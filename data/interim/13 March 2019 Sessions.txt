PROCEEDINGS HELD ON 13 MARCH 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS:  Morning Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS:  Chair before you is the application brought on behalf of Mr 
Thomas Moyane for cross-examination of Minister Gordhan.  In chambers we 
discussed the various issues relating to condonation it is not necessary for you to be 
burdened with any such application for the purposes at least of these proceedings.  You 
did on the 21 November last grant an application for condonation in regard to the late 
filing of 3.3 applications that has been dealt with.  So with your leave we may proceed 
10 
with the application? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  That will be Mr Moyane’s application now? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes.   
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Okay.  Good morning Chairperson DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Mpofu I guess you thought Mr Pretorius would take 
a little longer than he did. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes he caught me off guard I noticed.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am ready to deal with – to hear your argument in relation to 
Mr Moyane’s application for leave to cross examine Minister Gordhan. 
20 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Thank you very much Deputy Chief Justice.  If I may just mention 
for housekeeping that I appear with my learned friends Ms Sibuku and Ms Daniel from 
the Johannesburg bar.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.   
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Thank you very much DCJ.  Chair we will try to save as much time 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 3 of 204 
 
as possible … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes for what  
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Seeing that submissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I am sorry.  Just as I said in chambers I have read the written 
submissions submitted by both parties.  I read obviously as can been expected the 
affidavits in both Mr Moyane’s up founding application – affidavit.  Mr Gordhan’s 
answering as well as Mr Moyane’s replying affidavit.  So I am quite familiar what with – 
what is there.  I have also read the comprehensive written submissions delivered by 
both parties.  Mr Mpofu would like a few minutes to get your things in order? 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes I think I would DCJ.  One of the things I want to get is the stop 
10 
watch so that I can time myself.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes do you need us to adjourn or I must just give you… 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  No, no just one second. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.   
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I am indebted DCJ thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  So I have read both comprehensive written submissions 
delivered by both parties so it is not really necessary to repeat everything said there.  
The idea is that this opportunity should be used to clarify whatever submissions or 
points that counsel might feel need to to be clarified or to be emphasised.   
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Thank you Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Thank you.  Chair in that spirit of saving time I would like to start 
by just putting certain things out of the way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Firstly that it is not our case and it cannot be in light of the 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 4 of 204 
 
regulations and the rules that there is automatic right to cross examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  That the regulations are very clear on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  And I use the word automatic advisedly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Because that is how I read that regulation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Obviously once granted there is a right to cross examination  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  But it is not automatic as it would be in a court of law. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  The second aspect Chair which we again consider upfront is that 
these are not court proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  And therefore even when cross examination is allowed it is not 
going to follow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  The exact tracks.  So I will just so that I am not accused of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I think that is important that you started with that because certain 
20 
portions of the written submissions and the founding affidavit maybe the replying 
affidavit as well from Mr Moyane may give the impression  
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so it is important… 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  That is why I wanted to clear that ja. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 5 of 204 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  In other words when we talk about the right to cross examination 
we talking about it on the assumption that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it is – once it is granted. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Once it is granted.  That is correct Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Thirdly which gets closer to the meat because this raised in the 
heads of the other side is that we accept again that at best for us these proceedings 
are what one calls quasi adversarial in this context but largely they are inquisitorial.  So 
we have no qualms with that either so which also do not waste time on that.  Where we 
10 
start Chair is the definition of what cross-examination seeks to achieve in order to 
support our application to be granted to do so.  And we start with the quotation that we 
put in our heads that from Wigmo’s the leading international authority on this who said:   
“That cross examination is beyond doubt the greatest legal engine ever invented for the 
discovery of the truth.”  And we have attached a fuller version of that which we will hand 
up where they give examples of why that is so over the centuries that this is the 
greatest engine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  And the emphasis really we want to put on that quotation is on the 
truth.  How do you find the truth in these kinds of proceedings whether you call them 
20 
quasi adversarial or whatever.  And one of the key safeguards is that for evidence to be 
accepted it must have been tested somehow and as I said the best – one of the best 
known ways to do so is cross-examination.  Now the issue if we were in a normal court 
setting then obviously the two standards are relevance and credibility.  So you may 
cross examine in terms of relevance and also as to credibility.  Relevance in this 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 6 of 204 
 
context obviously will relate to the terms of reference of this commission relate to the 
subject matter and so on on the one hand.  On the other hand it will relate more 
specifically to the evidence of the particular witness subject to the caveat again which is 
now accepted that obviously a cross examiner has more leeway than the examiner in 
chief to cover issues which were not covered in the evidence.  But obviously you cannot 
go on for two days asking the witness about where he was born and so on if that has 
nothing to do … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe not even half a day Mr Mpofu. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Maybe not even half an hour.  That is correct Chairperson.  So the 
point is simply that there are limits to all these things.  It is not as if you just have carte 
10 
blanche.  And that takes us Chair around these general issues to a very important issue 
namely the reason as we have put in our submissions, the reason why the president 
appointed a judge and not just a judge the most senior judge that could have been 
appointed because the Chief Justice could not appoint himself into – in this … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I was about to say do not say the most senior. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  That could be [indistinct] Chair.  No I – no… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  But subject to that the point is that that is one of the safeguards 
because the president could have appointed anybody an accountant and or whatever 
but the reason why there is a judge is so that those safeguards are almost guaranteed 
20 
in a way because the judge will know when to curtail cross examination.  So the big 
point is that the safeguard against let us say cross-examination that strays across the 
rules is not to have a wholesale ban on cross-examination which is what is being asked 
for.  But it is simply to rely on the wisdom ok the Chair to – that he will when the time 
comes control the proceedings.  The second safeguard Chair insofar as some issues 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 7 of 204 
 
have been raised unfortunately about a choice of counsel is the two points there.  1. Is 
that of course the general legal rules apply.  So every citizen has a right to counsel of 
their choice that goes without saying but more importantly a second safe set of 
safeguards is that there specific rules specified by the General Counsel of the Bar 
which makes – would make sure that a counsel is going to cross-examine within certain 
parameters and that then becomes a double safeguard because of course counsel now 
and again will stray but then the Chair – so it is a double barrelled safeguard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you can take it Mr Mpofu that I do not think that you are here to 
do anything other than perform your duties as counsel. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I am indebted to the Chair.  Then I will move on to something else.  
10 
Now Chair what we really need to look are what I will – I will just specify a few well not 
a few but some of the issues that make this particular cross-examination important.  
Firstly Chair this is as we all know at the risk of stating of obvious this is the judicial 
commission on inquiry into allegations of state capture, corruption, fraud in the public 
sector including organs of state.  It is not as maybe widely assumed.  It is not the Gupta 
commission.  It is a commission into allegations of state capture, corruption and fraud in 
the public sector and organs of state much wider.  If it was the Gupta commission this 
commission would not have spent two weeks listening to Mr Agrizzo who said nothing 
about the Gupta’s it is because it is a wider test.  The next important thing Chair is that 
there can be no doubt that Mr Gordhan implicates Mr Moyane and the emphasis of the 
20 
word implicates is very important.  That after all Chair is the reason why we were 
invited here.  Remember Mr Moyane was not sitting at home watching TV and then saw 
Mr Gordhan and said oh there he is mentioning me let me rush to go and ask for cross-
examination?  No we were invited by this commission and the only reason this 
commission invited us was simply because we were an implicated party.  Now the word 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 8 of 204 
 
implicate … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let me just say that I think that is a very important part of what – 
an important part of the application for leave to cross-examine. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But before you proceed let me say this.  You will have noticed that if 
you look at the relevant rule it enjoins the legal team to give Rule 3.3 notice to an 
implicated person if a witness’s statement implicates or may implicate … 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  That is correct.  That is 3.3.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now as – oh okay I am not there yet ja.  The – my understanding is 
that the reason why you have may implicate there is or is based on the 
10 
acknowledgement that it may be difficult sometimes for the legal team to say whether a 
particular statement implicates or definitely implicates a particular person but they may 
look at it and say well somebody might say it does somebody might say it does not. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there is that possibility to be on the safe side. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Absolutely yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us give it to them and if they take the view as it has been taken 
by some witnesses in certain cases that they are not implicated. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes, no Chair we will accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you are a hundred… 
20 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Hundred percent ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  That the rule is broad enough to cover both – my submission with 
respect Chair is that in this case it is not the second leg.  There was actual implication 
and insofar that the – whoever wrote the letter to us, the commission I will use it broadly 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 9 of 204 
 
– the commission actually did site specific examples. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  And it used the word inter alia. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  It said you are implicated in this and that inter alia in the following 
– and that is because there was in this case unlike in other cases maybe a 
comprehensive statement which had already implicated us.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  And I will go further to say Chair that indeed the statement in the 
box actually went further to implicate us even further than the written statement.  So 
10 
that there can be no doubt that we are an implicated party. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I would like to go to that letter because I think it is important. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or it may be important. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  It may be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where do I find it again? 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Well Chair I was told that the pagination might not correspond.  
On our pagination – oh yes it is – okay I will find it now Chair.  It is attached to the 
answering affidavit.  While I am looking Chair let me just say that the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes well we can come back to it but ja… 
20 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  We can come back to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can… 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I can paraphrase it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  While we are looking.  What it says is routinely this is to notify you 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 10 of 204 
 
that you may apply and so on and so on within fourteen days.  You are implicated in the 
following way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  And then it raises two specific issues.  One is the tender fraud let 
us call it that in respect of an IT contract and then the second one is lying to Parliament 
which is the second leg.  But the point I wanted to make is that even in that notice and 
when we find it we will – it says you are implicated inter alia. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  In this way.  So it left… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  It open ended and I think that was a wise thing to do because you 
do not know what the witness might say or there might be other – and there were ten 
files we might have missed another reference to Mr Moyane in another place.  The 
simple submission I wish to make Chair is that there can be no doubt and I do not even 
expect my learned friend Ms Le Roux to say that Mr Moyane is not implicated by … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think in her written submissions I think she says that. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  No you will see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I understand it correctly. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  You see that is very tentative.  It says in most places and some of 
the…so I think even she could not get herself to say ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Okay well maybe let us go to what … 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  To the points yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe the crux.  I will – let me mention this.  My reading of the 
irrelevant roles is that once – is that if you are going to bring an application for leave to 
cross-examine obviously you do so because you take the view that you are implicated. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 11 of 204 
 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because obviously even if the legal team of the commission can 
send you a Rule 3.3 notice saying you are implicated or may be implicated you are free 
to disagree with them and say I do not know what you are talking about. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Absolutely.  Or the witness might actually exculpate him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exactly ja so you have got to take a view that you are implicated as 
far as you are concerned and then when you make your application I believe you must 
say, this witness implicates me when he or she says this. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you need to then say whether you admit that but you 
10 
explain or you deny that and put up a different version. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or whatever.  Now when I was reading Mr Moyane’s founding 
affidavit I struggled to find places other than maybe the reference to that IT contract I 
think you say it was. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Other than that I struggle to find a place where or places where he 
was saying, this is the allegation that is in Mr Gordhan’s statement or in his evidence 
before the commission this what he said about me and by making this allegation 
against me he has implicated me in wrongdoing and this is my version.  It is not true 
20 
and here is my version or it is true but there is an explanation, this is the explanation. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  That is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what I struggle to find. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. Yes Chair let me – my reading of the rule may be slightly 
different. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 12 of 204 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  My reading of the rule Chair obviously the application must set out 
the pieces. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  But when the rule, the relevant rule and I will find it now it says: 
You must set out the grounds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  For the cross-examination.  I read it as the – you know as you set 
out the ground let us say in a notice of appeal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR IAN HAMISH SCOTT SINTON:  You do not then traverse chapter and verse of the 
evidence but you said this is the ground the judge erred in this respect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  So that is the one – let us call it a narrow reading.  And while that 
reading would say you must then quote every word that the witness said and then say 
this 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  What we did say Chair very much upfront was that we – when we 
put what we call the themes you remember we put the five… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Cross-examination themes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  In respect of each we then put the ground broadly of our 
disagreement or objection as the Chair say. Except I think when we talk about 
credibility because there you cannot really say sometime the credibility caution is by 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 13 of 204 
 
omission rather than what the witness actually says ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  But if you – if Chair goes to page 2 I think it is page 2 on every 
pagination you will see the first one is the easy one let us say paragraph 5 of Mr 
Moyane’s affidavit.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  As I said that is the easy one where it says “I was – it was therein 
pointed out to me that Minister Gordhan implicates me in two broad respects namely 1 
my alleged participation in the awarding of a contract or tender to the New Integrated 
Credit Solutions a company owned by my alleged friend Mr Mneyke and then the 
10 
second one my alleged refusal to account to the Minister as the Minister and the 
finance on material issues the deteriorated relationship between the two us – you will 
remember that Mr Gordhan went on for a long time on that – alleged ongoing personal 
institutional attacks by me and Mr Gordhan and the relationship issues.  One might add 
there on the ones that I say are easy the lying to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry what paragraph is that? 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  5, 5, 5 Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay ja.  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  So 5.1, 5.2 so you might [indistinct] add a 5.3 which is the lying to 
Parliament. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Those are the easy, the easy areas of being implicated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  And then we then upon a cursory reading of the statement of 
Minister Gordhan and other issues raised by him which directly or indirectly affects me 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 14 of 204 
 
include and then we list I will not read them out – we list about 7 other what we call 
topics. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  And then – we then at paragraph 7 you will see we say there 
“additional issues which are related to the above but are not directly raised in the 
papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  And then we list another 7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  That is why I say it is about 15 issues. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  And then – and then we say we will group them into five for 
convenience. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Which is paragraph 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Then we then say this is the basis of what we say – we say the 
general credibility and general attitude of Minister Gordhan characterised by a 
propensity to distort and spin the facts.  So that is a ground on its own.  You cannot 
develop more than that.  Then the next ground we say is bias, hostility and 
20 
vindictiveness as guiding attitude of the relationship between the two of us leaving no 
room for professionalism, objectivity and impartiality in our mutual dealings.  And say 
this calls for any evidence given by Gordhan about me in any ongoing forum including 
this one needs to be taken with more than the proverbial pinch of salt.  Then we say the 
distortion of the evidence in order to support his false narrative of devils and angels and 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 15 of 204 
 
especially my alleged breach of procurement procedures.  Then we say racism on his 
part and the unbecoming behaviour of Minister Gordhan towards me symbolises 
regrettable behaviour which has no place in the nation we are trying to build and in 
which there is no place for looking down upon African people.  And then say the deep 
role of Minister Gordhan and the rogue unit saga also referred to as the Sunday 
evening project which was a form of state capture.  Now the importance of those 
grounds as it were Chair is that the – well the last one is more explicit and I – if you 
Chair allows me I will come back to your question I just want to touch on the question of 
the rogue unit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  On which Mr Gordhan obviously testified.  Our take Chair and I 
need to say this just in case I forget to say it later – our take is this given the 
broadminded of this commission if – if Mr Gordhan as Mr Moyane suggests and we 
know that Mr Gordhan testified that Moyane went even as to lay a charge about this 
issue so obviously he believes this.  If Mr Gordhan was involved in unlawful 
activity/criminal activity around the rogue unit issue that I am afraid is – comes directly 
to the remit of this commission why?  Because state capture is just a phrase we have 
created in South Africa for ourselves.  It is a cryptic phrase but state capture really talks 
about the creation or the alleged creation of a parallel state you know outside of the 
parameters that we all know.  Now there is no difference between that and setting up 
20 
unlawfully a rogue unit to spy on citizens to spy on political opponents and all that.  It is 
a parallel state that you are creating.  It might be on a smaller scale than the grand 
state capture.  So that falls squarely but squarely onto the issues and we know that that 
is one of the key issues that Mr Gordhan testified about in relation to Mr Moyane not 
just generally.  Because he says I have been – there is a campaign a political campaign 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 16 of 204 
 
to discredit me and so on and so on and it is characterised by you will remember there 
was a whole discussion about the 27 questions.  The 27 questions – those 27 
questions they genesis of the 27 questions is obviously the charges that were laid.  
Now here is the point of cross-examination.  According to Mr Gordhan Mr Moyane’s 
actions in laying those charges were motivated by malice and all this conspiracy and so 
on.  According to Mr Moyane these were motivated by a real by the Sikhakhane Report 
which said that this thing is unlawful but the Croan Report which said thing is unlawful 
which Sikhakhane Report by the way was commissioned before Mr Moyane came to 
work at SARS and as he says, what reasonable SARS commissioner or CEO would 
come into a place, find a report that says there has been criminal/unlawful activities and 
10 
just do nothing.  So these are two contesting theories.  So it is either in the end the 
Chair will have to buy into one of those theories let me put it that way colloquially.  In 
other words the Chair will either say the laying of those charges was part of some 
conspiracy long story or it was indeed the act of a reasonable commissioner.  So that is 
a very good example of what we are talking about and there is no other way with 
respect Chair in which this other counter narrative so to speak can be presented to this 
commission without having cross-examined Mr Gordhan. You will remember Chair this 
– Chair will know this is a constitutional court decision in sarfu.  In sarfu two things 
comes out of Sarfu one is that it is important for two reasons.  It is a case where no less 
than the president – President Nelson Mandela was prepared to be cross-examined.  
20 
So if it is good for President Mandela surely it is good for Mr Gordhan.  But the issue 
which was said in Sarfu was to restate the English principle that says that if a witness a 
witness does not just have a right to cross-examine but has a duty to so and because if 
you want a counter narrative as I have said to prevail then and you fail to cross-
examine then you have nobody else to blame because the Chair will have no option but 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 17 of 204 
 
to accept the one version so to speak.  In other words if the Chair is only given this 
narrative that the laying of the charges was part of the conspiracy and Mr Moyane fails 
in his duty to challenge then he cannot late complain and say why did the Chair find 
that my laying of the charges was malicious?  It is because you Mr Moyane you were 
invited, you were given an opportunity, you did not take it up and therefore what do you 
expect the Chair to do.  So that is the crucial point about cross-examination and the 
second. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I am sorry Chair if I can just finish this part. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  The other issue which again maybe we were making assumptions.  
We do not think that Mr Moyane just simply from this affidavit is just going to come and 
testify.  Remember Mr Moyane has volunteered that he will give evidence.  He will 
expand on his version.  Now one expects that that process will involve us, it will involve 
the evidence leaders and so on and the matter be, statements that are taken and then 
more expansion on some of the issues.  Ours at this stage is to highlight the grounds 
on which such cross-examination will be done.  Chair, okay I will move to this after your 
question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you are not going to forget the point you want to make that is fine. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes.  No, I will not. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see what I was looking is the issue of the grounds that you are 
talking about.  You see my understanding of the rules are that when you apply for leave 
to cross-examine. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must make it clear what parts of the witness’ statement evidence 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 18 of 204 
 
you dispute. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you must say what your version is in regard to those parts. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that is the main thing. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now there is reference to the grounds. This is dealt with in Rule 3.4. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It says: 
“An application in terms of Rule 3.3.6…” 
10 
Which is an application for among other things leave to cross-examine. 
“An application in terms of Rule 3.3.6 above must be submitted 
in writing to the Secretary of the Commission within…” 
It says with, but it should be within. 
“…14 calendar days from date of the notice referred to in Rule 
3.3.” 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then it says: 
“The application must be accompanied by a statement from the 
implicated person responding to the witness’ statement…” 
20 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  “…insofar as it implicates him or her.” 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then it says: 
“The statement must make it clear what parts of the witness’ 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 19 of 204 
 
statement are disputed or denied and the grounds upon which 
those parts are disputed or denied.” 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you have dealt with the question of grounds. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it seems to me. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  And [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Subject what you might say, it seems to me that when the rules say: 
“The application must be accompanied by a statement from the 
implicated person responding to the witness’ statement insofar 
10 
as it implicates him or her.” 
It seems to me that that is the part where we expect the Applicant to put up his or her 
version. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  That is true Chair.  That is not disputed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you have no problem with that? 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  No, I have no problem at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  All I am saying is that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  That statement it is not as if, it is not a mechanical thing where. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  We must now have a separate statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 20 of 204 
 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  That statement must be incorporated in the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  [Intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is true, ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  So if we are together on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Then my next submission is that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  This is exactly what we have done in the sense that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  We have identified, I have said at paragraph 5 we have identified 
the parts.  At paragraph 6 we have identified the parts.  At paragraph 7 we have 
identified even the parts that are not clear to the naked eye where we say there are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The problem that I have with how that has been dealt with. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that when I read it, it is not like when for example you do an 
answering affidavit. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know where you say. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  But. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now I am responding.  I am responding to this allegation. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It becomes clear. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So for example when Mr Moyane refers somewhere in his affidavit to 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 21 of 204 
 
Mr Gordhan talking about his participation in the ITC. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Issue, you know. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Hm.  Then it is clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know, I do not think I saw anything in his affidavit.  I may be 
wrong that says well I did participate, but in this way and not in that way. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or I did not participate at all.  I might have seen I do not know. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes.  It is there.  I. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I might have seen something that says he was not involved at all. 
10 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes, he does. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I will. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But maybe it is not put as clearly. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I understand what the Chair says. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As one wants, because part of the reason why the rules contemplate 
an implicated person putting up his version is to enable me to see the gap between the 
version of the one, of the witness and the implicated person.  How much area is 
disputed? 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Between the two statements and that may inform also the time I set 
for the cross-examination. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  100 percent Chair, but Chair please I think the only problem that I 
have is that maybe we are moving two steps ahead of where we are.  Where we are 
now Chair all we need to do is as I say almost as a grounds of appeal is to put the 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 22 of 204 
 
grounds and make it clear that we, what we contest which we will set out in paragraphs 
5, 6 and 7.  Maybe what created the impression that the Chair is talking about is our 
zeal to simplify this by using the thing of themes.  So we said okay these are the 15 
things, but we are not going to discuss each of the 15 things.  We are going to put them 
in five themes to make it easier to deal with and maybe that is, that trying to simplify it 
is what complicated it, but we did that deliberately after listing the 15 or 20 things.  That 
is the first thing.  The second thing Chair is that and this is the point about maybe we 
are jumping a step ahead.  The assumption of course is that there are three things that 
are going to happen before Mr Moyane ever puts his version in the broad sense now of 
talking, sitting there.  There will be this application.  There will be a statement taken by 
10 
the evidence leaders or at least in conjunction with them and then there is obviously the 
evidence itself that he must lead and my humble submission Chair will be at the point, 
at the second stage once the evidence leaders have interacted in some form.  It is only 
then that the Chair will then say okay I am giving this a day, I am giving half a day or 
whatever it is.  Not necessarily now.  Now the only function for the Chair is to allow in 
broad principles the issue of cross-examination.  Whether that cross-examination is 
going to be one minute or 10 days is it not at this stage the issue before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  But. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The approach of separating, I will allow you just now. 
20 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The approach of separating the issue of the grant of the. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  The right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Grant or refusal of the leave to cross-examine and the determination 
of the duration of the. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 23 of 204 
 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  The nature, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of cross-examination maybe one approach. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of dealing with him, but I prefer to deal with all. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  [Intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the same time. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Fair enough. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  That is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So. 
10 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I accept that.  There is no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I am not submitting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Chair that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  If you do so it would be wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I am simply saying that there are ways. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But where. 
20 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Of doing it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where I think it might, it might be important for us to look at that is 
the point you make which is made in the, in Mr Moyane’s affidavit, one of his affidavits if 
not both or even the written submissions namely that after I have granted leave to 
cross-examine if I grant it there would be a process of taking of statements. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 24 of 204 
 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I want that the statements should be in. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When I grant the. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The leave if I grant it and as I see it that flows from the Rule 3.4 
when it says the implicated person must give. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A statement dealing with the allegations implicating him.  So in other 
words not just broadly. 
10 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But to say this is my version, ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  That I accept Chair.  Except to say this, well at least this 
Commission where it has granted or at least being willing to grant leave the approach 
that has been taken as I understand it I read specifically the Gupta refusal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Was that the Chair actually was inclined to say look. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Except for this thing of you wanting to do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Overseas which I understand is not acceptable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I am going so far as to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I will grant you. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 25 of 204 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  If you remove that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  In other words simply because you have been implicated, simply 
because you are disputing at a broad level.  I do not at this stage have anything from 
you Mr Gupta, but because at a broad level you are implicated.  I will grant you and that 
is why we assumed if, let us assume the Guptas then said okay we will come back and 
do it then obviously what would follow is what we suggest.  They would interact with 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No. 
10 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  [Intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No in the Gupta they put up their version fully. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, in regard to the allegations that were made by the specific 
witnesses. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  And even in the case of, what is his name, Mr Duduzane Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Duduzane Zuma. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Which you have granted.  I know. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I have looked at. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, at the affidavit. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  At the documents, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 26 of 204 
 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Let me just move from this point by saying Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I take you to page 6, paragraph 16.  So maybe one does not use 
the word version, but here is the version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  We say, actually we would even use the word version.  At 
paragraph 12, ja. 
“Under this thing my version is that Minister Gordhan’s affidavit 
is more significant for what it omits than what it says.  The 
omitted facts will give a truer picture of the Commission about 
10 
what actually went on behind the scenes.  The truth…” 
Again that is the way of saying my version. 
“The truth is that Minister Gordhan was an ardent supporter of 
President Zuma and was in fact twice entrusted by him into 
what is according to Gordhan himself the most strategic 
ministry in the state capture project.  It requires some 
exploration so as to distil its impact and meaning.” 
Let us just pause there.  Chair anybody reading those two paragraphs would 
understand that Mr Gordhan’s entire posture, let me put it that way, was that he is an 
anti-state capture buster or something like that.  Now the point we make here is that 
20 
you cannot have that when the version that we are going to put is that even according 
to the same witness at the centre of the state capture project is the Treasury, the 
Ministry of Finance and actually at a prima facie level people are assumed to be once 
they are there whether you are Van Rooyen or Gigaba or Nene you are a Gupta 
person.  So miraculously Mr Gordhan is the only one who is in that Ministry, twice 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 27 of 204 
 
appointed twice but by no less than the person he says was the kingpin of state 
capture.  To be in charge of this very Ministry.  So there is the version.  Then we say in 
his affidavit [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That does not indicate at least as far as I recall he is, it is prompted 
by what statement that he made. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That implicates. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  The next paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Moyane. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  The next paragraph. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  The next paragraph says and this is about [indistinct] by the way: 
“In his affidavit the Minister Gordhan seeks to downplay the 
impact of the history labelling himself as an “unwitting” member 
of the Cabinet which was oblivious of what was going due to 
being “manipulated, lied to and abused”.  These two call for 
exploration.” 
Those quotes Chair come directly, Gordhan’s affidavit we do not reference them.  They 
come literally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  From the mouth of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Of, so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  You can either say well you have not identified exactly where he 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 28 of 204 
 
says unwittingly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Then we can find it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  In the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  But it does exactly what the Chair says. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Needs to be done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  You put a version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Your problem with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  And then you identify what he said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Now more than that with respect an Applicant cannot do and then 
paragraph 16 the same thing.  We say: 
“Under this…” 
This is the anti Moyane bias and bias of course Chair knows is a very important issue 
20 
for cross-examination. 
“Under this we seek to demonstrate that the levels of acrimony 
hostility and underline hostility.” 
Because Mr Gordhan actually used that word here. 
“Enmity and [indistinct] by Minister Gordhan towards me as a 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 29 of 204 
 
person are sufficient to disqualify him as an impartial 
dispassionate commentator on any issue I am allegedly 
involved now here.  The documented and unchallenged history 
of racist and other forms of abuse of power in the hands of 
Mr Gordhan will be provided as the basis for the conclusion 
postulated in the preceding paragraph.” 
And then we refer directly in the next page Chair to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am looking at you. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Oh, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I look at the [intervenes]. 
10 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I know, I know Chair.  I know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  But if the Chair was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, let us try and wrap up. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  And I appreciate the engagement, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Now just jump to paragraph 19 then Chair, just for, so that we do 
not waste time.  Paragraph 19 you will see there that we do not just say this is our 
version and this is what is wrong.  We take you, we say go to the affidavit Annexure 
TMZ1 and we say go to Annexure TMZ22 to this affidavit.  Now that is a version.  The 
20 
fact that we do not call it a version, but it is there.  We actually say here is, there is a 
transcript of a telephone call by Mr Gordhan to Mr Moyane which Mr Moyane found to 
have racist connotations and undermining towards him.  For example it is verbatim, he 
says to Mr Moyane, grow up and Mr Moyane says what do you mean I must grow up?  I 
am not a little boy and we know the connation in South African context of referring to 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 30 of 204 
 
somebody as a boy.  We are almost the same age.  You cannot talk to me like that and 
so on.  It is even to you Chair in verbatim transcript form.  So where is your version?  It 
is at TMZ1.  It is TMZ22.  Then the next one we say is common course.  Well if it is 
common course we do not have to refer to it.  So the whole thing is littered and even if 
you go to paragraph 20.  We say: 
“It is common cause that Minister Gordhan was the first ever 
witness called in the SARS Enquiry about [indistinct].” 
And then we say towards the end there: 
“These are false and self-claims in pursuit of the Moyane 
removal claim.  The undisputed evidence is that my 
10 
performance by far outperformed his own.  I also did not form 
an illegal intelligence structure as the rogue unit outside the 
parameters of the law.” 
Well for that you cannot say, if he says it is in the negative.  I did not do this.  You do 
not say well where is your version.  That is his version.  That is what I. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What may, what I may have to consider is whether I should not ask 
you to put up, to file maybe a supplementary affidavit that makes this job easier rather 
than me having to try and look for them all over.  If you do like an answering affidavit.  
You say in his statement paragraph so and so this is what he has said and this is what 
we say. 
20 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or in his evidence the transcript shows this is what he says and this 
is what we say. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might make it easier. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 31 of 204 
 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Well Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In time and. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Time saving. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Maybe in the end. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  But I would like the Chair to just give me an opportunity to 
demonstrate that that actually is what we have done. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Here is the one we were looking for Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Paragraph 21. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  We say: 
“In further pursuance of the aforesaid vengeful and racist 
agenda Gordhan has made direct accusations that I one, 
improperly participated in the award of a tender of my friend. 
That is the one you are not sure if it was that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  [Indistinct] and two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  “Lied to Parliament about such involvement.” 
Okay.  So that is the. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 32 of 204 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  The problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Where is the version?  We then move.  We say: 
“Then it is not clear where Gordhan made these remarks and 
they are not included and so on.” 
Okay.  23: 
“In any event I deny these accusations and will accordingly put 
questions to Gordhan to demonstrate their falsity in support 
thereof…” 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, [intervenes]. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  “…I instructed my attorneys to obtain the necessary 
records of Hansard.  In other words the raw verbatim evidence 
of what I said in Parliament.  In this regard I will ably 
demonstrate that it is a deflection, because it is Gordhan 
himself who secured lucrative multibillion Rand IT contracts 
without following proper procedures.  The Commission will be 
referred to specific examples of such contracts and their 
relevant documents and so on.” 
And then [intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course, I am sorry, of course. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I am sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course if it is a statement not made in a, if it is an allegation made 
outside of the Commission and not in his statement against Mr Moyane and not made 
in the witness box in the Commission we may have to look obviously. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 33 of 204 
 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  No, it is not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not? 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  No, it is not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  That allegation Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Is dealt with extensively, but extensively. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  In what Mr Gordhan attached himself in his own statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  From page 527. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  To page 598. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Of the, of his bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Where he goes and talks about this specific contract.  In the 
answering affidavit he goes further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  To say to quote chapter and verse. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, it is not in the affidavit, but it is in an annexure? 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  No, no.  It is in, ja it is in an annexure which he refers to and 
which he. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Testified about one. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 34 of 204 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Two, which I could not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I could not find it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I subsequent found it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Secondly, in the answering affidavit Chair will see there may be 
four or five pages of quoting the Nugent findings on this very issue.  So there can be no 
doubt. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Whatsoever that that is the version of Mr Gordhan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But are you not talking now about his answering affidavit when you 
refer to him quoting the Nugent Commission? 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes.  That is exactly what I am saying.  I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  One, you will find it in the annexure to his affidavit in the written 
statement to this Commission and two you find it even more substantiated in his 
answering affidavit [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  So there is no doubt whatsoever that it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  It was part of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  So again it is exactly the, I mean maybe it is a question of time, 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 35 of 204 
 
but the format is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  What did he say? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Where is it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  What is wrong with it?  What is your version? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  It cannot be anything more than that Chair and then the; so issues 
of style aside the issue is that if the Chair at this stage, there are two standards.  One, 
10 
is the evidence okay broadly speaking relevant as I defined earlier.  Is it necessary and 
does it advance the cause of the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  And with the greatest respect unfortunately this thing that I have 
been wanting to read unfortunately we could not get to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  But we have listed here more than 10 instances of the so called 
implication. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Chair let me paraphrase it, because we do not have time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  What we are really saying is that Mr Gordhan the things that he 
implicates Mr Moyane in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Most of them amounts to criminal activity. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 36 of 204 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Right? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  So let us put that aside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  And if that is the case really then at the highest level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  The only way that Mr Moyane can defend his integrity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  And his rights. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Against such accusations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Of just take any example. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Of the, what I term as criminal activity, can but only be done in 
cross-examination.  Now whether the extent and all that of that cross-examination are 
matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  That as I say will be determined by the Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Sometime even in the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Live proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 37 of 204 
 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  But nobody in their right mind can say at this stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  That the right to challenge someone who has implicated you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  In criminal activity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Let us take this example Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  The other said says for example in its heads. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Shall we agree that I give you five minutes and you wrap up within 
10 
five minutes? 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We, I think we. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It has been. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I will. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are at 10 o’ clock.  We have should have finished. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  [Intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Everything by 10 o’ clock, but. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I know Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Well it is the questions from the Chair which I appreciate, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  But let me just make this example then.  You are told for example 
in the heads that you must take into account the so called high level panel report the 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 38 of 204 
 
recent one about the parallel state that was stated at intelligence.  Now that report 
incidentally says that the people who were involved in that parallel state creation must 
be charged.  I think with treason something dramatic like that.  Now here we are saying, 
Mr Moyane is saying Mr Gordhan was involved in similar exactly similar conduct in 
respect of a rogue unit, but the impression you are given is that the other people who 
did exactly the same thing must be charged with treason, but Mr Gordhan must be 
given a hug you know for doing the exact same thing.  Now that, I mean, is a 
self-evident point that says that if it is true and again I use a big if, because I cannot 
pre-empt, again Mr Moyane cannot also be as arrogant as Mr Gordhan to think his 
version is unassailable, but if his version is correct then it destroys that entire and 
10 
actually you might find that it is Mr Gordhan who must be charged with treason, 
because he did the exact same thing that the high level panel says was done on a 
smaller scale maybe but, and in a different context but as far as the crime is concerned 
if is exactly the same thing.  So that is the one thing.  So it is the criminal, let us call it 
criminal [indistinct].  The second issue Chair and that goes to the quotation that we 
make and that deals with this issue of whether even if it is inquisitorial this Commission 
that very well-known quotation from Lord [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  That says that even if it is completely inquisitorial the, I am sorry 
Chair.  It is at page 11 of our submissions. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  No, page 13.  This is a classic quotation which has been accepted 
by our courts in the Du Preez v TRC matter and I think in the [indistinct] matter which I 
was involved in that is the Marikana Commission, because these arguments were 
always said that look and the point really, the big point Chair is that the stand of 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 39 of 204 
 
fairness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Is not the sole preserver of adversarial proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Here Lord [indistinct] in his typical flowery language said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  “This enquiry was not a court of law.  It was an 
investigation in the public interest in which…” 
Like this one. 
“…in which all should surely cooperate as they promise to do.” 
10 
As this one. 
“It is true of course that the inspectors are not a court of law.” 
We can put there this Commission. 
“Their proceedings are not judicial proceedings.  They are not 
even quasi-judicial for they decide nothing.  They only 
investigate and report.  They sit in private, but this should not 
lead us to minimise the significance of their task.  They may if 
they think fit make findings of fact which are very damaging to 
those whom they name.  They may accused some.  They may 
condemn others.  They may ruin reputations or careers.  Their 
20 
report may lead to judicial proceedings.  It may expose persons 
to criminal proceedings or civil actions seeing that their work 
and report may lead to such consequences.  I am clearly of the 
opinion that the inspectors must act fairly.” 
And all we are saying is that the fairness in this context. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 40 of 204 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Surely must include granting somebody who has been accused 
not just for reputation and careers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  But of such [indistinct] of prison basically. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Or being part thereof, of a right to cross-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  One last point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  The references to the Nugent Commission with the greatest 
respect it is completely irrelevant.  This Commission has got its own task and it cannot 
rely, although the rules of evidence must not be applied mechanically, but it cannot rely 
on the opinion of another Commission no less one that is the subject of a review 
application by Mr Moyane.  When there is evidence of other Commissions that have 
found otherwise which have never been challenged.  We know what the law is in 
relation to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  So insofar as that is made as a point it must just be kicked out 
and we make the point that most of this defence is almost 80 percent on what was said 
20 
in the Nugent Commission and to that extent it must just be expunged and not be 
considered at all.  All in all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  What we say is that there is enough more than enough, even if 
you do not take all the allegations made.  Take four or five of them. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 41 of 204 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  And say in principle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Does Mr Moyane have the right to cross-examine the person who 
implicated him, yes or no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  If he does then of course at least and appreciate that the Chair 
says. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  You want to do it comprehensively. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Then of course we should assume that there other procedures 
which must be followed to cut the cloth as it were to fit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  The Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  But there can be no doubt whatsoever in our respectful 
submission that the entitlement or rather the discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Of the Chair which is really what this is about. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Ought to be exercised in favour of granting that right under. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Good cases that show that a denial of, because that is what is 
being asked of a denial.  A denial of cross-examination ipso facto. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 42 of 204 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Is a serious irregularity admittedly in court proceedings, but even 
in general.  It would, a complete blanket denial is just unfathomable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I stop you now? 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  You can. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let me hear. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I appreciate Chair.  I appreciate the engagement and the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  And the extra time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you very much.  Counsel for Mr Gordhan?   
10 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:   Thank you Chair, good morning.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, good morning. 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:  Chair I think we should emphasize three submissions in 
these oral submissions, given that we have made full written argument already and the 
three submissions I would like to stress this morning are the following; the first is that 
Mr Moyane has not laid a foundation identifying specific aspects of Minister Gordhan’s 
evidence that he disagrees with and disputes and the grounds for that dispute.  The 
second submission is that the purpose on his own terms for this application is not a 
proper purpose for the cross-examination application and the third is to say that if we 
understand the purpose of cross-examination before you by an implicated person the 
20 
application should be denied in its entirety.   
 
And let me perhaps start with that final point, because my learned friend I 
was obviously appreciative to hear accepts that there is no automatic right to cross-
examine in this Commission, that it is in your discretion.  What he failed to address you 
on though is the test, that’s the regulation and the rules set for the exercise of that 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 43 of 204 
 
discretion and there are two elements that must be the loadstar for any decision that 
you take. 
 
The first question is whether the cross-examination is necessary, and the 
second is whether it’s in the best interests of the work of the Commission.  So if we 
could put that a different way, is it necessary and does it progress the work of this 
Commission if it digresses into the issues listed in Mr Moyane’s application, and for all 
of the reasons submitted in the answering affidavit and in the written submissions we 
would submit that it does not, because Chair if we understand Mr Moyane’s application, 
and I am indebted to my learned friend for identifying and stressing that the contents of 
paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of the founding affidavit are what he wants to cover and the 
10 
grounds on which he wants you to grant him leave to cross-examine, all of that falls into 
three categories.   
 
The first category are SARS related issues, he wants to resuscitate the so-
called rogue unit narrative, he wants to traverse his appointment and removal as the 
Commissioner of SARS and he tries to attribute some motive and I mean the language 
of the founding affidavit is obviously quite extreme, if not hysterical, it talks about Mr 
Gordhan having a vendetta and that it’s his life’s work to try to remove Mr Moyane, of 
course as the Minister testified his life’s work has been to work for a non-racist, non-
sexist, free South Africa, but the point is that all of these SARS related issues are the 
work of the completed Nugent Commission.  The Nugent Commission and I have given 
20 
you the references in the heads and in the answering affidavit at length, and we’ve 
provided you with the two reports of that Commission headed by a very senior and a 
distinguished judge. 
 
Judge Nugent looked at this question of the rogue unit, he looked at it and he 
concluded that there was nothing there, that there was no basis to say that an unlawful 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 44 of 204 
 
unit had been established within SARS.  He goes at length through how the Sunday 
Times reports were all complete fabrications resulting in an apology and their retraction.  
He goes through how the Sikhakhane Report had been discredited but in any event 
overtaken by events.  He had Judge Kroon come before him and disavow the findings 
of his enquiry and Justice Nugent looked at this issue and he said I can see no reason 
why this so-called rogue unit, but of course we know it’s called the High Risk 
Investigation Unit, why anyone says it was unlawful and why Minister Gordhan should 
be criticised in any way for having played the small part he played in its establishment. 
 
What we then know is that Justice Nugent recommended that it be re-
established, he recommended that a unit with those powers to investigate and combat 
10 
the illicit trade and look at the tax affairs of politically prominent people be re-
established and we know that that’s currently taking place. 
 
So all of the SARS related issues have been dealt with by Justice Nugent 
and what this application essentially amounts to, with respect to the SARS allegations, 
you’re being asked to redo or review Justice Nugent.  The first ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe putting it like that is not accurate, but what maybe 
accurate is to look at the same issues that he looked at, to consider the same issues. 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or some of the issues that he considered. 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, without putting a label about review on it. 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:  Sorry, so let’s not talk about a redo or a review, but you’re 
certainly being asked to traverse the identical terrain and you’re being asked to come to 
the opposite conclusion of that reached by Justice Nugent, you’re being asked to find 
that there was an unlawful unit, Justice Nugent has found there was no such thing.  So 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 45 of 204 
 
let’s assume you take up this invitation to look at the same issue that Judge Nugent is 
finished with, let’s assume you come to a different conclusion to him, you put that in a 
report to the President, what is the President to do with competing reports from two 
Commissions of Inquiry that go in different directions, it’s an untenable position that 
you’re being asked to occupy, because what you would then have to do, what you 
would have to do is expand your own terms of reference to accommodate the terms of 
reference of Judge Nugent’s Commission and we say that all of the SARS related 
issues identified by Mr Moyane were the work of Justice Nugent’s Commission, he has 
completed that work, he has made the findings he has made, and if Mr Moyane is 
unhappy with that he has recourse, he can review that panel’s findings explicitly, he has 
10 
not as far as I am aware done that.  He has attacked the process, he’s attached 
decisions taken by the President on the basis of the reports issued by Justice Nugent, 
he has not actually as far as I’m aware launched a review of the Nugent Commission, 
and if he wants to disagree with its findings that’s the avenue he should pursue, not 
asking you to look at the same issues. 
 
So Chair on this first category of everything SARS related it is not irrelevant 
that Justice Nugent spent a lot of time and attention coming to very carefully reasoned 
conclusions based on a body of evidence.  Then we have a category of issues that at 
best could be described as personality issues.  The language again of Mr Moyane’s 
papers, he talks about racism, he talks about acrimony, he talks about hostility and hate 
20 
and grudges and vendettas.  Chair I go back to the question that you have to answer 
today, is it necessary and in the best interest of the work of this Commission to 
entertain that?   Let’s assume you grant leave on those topics, Mr Moyane’s legal 
representatives will cross-examine Mr Gordhan about Mr Moyane’s dislike of the man, 
how does that help you fulfil your terms of reference, we submit that it does not.  It 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 46 of 204 
 
doesn’t take your work any further, and Chair I must say that this Commission with the 
hundreds of millions of rands being spent on it and the very limited time that you have 
been given to cover an enormous set of terms of reference should not be -  time should 
not be spent and money should not be spent on consoling Mr Moyane’s feelings or 
airing his personal grievances, it’s not going to get you any closer to fulfilling your 
mandate. 
 
And the final category of what’s in Mr Moyane’s papers is a political 
campaign, so it’s all of this – these allegations about Minister Gordhan not being an 
angel, and Minister Gordhan actually being part of the State Capture Project, and as I 
understand my learned friend’s argument this morning somehow because he was made 
10 
Minister of Finance twice and we know that Treasury was an important target of the 
State Capture campaign that somehow it turns him from the man that we all know into 
some central architect of the State Capture Project, but as your questions have pointed 
out this morning there’s no link, there’s no evidence put before you as to why Mr 
Moyane says that.  It’s very easy to throw out allegations, very easy to throw mud and 
worse and hope that something sticks to Minister Gordhan, and we understand it’s 
election season out there, we understand the political campaign against him because 
he testified about what he has endured and what his family has endured, but the 
question is does it help this Commission is it necessary and in the best interests of the 
work of your Commission to entertain what quite frankly are outlandish and baseless 
20 
political theories about Minister Gordhan and we would submit that that is not a way to 
spend the taxpayers’ money and your time. 
 
So if we then look at the actual implication that was raised by the 
Commission’s notice, the Commission identified only one item, and yes it used the word 
inter alia, but it only actually identified one issue for you, and for Mr Moyane, and it’s 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 47 of 204 
 
the issue of him misleading Parliament about his personal involvement in the 
appointment of Mr Monyeki’s firm, NICS, as a debt collection agency, it’s not an ICT 
contract Chair, it’s a debt collection contract with SARS.  The way it came up in Minister 
Gordhan’s evidence was that he provided you with the affidavit to which he deposed in 
the disciplinary enquiry launched by the President against Mr Moyane before Senior 
Counsel Bam.  One of the charges there was that Mr Moyane has misled Parliament.  
Why?  Because he said to Parliament at one of its committee hearings that he had 
played no role in the appointment of NICS at SARS.  One of the disgruntled debt 
collection companies launched litigation.  In his answering affidavit on oath Mr Moyane 
said yes I approved these contracts including the one of NICS.   
10 
 
So there’s a competing version, you told Parliament you played no role, you 
told the Court you approved their appointment.  There’s a discrepancy, there’s a 
contradiction, one of them was an untrue statement.   
 
All Minister Gordhan gave you was that affidavit.  He said this is what you 
told Parliament, this is what we know to be a statement you made you made elsewhere, 
there’s a discrepancy, Advocate Bam was going to enquire into that.  Obviously the 
disciplinary fell away following it being stayed because of a High Court case, and then 
obviously Mr Moyane’s termination ended any need for discipline.  
 
So this NICS contract again has been the topic of the Nugent Commission.  
Justice Nugent looked at this and we’ve given you the references and the papers, he 
20 
looked at the issue and he said no Mr Moyane was untruthful when he told Parliament 
he played no role, because he played this role of being the final approval, and he 
participated in that process, and Justice Nugent goes into NICS and Mahobe which is 
another Monyeki company and how it all fitted together and Chair it links to the 
allegations that were made against Mr Makwakwa, Judge Nugent looked at all of this 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 48 of 204 
 
and made findings that there was an untruth told. 
 
So let’s assume you say no it’s necessary and in the best interest of my 
commission to cross-examine on the topic that Nugent has already looked at.  Minister 
Gordhan isn’t going to be able to assist you.  Minister Gordhan wasn’t there appointing 
contracts, he wasn’t in Parliament making statements so it’s not going to assist the 
work of the Commission to cross-examine on the one issue that the Commission 
identified as a potential implicated issue, so there is no link between the evidence and 
what Mr Moyane would want to cover. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the extent that anyone of the issues on which leave to cross-
examine is being sought, any one or more, is or are issues that in respect of which the 
10 
Nugent Commission has made findings to the extent that when I look I might find that 
some of the issues are issues that have – in respect of which there’s already been 
findings by the Nugent Commission what may arise is whether Mr Moyane is going to 
accept those findings and leave the matter there, which is one thing, another approach, 
another is whether he is going to challenge those findings.  If he is not going to 
challenge those findings the one attitude might be to say well if he doesn’t challenge 
that it means he accepts that, and if he is going to challenge them it may be that it’s not 
appropriate, I am using appropriate because maybe that might be a more neutral word 
to use, for this Commission to seek to make findings on the same issue because if he 
challenges those findings of the Nugent Commission involving that issue we don’t know 
20 
what will happen in that review application.  If he is successful and those findings are 
set aside it may well be that the review court depending on the grounds of review that 
may be relied upon it may well be that the review court says well those findings are set 
aside completely, or it may be that if for example one of his complaints is that he was 
not allowed an opportunity to cross-examine and the review court concludes that he 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 49 of 204 
 
should have been allowed the opportunity to cross-examine it may be that the review 
court might say well I’m setting them aside and he must be given that opportunity to  
cross-examine.  Is that one of the – are those some of the possible scenarios? 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:  Chair with respect I think you’ve identified that there is 
this world of uncertainty if Mr Moyane were to exercise his right to challenge the Nugent 
findings squarely, a direct attack on these findings and it may have an impact on your 
process and how you evaluate things, but where we stand today on the basis of this 
application I would make three submissions in this regard.  The first is that Minister 
Gordhan only testified about this issue of you misled Parliament because under oath 
somewhere else you said the complete opposite.  That’s the extent of Minister 
10 
Gordhan’s evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you say he has no personal knowledge of any ...(intervention)  
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:  No personal knowledge of any of the underlying facts and 
events that led up to this appointment, all the Minister’s evidence is about is in 
Parliament you said this, and that’s a public record, and in an affidavit filed in court, 
another public record, you said the opposite, so there’s no factual dispute that Mr 
Moyane can rise with the Minister’s evidence because it’s about Parliament 
transcription tells me this, affidavit copy tells me the opposite. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:  That’s all he says, so cross-examining the Minister isn’t 
20 
going to advance your process and settle that explanation, which brings me to my 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  That might be a case where it becomes important to say – to deal 
with the issues, you know sometimes you deny, sometimes you confess and avoid to 
put a version to say well I have seen the transcript from Parliament, it says t his is what 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 50 of 204 
 
I said, that’s not true or it is true but the context is the following, and this what he said in 
the affidavit is what is true. 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:  And Chair that leads me precisely to my second response, 
which is under your rules, and it’s rule 3.3.6 in particular that empowers you in this way, 
there are three outcomes possible today, the one is cross-examination of Minister 
Gordhan by Mr Moyane’s representatives, the other is Mr Moyane testifies, and the 
third is somebody else testifies because somebody else can advance your work. These 
are the three outcomes because again the test is what’s necessary and in the best 
interests of your Commission’s work, so Mr Moyane may want to put up a version and 
come and testify and tell you what happened with this contract why he told Parliament 
10 
that he hadn’t played a role, why he then on oath said the opposite.  Mr Moyane may 
be able to assist you, but his lawyers cross-examining the Minister isn’t going to assist 
on this actual dispute, and Chair the third submission about this issue is that in the 
notice the Commission identified that this question may relate to your terms of 
reference 1.4 and 1.9, broadly speaking those are the ones about government 
contracts.  
 
Now again to the extent your Commission is interested in this government 
contract at SARS it’s for Moyane, possibly Mr Makwakwa, possibly some others from 
SARS, to come and help you to understand what happened there.  Mr Moyane’s 
lawyers cross-examining Minister Gordhan isn’t going to get you anything falling into 
20 
1.4 and 1.9, so on the only issue identified in the notice the application would have to 
fail.  So Chair what this application would actually amount to, with respect to all of this 
SARS related material, and quite frankly also with respect to the political and personal 
issues that are identified, this is an example of what we would call forum shopping, 
because Mr Moyane is hoping that you will buy what at least five other sets of Presiding 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 51 of 204 
 
Officers haven’t.  He’s trying to hope – he is hoping that you will do what Advocate Bam 
didn’t do when he said it’s premature for you to cross-examine at this stage, the 
Constitutional Court, your Court, twice has refused Mr Moyane on the basis of him 
having no prospects of success, where he tried to challenge and raised all of these 
identical issues.  He has been refused twice, and then of course Judge Fabricius in the 
High Court similarly entertained these questions about whether Mr Moyane was in fact 
to be vindicated and found against him, and what’s important to stress, and it’s in the 
heads of argument, when Judge Fabricius dismissed Mr Moyane’s application 
challenging all of the steps taken against him that culminated in his removal, Judge 
Fabricius imposed a punitive cost order and you’ve seen the reasoning of the Judge as 
10 
to why, and then the Constitutional Court confirmed that, saying you’ve got no 
prospects of an appeal here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you there any issues relating to the application for leave to cross-
examine that were the subject of that High Court judgment? 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:  Chair the High Court judgment in effect, the High Court 
judgment was a series of declarators and a series of mandatory relief.  I don’t have the 
notice of motion with me but what it essentially was about is you know draw a line 
through the Nugent reports, the President mustn’t have any reliance on those reports 
and take any decisions to suspend and ultimately terminate me on the basis of them, I 
should be allowed to come and make my submissions in the way I see fit and you can’t 
20 
take a any action against me until that’s all ventilated. 
 
By implication when the Constitutional Court turned down that case when it 
was tried to be brought as a case of first instance and then when it confirmed the High 
Court’s rejection of these arguments the Constitutional Court is saying Judge Nugent’s 
process was proper and the President’s reliance on that process, the decisions he took, 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 52 of 204 
 
suspension, disciplinary before Advocate Bam and the removal ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but my question is are there issues relating to the application for 
leave to cross-examine that were covered by the High Court judgment? 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:  Chair the process of Nugent we would say was the 
subject of those cases, obviously there was one declaratory sought against Minister 
Gordhan, that declaratory is the one that the Constitutional Court rejected twice, it was 
the declaratory that said Minister Gordhan should not have played the role of deposing 
to the affidavit that set out the charges against him, that was the declaratory sought 
against the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:  The reasons given in the Court papers which are attached 
to this application, the reasons given were the same thing, Minister Gordhan doesn’t 
like me, he’s being racist towards me, the transcript of the phone call was attached. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I didn’t see the High Court judgment here, I would like to have a look 
at it to the extent that it may enlighten me on any issues that may or may not be 
relevant. 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:  Chair I’m sure we can arrange that ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, arrangements can be made afterwards ja, okay. 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:  ...it finds its way to you.  But we would just say that there 
were two aspects that were the same in the litigation strategy followed and what’s 
20 
before you now.  The basis for all of the declaratory relief sought against Minister 
Gordhan is the same, it may not be an exact mirror image in terms of the precision but I 
know that the transcript of the phone call was there, the accusations about dislike and 
vendettas and grudges and acrimony and bias and all of those allegations from Mr 
Moyane’s personal view, those were all ventilated there.

Chair the other important issue ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  It may well be that I might, I don’t know how big the High Court 
papers were, it may well be that I should have them available should I want to have a 
look at what was placed before the High Court by the parties and what was placed 
before the Constitutional Court by the parties.  It may be that it’s not worth it, but it 
might be that if I want to have a look I should be able to have a look. 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:  Yes Chair I’m sure we can get the full set of those papers 
to you and I would just highlight again that the High Court confirmed by the 
Constitutional Court imposed a punitive costs order because it said that the way those 
proceedings were run and we’ve quoted the paragraph in our heads of argument, it’s all 
10 
strikingly similar to the invective and the bile that you see in the papers here against 
Minister Gordhan. 
 
So what this application is trying to do is hoping to sell you on something that 
Advocate Bam, Judge Nugent, Judge Fabricius and the Constitutional Court twice have 
said this is not an appropriate use of the process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you need to also make sure I know what the first application to 
the Constitutional Court was about, what this and what the second one was about so 
that I have a complete picture because otherwise I just hear that this was dismissed but 
I don’t know exactly what it was. 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:  Yes Chair very briefly they went straight to the 
20 
Constitutional Court with a Part A to pause everything essentially, Part B was a whole 
lot of declarators about the processes followed.  That included the one about Minister 
Gordhan and the affidavit and the grounds for that declaratory are similar to the 
personal and political attacks here.  Concourt rejected those, then he went to the  High 
Court ,Judge Fabricius dismissed, then they went back on appeal to try to have 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 54 of 204 
 
essentially Part B decided at the time, the Concourt rejected again including the 
confirmation of the punitive cost order for having done this, because Chair Mr Moyane 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  So if I could have the whole file, I don’t want to make one decision 
and find afterwards that had I had access to all of that maybe I might have dealt with 
the matter differently. 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:  Chair I am sure we can get you all the papers the two 
Constitutional Court orders as well as the High Court’s order, because Chair where all 
of this goes is Mr Moyane very explicitly tells you that he is here to rehabilitate his 
reputation and career prospects, he’s asking for your help to rehabilitate his discredited 
10 
name, and when you read the Nugent reports, when you read Judge Fabricius’ decision 
what you will see is the grounds on which Mr Moyane has been discredited and 
disgraced so he comes to you asking for rehabilitation, but again rehabilitation is not 
the purpose of this Commission.  He has a legal avenue he can take, he can take these 
things on review, he can’t come to you asking you to help him to rehabilitate his name 
and his career prospects, that’s not within your terms of reference, and it’s not a useful 
expenditure of public resources. 
 
So if we then look at the other factual issue that was ever raised in this case 
it’s this whole issue about the criminal charges, so initially there was some confusion 
because it seemed that Mr Moyane denied being the complainant, it was clarified in 
20 
reply that he just said no, no I did it as a reasonable SARS Commissioner and anyone 
in my position would have done the same thing and it wasn’t out of malice. 
 
Chair on that Mr Moyane’s motivations are not relevant they are not going to 
help you in your work to understand why he did it, because let’s remember what the 
Minister’s evidence in this regard was, he said I was reappointed following the then 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 55 of 204 
 
President’s reversal of his appointment of Mr van Rooyen as Minister of Finance.  From 
the moment I arrived it appeared as if there was then regret at the fact that I was back, 
and I then endured a campaign, 27 questions, the charges, the political campaign, the 
social campaign, which of course continues in various forms to this day against Minister 
Gordhan.  That was his evidence, so Mr Moyane coming and saying I was a reasonable 
person when I went and filed charges isn’t meeting the evidence,  it doesn’t implicate 
Mr Moyane’s motives, so it is not actually an issue on which Mr Moyane must vindicate 
some right as an implicated person.  The fact is he was the complainant as he has now 
clarified.  The fact is that Minister Gordhan’s evidence was that it was one instance of 
this pressure and this campaign and what I had to endure.  So why the charges were 
10 
brought… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well assuming – assuming that it is an issue that I should entertain 
his motive may be relevant if Mr Gordhan’s evidence was to the effect or suggested 
that in laying the complaint against him Mr Moyane knew that there was really no case.  
But he was doing so for ulterior motives. 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:   Chair let me say to two things in response to that.  The 
first is again Judge Nugent has looked at this.  Judge Nugent has looked at this and 
said Mr Moyane arrives, Minister Gordhan gets appointed, these charges are brought, 
they baseless, they are withdrawn, it is all – it is all rather suspicious and seems to 
have been politically motivated. So Justice Nugent has looked at this.  The second 
20 
point is this.  If you decide that Mr Moyane’s motivations to file charges – to file 
complaint that ultimately led to charges against the Minister is relevant necessary and 
in the best interest of the work of the commission.  Then again Mr Moyane should come 
and tell you about his motives and be subject to cross=examination on those motives 
and test his theory about why he says it was reasonable to do what he did.  It does not 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 56 of 204 
 
help to cross-examine the Minister about Mr Moyane’s mind set. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if the Minister in giving evidence suggested that there was an 
ulterior motive on the part of Mr Moyane in  laying those charges then there should be 
nothing wrong with the Minister being cross-examined on whether his attribution of that 
motive to Mr Moyane is correct or justified but that is if I were to accept that the issue is 
one that should be dealt with here. 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:   With respect correct Chair so let us go back.  Is it 
necessary and in the best interest of your work to delve into this question?  We would 
submit not.  If you were going to the Minister has testified and said, this was the 
campaign that I endured and the charges were one element of it and my perception is 
10 
that it was a political campaign.  Mr Moyane’s cross-examination is saying no, no I was 
just being a sensible commissioner.  Does that re – there is no factual dispute that that 
cross-examination resolves for you.  It is not like I was at Saxonwold, no I was not.  
Factual dispute, cross-examine, come up with evidence and it takes your commission 
forward because you establish some facts.  This is two people who disagree about why 
something happened and both of them can be right.  One can say I was just being 
sensible in laying charges and the Minister says I endured a campaign and I saw this 
as part of it.  It does not help your job to resolve that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the one may be saying – the one may be saying the motive for 
this one doing this is part of state capture and the other one might be saying it is not 
20 
part of state capture it is just a bona fide decision that any citizen would have taken – 
any citizen in my position would have taken.   
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:   And Chair let me… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And once we go to that level then I would have to say well because I 
need to establish people who were participants in you know conduct that may constitute 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 57 of 204 
 
state capture.  But again that is if that issue is an issue that I entertain but I think you 
have made the points you wanted to make on that.  You may be ready to go to the next 
point. 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:   Yes and Chair let me just – let me just say finally on this 
point.  That again and it is – it arises out the questions you posed to my learned friend 
this morning.  Mr Moyane needs to put up a version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:   That can be tested.  So even if you did think that this 
would advance your work and for the reasons I have already explained it does not but if 
you were inclined to entertain it you need a version from Mr Moyane first in order to test 
10 
which we simply do not have.  So Chair finally let me – let me conclude by saying that 
the Minister had nothing to hide from this commission.  The Minister as he has 
repeatedly said is willing to assist you.  If there is further information that you require 
from him he will come and continue to assist and support the important work of this 
commission.  But the reason why he is opposing this application is because it is either 
airing personal vendettas and grievances which are not part of your terms of reference 
and do not advance your work  Or it is part of some political campaign and the – the 
reliance, the explicit association of Mr Moyane with the narrative run by certain political 
opponent of the Minister in his papers by attaching their papers shows that there is a 
political element to this that they are trying to introduce into your proceedings.  And 
20 
finally everything SARS related has been dealt with by Justice Nugent.  So for – on the 
three things they want to try to do here we would submit it is not necessary and it is not 
in the best interest of the work of the commission to do that.  And it is the best interests 
of the commission for another reason.  Because this kind of abuse of your process 
which is what we would say this would allow that is the reason why people will not 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 58 of 204 
 
come and take up your invitation to come and give you information.  If they have to 
endure their political detractors and people that used to work with them being able to  
come and air personal grievances why would anyone put themselves before you?  Why 
would you put yourself through that?  So there is a chilling effect that is possible on the 
commission here and so when you are thinking through is it necessary and is it in the 
best interest of the commission entertaining this application is likely to have a 
detrimental effect on the willingness of participation in this commission.  And given that 
you have very little time left if we actually look at the calendar and what is left to do we 
would submit that it would not be the best use of your public resources.  Chair other 
than – if there are any other questions those were our submissions. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No questions.  Thank you.  Mr Mpfu I do not know whether Mr 
Pretorius wants to say anything for five minutes or he want to come after you?  Okay. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Thank you Chair I will … 
CHAIRPERSON:  This time I will be strict with you. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I know, I know.  Ten or fifteen minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So any reason to give you more than seven minutes? 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes Chair because we agreed on ten which I wanted to increase 
but I am happy with the ten.  No Chair I will be very quick ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Very briefly. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Well Chair I mean really I think that I just want highlight those 
20 
issues over which there is an attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of this commission.  
1.  Anybody who says we simply do not have – my learned friend just said, we simply 
do not have a version as to whether Mr Moyane was bona fide, the debate that you just 
had.  What?  We have attached this Sithakhane Report.  We have referred to the Kroon 
Report.  We have referred to the KPMG Report.  We have referred to the IGI, Inspector 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 59 of 204 
 
General Report all of which say that Mr Gordhan’s activities were unlawful or criminal.  
So it – to say there is no version is just a – the only counter version is that of the 
Nugent Commission which we have said Chair explicitly in our replying affidavit we are 
challenging in court.  So the Chair with respect said if he is going to – it is not if.  He 
has said under oath that he is going to challenge that it is part B.  My learned friend 
says that it was the = all these court cases she refers to were part A.  So it is 
disingenuous with respect to then think that part B has just disappeared into the ether 
because the part B is still alive and Mr Moyane tells you Chair in this application that he 
even says I am taking advice whether I should pursue part B as it was or issue a fresh 
challenge to the Nugent Review or rather Report because now remember there is a 
10 
final report.  So it might go wider than whatever he was contemplating last year.  But he 
says one thing I can tell you Chair is that I am going to review this and we are still 
within the time within which that is going to be done.  There is no doubt about that. 
There cannot be any doubt in the mind of any lawyer.  Now and my learned friend says 
part B says you must draw a line through the Nugent Report.  So what is that if it is not 
a review?  Draw a line through the report that means you Chair should not consider that 
report because – and we do not want to talk about prospects of success or whatever 
50/50 leave it at 50.50.  50% it might be – it might stay, 50% it might be set aside.  That 
is all the Chair has to take into account and therefore to suggest that this commission 
can rely even if it was not being challenged for that matter when there four other reports 
20 
which have never been challenged by maybe twenty people and then one report which 
is being challenged by three or four other people. I mean it is actually a racist attack on 
this commission to suggest that this commission must suddenly you know [speaking 
Xhosa] there is no such thing.  The Nugent Report has got the same status as any 
other report and the other reports of Sikhakhane and other people which have never 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 60 of 204 
 
been challenged even though Mr Gordhan – let us take the Kroon thing for example.  I 
am sorry Kroon J.  They come here and say Kroon J disowned the – his report.  That 
panel had about seven people.  The – if one of them disowns the report who cares?  
Because it might well have been that the report in any event was 52 or 43 or 62 or 
whatever we do not know.  The report stands nobody has ever discredited it.  Nobody 
has ever reviewed it and it says that Gordhan should be investigated for criminal 
charges or rather no that is the IGI Report.  But it says it was unlawful and so does 
Kekane and so does KPMG and so on.  So this is just trying to mislead this – and I am 
glad the Chair has asked for the papers because the other red herring is this thing, oh 
no there have been this court cases.  Though all those court case I know because I 
10 
drafted them.  All those cases – the first one was about whether there was direct 
access. The constitutional court made it clear it says you may go to another court.  So 
what has that got to do with the price of milk?  It has nothing to do with the merits it said 
you must go to the high court.  That is just one example.  The other one it said no 
prospects of success on part A and the Chair will know there may be an array of 
reasons for example the fact that it was only an interim finding that is being attacked 
and so on.  So all that is just to confuse to at least an attempt to confuse this court and 
the Chair will clear it out when he gets the necessary copies.  The other red herring oh 
no Mr Moyane now that he has lost these cases wants you Chair to rehabilitate him and 
so on.  I cannot say it in open court what I think of that submission.  Because the 
20 
sequence of events is very clear.  When Mr Moyane came here Chair in front of you I 
came here on the 19th or 20th November and said we are applying to cross-examine.  
None of these judgments that my learned friend is talking about were out at that stage – 
Zero. So how could it be that we are motivated by those judgments which had not 
happened when I was standing right here on this podium saying that we were going to 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 61 of 204 
 
ask for cross-examination?  That is just you know an attempt to obfuscate the issues.  
Then what – we are told that it is hysterical to suggest that there was a vendetta by Mr 
Gordhan.  Well the funniest thing is that at page 390 and 91 Mr Gordhan says and I am 
not sure if the pagination works at 12.3 Mr Moyane using the platform to denigrate me 
and my record public service through cross-examination by his legal representatives,. It 
is outlandish theories, racist and populist script and in the pursuit of a personal 
vendetta against me.  So if it is hysterical to say Mr Moyane is – has a personal 
vendetta against him why is not hysterical in his case?  What is so special about him?  
So the – and he can accuse people of racism and by the way Chair with the greatest 
respect if nothing else you remember that I say on this point is this.  Specific in the 
10 
papers you will see that there is a specific reference to the racism issue there are even 
transcripts and so on.  Mr Gordhan who was cited did not oppose never filed a single 
affidavit in those cases.  When you receive the papers you will see to say Mr Moyane 
for three or four pages says I was racist him says I was calling him a boy... He says I 
was condescending towards him.  He said I was denigrating, I humiliated him I insulted 
his dignity and I say he is wrong.  Zero till today.  He has never – a person who is 
accused of such serious issues as racist in the context of South Africa would have just 
put even a one page affidavit to say look I do not want to get involved in the 
employment issues but I just want to put on the record that I am not a racist, I never 
called him a boy.  He is making it up.  The transcript is wrong it was manufactured and 
20 
doctored somewhere, never.  So those are the facts but the last point Chair is what the 
Chair put to my learned friend which as I – as far as I am concerned decides the issue.  
The issue is this if Mr Gordhan in his wisdom sat here and Mr Pretorius no less than Mr 
Pretorius put this to Mr Gordhan which is the discussion here Chair you were having.  
At page 56 of 115 of the transcript of Mr Gordhan’s evidence this is the whole thing 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 62 of 204 
 
about the laying of the charges by Mr Moyane and the 27 questions what with you 
which went at length.  Says Mr Pretorius is there not an argument that could be put to 
you that these were genuine investigation in relation to matters of potential unlawful 
activity?  Is the point that the Chair was making that if there is a counter narrative and 
then Mr Gordhan gave some long convoluted answer which did not deal with that. But 
that shows exactly the – the only reason Mr Pretorius would have asked that question it 
is because it would be relevant as to the  motive that was being attributed to Mr 
Moyane by Mr Gordhan which Mr Moyane disputes as being – and if that is not a 
question for cross-examination then nothing is because cross-examination as to motive 
let alone the questions of bias is legitimate.  So even on that narrow issue there is no 
10 
doubt but no doubt Chair that the issue of cross – rather cross-examination should be – 
should be given.  And my learned friend maybe was not listening I did articulate the test 
of necessity and mandate and I said I use the mandate deliberately because it is the 
wider test.  It say: is it necessary 1 and is it – does it advance the mandate of the 
commission because that is how it has been – it is articulated I think in Rule 6.1.  The 
point we simply want to make is that it is – if anything is going to discredit – can 
discredit this commission it is the idea obnoxious as it is that is being suggested here 
that it is acceptable for Mr Gordhan who is the boss to come here and denigrate Mr 
Moyane and cast aspersions on his character and his motives.  But it is not acceptable 
for Mr Moyane the subordinate to come here and defend himself against that and also 
20 
to assert issues which are relevant to state capture on the part of Mr Gordhan that is 
the most ridiculous submission I have ever heard in my life.  Because if that is what this 
commission is going to be communicating to the world out there that you can be 
denigrated you can be called all this and the other but you will not be given an 
opportunity to put your side of the story. That is what will discourage people from 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 63 of 204 
 
coming here.  Not granting what is the obvious right of Mr Moyane to refute the 
disparaging remarks and the criminal imputations which have been put upon him.  I am 
sorry Chair I am so sorry.  Two seconds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I just – this is a – just had a reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I will not even motivate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  The – in the – in the invitation of the commission to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Rule 3.3 Notice. 
10 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  The 3.3 Notice that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  The – on my pagination it starts at page 270 I am told that Mr 
Pretorius tells me that our pagination also appears so even if it is wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Ours would be the koki pen one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes.  And so 271 of the koki pen [indistinct] rather pagination 
paragraph 4 Chair I just wanted to highlight that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  To say the commission said so we do not even have to come and 
say to you Chair this is how it is relevant in terms of the terms of reference.  The 
commission says to us you are implicated in this – in the following ways inter alia bla, 
bla, bla and then it says: these allegations fall within the investigation of the 
commission as envisaged in its terms of reference and in particular paragraph 1.4 and 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 64 of 204 
 
1.9 thereof.  Case closed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to say that I will look at that. What is put there in a Rule 
3.3 Notice is the legal teams view on the position as opposed necessarily of the 
Chairperson. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  No, no Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Usually I have not even seen the statement by the time –  
ADV DALI MPOFU:  No Chair I think that is an important – that is an important – we 
spoke about it in chambers.  No it is very important. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja yes ja we do … 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  We do not at all impute any of these utterances to the Chair.  As I 
10 
said in chambers we regard as in the high court as analogy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  As if they come from the registrar. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From the registrar ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words but all of the point I am simply making is that the 
evidence leaders highly trained lawyers, senior counsel and so on if they say the 
allegations we are talking about above are relate to terms of reference 1.4 and 1.9 at 
least that must come… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, it is something. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  That must count for something ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  As the court pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I am sorry – as the commission pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Mpofu. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 65 of 204 
 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I am indebted … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius you wanted to say something? I am sorry Ms Le Roux 
wants to say something. 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:  Sorry Chair I just need to correct something on the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:  The reason why Minister Gordhan has not put in an 
affidavit contradicting the racisms allegations in the court papers is because the 
constitutional court dismissed the case on both occasions before giving him an 
opportunity to do that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV MICHELLE LE ROUX:  I just needed to correct that on the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I am sorry Chair no that is not true.  Mr Gordhan was cited in the 
constitutional court yes what they happened because the constitutional court referred 
the matter back to the high court Chair it – we then complied with the constitutional 
court directive and that is how the high court part A matter happened.  When that 
happened Mr Gordhan did not oppose there as well.  What – so – if the constitutional 
court did something before he moved which is also not true then at least he should 
have opposed in the high court.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But… 
20 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  I am simply saying the sequence is wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay but in the end really – it is neither here nor there for this 
purpose. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes. – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 66 of 204 
 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  But that correction is wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS:  Thank you Chair.  We would like to place you several points. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And five minutes for you.  You had indicated five minutes should be 
enough. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS:  Well as long as our treatment is consistent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – they did not ask for five minutes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You asked for five minutes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS:  This will not be included in the five minutes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS:  The first is what is the proper approach to applications of 
this sort?  And our submission in that regard Chair is that the approach cannot be 
based on a right to cross-examination because that is not present.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS:  In these proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is common cause now. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS:  The applicant must establish firstly that he is implicated by 
evidence.  Secondly that he has a version on the basis of which that evidence may be 
contradicted and thirdly and importantly Chair that it would further the investigation of 
20 
the commission to allow that cross-examination or and we stress or be necessary to 
protect the integrity or reputation of the person wishing to cross-examine in respect of 
that evidence or issue.  Based on that Chair if one has regard to paragraph 13 of the 
applicant’s submissions.  Our view is that 13.5, 13.8, 13.9 and 13.10 may subject to 
your discretion if you believe it would further the objects of the commission and its 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 67 of 204 
 
investigations in its investigatorial role or proceed to protect the integrity and reputation 
of the witness those are the four which we concede may … - it is 1.35 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS:  13.8 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS:  13.9 and 13.10.  The next point briefly put Chair is it is not 
within the province of cross-examination or the cross-examiner of a particular witness 
to open an avenue of investigative enquiry.  It is for the Chair to direct what evidence 
may be put before it and what other avenues of enquiry may be opened.  So it is not for 
the applicant to conduct his own investigation via cross-examination.  Differently if that 
10 
evidence is brought to the commission via the legal team that is a different question.  
Then Chair the IGI Report which appears at page 315 of the papers that is the 
Inspector General Intelligence.  That is a classified report.  It has not been declassified 
although there is mention of it appearing before some or other forum.  You may want to 
consider Chair whether when the documents before you are released for publication by 
the press that report should be included or excluded from the documentation publicly 
released. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if it is classified and it has not been declassified it should not be 
for public consumption. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS:  Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I do not even know if – whether it should be here. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS:  Well it is here unfortunately Chair but the fact that protocol 
may have been breached by putting it before you I have no facts to suggest that it has 
but does not excuse the commission from adhering to its own protocols in controlling 
public release of classified documents.

CHAIRPERSON:  Well I may have I see Mr Mpofu want to say something I may have to 
say that it should not be published before the end of these proceedings.  It should not 
be published unless I make another decision at some stage in the future. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS:  As you please Chair.  The last issue which has not really 
been dealt with by the parties is what time should you in your discretion Chair wish to 
allow cross-examination on any particular topic or subject to any particular conditions 
what time should be afforded and in that respect what we wish to place before you 
Chair is that the calendar of the commission at present and its time limits place great 
pressure.  We have 250 witnesses at least to call before the end of the year that does 
not include implicated parties nor does it include time for cross-examination and I think 
10 
the parties must accept that their expectations may have to be tempered by that 
consideration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr Mpofu made it clear that they accept that the – they – if 
leave to cross-examine is granted they would be a limit put by the Chairperson on the 
duration. Of course we have not gotten to the question of how time? 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the past I have in regard to those who have cross-examined I think 
I had given them thirty minutes and they accepted at that and they worked more or less 
within that.  They may exceeded a little bit but it would all depend because also there it 
was the issues that I considered.  So in every case in determining the amount of time I 
20 
would grant I would look at the issues that is why it is so important to have the version 
of both parties or both persons involved so that in deciding on the amount of time I 
allow I have a fair idea of what – how much difference there is in their respective 
versions.  But that is something that one can deal with. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS:  Thank you Chair those are the points we wish to raise. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 69 of 204 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS:  And Mr Mpofu is welcome to enjoy the last minute of my five. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Two seconds only Mr Mpofu. 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Yes Chair two seconds.  The first one – the second point Chair we 
accept that there will be limitations.  Of course subject to the caveat that Mr Gordhan 
was allowed to go on for days about his daughters and all that but we accept that not all 
that was about Mr Moyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
ADV DALI MPOFU:  And therefore it will have to be curtailed.  But on a more serious 
issue which is the IGI Report Chair.  Well Chair again another caveat Mr Gordhan’s 
10 
version of course is that this might be a fake report.  So if it is a fake report it cannot be 
classified.  So but be that as it may because it is not a fake report.  We accept that what 
Mr Pretorius proposes.  Even on the off chance that it is genuine – genuinely classified 
report it would be improper to put it for public consumption.  We must make the point of 
course that when we heard it here we heard it in the context of papers which are 
already in the public domain in the equality court of a matter that I think was initiated by 
Mr Gordhan himself and so it is already in the high court, it is already here but as far as 
this commission is concerned we accept that it would be – it would be improper to – or 
rather it should be – maybe redacted if when the papers are released. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV DALI MPOFU:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  I will reserve my decision on the application but in the 
meantime I want to say that the IGI Report is not to be published unless I decide 
differently at a later stage.  So in regard to this application I reserve my decision and I 
may ask the parties to deal with any other issues that may arise when I look at the 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 70 of 204 
 
matter before I make my decision.  Okay, what is the next ...(intervention)  
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Chair there are – one of those minutes in relation to the 
application by Mr Abrahams, he has applied for condonation for the late filing of a 
statement which will in due course be put before you Chair, the application is before 
you, I have a copy for you, it is unopposed, we bring it on behalf of Mr Abrahams. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have read it and condonation is granted. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there another matter to be dealt with before we ...(intervention)  
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...we go to the witnesses, okay.  I think we should then take the tea 
10 
adjournment and we will resume at half past eleven. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
HEARING RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair.  Before the Eskom evidence resumes there is 
one witness that is to be interposed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
20 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  And that is Ms Mgabadeli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL PRETORIUS SC:  Who will be led by Ms Sello.

Page 71 of 204 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Chair before we swear in Ms Mgabadeli 
for record keeping purposes we have made available to you a little file we marked 
EXHIBIT D8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second.  I still have here things. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is a ring bound. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That belonged to what we were doing earlier. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think this relates to Mr Shaun Abrahams condonation application 
and it should get out of the way.  Also. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It should be a ring bound document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Moyane’s application and Mr Gordhan’s opposing affidavits and 
their submissions should get out of the way.  I have got EXHIBIT D8. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We have marked it D8 Chair in anticipation that the Chair will 
approve.  If the Chair will recall Ms Mentor’s range is D for David. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And so far the exhibits go to 7A and 7B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Being individual recordings of the inspection in loco. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So we would with your approval then Chair request that be 
marked D8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It shall be so marked. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 72 of 204 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  D8 Chair has actually got statements of 
two witnesses.  The first statement relates to Ms Hlengiwe Mgabadeli who is the 
witness in the box now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The other statement which I will deal with in the fullness of 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  With that Chair then may I request that the witness be sworn 
in? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI: 
 
My 
name 
is 
Hlengiwe Christophina Mgabadeli. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection with taking the prescribed oath? 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Not at all. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your conscience? 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the truth, the whole 
truth and nothing but the truth if so please raise your right hand and say so help me 
God. 
20 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  So help me God. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  (duly sworn, states) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 73 of 204 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair just to give perspective to Ms Mgabadeli’s evidence.  
The Chair will recall that Ms Mentor during the course of her testimony indicated that 
after she was offered the Ministerial position by Mr Ajay Gupta she had a conversation 
with Ms Mgabadeli at which she disclosed this fact to Ms Mgabadeli.  Ms Mgabadeli 
has prepared a statement in response to that one particular issue and is present here 
today to testify on that [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually if I recall correctly and I got reminded when I was looking at 
this is that Ms Mentor said she made two or three calls, maybe three calls to or no she; 
that was to. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The other one. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Her friend. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Nkosi.  Is it Nkosi? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  It is Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, ja.  That is the one. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is only one in regard to Ms Mgabadeli. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Only one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  In regard to Ms Mgabadeli. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And again perhaps some perspective would assist here the 
Chair would recall that in her original statement at paragraphs 103 and 104 Ms Mentor 
has initially stated that she made this disclosure to Ms Mgabadeli, Mr Bloem and 
Mr Cwele.  In her subsequent appearance on 12 August she noted to the Chair that she 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 74 of 204 
 
had made an error and she changed her position to say that the discussion she had 
with Ms Mgabadeli was between the two of them.  The statement filed today is in 
response to the amended version. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of that incident, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ms Mgabadeli I see you have it already, EXHIBIT D8.  Could 
you please turn to page HCM01?  It is a document that runs on for three pages until 
HCM03. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is that your statement you have made to this Commission?  
Do you confirm? 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Yes.  This is my statement. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And at page HCM03 the signature appearing thereon is that 
your signature? 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Definitely that is my signature. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Do you confirm the correctness and do you stand by the 
allegations you make in this statement under oath? 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Very correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  Ms Mgabadeli just very briefly to the Chair, give 
20 
the Chair your background very briefly including your time of service in Parliament. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  If you say background how far back 
you want my background? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  That is a good question.  Maybe adult background.  
Perhaps you start of by mentioning that you are a member of the ANC and perhaps you 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 75 of 204 
 
take it from your membership of the ANC leading onto your service in Parliament. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:   
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise you can just say when you started as a Member of 
Parliament. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  20. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And which party were you representing in Parliament? 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Just like my father was a member of 
the African National Congress I was born within the family of the African National 
Congress.  So since I grew up.  I went to Parliament in 2004, April.  I do not know 
whether you want me to [intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you remained a Member of Parliament until 2014? 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Until 2014, June. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay and. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And during that time you were a member of certain Portfolio 
Committees is that right? 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  A number of Portfolio Committees. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A number of them? 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the Public Enterprises Portfolio Committee one of them/ 
20 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  I have never been that one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh or maybe it was called something else at that time. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No Chair.  If I may. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ah. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The right Committee is the Joint Standing Committee on 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 76 of 204 
 
Intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, the joint ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  You served on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Mentor was Chair of the one for 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One for Public Enterprises. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But she was also serving. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Both served on that one. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, both served on that one? 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  On the Joint Standing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Alright, yes.  You continue [intervenes]. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  I can give you some of the 
Committees that I served on. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  For completeness you might as well if you recall. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  I served on the Education one, Public 
Service and Commission, Defence, Joint Standing Committee on Defence, Joint 
Standing Committee on Intelligence.  I will leave the other ones. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Then I was appointed to some 
Commission.  One Commission, I just remember when the soldiers were marching to 
Union Buildings I was in that Interim Commission.  Two ladies only in that Commission 
and I was also in the Committee that was dealing with the Protection of Information and 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 77 of 204 
 
others that were short term. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, thank you.  Now specifically in respect of the Joint 
Standing Committee on Intelligence you served on that Committee with Ms Mentor your 
statement said? 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  I served in that Committee with 
Ms Mentor, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Besides that relationship do you know Ms Mentor personally 
and could you just briefly state to the Chair how you know Ms Mentor? 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Yes, I do.  Besides serving in the 
Committee of Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence.  We were both sitting in the 
10 
caucus, the ANC caucus and she was my neighbour when I arrived.  I found her in 
2004 having arrived in 1999, if I am not mistaken.  So I joined in that parliamentary 
village and I was her neighbour.  We had children.  I was raising my sister’s children 
and they would help one another and each other on homework and stuff like that.  We 
will go, I love art.  She loves art.  We will discuss so many things.  If I remember of the 
ANC, let me not talk about other parties.  If I remember of the ANC you like discussing 
about the past, the present and what you had hoped to achieve and what is being 
achieved and all those stories.  Indeed yes we used to discuss a lot. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  With Ms Mentor and her children 
20 
were just equivalent to my own children.  The same with my nieces and nephews.  She 
was not a person, I can say she was at a distance with.  We are very close. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were very close? 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  We were very close. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 78 of 204 
 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Very close. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And in 2010 the relationship was as you have just described, 
during the year 2010? 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  In the precinct of Parliament yes, but 
I do not actually remember when Ms Mentor moved away from being my neighbour, 
but. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At a certain stage. 
10 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  At a certain stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were not neighbours in the parliamentary village? 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Acacia Park is very big.  There is a 
part that is lower down very far away from, I am at the entrance next to the gate.  So 
she moved and resettled further down which was very, very far away from me up until I 
left Parliament in 2014.  At the time that relationship of after working hours and 
discussing things was no longer there, because it was too far. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Now as you will recall you were provided with firstly 
20 
Ms Mentor’s statement then the transcripts of Ms Mentor’s testimony and you were 
asked to comment on an allegation made by Ms Mentor and for this purpose I will refer 
you to paragraph 6 where a quote is given with reference to the transcript.  That at 
page 67 of the transcript dated 12 February 2019 from lines 13 to 15 Ms Mentor states 
as follows: 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 79 of 204 
 
“I have said also to the legal team of the Commission I may 
have discussed it with Ms Mgabadeli.  May be able to 
corroborate.” 
Well it goes further. 
“I also said that the SS Member of the Standing Committee on 
Intelligence.” 
That is a direct quote taken from the transcript.  Please concentrate on the first part, 
because that is the relevant part as to what she says she may have discussed with you.  
My question is Ms Mentor’s evidence is sometime between September and October 
Mr Ajay Gupta offered her a Ministerial post and at the conclusion of this conversation 
10 
the then President Mr Zuma joined them in a room and she disclosed this fact to him to 
which he did not respond.  That is Ms Mentor’s testimony to the Chair.  Did you have a 
conversation such as described by Ms Mentor in the transcript or concerning an offer 
made to her by Mr Ajay Gupta? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think maybe let us add a part of her version that you have left out 
that maybe important.  Namely that she says she had travelled from Cape Town to 
Johannesburg to meet the former President, President Zuma, but she ended up at the 
Gupta residence where she says she had a conversation with, I cannot remember 
whether she is specific that it is Ajay Gupta or one or other of the Gupta brothers who 
offered her the position of being Minister of Public Enterprises on a certain condition 
20 
that she mentioned.  I think it was that on condition that once she was Minister of Public 
Enterprises she would terminate the airline route from Johannesburg, is it Mumbai. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mumbai. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To Mumbai and while she was having this discussion with 
Mr Ajay Gupta or whichever of the Gupta brothers the former President emerged, this is 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 80 of 204 
 
now at the Gupta residence, emerged from one of the rooms and he; at this time she 
was getting emotional that is her version, because she was very shocked by this offer 
from the Guptas and the President calmed her down and her walked her to the car to 
go back to the airport.  So I just want to, you to get the as full a version of what that part 
of the story is because I do not know which part may or may not have stayed in your 
memory if there was such a discussion and what would have made you to remember 
the discussion easily if at all you remember it.  Ms Sello it is, have I captured it 
properly? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As far as Ms Mentor’s testimony in totality is concerned, ye 
Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So that is what she told the Commission and she said she 
either said she discussed it with you or she may have said she thought she had 
discussed it with you among other people who she said she had discussed it with and 
the purpose of calling you is to see whether you have any recollection of such a 
discussion. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Chairperson all the details that you 
are giving me now I learnt about them just like most of other South Africans when 
Vytjie Mentor was here and the Vytjie that I know was not going not to tell me when she 
is being called.  As I have given you the background how close we were and are still, 
because when I get time up until this Commission started we do phone each other and 
20 
one another.  I have no reason why I should say I do not recall her telling me and 
fortunately herself in paragraph 6 said I may have discussed it with Ms Mgabadeli.  So I 
learnt about all the calling by the President and whatever from watching the television 
when the state capture was on in space. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Commission was sitting and she was giving evidence/ 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 81 of 204 
 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  And all the descriptions of whatever 
happened.  I really have got no reason why I say I can say she did not tell me.  If she 
did tell me I do not recall any of that.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you have no recollection of the two of you having the discussion 
when she would have told you that? 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  No, not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Also really in Parliament our 
10 
Committees and different Committees, we finish very late.  We finish very late.  Take 
the Protection of Information, we will finish roundabout double one in the morning.  
Saturdays I will go, I have got [indistinct] and I will come back on Monday.  There is 
very little time to really for a person to be called by a State President and come back 
and tell you all the details that I learnt about them when I was watching the television.  
So I have got nothing against Ms Mentor.  She is my sister.  She is my comrade.  She is 
my neighbour.  She was my neighbour at that time, but I just do not recall her telling me 
that. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If I may then just follow up on that let us leave the 
conservation of 2010 or the direct offer to her by Mr Ajay Gupta.  Have you and 
20 
Ms Mentor ever had any discussion regarding offers of appointments as Ministers by 
the Guptas in general or anyone who is not the President?  Have you had a 
conversation that would fit that bill? 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Maybe it will help this Commission for 
me to say as much as we are all members of the African National Congress there were 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 82 of 204 
 
those who were sitting in the NEC, National. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Executive Committee. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Executive Committee.  I have never 
sat in that Committee.  There were issues that were discussed at that higher level.  I 
will be in the caucus and very productive in the caucus.  My hand was almost all those 
days when the caucus sit because I have been inside the country for the rest of my life 
and I would like to see my country going right, but when it comes to issues that are 
discussed in NEC, at NEC Meetings, people being promised this and that as much as I 
am mentally okay high up there, but I was not at that level.  I was not attending the 
10 
NEC Meetings, because to be honest I learnt so very late that the Gupta, there is a 
surname called Gupta.  I stay in Durban.  There are so many Indians in Durban.  I can 
count a list of surnames.  I have never come across a surname Gupta.  Coming from 
Intelligence and I thought it was just a project.  G-U-P-T-A and from the Intelligence 
Rules when you are not involved in that you are less concerned, because before I went 
to Parliament I was the instructor in Nia.  So I am very, my veins and everything about 
me even before we were unbanned as a country.  That is what I was doing the most.  
So I never interfere when I am not needed.  It was after so many, many years that oh 
this Gupta is a surname and I thought it was a project, project called Gupta.  So really 
when it comes to the levels I was not in that level of knowing all those things. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is your, am I correct to; is my understanding correct that what 
you are saying is anything about Ms Mentor having been offered a Ministerial position 
by the Guptas is some that as far as you recall you heard for the first time when this 
Commission was hearing Ms Mentor’s evidence.  Am I correct in understanding your 
evidence to be to that effect? 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 83 of 204 
 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Yes.  I think there was also a public 
sitting like this before this particular Commission sat which was not this year, which was 
not last year.  There was a public set up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Where she first got to be known by. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  The masses of the country. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Pronouncing that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  I got to know about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that time. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  At that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the first time/ 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  For the first time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair, I do not have other questions that is the evidence of 
20 
Ms Mgabadeli unless the Chair would require clarification on other issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, I think that, because I think it is quite clear that what you are 
saying is whatever you heard as far as you can recall is what you heard through the 
public, in the public domain not in a private discussion. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Yes Chairperson. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 84 of 204 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is as far as you remember? 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No, thank you very much. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you for coming to share that with us.  You might 
not, maybe appreciate the importance, but it is important because it is an aspect of the 
terms of reference that is quite important to the Commission whether or not certain 
Ministerial positions were offered to certain people.  Thank you very much.  You are 
excused. 
MS HLENGIWE CHRISTOPHINA MGABADELI:  Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair with that I think I will hand over to 
Mr Maleka. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  We will be excused. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Maleka. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Good afternoon Chair.  The next witness is 
Mr Piers Marsden.  May I ask the Registrar to administer the oath/ 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Maleka. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Well. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have just looked at the watch.  I guess it has been a long morning 
or is your watch different? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I am sorry mine is ahead of yours. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  The Registrar can administer the oath.  Mr Maleka before you, 
while the Registrar is administering the oath I would like to dispose of Mr van Rooyen’s 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 85 of 204 
 
application for leave to cross-examine either at some stage today or tomorrow.  So if, 
maybe we should say tomorrow.  So if somebody can confirm that there is nothing 
outstanding otherwise I can announce my decision tomorrow. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Chair as far as we know all you needed to do from 
all the affected parties is before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Fuzile’s lawyers at some stage mentioned about bringing 
something.  They are not bringing anything. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I believe that they have and I believe that what they 
have submitted is before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Intervenes]. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Is before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, I have not seen it.  Is it an application for leave to cross-examine 
him? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh then I can deal with that separately. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and you know our views on the score of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we must just, I am not going to deal with that one. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I do not know if processes have been completed.  Whether 
Mr van Rooyen has had a chance to respond or not to that one, but I will deal with 
20 
Mr van Rooyen’s application because from what you are telling me it looks like all 
processes have been complicated. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As far as that is concerned. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 86 of 204 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So tomorrow I can then announce my decision with regard to 
Mr van Rooyen’s application. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then I can look at the other one and processes would need to take 
their course. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And at the right stage I can make it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We will be grateful, because you know that we are eager 
to complete the evidence of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Fuzile. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I have not seen that application.  So somebody must just make 
sure that I am in possession of it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We will liaise with your Registrar during the lunch 
adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  To make sure that she reminds you when. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It was submitted to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Well I have got the Van Rooyen one.  It is the new one that I do 
20 
not have. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Or we will make an extra copy for you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is fine, ja.  Okay, thank you.  You can go ahead. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65

REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  My name is Piers Michael Marsden. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection with taking the prescribed oath? 
PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your conscience? 
PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the truth, the whole 
truth and nothing but the truth if so please raise your right hand and say so help me 
God. 
PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So help me God. 
10 
PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  (duly sworn, states) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair before Mr Marsden starts may I record that he was 
one of those persons who assisted the Public Protector to investigate matters relating 
to the business rescue administration of Optimum Coal Holdings and Optimum Coal 
Mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  He is also one of the persons who orally testified before 
the Portfolio Committee on State Owned Enterprises. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We have submitted the transcript of his version together 
with the bundle of the transcript that Ms Norman took you through. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  On the, I think the 18th if I am not mistaken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 88 of 204 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But we have also prepared a separate transcript for you 
of his testimony before the Portfolio Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALELKA SC:  I am not too sure whether it was given to you in a small 
blue file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it specifically wasn’t drawn to my attention, sometimes people 
think they have given me things when they have just put them where I am supposed 
them.  I see a certain file here, I don’t know about it but ...(intervention)  
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   No, no that’s not the one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s not the one. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   No that is the copy of the legislation we dealt with 
yesterday, but we will get to it after ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, in due course. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Lunch time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but let me check whether I’ve got what you have got in front of 
you, what exhibit is the one, is that one that you have got? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   The file of Marsden I believe it’s U10, U11. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not have any file marked Exhibit U11 or U11, I’ve got one 
marked Exhibit U10, or Volume 10. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   If you look at the spine. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh this is the one, okay, okay, I think it’s because it wasn’t drawn to 
my attention and I think I’m hearing about U11 for the first time, so we should mark it 
Exhibit U. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   It is marked at the back and you remember you 
requested that there should be ...(intervention) 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 89 of 204 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I am happy to see it’s beginning to happen. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If all of them including those that are at home can be marked like that 
I would be grateful. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   And together with that file you will see a ring-bound 
bundle, that one that you are having. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   That’s a transcript of Mr Marsden’s evidence before the 
portfolio committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   We would like you to have it at hand because at some 
point depending on his answers we may have to remind him about what he said to the 
Portfolio Committee.   Mr Marsden I can fairly and comfortably welcome you by saying 
good afternoon. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Good afternoon. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Can I make sure ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  He might have to look at his watch too.  Yes, you may proceed. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Marsden the investigators of this 
Commission asked you to prepare a statement for the purposes of your oral testimony 
to this Commission, correct 
20 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   And you’ve had some discussions which ultimately led 
to a statement that you prepared and signed on Monday, this Monday, this past 
Monday. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think it was Tuesday but yes, it was yesterday. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 90 of 204 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Tuesday yes.  Accompanying your statement that you 
signed on Tuesday was a set of annexures, correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   And they too were put in a bundle by attorneys 
representing you, that’s Werksmans Attorneys.  
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That’s correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   All of those documents are now before you and they 
have been placed before the Chairperson as exhibit U11.  You have had an occasion to 
look and relook and reread the statement correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   And do you confirm that that statement correctly reflects 
your recollection of the events relating to your functions and duties as a business 
rescue practitioner for Optimum Coal Holdings and Optimum Coal Mine Pty Limited. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I do yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes.  Is there anything that you would like to reflect on 
the contents of the statements before we start with your evidence, or are you fairly 
comfortable that it represents the truth to the best of your recollection.  
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I’m fairly comfortable yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Right, I would then ask you to go to page 1 and ask you 
something about your background which is not there, you record in paragraph 1 that 
20 
you are a chartered accountant, correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  When did you qualify? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I qualified in 1998 and then I did my articles so it 
would have been 2001, 2002 around there. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 91 of 204 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And when did you complete your articles? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  In 2001. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And thereafter? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Thereafter I did a brief stint with Deloitte in the US 
and then I came back and effectively worked for a number of different organisations 
principally in the distressed business environment prior to and subsequent to the 
promulgation of the new Companies Act which obviously then included the business 
rescue as a further tool for assisting distressed companies. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, it’s a new chapter in the Companies Act.   
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   When did you yourself become listed or registered with 
CIPIC as a Business Rescue Practitioner?   
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Pretty soon after the promulgations, I think it was 
effective in 2011, so in probably the five or six months after the Act became effective. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Your know Mr Pieter van den Steen? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I do yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In what capacity? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  He is a fellow and co practitioner and he was a co-
practitioner on both OCH as well OCM. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So you jointly worked together in trying to rescue 
20 
both those companies. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That’s correct yes.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, when did you start with your functions and duties 
as the BRP for these two entities, taking back in time. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So our effective appointment date is detailed in the 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 92 of 204 
 
file according to my recollection I think it was early in August of 2015 and effective from 
the registering of those particular documents at the CIPC, our appointment as Business 
Rescue Practitioners is effective immediately thereafter. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You can go to page 2 of your statement and look at 
paragraph 5. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes on the 4th of August. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The 4th August, right. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  At that point in time there had been some developments 
between Optimum Coal Holdings and Optimum Coal Mine on the one hand and Eskom 
10 
on the other, which led to the decision of those two entities to initiate the business 
rescue proceedings.  I take it that you are aware of those developments.  
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Part and parcel of them involved the decision by 
Eskom’\s then acting Chief Executive Officer to impose and require penalties in the 
order of R2.1billion to be paid by Optimum Coal Mine to Eskom. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, and once you took over as a Business Rescue 
Practitioner you had a fair sense of what the financial condition including the assets and 
liabilities of Optimum Coal Mine were, correct? 
20 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes, correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Give us a sense of what you discovered immediately 
after you and Mr van den Steen took over? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think what was apparent and maybe if we can just 
deal with it in two parts, first of all that OCM and secondly OCH given that they are 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 93 of 204 
 
different legal entities with different perspectives.  At OCM we found as you’ve alluded 
to that there was a contract with Eskom at the point in time it was to all intents and 
purposes the sole customer of the Optimum Coal Mine, there was a long-term 
agreement in place and the company was experiencing significant cash losses on a 
monthly basis, essentially it was selling coal to the tune of approximately R150 per ton 
delivered and its production costs, it’s cost of production were about R430 to R450 per 
ton, so rather substantial losses.  It had exhausted all of its internal resources, and it 
therefore relied extensively on its shareholder in order to continue to survive and 
continue to meet its obligations.   
 
It’s immediate shareholder was Optimum Coal Holdings so perhaps if I can 
10 
address that next, this as the name suggests was a holding company, it had no 
operations, no employees, no creditors other than a banking facility and – so Optimum 
Coal Holdings existed as the Holding company for several entities of which Optimum 
Coal Mine was one and in addition to the bank debt that sat at Optimum Coal Holdings 
it had signed a guarantee for the obligations of OCM to Eskom. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But it too at a point in time was in business rescue? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  As a result, as a direct result of the guarantee. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Ja, and therefore a company in business rescue cannot 
look into another in business rescue to assist it, financially at least? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Well I think not only would it be difficult for a 
20 
company to justify supporting a company that’s clearly financially distressed, the 
guarantee essentially made it as a co-principal debtor on the hook for the obligations of 
OCM and as a result the R2.1billion fine that you alluded to from a legal point of view 
could then be applied either to OCM or to alternatively to OCH. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I would like to fast track that part of your evidence 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 94 of 204 
 
because it is really common cause.   
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Where I wanted to get to was to try and understand 
whether or not you had an appreciation of the extent of the loss by OCM, that is the 
mining entity at that point in time.  We heard evidence from amongst others Mr Clinton 
Ephron, I take it you know him. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes I do. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That the extent of the loss was in the order of 
R150million. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  It would certainly be that amount, absolutely. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So the R2.1billion penalty that were imposed had a 
significant impact on the financial condition of Optimum Coal Mine in two respects, 
correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can you identify those respects for us? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So I think the most obvious one is a demand for 
R2.1billion, ie it would have had to find the means to settle that initial fine and the 
second and perhaps more significant issue is that following through on the application 
of that fine, so the fine was retrospectively looking historic deliveries of product that had 
already happened and where the coal had been consumed by Eskom, but applying that 
20 
methodology in terms of the contract going forward would have meant that the coal that 
was previously supplied at 150 would effectively have had to be supplied at R1 per ton, 
thereby greatly increasing the already quite substantial losses on a monthly basis. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can I ask you to pause there and just clarify two things, 
so as you come in around August 2015 there is at least an accounting liability of 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 95 of 204 
 
R2.1billion arising from the penalties correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I mean I think it would be a contingent liability 
because there were certainly grounds on which the claim could have been opposed.  
So I mean whether one would accrue it as a full liability, probably unlikely, but most 
definitely given that papers had been prepared I would certainly suggest a contingent 
liability. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Of course, but in account terms you have to account for 
it contingent liability, you can’t ignore it. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  You certainly can’t ignore it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  And then from that point on, August 2015 going 
10 
forward there was also another contingent liability that you had to account for, that is 
the effect of the penalties on the stockpile of coal Optimum was required to supply to 
Eskom on a month to month basis, correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely, to the extent that Eskom wished to 
pursue that interpretation of the contract you are absolutely correct there would have 
been an obligation to supply at R1 per ton for the remainder of the contract or until such 
time as it was outside of the sort of claim of penalty. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN: But you are correct in terms of the forward looking 
loss would have been a liability that anybody looking to acquire that or looking to fund 
20 
that business would have had to understand quite intimately.  
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, and as you have indicated Eskom was the primary 
if not the sole client of Optimum Coal Mine in the country? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That’s correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So it means that the condition you found the mine at that 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 96 of 204 
 
point in time is that it would not have earned any significant income from the supply of 
coal to Eskom, instead it will continue to suffer a loss. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  And an ever increasing loss given the application of 
the 150 to one yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  I don’t know whether you will be able to do the 
mathematics for us but on your approach the CSA required Optimum Coal Mine to 
supply at a price of R150 per ton, on your calculation it would be required to supply that 
stockpile of coal for R1 per ton, so the losses would be around R149 per ton for each 
stockpile. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Well the losses will be a lot more than that because 
10 
the cost of production were 40, so the additional losses would have been the 150 to the 
one, so if one were to calculate the total losses it would have been the obligation to 
supply once again I hope my maths is reasonable, approximately 5.5million tons per 
annum, in agreement in terms of contract, at the cost of production given that your 
revenue would be R1, so that would be in the region of R450 per ton multiplied by five 
million tons. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So it’s about R449 per ton. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct, a number of billion I think in my rough 
calculation probably in the region of R2billion. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright, we will work with that number.  What did do 
20 
when you realised that that was the scope and scale of the financial condition of 
Optimum Mine when you took over. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So I think there were a number of things, one of the 
requirements from a practitioner is to investigate the affairs that involved trying to get 
an understanding of some of the history of that contract, some of the aspects that 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 97 of 204 
 
occurred prior to business rescue, but certainly what became very apparent is that any 
solution and any tools that a practitioner would have in order to try and advance the 
business rescue would require the cooperation, assistance of Eskom as well.  So one 
of the first things that we did was attempt to engage with Eskom around a number of 
items, number one some form of an interim supply in which we could continue to meet 
those obligations through an interim period and then second of all to try and find a long-
term solution which would have resulted in a more sustainable business for the mine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  You indicate that Eskom was critical to any 
prospects of rehabilitating the financial ill-health of Optimum Coal Mine, and you do of 
course know that the connection between Optimum Coal Mine and Eskom at that point 
10 
in time was the agreement to supply coal, called CSA, the long-term supply agreement. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It’s common ground and I’m sure you know that all 
things being equal that agreement would have come to an end around 31 st of  
December 2018. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So by the time you came in it had a lifespan remaining 
of three years. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That’s correct ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Did you have occasion to look at how that agreement in 
20 
its terms up to the second or third Addendum at that point in time impacted on the 
ability of Optimum  Coal Mine to financially rehabilitate itself. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely and I think some of this ground has been 
traversed by other witnesses, but certainly there were a number of aspects of that 
contract.  The first was that there was always the intention that there would have been 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 98 of 204 
 
some element of cross-subsidisation, you know it was a big mine, it was able to 
generate more production than simply the obligation to supply Eskom, so there was 
certainly an ability to cross-subsidise the same coal by exporting that, and then 
obviously using the profitable portion of the mine to subsidise the non-profitable portion 
of the mine.  Unfortunately when we arrived there the coal price was at an extremely 
depressed state and there was no export coal being produced.  The second aspect is 
that that contract escalated at a particular rate and in reality the escalations of the cost 
of production had for some time exceeded the anticipated escalation in terms of the 
contract, so there was effectively a point at which those costs had simply escalated 
beyond what the increase was determined to be in the contract was well. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair Mr Marsden deals with that issue of the impact of 
the CSA on page 4 paragraph 13 of your statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Having gained a picture of what animal you were 
dealing with you began to take processes to try and see whether there would be some 
hope to save it by beginning with engagements with Eskom, correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That’s correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You detailed those engagements from page 5, 
paragraph 15. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes, so we attempted on numerous occasions to 
20 
meet at the appropriate levels within the Eskom and we were able to do that after some 
time, as we mentioned we were appointed on the 4th and almost immediately 
afterwards we would have attempted to make contact with them.  We were finally able 
to get an engagement with Eskom on the 17th, as detailed on page 5 and it really as an 
open invitation to Eskom that we were independent parties, we were here to attempt to 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 99 of 204 
 
find a solution to a challenge that was both  a concern I would have thought for Eskom 
as well as for shareholders and creditors of OCM. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Who initiated the meeting of 17 August 2015? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  We would have initiated it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And who from the side of Eskom attended that meeting? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  As far as I can recall it was attended by Ayanda 
Nteta, by Matshela Koko, by myself, by my fellow practitioner by tele-conference and I 
think that Jabu may have been there as well. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Who was Jabu? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  He was I think at the time the acting head of 
10 
Primary Energy. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  I’m sure there were discussions that were held 
at that meeting, I would like to ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, what was Jabu’s surname? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  It’s just not coming to me right now, but I’m sure I 
can get you the details of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, well I hope we will remember so that we can refer to him properly, 
not just as Jabu. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, I don’t know but you’re right, we will ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  This is not right, ja. 
20 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes sir. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What was the upshot of that meeting? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So I think the purpose of that meeting was to 
discuss the business rescue, what the potential impact of what the process was like, as 
well as to attempt to open discussions with Eskom around a possible renegotiation of 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 100 of 204 
 
the Coal Supply Agreement in order to avoid a liquidation which is really the alternative 
if there is not a solution to finding a business rescue solution. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  But what happened, I mean did you meet each 
other or was there no specific outcome? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  There was no positive outcome, the sense that we 
got from the meeting was that Eskom and OCM and OCH had a very strained 
relationship and certainly we found Eskom to be relatively cold to our advances in 
terms of attempting to find a solution. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In paragraph 16 you say that Eskom was unwilling to 
commence negotiations with OCM. 
10 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN: That’s correct yes.  
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What led you to believe that Eskom was not willing to 
engage with OCM? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I mean we had made numerous attempts to meet 
with them, we had finally got to the point where we did have a meeting, and as you 
pointed out there were really no clear points of going forward points determined at that 
meeting.  We certainly didn’t get the view that the urgency that is placed on us as 
practitioners was necessarily reciprocated by Eskom and we were not able to get to the 
point of a forum in which we could commence the negotiations. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe Mr Maleka let’s revisit Mr Marsden when I said that it’s not 
right to just refer to him as Jabu, whoever the person is, I didn’t meant that you 
intended anything negative, it’s just that because these are formal proceedings, it’s 
better to refer to people as Mr So and So, Ms So and So, Dr So and So, Professor 
whatever and in the past there have been witnesses who because of their relationship 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 101 of 204 
 
with the person sometimes just called the name but I think certainly from the evidence 
leaders side and from my side we have tried to use their surnames because it’s the 
right way for this kind of forum.  So I just want you to know that I am not necessarily 
saying you used Jabu because you intended anything negative. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  And I must apologise to the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, that’s fine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair the mistake is with us, we did not forewarn Mr 
Marsden about the customary formalities of these proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, no that’s fine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Let me take the apology. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that’s fine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  For him, let me make the apology for him.  Mr Marsden I 
mean once you realised that they had, there was no productive engagement with 
Eskom you did something. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  As the managers for the time being of Optimum Coal 
Mine. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely one of the key features of business 
rescue is the ability to suspend obligations of contract, so certainly that is one of the 
most powerful tools in the business rescue practitioner’s toolkit.  It’s not something that 
20 
one does lightly, it’s not something that one does in haste, however we elected to use 
that mechanism on Eskom and we effectively terminated or suspended the Coal Supply 
Agreement which we obliged us to supply coal at that rate to Eskom. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, and you relied on the provisions of Section 
136(2)(a) of the Companies Act. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 102 of 204 
 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:   That’s correct, so that sits within the Business 
Rescue Chapter 6 legislation and is available only to Business Rescue Practitioners.  
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, yes, what did you hope to achieve by suspending 
the supply of coal to Eskom? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think a number of things, I mentioned the word 
urgency and we touched it in our papers and we haven’t discussed it necessarily here 
today but the time constraints placed on us as practitioners in terms of the Act are 
pretty clear, where a plan has to be published within five weeks, but more importantly 
given the losses that were being made we didn’t have the  luxury of time so certainly in 
order to create some urgency and to get the attention of Eskom, certainly that was an 
10 
intention, and I think it also sought to perhaps illustrate that we did not have an open 
chequebook in terms of which we as practitioners could continue to incur losses, that’s 
not our mandate, our mandate is to restructure and to resuscitate a business and we 
certainly could not sustain that for any period of time. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, as I recall in terms of the new Companies Act you 
had a period of three months to formulate  business rescue plan, correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  It’s actually shorter than that, it’s a period of 25 
days in which you have to publish a plan for consideration for creditors.  The three 
months is if it’s not been concluded, ie the plan presented, adopted and implemented 
within three months there’s a whole bunch of regulatory items, so the timeline is even 
20 
more compressed than the three months.  
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, so you still had time by the time you suspended 
coal supply to formulate a plan. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:   Absolutely, but very little.  
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Little, and you say that you informed Eskom about the 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 103 of 204 
 
suspension of coal supplied to it and Chair you will find a reference to the letter from 
the business practitioners to Eskom referred to in paragraph 16 on page 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It is PMM7 and you will find it at page 64.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You are aware of it Mr Marsden, can I just highlight 
some few aspects of this letter.  Are you at page 64? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I am indeed. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Who is it addressed to? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So it is addressed to Mr Koko and to Mr Mboweni 
10 
and I must now extend my apologies further to the Commission, that is the gentleman 
to whom I referred to earlier, it’s Mr Vusi Mboweni was at that private meeting, my 
apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the one in respect of whom you used the name Jabu? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct, my apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the name was a mistake. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  It was a complete mistake of mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair I did not know someone Jabu so at least the 
confusion is cleared now.  But it is also copied to someone else, who is it? 
20 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So it is copied in the cc to Ayanda Nteta who was 
also present at that previous meeting as well as to the legal advisors, Cliffe Dekker 
Hofmeyr for the attention of Rishiban Moodley. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, one of these addressees were not new to you, y9ou 
had met them at the meeting of the 17th of August.  You say something in paragraph 4 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 104 of 204 
 
which is quite interesting, you refer to the Cooperation Agreement which was previously 
concluded between the parties on the 23rd of May 2014, do you see that? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes indeed. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Did you have occasion to look at the terms of that 
Cooperation Agreement? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you know the background to it? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I do. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It related to the suspension of an arbitration between the 
OCM entities and Eskom relating to what was declared as a hardship… 
10 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  By OCM? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Arising from difficulties relating to the cost of operating 
that mine, correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN: That is correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So that agreement was raising something that you too 
had concern about relating to the CSA and its impact on the ability of the mine to run 
profitably? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely and certainly that informed a lot of our 
20 
decision making going forward in that there was and had been prior to business rescue 
an attempt to resolve this and I think a lot of good work and a lot of good time had been 
expended by both OCM not in business rescue as well as Eskom in terms of trying to 
determine a solution.  So certainly a reliance to a certain degree on that was something 
that we – that we placed in terms of the fact that both parties had attempted 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 105 of 204 
 
unfortunately not succeeded but attempted to restructure the agreement and there was 
certainly a history between the parties in that context. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The impression I gain from your evidence is that it must 
have been clear to both parties to the contract what the drastic impact of the CSA was 
on the ability of OCM to supply coal to Eskom? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  It was apparent and I think even more so in the 
context of business rescue.  I cannot imagine a multinational like Glencore would take a 
decision lightly to put one its subsidiaries in that hands of an independent party in the 
context of insolvency as well.  So not only were the numbers apparent but I think the 
context of actually you know putting the company in business rescue just really 
10 
illustrates the point even more clearly. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I also gain the impression that it must have been clear to 
you as the manager for the time being and also Eskom as the client of the entity you 
were managing that there was a risk of not procuring a security of supply of the coal to 
Eskom because of those difficulties you have explained? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely and I think business rescue in some 
terminology a purgatory right where you are in the last chance saloon and to the event 
– in the event that we were unable to procure funding to continue the business rescue 
and or we failed to find a solution to the business rescue.  There is a positive obligation 
in the business rescue section of the Company’s Act that requires a practitioner in the 
20 
event that he believes that there is no longer a viable option to rescue the company to 
place it into business rescue.  So it is kind of an iterative test that one goes through 
throughout a business rescue process to the extent that you ever reach the conclusion 
that there is no longer a reasonable prospect of rescuing that business.  A practitioner 
is obliged to place a company into liquidation the consequence of course of that being 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 106 of 204 
 
that there would no longer be supply to Eskom. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Even before the prospect of litigation became real or 
likely it seems to me that at that point in time the parties must have appreciated the risk 
to one another relating to the difficulties posed by the CSA? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  I pose these questions to you now because later 
on we will canvass correspondence emanating from Eskom showing that they 
appreciated the strategic importance of Optimum Coal Mine as a useful asset to supply 
coal and secure security of supply to Hendrina. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Are you aware of that? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Also for the supply of coal and to secure security of 
supply to Arnot Power Station? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  At this stage in the business rescue there was no 
supply going to Arnot from this power station so certainly its proximity to the Arnot 
Power Station if the mine’s proximity to the Arnot Power Station would have made it 
potentially compatible but at this point in time it was supply solely to the Hendrina 
Power Station. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You can accept? 
20 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And the Chairperson has heard evidence that from 
around December 2015, January 2016 coal from Optimum Coal. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Was bought and traded to Eskom for the supply of Arnot 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 107 of 204 
 
Power Station? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I am aware of that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You are aware of those things? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And there were presentations made by executives of 
Eskom about the strategic importance of Optimum Coal’s coal from Optimum Mine to 
Arnot, are you aware of those representations? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  No I am not aware of internal activities or 
representations. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Well I will take you through them yes.  But what I find 
10 
surprising is this is would those risks appreciated by the parties you could not find one 
another. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  We could not. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  From your perspective why was it so difficult to find one 
another because this seems to be something which the parties had to work jointly with 
the view to find a compromised position? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think that we attempted and it is certainly in the 
documents to provide a number of different solutions.  Certainly my experience has 
been previously even if a solution is unacceptable to another party there is some level 
of back and fro, some level of counter proposal.  Eskom’s position was steadfast and 
20 
unmoving with regards to the fact that they had a contract until the end of 2018 and that 
they expected that contract word and verse to be delivered on throughout the time from 
2015 all the way until the end of 2018.  And throughout the process that was their red 
line.  There was not movement on that particular issue. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. One of the issues you proposed to Eskom is the 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 108 of 204 
 
prospects of an interim agreement to supply? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you propose that option in paragraph 7 on page 65 
of the letter we are looking at.  Are you there? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes I am. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can you just indicate to us what led you to make this 
proposal? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Historically the mine had been funded by its 
shareholder.  Within business rescue that option is not necessarily guaranteed and one 
is required to fund those losses by means of post commencement finance and in the 
10 
absence of that whether I wanted to or not I simply could not continue to incur those 
losses I would have run out of cash.  So we had put together a proposal whereby 
effectively for an interim period whilst we were attempting to find a solution there would 
be an interim arrangement which would see that security of supply guaranteed whilst 
negotiations continued.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you in that letter annex a copy of the proposed 
interim agreement, correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair we have looked at this at some point but look the 
terms of the interim agreement mirror aspects of the fourth addendum. 
20 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That was in a draft form but rejected by Eskom? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes that is right. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  And in paragraph 8 of your letter again at page 65 
you say that Eskom was not moved to consider that interim proposal correct? 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 109 of 204 
 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I would like to – you to reflect on this.  I mean Eskom is 
now facing a clear decision by you that you are not going to supply coal correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think more than that the decision has been made 
and the conveyor belts at this point had actually stopped delivering coal. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So there was no supply of coal at all to … 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  We suspended the obligations and switched off the 
conveyor belts. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  And that is the operation of the law. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And yet they insist that you should comply with the CSA 
which on practical terms has been suspended? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  How can you comply with something that by law has 
been suspended? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think their intention was that to the extent that the 
resupply commenced any solution to the business rescue would have required the CSA 
to remain intact.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No but you have already suspended. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The agreement and you entitled to do so by law? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  How can they insist then that you should supply when 
by law the agreement has been suspended? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  They could not insist.  What happened subsequent 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 110 of 204 
 
to that was a meeting was called by Eskom and I think you certainly covered it with Mr 
Ephron’s… 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Well we can go back. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I was merely sitting outside but and I am not sure 
what clause it is but the – the intention of the suspension certainly worked in that we 
then were able to get an engagement with Eskom at the highest level. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  As a matter of sequence. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Let me take you back to your statement on page 5.  
Remember you suspended and on your approach the conveyor belts were shut around 
10 
the 20th August 2015.   
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you say as a result of that suspension there was a 
meeting convened by Eskom and you refer to that meeting in paragraph 17 of your 
statement. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So there must have been a period of about 13 days 
during which there was no supply of coal to Eskom? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I cannot remember the exact days but absolutely 
there was a period and that appears to be the correct period. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Do you know where Hendrina would have obtained 
its coal during that period? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  They would have had a modest amount of coal 
available on stock piles already delivered to themselves and they would have then been 
able to truck in from third parties suppliers as well which they certainly did. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 111 of 204 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We have evidence to show that third party suppliers 
were at rates higher than those that Optimum Coal supplied to Hendrina. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That would not surprise me. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  Chair you would recall that Mr Opperman 
referred to a short term agreement and the rates that we explored with him were fairly 
higher. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But you are not aware of them but you would not be 
surprised? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Not in the slightest. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  What happened at the meeting of 3 September? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I am loathed to call myself a participant in the 
meeting. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Well just take us through what happened.  We know that 
the meeting called by Eskom who attended? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So a meeting was called. I received the phone call 
from the chief executive Mr Molefe for a meeting at Megawatt Park.  I was invited as 
was Mr Van Den Steen my co-practitioner and I was requested to ensure that Mr 
Ephron was invited as well.  So we were invited up the executive section of Eskom at 
which point … 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The third floor of Megawatt Park? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Indeed yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  And we were enjoying some good coffee outside 
there when Mr Ephron was called to a meeting and myself and Mr Van Den Steen were 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 112 of 204 
 
left drinking coffee outside. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You were invited to a meeting and you do not attend the 
meeting? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Why not? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  We were not sure if the meeting that was happening 
in our absence was perhaps a pre-meeting or that we would be invited at some point in 
time.  That did not happen and so it was most unusual. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And what happened after the meeting between the 
executives of Eskom Mr Molefe and Mr Ephron took place? 
10 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Mr Ephron came out and told us that the meeting 
was finished. We then left the building and either on the way out or immediately 
afterwards outside Mr Ephron recorded to us what had happened at the meeting and 
essentially he would need to get consent from his stakeholders but essentially if 
Glencore were prepared to fund the losses on an interim basis would we as 
practitioners agree to recommence the supply on a couple of – with – on an interim 
basis with a couple of key factors.  Number 1 the price would not be at the stated R1,00 
but more like the R150,00 that it was originally.  Eskom had defaulted on two months’ 
worth of previous payments.  There was a condition that they needed to pay that 
amount and then the payment terms were changed from I think 30 days statement to 
20 
effectively every 7 days. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You were not at that meeting. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Mr Ephron tells you what was agreed at that meeting. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 113 of 204 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And after you gained a sense of what happened you put 
in writing your understanding of what was agreed and sent your letter to Eskom? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And Chair that is all dealt with at page 6 paragraph 19 
and the letter of Mr Marsden and his colleagues – his colleague are at – is at page 74 
and 75.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You have had a chance to look at this letter, correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And it sets out what was supposed to be an agreement 
10 
at the meeting between Mr Molefe and Mr Ephron. Was there any comeback from 
Eskom to say what you had put in writing was not a correct reflection of what was 
agreed at that meeting? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Not as far as I can recall. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Not as far as you are aware.  So on that premise that 
those would be the terms of the interim agreement what happened thereafter? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So the interim agreement had a very important 
condition or several important conditions.  One was the resupply and so just from an 
operational perspective we again began to supply the Hendrina Power Station.  The 
most important aspect from our perspective was that the parties would give one another 
20 
sixty days to commence and hopefully conclude good faith negotiations on a longer 
term solution i.e. beyond the interim sixty agreement. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So you supplied and were you paid? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you say in paragraph 20 of your statement that 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 114 of 204 
 
Eskom began to engage earnestly with the difficulties of Optimum Coal Mine by calling 
for information relating to its financial condition. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I am not sure if I said they engaged earnestly but 
certainly they began to engage.  Well principally at the start with request for financial 
information pertaining to the costs of the operation. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But did you doubt their good faith when they began to 
call for information from Optimum Coal Mine? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think we had the seeds of doubt given that this 
information had been extensively audited by Eskom themselves prior to business 
rescue.  I think we heard testimony yesterday I was – happened to be in the room for 
10 
Mr Opperman who conceded that both Nedbank and another sort of consulting 
company had been provided and gone through this information so we thought that 
whilst it was positive to now have some engagement we certainly had a concern that 
there was a lot of redundancy in terms of information that had already been provided 
but regardless we provided it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  But you not suggesting that Eskom was playing 
marbles when it called for this information? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Let us give them the benefit of the doubt. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  I am sure you provided that information. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  We did. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What was the next phase of the development relating to 
the negotiations? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So in parallel to the negotiations we had received 
an unsolicited bid for the business and we received several of these throughout the 
process so we were not certainly running a formal process to solicit bids but we 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 115 of 204 
 
received on the 10 September just going chronologically in terms of the statement a 
unsolicited non-binding offer from Oakbay Investments. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Chair that was what was referred to as he first 
offer.  The first of Tegeta offer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We have looked at it I do not think that we should waste 
time and burden the record by considering it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no it is not necessary. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  We have heard evidence on it.  What did you do 
once you received that offer? 
10 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  As I said it was already in parallel with our 
engagements with Eskom so we – we were not really considering the sale of OCM at 
that point in time we were focussed on the engagement with Eskom and you know we 
kind of not treated it with it glibly but we did not consider it in much detail.  Our focus 
was very much on the Eskom renegotiation. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  One thing that is interesting from your perspective 
of what that offer said is the statement you make in paragraph 22 of your affidavit.  It is 
last statement where you say that the offeror at the time indicated amongst others that 
it was confident it would be able to secure Eskom’s consent to the transaction, correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes that is right. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You know that under the original CSA as amended by 
the first to the third addenda. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Eskom was entitled to consent or refuse consent for the 
session. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 116 of 204 
 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Of that contract. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Ja I believe they had change of control provisions 
as well. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So they were certainly as I mentioned right at the 
start an absolutely fundamental player in any business rescue context. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What I find interesting with this offer is that it indicates to 
you upfront that the potential buyer would be able to secure the consent of Eskom.  
How did you consider that expression of confidence for the buyer and I will tell you why 
10 
I am asking this question. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You know that another bidder also sought to establish 
whether Eskom would consent and Eskom indicated that it would not. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Ja we saw this as really a response to one of our 
conditions in terms of any transaction that we believed would require a consent so 
certainly we stated that one of the objectives to any offer would be that they would need 
to get Eskom’s consent.  So I think this was a reply to the terms and conditions that we 
had done. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  They were at the time a supplier of Eskom’s through 
the Brakfontein operations so we certainly knew that they had a relationship with 
Eskom and as a result to the extent that Eskom was going to consent perhaps you 
know they were already a known quantity. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can I follow up if you do not mind? 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 117 of 204 
 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Of course. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Pembani was one of the entities that was interested in 
making an offer to buy this mine, correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And Pembani was no stranger because it was… 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely not. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Pembani was part and parcel Optimum Coal Mine, 
correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct they were minority shareholders. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It was supplying to Eskom 
10 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is right. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So they cannot be a point of distinction in that regard as 
between Pembani and Tegeta, correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think there is a slight nuance here in that Tegeta 
were confident that they would get Eskom’s consent.  I think at the point that we initially 
engaged with Pembani they too were confident that they would get Eskom’s consent.  I 
think whether they did or did not is ultimately where the test lies. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Well that is important because Tegeta was quite 
confident well before the consent provisions were triggered and ultimately it got 
consent.  Pembani was frustrated by lack of consent.  
20 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Sure. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Are you able to explain the precipitous expression of 
confidence and the ultimately procurement of that confidence? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I am not able to explain it no. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Well I suggest to you that is because Tegeta was given 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 118 of 204 
 
favourable treatment from beginning to the end. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I would agree with that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Can I take you then to paragraph 23 of your 
statement? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Where you deal with the terms of the letter dated 17 
September 2015.  Chair you will find that letter as PMM14 it is at page 101. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That letter is written by CDH do you see that? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Sorry the… 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Page 101. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Ja our offer is 13 their response is 14 you are right 
yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  And that is a letter from CDH, correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Just to explain to us why did CDH write that letter to you 
and your colleague? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So if take you back to the minutes they were 
recorded as acting for Eskom.  They received that pack of information that Eskom had 
requested so we kind of engaging either lawyers of practitioners directly to them.  We 
20 
had provided that information in – earlier on in the month and then after an appropriate 
amount of time we had proposes a solution and this letter is in response that proposed 
solution. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and it is quite clear from the legal representatives of 
Eskom that they rejected your proposal? 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 119 of 204 
 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely and I think what is important is there is 
no counter proposal or any stipulation on the way forward. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  You record in paragraph 24 I am at page 6 Chair 
page 8 I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Paragraph 24.  That the negotiations came to an end 
around 5 February 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  October? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I am sorry 5 October 2015. Do you see that? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes indeed. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What did you do after Eskom made it clear that it was 
not going to pursue further negotiations in terms of your proposal? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So I think what we had come to the conclusion of 
and going back to what the objectives of a business rescue are the objectives of a 
business rescue are to restructure a company its affairs etcetera and that envisaged to 
be a restructure of the legal entity and its contracting affairs.  What became apparent to 
us throughout this period was that there was clearly a history between the parties and 
to the context that Glencore was a shareholder we were unlikely to make any further 
headway with renegotiating this hearsay.  There was simply too much water under the 
bridge.  So going back to our business rescue we then proceeded to say well is the 
20 
next alternative to restructuring it and there is one more step prior to no alternatives 
being left which would have been a liquidation. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Which is an outright sale of the assets and that 
achieves the second category of business rescue which is a result better than a 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 120 of 204 
 
liquidation [indistinct] rescue. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So at that point in time we really back to the 
drawing board put a line through our attempts to renegotiate the CSA in the context of 
Glencore as a shareholder in context of the entities as they were and changed tact to a 
certain degree. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  But that too failed and the options were becoming 
narrower and narrower? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct.\ 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And in paragraph 25 you say that one of the options that 
10 
you considered in the narrow scope was a sale of the asset? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And what happened to that option?  I mean did you 
trigger it or? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So I think we advised Eskom that we had a number 
of options.  The first was the sale of OCM to a third party. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  The second was the sale OCM to Eskom 
themselves. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  And the third was the sale of OCM to a third party 
but via a competitive process.  The distinction being the first and third being one was a 
kind of bilateral discussion whereas the third we would have effectively solicited bids on 
an open basis as a distinction between options one and three there. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 121 of 204 
 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  We indicated that we had received an expression of 
interest and from a party which would have fitted into that first category a bilateral 
discussion. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  And that was once again as mentioned the Oakbay 
offer. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  And those options were communicated to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it is time. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  My apologies Chair.  I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you did not keep an [indistinct] 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I was disorientated by the fact that we started late when 
I thought we started early. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  We are going to take the lunch adjournment and resume at two.  
We adjourn. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Maleka you may proceed. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Marsden we were at PMM17 page 
106 where you informed Eskom of the various options available to you as the BRPs, 
20 
but before you return to it can I ask you to page back to 101? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes, I am there. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You have already indicated this is the letter from CDH 
responding your request for negotiations and the various options? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes.  Can I? 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 122 of 204 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  [Intervenes]. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Sorry. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Go ahead. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Ja.  I think it is important to highlight kind of what I 
had mentioned previously about Eskom’s position with regards to in particular the 
penalty. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  And I think that perhaps Clause 2.2 really highlights 
it as clear as one can which I will read.  It says: 
“The penalty claim is not negotiable and it should be settled in 
10 
full and without any delay.” 
So it really just highlights as I have said previously Eskom’s kind of unmoving position 
towards that particular aspect. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you said unmoving that is just another way of saying they 
were rigid.  Is that right? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  They were completely rigid, absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and this reflects exactly that attitude? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Can you also deal with 2.1, because it 
reinforces that conclusion? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  “Any discussion and negotiation on the 
new contract price for coal to the Hendrina Power Station will 
only be considered closer to 2017 and not at the stage prior.” 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 123 of 204 
 
So yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  On the two issues both the CSA and the penalty. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  Thanks for that clarification.  Let us go to the 
letter that you sent to Eskom when it became clear that there was no room for 
negotiations.  There is PMM17 Chair at page 106.  Remember by this time there is no 
room. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Remember by this time there is no room for negotiation.  
Correct. 
10 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Ja.  Deal with those options. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So essentially we presented three options.  One 
was the sale of OCM to a third party.  We disclosed that we did have an indicative offer.  
The second was a slightly out of the box consideration which was the sale of OCM to 
Eskom themselves given how important the supplier was and third was the sale of OCM 
to a third party.  The contrast as I mentioned previously to item one being that through a 
competitive process i.e. to take the time to engage advisors to prepare a data, a due 
diligence pack etcetera and effectively try and elicit bids in that manner as opposed to 
kind of unsolicited bids. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  I know that each of the options you explain is 
motivated by the ups and the down sides to it.  We do not have to go there.  What I 
want to understand is did Eskom respond to you about each of these options? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Not in as much detail as we would have liked or 
hoped.  I think certainly not formally I think at one point there was the infamous 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 124 of 204 
 
comment around option two where we do not want the bakery when we get the bread, 
but certainly as far as I recall there was no formal response to what we did in terms of 
that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What I find interesting is that the third of the three 
options you propose make it quite clear that the asset can be sold through a 
competitive dealing process and yet what happens thereafter is that there is a set of 
unsolicited bids. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is right. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Inconsistent with the proposal.  My sense is that the 
third option was imminently reasonable consistent with Eskom’s obligations to promote 
10 
a competitive procurement process.  Do not misunderstand me.  Understand that this 
was not an asset of Eskom, but Eskom had an interest in it. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So the third option was a fairly reasonable one 
[indistinct] of that to Eskom’s obligations.  The moment US Optimum begin to engage 
with unsolicited bids did you inform Eskom about them as and when they were coming 
through? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I do not recall the timing of when we did, but as they 
progressed to a point where we were comfortable that we could engage with Eskom we 
did that. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  Can I take you through to those unsolicited 
bids?  You address them from page 9. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Paragraph 28.1. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes.  I mean I will run through maybe as briefly as 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 125 of 204 
 
much detail as you want. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  We had received an offer from a company called 
Endalweni Mining Corporation and there was as I said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Did you change the page where we were?  
Did you move backwards or? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, we moved backwards to the statement Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the statement? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Ja, page 9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And Chair remember we have now established that 
negotiations are closed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We have now established that Mr Marsden set out the 
three options.  We have now established that Eskom did not meaningful engage with or 
respond to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  About those options. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Now we look at what he is doing. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In the light of Eskom’s non-responsive attitude. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So the first party in paragraph 28 is Endalweni 
Mining Corporation and there is quite extensive negotiation around the terms conditions 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 126 of 204 
 
etcetera and what would be acceptable to us.  Nothing really came of that.  I do not 
think that they were able to adequately satisfy ourselves that there was sufficient.  The 
second on which is the African Exploration Mining and Finance Corporation which is 
affected the state owned mining corporation. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Which state owned entity is that?  I mean. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I believe it sits, I stand under correction, but I 
believe it sits under the Department of Energy as an entity, but it is the state owned 
mining corporation.  I think it owns Alexkor amongst other assets. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Oh, I see.  Okay. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  They are currently the bidder in round two of 
10 
Optimum, its current business rescue.  So. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  For interest sake more than anything else. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where you reading from page 9? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes, I am. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought you said paragraph 48 and I cannot see 48 on my page 9. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Sorry, 28. 
CHAIRPERSON:  28, okay. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes, page 9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
20 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So obviously a prequalified candidate one would 
have assumed with the backing of the state, but they withdrew from the process for a 
number of reasons.  Amongst other that Eskom had requested it to record its intentions 
in respect of OCM and then they disappeared.  We had some meetings with a company 
called Joe Singh Group of Companies and after one meeting they too withdrew from 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 127 of 204 
 
the process and then perhaps the most relevant in 28.4 is with the Pembani Group of 
Companies which as you have mentioned was well known to not only us, but also to 
Eskom.  They were a minority shareholder in Optimum Coal Holdings and we actually 
got to the point where we signed a term sheet with them and effectively afforded them 
the opportunity to exclusively look at the accusation of OCM. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and I mean Pembani knew the asset very well, all 
things being equal. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Very well yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  They had dealt with the asset since they became the 
shareholder in 20, I think 2012 if I am not mistaken. 
10 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I assume that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Sometime prior to business rescue. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But anyway you indicate in 28.4 that Eskom indicated its 
unwillingness to support the Pembani bid. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So we engaged with Pembani directly and then they 
had an engagement with Eskom. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  We were obviously not party to that engagement, 
but they did record that in a letter to us which is annexure sometime after they had 
20 
withdrawn from the transaction.  So we were not immediately aware of why they had 
withdrawn.  That only became apparent when they issued us that letter some few 
months later. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair the letter is at page 133. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 128 of 204 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You have read the letter.  I am not going to ask you to 
deal with it, but the point is that Eskom was not willing to support that deal.  Correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely.  I mean it is quite clear in the second to 
last paragraph: 
“Eskom was not prepared to amend the OCM Coal Supply 
Agreement or waive its right to enforce the claim under the 
Coal Supply Agreement.” 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Did they explain to you why Eskom was not willing 
to support their bid? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  They did not. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then in paragraph 29 you deal with the only 
remaining. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Bid. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes.  I think importantly to note that when we 
contracted with Pembani we did it on an exclusive basis. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So we had at that point in time told the Oakbay to 
get a consortium that we had found an offer that we thought was more appropriate and 
we had terminated discussions.  When that transaction failed we were then left 
20 
effectively to revert back to the last remaining bidder in terms of the unsolicited 
process. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then the bid was made through KPMG of course. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 129 of 204 
 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is right. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And we know that KPMG were the statutory auditors of 
the Oakbay Group of Companies.  Correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I believe so, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It was unsolicited, but what I want to establish from you 
is how did the statutory auditors get to know that this sale may well be up for sale? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think that the Optimum matter was quite widely 
publicised in the media.  We certainly did not go out with any formal announcement 
around the sale process.  So that aspect I cannot comment on, but as I am aware and 
as I am sure you are aware they were interested in acquiring the asset even prior to 
10 
business rescue. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I presume they thought the timing was appropriate. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then you responded to the KPMGs letter expressing 
the offer on behalf of Oakbay or Tegeta.  Correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You deal with your response in paragraph 32. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes that is right.  We were seeking quite a lot of 
clarification around the offer.  I think it is also important to note that at this stage, time I 
was wearing to hats.  One, as the OCH practitioner one, the OCM practitioner.  At this 
20 
point in time we were engaging merely around OCM.  As I said OCH was a non-trading 
company.  It did not have creditors and the stay that we had given from the moratorium 
effectively dealt with both the banks and Eskom’s potential claim.  So at this stage we 
were dealing very much in the OCM capacity.  So we sought to clarify a number of 
items specifically that OCT a sister or brother company i.e. owned by OCH would not 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 130 of 204 
 
form a part of this transaction. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  My recollection is that at that point in time OCH 
had several subsidiaries.  One was Optimum Coal Mine. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Next was OCT. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And the last was Koornfontein? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct.  There were a couple of smaller. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Others? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Others, but yes those are three main subsidiaries of 
10 
OCH. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  The offer that you were engaging with at that point 
in time, the Tegeta offer, to which subsidiary did it relate, I mean? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  It related exclusively to the OCM, the mine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The mine only? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  The mine only. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright and that is a premise on which you engaged. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Whether. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is premise on which we had engaged the 
20 
previous buyers as well. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and then what was the response of KPMG insofar 
as you were dealing with that offer?  I mean did they come back to you to say look their 
client’s accept it or they reject it?  I am just trying to establish how far the negotiations 
progressed. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 131 of 204 
 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So we got to the point of a non-binding term sheet. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  After some correspondence which essentially 
sought where OCH would sell its shares and claims in OCM with a whole bunch of 
considerations.  The principle once again was Eskom’s consent, a due diligence period 
and there were a number of other ancillary sort of terms that had been agreed between 
the parties. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Do you remember what the purchase price was at that 
point in time? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  It was a R1. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  A R1? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Ja.  I think it, further to that there was some 
assumption of debt within OCM that had not yet been clarified that would be dealt with 
post due diligence, but essentially the value that OCH would receive for its shares 
claims would be R1. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  On the face of it, it looks for someone like me a 
laughable offer, but it was serious in the sense that they assume liabilities? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely.  I think that it would have to deal with 
the very present 2 billion or just north of that claim as well as of course the funding 
obligation going forward. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  The mine was still at that stage loss making to a 
considerable degree.  So if you buy an asset for a Rand there is generally a reason for 
it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And I would like you if you can take us through the 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 132 of 204 
 
financial implications of that R1 deal that Tegeta would be assuming at that point in 
time.  My recollection is this that at that point in time OCH no, OCM had a banking 
facility? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  To the order of R2.5 billion? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So Tegeta would be assuming that liability of. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So maybe just a slight clarification. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  The 2.5 billion was an OCH facility, but of course 
10 
banks being banks they had security across the organisation. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Indeed. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So they had security not only of the assets which 
they had perfected in OCM.  We were effectively acting as their agents.  They also had 
sessions of the shares in OCT and in Koornfontein as well. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, but it is a facility that enabled OCH to fund? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that is the reason why ultimately when OCH sold 
the three entities it had to settle its portion of that facility which was something in the 
order of R400 million? 
20 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So the purchase price was contributed to by two 
parties. Ultimately we are talking about the final transaction? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  There was a purchase price that was delivered from 
essentially from Tegeta for the. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 133 of 204 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Tegeta, 2.5 billion? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct and the R400 million was a contribution 
made by Glencore in order to ensure that the banks were paid in full such that the 
assets would be released.  If that is where you are heading. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That is where I am heading to. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So for that R1 they will be assuming at least 
portion of the 2.5 billion? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct and I think that recorded in the term sheet 
where we record that there are banks that have security over the assets and post due 
10 
diligence we will have to apportion how much of that pertains to OCM. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Because of course a portion would pertain to OCT 
and Koornfontein. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Indeed. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Indeed. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Then they will be assuming a potential liability for the 
penalties of 2.1 billion? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  It is, I mean, yes.  There is within the term sheet an 
endeavour by both parties to try and resolve it, but ultimately there would be a liability 
20 
that would accrue and would be part of that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We know that on that letter you have read from Cliffe 
Dekker Hofmeyr.  Eskom was quite clear about those penalties.  They were not 
negotiable.  They had to be paid immediately without delay.  Correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 134 of 204 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So new buyer for R1 would be assuming that liability? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct.  Although in the term sheet we had 
agreed that there may be an apportionment of it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  There would be for sure a portion that would be due 
by the new buyer. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And lastly that buyer would be taking over the 
prospective penalties? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Forward looking losses and the prospective 
penalties, absolutely. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  On your approach at that point in time and the 
reason for you to stop it was to supply coal at R1 per ton? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Ja, at this point in time we had, we were in the 
interim supply agreement.  So we were back to the R150, but even in that context there 
was significant losses.  So one can debate whether it is the one or the 150 [intervenes]. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Let us assume that it is 150. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  There are massive losses. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The cost of producing coal for R1.50 per ton was 
higher? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Significantly. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So they will be assuming that lability to? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Having regard to those at least three identifiable levels 
of liabilities which Tegeta would be taking for R1.  I suggest to you that you need a 
strong balance sheet to carry that liability for the life of the mine or for the life of the 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 135 of 204 
 
CSA. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes.  I think that, remember Eskom’s position with 
regards to the penalty, we interpret it as in the context of having Glencore as a 
shareholder.  So we though that there was the possibility that it could be renegotiated, 
but in the event that they stuck to that position you would need an organisation who 
could meet those financial commitments. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Oh, yes.  With a strong balance sheet? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Or parental support? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  A strong balance sheet. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and I suggest to you that Tegeta did not have that 
balance sheet.  That is the reason why it would have gone to Eskom to procure a 
guarantee to secure the purchase price and that is the reason why it would have gone 
to Eskom to secure a prepayment to fund the balance of the purchase price.  On any 
basis they did not have that balance sheet. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I know chronologically we are a little bit out of order, 
but certainly we had similar thoughts and when the ultimate transaction was concluded 
so this was kind of a preliminary and then it moved and I am sure we will cover that 
ground, but the fundamental point remains in any context.  The ability to fund the 
purchase price and continue was of course a concern of ours and as a result we had 
20 
request a demonstrable evidence of funding available at that point to conclude the 
purchase of the business and we were shown a document, but I am sure we will get 
there. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We will get there. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Ja. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 136 of 204 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What I am suggesting to you is that even at that point in 
time you must have had our doubts about. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Indeed. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The funding ability of Tegeta. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Indeed. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  To meet such liabilities. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Alright, can we then look at your statement?  Chair 
I am back at page 12. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You were explaining how you were dealing with that 
offer of Tegeta. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you could summarise or read out the whole or 
portion of 34.1 up to 34.3. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So whilst we were engaging with Tegeta we of 
course were attempting to engage with Eskom at the same time.  So despite Eskom’s 
unwillingness to engage with OCM we continued to update Eskom.  In November we 
reminded them that they played a key role in the rescue of OCM.  We further advised 
that we had secured additional funding for the month of November and thus had limited 
20 
times and funds to conclude the transaction.  Eskom did not comment on any of the 
options that we have just discussed that were available to us.  It merely confirmed that 
it was willing to meet with representatives of Oakbay to consider the veracity of its 
10 September offer and we acknowledged that as well. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And in paragraph 35 you say that Tegeta then requested 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 137 of 204 
 
you to arrange a meeting with Eskom. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that that meeting was held on 25 November.  
Correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Can I ask you to deal with that meeting?  Firstly did you 
attend the meeting? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I did attend the meeting indeed. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What about your colleague, Mr van der Steen. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Mr van der Steen was there. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  From Eskom’s side who attended the meeting? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Mr Koko, Ms Nteta.  I believe Ms Daniels was there.  
I think it reflected in the minutes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  A little bit further and Shaun Blankfield from 
Glencore. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  We can go to the minutes.  They are at pages 148 
and 149. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Mr Magalani, Ms Nteta and then of course 
representing Oakbay Mr Howa, Mr Twala and Ms Ragavan. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  When I look at the minutes it seems as if you 
were doing a lot of the talking? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I am prone to that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Then the most important part of the minutes and again 
subject to your guidance which I would pick up and ask you to comment on is at page 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 138 of 204 
 
149 and I am going to read these and ask for your comment. 
“The Chairman who was Mr Koko at the time…” 
PIERS MICHAEL MARSEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  “…emphasised the Eskom position which is 
Eskom’s priority is security of supply.” 
Do you see that? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We will come back to that in a moment. 
“There is a coal supply in place until 2018.  Eskom expects 
Optimum Coal Mine to honour the contract at the contracted 
10 
price until 2018.  Eskom will not waive its penalty claim.” 
That was his view. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What I find odd with this position it is a matter which I 
want you to comment on, is you cannot insist on security of supply in relation to an 
asset which you know has already indicated via its Managers you especially that you 
cannot supply at that rate.  Correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That position itself imperils the security of supply. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Indeed. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What was your response to Eskom’s position? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think that we had on numerous occasions, I do not 
want to use the word threaten, but they interpreted it as such.  We had clarified that in 
the event that we do not find a solution that very issue would come to the fore to the 
extent that we run out of options and as we have been through our options had greatly 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 139 of 204 
 
diminished over the last few months.  If we go to the point where we had no options we 
would be obliged to place the company into liquidation and of course imperil the supply 
in that way. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Mr Howa and his colleagues from Oakbay were 
there present? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  They were. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  They must have heard this unwavering position of 
Mr Koko? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  They did. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That Eskom will not waive. 
10 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  They did. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The penalty.  So they would have engaged with you on 
the offer on the strength of that knowledge that Eskom was not going to waive the 
penalties.  Correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think we did not really get an opportunity to have a 
discussion, because the meeting then moves on effectively to attempt to address that 
and the whole structure of the transaction effectively changes as a result of what 
happened subsequent to the meeting. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  No, no I understand, but if we take Mr Koko on his own 
words. 
20 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  They were present.  They heard what he said. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  They did. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And they knew what Eskom’s position was? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 140 of 204 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In relation to the penalties? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The question of how it changes and why it changes is 
something that we will deal with later. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But at that point in time when you had arranged a 
meeting at the request of the very same persons.  They were told what Eskom’s 
position is.  Correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Then there is something new which is introduced 
10 
which was not part of the offer of Oakbay.  It relates to the two subsidiaries 
Koornfontein and OCT, Optimum Coal Terminal.  Those are assets which were outside 
the offer.  How do they get raised for the first time in this meeting in relation to the 
desire of Tegeta to discuss the offer with Eskom? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So Mr Koko raised the issue that much as you have 
raised and as much as we all understood that OCM is a standalone business who is 
likely to be in the context of a non-renegotiated offer which has been made now clear 
on several occasions [indistinct] making and it would require a new set of balance 
sheets in huge to support that.  The current positon was that Eskom already had a 
guarantee from OCH and as such it would have the ability in the event of a default to 
20 
pursue that guarantee to OCH and effectively then follow the money down to either 
Koornfontein or OCT in terms of a recover of the amounts that would have been due to 
it.  So there was a proposal made at the meeting by Mr Koko that rather than consider a 
transaction of just the bad part of the business, if I can use that common vernacular, to 
rather expand our scope and look at not only OCM but at Koornfontein as well as at Oct 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 141 of 204 
 
which were in certain contexts the good aspect of the business. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I would like you to be clear on your recollection of the 
discussions at that point in time.  Are you suggesting that it is Mr Koko who raised the 
issue? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I absolutely believe so and I think it is recorded in 
the minutes as well. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So it is not the buyer who is raising the issue/ 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  It is not. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  Okay.  We may proceed, thank you. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair if there is anything you want us to help with we will 
definitely do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, it is something that needs to be sorted out by the 
Protectors in Administration. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you.  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  We now know that Mr Koko raises the 
question of the other assets and not the buyer? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  If I can read from the minutes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So it is on page 260 the second paragraph right at 
the bottom. 
“He…” 
And in the context of this the “he” refers to Mr Koko. 
“…postulated that if OCM were to be ring-fenced Eskom was 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 142 of 204 
 
not convinced that it would survive on its own and hence he 
was compelled to engage in a discussion regarding OCT not 
OCM.” 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Can I take you forward to page 149? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Mr Marsden just before you read, did you say page 260? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  No, sorry I have got a different referencing.  It is 
149, my apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  We must just use the [intervenes]. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  My apologies Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was trying to see where are you reading from now. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  My apologies, so it is the second paragraph, the 
paragraph opens with “you noted that”, but I’m reading the last sentence of that same 
paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Then you read something about OC – sorry Tegeta’s 
financial strength can you read the minutes? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes so it’s slightly before the paragraph that I’ve – 
or the sentence that I’ve just read, “he further questioned the financial strength of the 
new buyer, firstly would it be able to sustain a loss of 134 per month and secondly how 
20 
would the buyer survive without the Koornfontein contract and the export allocation”. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   The key part of his concern at that point in time is that it 
was clear to him, absent any form of increase in the asset base for sale, quite clearly 
Optimum Coal Mine itself was running at a loss. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 143 of 204 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   And that loss on his own estimation was 130 million 
rand per month. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   So he is telling the prospective buyer at the meeting 
that you are buying a loss making asset of 130 million rand per month. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   You have to be a strong person. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Indeed. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Who has the greatest faith in commercial realities to 
acquire an asset at a loss of this significant proportion? 
10 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I agree. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   And he suggested that there had to be a pairing of the 
coal of Koornfontein asset as well as access to the export allocation contract which is 
OCT. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes, can I ask you to explain to us why OCT as an 
asset was an important issue that could have increased the financial fortunes of a 
buyer? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely I think the importance of OCT is that it 
has an allocation through RBCT of approximately 6 million tons.  Koornfontein, itself 
20 
had its own allocation of just over a million tons as well.  What does that mean, the 
export of coal is an extremely lucrative business in South Africa and the gatekeeper of 
that and the access to export markets is largely as a result of the Richards Bay coal 
terminal.  So if one has coal and no export allocation it doesn’t really help you.  So the 
ability to access that very important strategic assets is fundamental and that in itself 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 144 of 204 
 
has significant value.  So whilst OCT is largely a non-trading entity, it simply has the 
rights – it could sell those rights for very handsome reward on an ongoing basis. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   So Optimum Coal could export coal using the terminal 
to the extent of 6 million tons? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  It could export its own coal and/or it could sell that 
allocation to any other miner who wishes to use the allocation to the tune of 6 million 
tons. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Indeed, so I as a trader, could approach OCT and say 
that, please take out my exports to the market and I’ll pay you a fee? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:   Correct, and it’s a very lucrative allocation. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   And I mean it’s – you do nothing, you don’t even lift a 
finger to …(intervention). 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Just some paperwork that you push, but yes, in that 
context. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   It does not involve any significant overheads? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  No it doesn’t or risk. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Alright what then was your response to Mr Koko’s idea 
that those two assets must become part and parcel of the sale agreement and secondly 
in the light of his concern about the lack of financial strength of the buyer to absorb the 
loss of OCM as a standalone? 
20 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I actually thought it had quite a lot of commercial 
merit I think that through the guarantee Eskom already had the ability to access those 
good assets if I use that in inverted commas.  So to retain the structure in place made 
commercial sense and I think at the same time it solved the problem that you’ve put 
and the problem that he had suggested around the buyer’s financial strength, because 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 145 of 204 
 
any transaction that involved, both Koornfontein and OCT would support any losses 
that were made at OCM.  So the proposal had merit, I was surprised that it had been 
done because it could have been raised previously, so I was certainly surprised at the 
proposal but pleasantly surprised because I thought it had commercial value. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes, were you surprised that the new buyer did not see 
the commercial sense of it when it made its offer? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Just for a correction, their first offer was not there, 
they then subsequently did make an offer on that basis, so I think they must have seen 
the commercial value.  So quite shortly after this they made a further 
offer…(intervention). 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   No I’m saying at that point in time before they revised 
the offer. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think they must have seen the commercial value in 
it yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Okay, for the first time as a result of that meeting? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes, and then you deal with the question of the debt to 
the bank, still at page 149, the paragraph following the one you have just read.     
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:    Yes so the bank consortium had – the debt had 
grown as a result of interest and post commencement finance, it was at a higher 
20 
amount than you would recognise from earlier on and any transaction would require, 
equally, their consent to the extent that they were not fully repaid and as a result, you 
know, they were the secured creditor they had access to the assets etcetera, so any 
transaction, whether it be at OCM or OCH would require some level of consent from the 
banks. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 146 of 204 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   And you said that was the senior debt of 2.7 billion rand 
secured in favour of the banks? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes they had security over the fixed assets they had 
accession over the receivables, they had a pledge over the shares, as you would 
anticipate with banks, they had pretty much everything. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes, Chair you’d recall how the banks do tie you up they 
even own your income, they even own your assets, you can’t do anything.  I would step 
off the minutes unless you would like to say something but maybe let me direct your 
attention to the second last paragraph and the last sentence of that paragraph under 
Roman III. 
10 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Sorry are we still on 149? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes I think the last sentence is really fundamental is 
that Nazeem – NH, Nazeem Hower confirmed that (indistinct) was dealing with dealing 
with it from OCM perspective and did not have a mandate at this point and that’s been 
paraphrased into  talk regarding OCH which was the proposal by Mr Koko. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes, but he raised a few issues before then about 
whether there were negotiables from the side of Eskom correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:   He did it was…(intervention). 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   And one of them relates to penalties correct? 
20 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   And can I ask you to deal with his issue relating to 
penalties you’ll see it under Roman III. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes he had asked whether Eskom would consider a 
waiver of the penalty and unsurprisingly Eskom replied back that it was clear that 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 147 of 204 
 
Eskom was not prepared to waive that penalty. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright, we can leave the minutes on the clear premise 
that what was clear to the parties in that room at that point in time was that the 
penalties would not be waived, there may be a restructuring of the offer in order to 
include three assets.  
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    And the banks would have to consent to the sale 
because of the security debt of 2.7 billion? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    Alright, now I’d like to take you back to your statement 
10 
in order to trace the developments thereafter and you deal with those developments 
from page 13 paragraph 36. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes, so just to recollect the timing, because I think it 
is important, the meeting that we’ve just referred to, the minutes, was held on the 24 th 
of November so very shortly thereafter on the 26th of November in the context of a 
completely re-structured deal in a surprisingly short amount of time, Tegeta made a new 
offer, this offer included the sale now of all of the assets of OCH i.e. not just the shares 
in OCM but in the other subsidiaries including OCT and Koornfontein for a purchase 
consideration of 1 billion rand.  This was not a written offer, it was communicated to me 
by Mr Ephron. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Alright, we heard the evidence of Mr Clinton Ephron in 
relation to how Glencore corresponded to that offer and he said it was rejected. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I have a slightly different recollection, whilst they did 
certainly reject it, given the context that it would have required the bank’s consent I also 
had arranged a meeting with the bank consortium and in the context of a purchase 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 148 of 204 
 
consideration of one they would have written off 1.5 given their total exposure was that 
and I received a very curt response that, that was not an acceptable offer.  So both 
Glencore and the consortium of banks rejected that proposal. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes, alright I don’t think anything turns on it we know as 
a fact that, that offer was rejected and then what was the next phase of the 
development, I think you begin to deal with it on page 14 paragraph 38. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  In paragraph 40 or earlier than that sorry? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Earlier than that from paragraph 38. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So taking back to the context of, the offer has now 
been rejected, on or about the 30th of November 2015 I received a call from Mr Ephron 
10 
requesting that I attend a meeting, I did such and I was informed at that point in time 
that Glencore had received a number of notices from the Department of Mineral 
Resources stopping operations, not only at – within the OCH table but at other 
Glencore operations and as a result of that Glencore had, effectively reconsidered its 
position and the view that the 1 billion was certainly not sufficient value and they had 
made a fundamental decision to, essentially declare the business rescue process a 
failure, if I can use that terminology.  They would continue to support OCH and OCM 
they would discharge the company from business rescue once they had gone through 
some of the governance steps and they would live with the contract until the end of its 
term in 2018. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes we’ll get to the details, Mr Ephron testified about 
the notices and I think other witnesses, too testified about the notices and they were of 
the view that they were too harsh and represented some form of pressure but from a 
different quarter and that was DMR.  I wonder whether you took a view about the 
purpose behind those notices. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 149 of 204 
 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think I would concur with that view. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Alright then I’d like to get to the details of this 
fundamental shift of Glencore in relation to its assets at Optimum Coal Mine, I mean it’s 
a fundamental shift. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  It is Glencore, essentially acceding to all of the 
demands that Eskom have made and that they’ve stuck to as we’ve recalled on several 
occasions that kind of firm line in the sand. We’re essentially having Glencore saying, 
you know, this last couple of months is really not worked out and we would seek to 
discharge the business rescue and to live with the contract, on Eskom’s terms until the 
remainder of 2018, which is a fundamental shift. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   I mean we heard his evidence and it is quite clear from 
his evidence that from May 2014 when he came in, it was quite clear that neither 
Optimum Coal itself, the holding company, would absorb the loss and therefore they 
had to do something fundamental and they could not carry on under the CSA as it was 
structured and for that reason they declared a hardship.  The penalties even added to 
the difficulties they had and for that reason they decided to place this mine and the 
holding company into a business rescue.  At this moment when Eskom was quite clear 
that it was not going to give a quarter they now shift and concede to each and every 
demand of Eskom by taking out this company out of business rescue by telling Eskom 
that they will supply on the same terms of the CSA which, previously the conceded 
20 
oppressive, correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Why would Glencore all of a sudden get to this Lazarus 
moment? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I really I think that, that’s a question they should 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 150 of 204 
 
have answered but I think the context is we were running out of options, the last bidder 
had put an offer that was not acceptable, there was external pressure that may or may 
not have impacted their other businesses and as a result they had an internal meeting 
and decided to do an about turn and pursue this process. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Alright, you do indicate in paragraph 41 on page 14 
that, that fundamental changing position was communicated to Eskom. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Can I ask you to deal with how Eskom was told of that 
change in stance? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So immediately after Glencore had informed me of 
10 
their intentions, I was requested to facilitate two meetings in a very specific sequence.  
First they had requested that I set up a meeting with Eskom which I did and they, 
immediately, thereafter wanted to meet with the banking consortium.  So if we can deal 
with the first meeting, the first meeting was held on the 1st of December it was attended 
by myself, Mr Van Den Stein, Mr Koko and two representatives from Glencore and at 
this meeting, Glencore effectively recorded that the offer had been rejected and that 
they, Glencore, would continue to support OCM going forward and that OCM and OCH 
would be discharged from BR. Obviously pursuant to some governance that had to be 
achieved first, it’s not something that can be done immediately and then they 
confirmed, further, that they would not seek amendment to the CSA and it would pursue 
20 
arbitration proceedings for the resolution of the penalty and it would also not insist on 
an extension of the supplier agreement with Eskom at the Koornfontein mine. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Alright I suppose that this meeting was not recorded 
because you don’t favour us with any minutes or notes of the meeting? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  No it was an informal meeting, I do think that – I 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 151 of 204 
 
don’t think the contents is disputed, I certainly recall from Mr Koko’s evidence at the 
Parliamentary enquiry that he records very similar (indistinct) stance at the meeting. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   We will come to his position because it becomes 
fundamentally important and you’re quite correct that he did make submissions and 
testified at the Portfolio Committee hearings but what I want to confirm with you at this 
point in time is that, when Mr Ephron communicated that position to Mr Koko, Eskom  
must have been surprised by this, correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I would hope pleasantly surprised yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Indeed, because whatever it insisted upon up to that 
point in time, had been considered by Glencore. 
10 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Exactly their hardball tactics and holding the line 
appeared to have worked. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes, the consequence of it is this, that on Eskom’s hard 
line and the concession of Glencore Optimum would be running at further losses for the 
lifetime of the CSA which was two years more, correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   So if one does simple mathematics, from the 
perspective of Eskom it will be 130 million rand per month multiplied by 24 months. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:   That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    From the perspective of Glencore it will be 150 million 
20 
rand multiplied by 24 months. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:    Yes, Chair at this stage I would like to introduce 
documents which are not in these files because they reflect how Eskom dealt with this 
change of position…(intervention) 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 152 of 204 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry before you proceed did you – Mr Marsden, did you ever get 
to know what had informed Glencore’s fundamental shift around that time, did you get 
to know or is it something that you might have got to know much later? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I certainly asked the question at the 
time…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I would have expected you to ask. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  And I think I was aware of the Section 54 Notices at 
the time Glencore, and still remains a very large organisation whilst these numbers are 
extraordinarily large for ordinary people, Glencore is a large organisation and I suspect 
that as big as the losses are as illustrated, between 130 and 150 depending on whose 
10 
versions, Glencore could have sustained that loss, they had the balance sheet in order 
to do that.  What it would have done is two-fold, it would have protected the OCT and 
they would have retained that allocation which, at the time, with coal prices quite 
depressed was not as valuable but where they are at the moment certainly would have 
been and I think Glencore would have seen through that cycle of prices.  Secondly, I 
think that, come the 1st of January 2019 at the end of this (indistinct) there would have 
been a very interesting negotiation around an extension.  So I think they took the view 
that we can quantify what that range of costs is and in the context of the last remaining 
offer being a billion rand, the maths just didn’t’ work and in the context, perhaps, 
pressure of the 54 has an impact on the other business they could factor a risk element 
20 
into that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Thank you Chair, Chair can I, with your leave hand up 
these documents, they are already in the bundle of documents we introduced at the 
beginning of the Eskom hearings but we thought it was just to extract…(intervention). 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 153 of 204 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  For convenience. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   For convenience rather than to ask you to bring the 
whole set of files.  Chair as a matter of convenience these documents were extracted 
from volume 4 of the transcript of the Parliamentary proceedings and you’ll see that 
each of the pages at the top has been paginated, it is the pagination which starts with 
1499 which is relevant for the present purposes.  And the evidence of Mr Marsden in 
relation to these documents is going to become important when you hear the next 
witness Dr Ramontja because these letters were addressed to him.  So it’s a very 
useful introduction of Dr Ramontja’s evidence before he even takes the stand.  We 
have placed documents before you, and I’d like to identify them with the pagination 
10 
which begins with ES, okay, have you seen ES 1499 before? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I may have seen it as part of Mr Koko’s testimony 
which I kept a keen eye on. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   I’d like to orientate you about those letters.  ES 1499 
appears to be a draft and then if you go to ES 1501 you will see that, that’s an email 
from Ms Suzanne Daniels to Mr Koko, it is dated 6 December 2015 7h55 pm and it is 
addressed to Mr Matshela Koko and Ms Norman who is very astute and diligent about 
the calendar, she tells me that, that must have been a Sunday and thereafter you will 
see there is ES 1502 and 1503. That document appears to be an updated version of 
the previous document. If you compare the two, in other words if you compare ES 1499 
20 
and ES 1502 you will see that the page – the second page, page two of that letter is 
longer and therefore has additions which the previous letter did not have but other than 
the additions the contents of the letters are the same.  So the deduction we make Chair 
as a legal team, having regard to the email from Ms Daniels, is that ES 1502 it’s an 
updated version of the previous draft. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 154 of 204 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which is ES 1499? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And is – was ES 1501 a kind of covering note for 1499? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   We assume that this ES 1501 was an email from Ms 
Daniels telling Mr Koko that he has updated the draft and that albeit is the one which is 
signed by Mr Koko in ES 1502 and 1503. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes the 1501 is on the 6th of December 2015 at 7h55 and then 1502 
is signed by Mr Koko on the same date? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes the previous draft, 1499 is not signed at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   So we will work with the document which Mr Koko has 
signed because this – the one that he used to make submissions to Parliament and 
there’s the one that he introduced in the Parliamentary evidence.  So if you don’t mind 
I’ll ask you to go to page 1502, are you there? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I am but if I could make one comment before we 
disregard 1499. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Timing is everything in life and there is one other 
sentence if we could just focus on as a distinction between the two letters before we get 
into the content. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So if we go to 1499, it says “at the recent meeting 
of the parties two days ago”…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where are you reading from? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Sorry I’m – my apologies it’s 1499 the second 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 155 of 204 
 
paragraph from the bottom, “at the recent meeting of the parties two days ago, the 
meeting was held on the 1st of December, so one can assume that the genius of this 
letter was the 3rd of December and I think timing is important, that changes in 1502, “at 
the latest meeting of the parties, and obviously given the influxion of time it’s changed, 
but it’s an important distinction for me. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Thank you for that distinction but I understand from your 
evidence that the last meeting you had with them was on the 1st of December. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   There was no other meeting after that? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  There was no other meeting no. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes, so whether it is the recent or the latest, from your 
perspective we must work with the date 1 December 2015. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes the only distinction was that there was a 
monthly update report, a standardised update report that was submitted, critically in 
that interim period. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   I understand. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  It was not a meeting. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   So we can work on the basis that as far as we’re 
concerned recent or latest the date must be fixed as 1 December 2015. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct, absolutely right. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But some of these things may be significant for different purposes.  
That paragraph from which you read which suggests that there were – there was a 
meeting two days previously on what has been indicated – you have indicated the last 
meeting was on the 1 December before these letters and so – so either different parties 
I mean are intended or if it is intended the same parties are intended – if the same 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 156 of 204 
 
parties are intended then maybe the author was just mistaken about the date of the 
meeting or if it was not mistaken there may have been other purposes for stating things 
in a certain way? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  If I can maybe explain why I want to make the 
distinction that probably would clarify and I presume we are heading there so I do not 
know if I am going into the unknown here.  But I did  watch Mr Koko’s testimony at the 
Parliamentary inquiry and he seeks to discredit is maybe the only word that I can think 
of this letter stated by the fact that on the 4 December there was an update report that 
came in which was a generic update report.  So that is why the intention behind this 
letter started prior to that update report and that is merely a red herring so that is why I 
10 
make the distinction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  The letter further says in the latest meeting.  There 
was no other meeting so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So the advocate is absolute correct it sill records 
the latest meeting we are referring to the same meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but also the meeting – at the meeting of the 1st is the position not 
at that stage Eskom was being or – ja Eskom was being informed that Glencore would 
take Optimum out of the rescue process – business rescue process so it is not as if it 
20 
was out of that process already. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct and there is some governance around how 
one exits so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So that is part of the reason why we could not 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 157 of 204 
 
immediately discharge it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  The principle reason being the bank debt had 
accelerated and we needed to restructure that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  And then there are further governance issues that 
the practitioner has to satisfy himself that Glencore has provided sufficient funding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So there is – there is whilst we have said we are 
going out of business rescue we had not yet achieved the task. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  And I think that is the distinction I wanted to make. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes because the letter says that the business rescue practitioners 
indicated that Optimum was no longer in business rescue.  So at that meeting you 
could not put – you could not have put it that way? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct.  We were – our intention was to discharge 
it but we had not yet done the act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja, ja.  The fundamental shift had just happened? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Exactly right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Thank you. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright Chair just to reinforce your point if you put 1499 
side by side with 1520 and 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you reflect back to that paragraph the second last 
paragraph. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 158 of 204 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You will see that 1499 is shorter than its mirror image on 
1502? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The sentence that I am going to read from 1502 has 
now been added.  It was not there previously on 1499. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The sentence is and I am reading the second sentence 
from that penultimate paragraph. 
“They further advised that they will follow the contract route to 
10 
process Eskom’s claim of R2.2 billion.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  They made it very clear that they are not insisting on the 
extension of the Koornfontein Coal Supply contract with Eskom. They insisted that the 
extension of Koornfontein Coal Supply contract is at the discretion of Eskom. This was 
not previously in the draft. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In that paragraph. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Ja, ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  I am sure Mr Marsden around the 6 December 
20 
you were not aware of these letters? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Very much not. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  I would like to take you to 1502 because it reflects 
Eskom’s position to the stance taken by Glencore at that meeting of 1 December 2015.  
And forgive me if I were to go through paragraph by paragraph. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 159 of 204 
 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  No problem. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  This is Mr Koko writing to Doctor Thibedi Ramontja who 
is the next witness we are going to call.  Do you know why he is writing to DMR? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I have no idea. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  He says and as he starts. 
“As you may be aware Eskom has been involved in a legal 
wrangle with the above supplier from about August this year.” 
Do not worry about that we will take that up with Doctor Ramontja.  Next he says in a 
rather dramatic fashion the company was placed under business rescue and Eskom 
was faced with intermittent veiled threats of liquidation while at the same time the 
10 
business rescue practitioners purportedly sought constructive engagement with the 
parties.  Do you see that? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:   Yes Sir. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Was the initiation of business rescue process or 
proceedings by Glencore dramatic as far as you are aware? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Not in my view I think they had made it quite clear 
prior to making the decision that that was a possibility and they had let Eskom know 
about it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And they had engaged Eskom about that prospect 
before? 
20 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So there was nothing dramatic as far as you are 
aware?  And then they say that you had purported constructive engagements with 
Eskom.  We have gone through a series of what you had done to engage Eskom from 
August when you took over up to the point when you received the final offer of Tegeta.  
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 160 of 204 
 
Would you describe those negotiations as a reflection of purported constructive 
engagement? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Certainly not I think that we sought on many 
occasions to try engage with Eskom so from our side it certainly was not purported we 
sought actively to engage in constructive engagements.  Whether the engagements 
themselves were constructed is an entirely different question but I would lay the blame 
in that regard on Eskom rather than ourselves.  We genuinely attempted to engage with 
them. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What I find surprising about that disruption is that it does 
not disclose the director general the chapter and verse of those negotiations.  Correct? 
10 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And it yet it puts a description on the qualitative nature 
of those discussions. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In a manner that is not consistent with the true nature of 
those discussions. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I am going to read the next paragraph. 
“From Eskom’s perspective it was expected that as a Glencore 
operation Optimum Coal Mine would enjoy a far more – would 
20 
enjoy a far more support than the conditional funding for limited 
time periods that was on offer.” 
I hope I understand what he is conveying there but let me ask you first.  Do you 
understand what is conveying to the director general? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I do.  Glencore had been providing us post 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 161 of 204 
 
commencement finance throughout the business rescue.  Given where the banks 
ranked in the security profile any funding that Glencore provided was largely lost and 
would in all likelihood not be recovered.  So they were essentially providing that on a 
monthly basis in order to see how we had progressed initially in our negotiations and 
subsequently in the conclusion of a transaction. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The point I would like to establish from you is that by the 
time this letter was written which is five days after the meeting. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Glencore has made it quite clear that they are going to 
provide far more than a financial loss. 
10 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  You are absolutely right at this point in time we – 
Glencore had given me the assurance and had given Mr Koko on the 1 December 
meeting assurance that they would provide sufficient funding to see it through to the 
end of the contract. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  All that was required of Optimum Coal Mine to meet its 
obligations under the CSA? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct.  Exactly right. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Including the question of dealing with the penalties. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Exactly right. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Again that was not disclosed to the director 
20 
general in this letter. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. The next paragraph reads as follows: 
“Optimum supplies one of Eskom’s key contributors to the 
national power system as Hendrina Power Station is a stalwart of 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 162 of 204 
 
Eskom’s fleet supplying approximately 20 sorry 2000 megawatts 
to the national grid.  Glencore was fully aware of the dynamics 
and history relating to the nature of the coal supply agreement 
and its structure when it concluded the sale with its previous 
owner.” 
That is a fair reflection of the true state of affairs?  Then when Glencore bought the 
mine from BACSA correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes it seems to be correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We heard Mr Ephron’s evidence they were aware about 
what the CSA at that point in time I think it was BACSA bought it in 1993 from Trans 
10 
Natal they bought it in about 2012 I think. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  It sounds about right. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  From BACSA. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is right. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So I think he is reflecting the truth at that point in time, 
correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Embedded of course in the supply agreement is the 
hardship so yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  It is included in there. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What I want to understand is… 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  It is a fair reflection. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It is a fair reflection? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay. The next paragraph reads as follows: 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 163 of 204 
 
“At the latest meeting of the parties the business rescue 
practitioners together with the Glencore representatives or 
representative indicated that Optimum is being rescued and that 
it would honour the contract in its current form with no 
amendments.  They further advised that they will follow the 
contract route to process the Eskom claim of R2.2 billion.  They 
made it very clear that they are not insisting on the extension of 
the Koornfontein Coal Supply contract with Eskom they insisted 
that the extension of Koornfontein Coal Supply contract is at the 
discretion of Eskom.” 
10 
Again he is reflecting the truth? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is a fair reflection of the meeting yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  As a matter of detail when did the Koornfontein 
Coal Supply agreement come to an end? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  It was slightly different in that it was a volume based 
contract not a time based contract details aside sometime in January 2016 so very 
presently. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  The next paragraph reads as follows: 
“Eskom is perplexed by this about turn given the events of the 
past few months and at the blatant disregard Optimum displays 
20 
for the impact that the threats of liquidation has on the precarious 
balance of electricity security and commercial viability as a 
Glencore operation Optimum surely cannot be perceived to be 
acting in the national interest.” 
I see that you are smiling? 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 164 of 204 
 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I should not be. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  It seems to me that once you conceded each and 
every of Eskom’s demands and communicated them and when I say I mean Glencore 
you representing them.  Once you conceded them at that point in time you did 
something which Eskom did not expect because on Mr Koko’s approach that was 
perplexing. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I do not understand the word perplexing in the 
context of the two preceding paragraphs or in the context of the numerous occasions 
10 
when Eskom laid out what it is they wanted.  They have laid out in the numerous 
discussions and documents we have been through on numerous occasions what they 
wanted.  They had got exactly what they wanted.  So why one would be perplexed 
having stuck to a hard line and having received that hard line is inexplicable. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  A hard bargainer like Eskom at that point in time would 
have been happy? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Exactly right. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Rather than being perplexed? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Very much so. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  But I can understand why he would suggest that 
20 
he was per- your change of stance was perplexing. Because from his explanation in 
that paragraph about the history of the engagement with Glencore there was one 
important development which he does not refer to in this letter and that is the attempts 
by Tegeta to acquire the mine.  Because your change of stance at that point in time 
meant that the offer was no longer on the table. The mine was no longer available for 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 165 of 204 
 
sale. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that was a matter that perplexed him.  I cannot think 
of any other matter that could perplex him once you concede and every demand Eskom 
was making. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I agree with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well he – he could not have been perplexed about the fundamental 
shift the change unless in insisting on the position on which Eskom was insisting rigidly 
on your evidence unless he did not expect the shift.  Is it not? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  He should not have been perplexed in the slightest 
10 
at the news that he heard on the 1 December.  He should have overjoyed and it should 
have been one his KPI’s for that year if Eskom’s position was to take a hard line, they 
had negotiated hard and they had got one of the largest mining houses to effectively 
concede on each of their items.  I do not understand the word perplexed in the context 
of this {indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am thinking that let me talk in not on the facts of this case.  Let 
us say you have negotiations with somebody to settle something some dispute and you 
take a position that for example is intended by you to ensure there is no settlement but 
there is capitulation but you do not think capitulation is going to be – is going to happen 
and then if it happens would you not be perplexed? 
20 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  If your stated intention is different from your actual 
intention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not talking about this one. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 166 of 204 
 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  In your example.  You never wanted a settlement 
you were seeking it as leverage for another example. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And what he is saying in the paragraph I have just read, 
that is the last paragraph he refers to the fact that there were threats of liquidation and 
those threats of liquidation had a potentially negative impact on the supplier of coal and 
therefore electricity to the country and that you would not be acting in the best interest 
of the nation.  But what is quite clear is that by the time he writes this letter there were 
no longer threats of liquidation of the mine.  Correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In fact the mine was going to be removed from business 
rescue? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In fact the mine was going to honour all of its CSA 
obligations however oppressive. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What reason can you think of that Mr Koko does not 
disclose all the true facts?  The little that he discloses is in fact a misrepresentation of 
the facts. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I do not think I can speculate on what Mr Koko was 
20 
intending with this letter. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But from your perspective do you accept that this 
statement relating to threats of liquidation the possible impact of those threats of 
liquidation to the security of supply were a clear misrepresentation of the facts. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Exactly right.  Effective 1 December that position no 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 167 of 204 
 
longer existed.  Prior to that before Glencore’s about turn that was a real possibility but 
post the 1 December meeting i.e. at the time this letter was drafted that was no longer a 
realistic possibility. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In fact Hendrina would continue to procure? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Coal at its own requirements under the CSA. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The angling possibility that Eskom may well have faced 
was the supply of coal which was not meeting the specs but that would be dealt by with 
penalties. 
10 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  In terms of the contract yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Then I am paging over Chair to ES1503.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In [indistinct] you are aware that we have similar 
challenges at Arnot Power Station the current supply contract with Exxaro Resources 
expired on 31 December 2015 and we are discussing the winding down of operations 
with Exxaro, is there any comment you want make I am just reading in the interest of 
full disclosure? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I was not aware of it at the time. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But what you have been aware of in due course is that 
20 
coal from Optimum was procured by Tegeta to supply Arnot? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Indeed. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We will get to that in due course. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The next paragraph reads as follows: 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 168 of 204 
 
“While Eskom has issued request for proposals to the open 
market the tender submission indicate that we will not have 
sufficient volumes to meet their requirements for Arnot – of Arnot 
based on previous tests.  Eskom can confirm that the coal 
qualities at Optimum are suitable for Arnot’s burn requirements 
and will pass the necessary combustions tests based on 
Optimum’s current mining plans there should be sufficient coal 
volume to service both power stations therefore Optimum 
becomes highly sought after source for Arnot as well.” 
Do you see that? 
10 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  This is not a sudden reflection of the importance of 
Optimum to Eskom.  It has always been there historically from day 1.  It has always 
been there when you took over as the BRP’s, correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  It is historic importance, an ongoing importance, 
absolutely. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes So he is not telling the director general anything 
new here? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  He is not a couple of these items just reading it 
quickly maybe require some clarification if you do not mind 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Optimum’s current mine plans certainly at that point 
in time we were in control of the mine and we had no plans to expand production 
beyond our obligations to Hendrina.  Although when the mine was in full production and 
supplying to the export market it would have had sufficient coal to supply and so the 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 169 of 204 
 
half of that I suppose is debatable the second half would we have sufficient volume, 
yes.  So once again supporting your assertion that it is an important asset from an 
Eskom perspective. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You know Mr Marsden the sad part of this story arising 
from this paragraph is that Glencore was willing to keep Optimum Coal Mine as part 
and parcel of a strategic supply to Eskom for the rest of the CSA.  In fact if it wanted to 
go even further but that mine has now been lost altogether. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yup. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Because the evidence before the Chair is that that mine 
is a mine dump at the moment.  Are you aware of that fact? 
10 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I am aware it is undergoing its second business 
rescue process and I do not believe it is currently in production. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  And that is the sad reality of what Eskom is now 
facing. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Indeed. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  The next paragraph reads as follows: 
‘I also put it to you that Komati Power Station received 180 000 
tonnes per month of coal from Koornfontein Mine.  As a 
subsidiary of Optimum Coal Holdings this contract expires at the 
end of January 2016. As a result of the rescue proceedings this 
20 
power station is also at risk post January 2016.” 
Do you understand what is communicating to the DG at that point in time? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I understand what he is miscommunicating to the 
DG. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.   
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 170 of 204 
 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think that factually Optimum Coal Holdings is in 
business rescue.  Its subsidiary Koornfontein Mines is not.  It is a separate legal entity it 
has its own board, it has its own funding structure and it is not in business rescue.  So 
whilst I had representation as a shareholder Koornfontein exists as a separate legal 
entity not within business rescue and not at threat of either business rescue and or 
liquidation as well.  The contract expires at the of January 2016 I think that at least 
agrees to the date I just gave you.  We had been requesting an extension on similar 
terms from Eskom they were the ones who did not want to give the extension and if you 
go back to the previous page on page 1502 the last sentence of the second last 
paragraph. 
10 
“They insisted that the extension of Koornfontein’ s supply 
contract is at the discretion of Eskom” 
So the threat of Koornfontein sits very squarely on Eskom’s doors not at Koornfontein’s 
doors.  If you understand me? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I understand that.  I mean I have read a little of every 
available public information relating to the business rescue proceedings.  I have never 
come across any evidence whatsoever suggesting that Koornfontein Mine was in or 
about to be put into business rescue.  This is the first time I hear of it. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  You are absolutely right it was never at risk of being 
in business rescue. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Do you know any reason why Mr Koko would 
miscommunicate this fundamental proposition to the director general? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I do not. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The next paragraph reads as follows: 
“As at the date of this letter we have not yet received a formal 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 171 of 204 
 
notification of the status of Optimum.” 
Is that true? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is true yes we had not been able to achieve 
the governance required in order to discharge the business rescue. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay the next paragraph reads as follows: 
“While Eskom fully appreciates the turnaround of the business it 
remains concerned that such erratic display of business stability 
may compromise the security of supply to Hendrina Power 
Station in the short to medium term therefore Eskom would 
require a firm resolution on Optimum by mid December 2015.” 
10 
Do you see that? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I do. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I do not know what firm resolution he was looking at by 
December 2015.  But on what you have told the Chairperson it is quite clear that 
remaining disputes between Eskom and Optimum Coal Holdings relating to Optimum 
Coal Mine have been resolved.   
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I suppose they have been verbally agreed but there 
is governance and paperwork that needs to support those decisions.  So I can only 
anticipate that the formal discharge of business rescue is what was required in this 
paragraph, I assume. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Ja but that is a formality. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I mean there are steps that need to be done but 
yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes but is it – those are formal processes? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 172 of 204 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  They are not matters of substance. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  No. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Alright, we will leave that to Mr Koko and we will 
ask him. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Sure. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Maybe he will be able to tell us what was erratic about 
the remaining steps to bring about the formal rescue of the entity.  The next paragraph 
reads as follows: 
“The risk of security of supply for Hendrina Power Station, 
Komati Power Station and Arnot Power Station is of such a key 
10 
national interest that we thought it appropriate to bring it to your 
attention.  This upcoming adversity facing Eskom will require 
some form of intervention on the part of the Department of 
Mineral Resources to assist Eskom in leveraging the necessary 
key authorities to assist in assuring resolution to the coal 
supply situation and certainly going forward.” 
Can you think of any need for the Director-General, his department or even the 
Executive Authority of that department be the Minister of Mineral Resources would have 
to intervene in your contractual relationship with Eskom once you have conceded to its 
demands at the meeting of 1 December 2015? 
20 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I see no reason. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  We have dealt with the contents of this letter 
and in fairness you were not aware of them when Mr Koko wrote to the Director-
General? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 173 of 204 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Now that you are aware of them what is the view you 
take of the contents of this letter? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think it is quite disturbing in terms of where we had 
landed on 1 December and to the extent that Eskom wished to play hard ball on the 
contract which was their prerogative and they achieved that.  I would have thought that 
would have been the end of the matter. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  There were further developments which took place 
between Eskom, Glencore, Optimum Holdings and yourself before Mr Koko wrote this 
letter and I am talking about developments of 1 December which were not disclosed in 
this letter and I would like to deal with them to the extent that you are aware of them.  
10 
You begin to deal with them from page 15. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes.  So to pick up where we were, we had just 
concluded the meeting with Mr Koko at Eskom.  As I had previously said we had been 
asked to set up two meetings one, with Mr Koko and the second with the consortium of 
banks.  Mr Ephron excused himself from that meeting between driving from Megawatt 
Park to the banks.  Shortly after in December, unfortunately I do not have the date it 
was an informal session, Mr Ephron advised me that there was a meeting held in 
Switzerland.  The principal terms of the transaction that had been agreed between 
Glencore, Oakbay and Tegeta which included the sale of OCHs assets for a purchase 
considering of 2.15 billion and the various terms of the offer.  I was certainly not present 
20 
at those meetings and essentially we would have been required to consent to that 
transactions.  We were in operational control effectively in the shoes of the Board of 
Directors of OCH.  So whilst the shareholders had agreed we also needed to 
understand the transaction and the consent thereto.  We discussed the new offer with 
Glencore’s representatives and Mr Ephron on his return to Johannesburg and we were 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 174 of 204 
 
satisfied that the offer was significantly more than the one billion and if there was the 
contribution of 400 million as proposed by Glencore this would essentially deal with all 
of the stakeholders at OCH. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  The stakeholders at OCH being the bank 
consortium, being Eskom in terms of its contingent claim in terms of the guarantee and 
Glencore representing the shareholders and there were no staff at OCH being the 
holding company.  So in the world of our affected parties this ticked the boxes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  What is quite clear from Mr Ephron’s evidence is 
that he was called to fly to Zurich on 1 December to attend a meeting, because on that 
10 
day 1 December there was a meeting between Mr Glasenberg and the Minister of 
Mineral Resources at that point in time.  Are you aware of that meeting in Zurich 
between? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I have no personal knowledge, but yes I am aware 
of the meeting. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  But you were not told of it? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I was not aware of it, no. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay and then once he arrived at the meeting he was 
told of, well there was everyone there, the agreement was reached and I assume that it 
was on 2 December when an agreement was reached.  When did you become aware 
20 
that Zurich had struck a deal on the sale of the three assets? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I do not recall the exact date, but it would have 
been early in December sometime immediately thereafter.  I can only postulate that it 
would have been sometime between the 2nd or the 4th or the 5th. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright and then we know that as a result of that deal 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 175 of 204 
 
there was some kind of the implementation of it? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  By means of the execution of the sale agreement? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes that is right. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You refer to that sale agreement, Chair at page 16. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Paragraph 46 and it begins at page 150.  If you do not 
mind I would like to take you to some of the terms of that sale.  The first is part of the 
definition classes.  If I may ask you to go to page 158 and just to confirm with you the 
sale agreement is on the letterhead or at least the branding of Werksmans? 
10 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So Werksmans was quite busy? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  They were indeed. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  At page 158 paragraph 1.2.29 there is a definition of 
what a guarantee is.  Do you see that? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I do. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  The guarantee executed by the seller in favour of 
Eskom on 6 April 2008 in terms of which the seller guaranteed the performance by 
OCM of all of its obligations in terms of the CSA.  Correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So as I understand independent of the CSA there 
will be a guarantee put up by OCH? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  To make sure that OCM fulfils all of its obligations? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 176 of 204 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In the event of breach Eskom can rely on that 
guarantee? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  Against that background I am going to take you 
to page 168 which deals with suspensive conditions. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Hm. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And the key ones which you would be aware of begin at 
page 169 paragraph 3.1.3.  Do you see that? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It says: 
10 
“By 31 March 2016 the sale agreement ought to be approved 
by the lenders which is the banks, the competition authorities 
which is the Competition Commission failing which the 
Competition Tribunal and halfway through the competition, 
appeal courts in case of litigation and then the Minister of 
Mineral Resources in terms of Section 11 of the MPRDA.” 
Correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We will come back to this and some of them I will raise 
them with Dr Ramontja when he comes in, because those were contractual obligations 
20 
imposed on someone who had to take initiative to make sure that these obligations 
were fulfilled. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Do you know who was supposed to show the obligations 
to ensure fulfilment of these? 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 177 of 204 
 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Generally in an agreement of this nature both 
parties would use their endeavours to make sure that the conditions precedent are met. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Well can I take you to page 172? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You will see that there is Clause 5 which deals with 
regulatory filings. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Hm. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  5.1.1: 
“It is recorded that the proposed transaction shall on 
implementation cost constitute a large merger for the purposes 
10 
of the Competition Act.” 
And we know that a larger merger is notifiable? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  By the parties to that measure.  Correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  5.1.2: 
“The purchaser shall be responsible for preparing and lodging 
on behalf of the parties as soon as reasonably possible after 
the signature date.  Requisite measure filings for the proposed 
transaction in accordance with the provisions of the 
20 
Competition Act.” 
It seems to me that the obligation to file notification for the transaction is placed on 
Tegeta as the proposed purchaser? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  If you go to page 173 paragraph 5.1 Section 11 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 178 of 204 
 
applications. 
“The purchaser shall be responsible for preparing and lodging 
on behalf of the parties as soon as reasonably possible after 
the signature date the application in accordance with the 
requirements of Section 11.” 
So again the agreement makes it quite clear that it is Tegeta who must initiate those 
processes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I would agree. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Of course I accept that it does it on behalf of the 
party, but it is the one which must procure by making the applications. 
10 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think there is a slight distinction between procuring 
the entire. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Sorry. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  CP and submitting of documents. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Is it [intervenes]. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I do not want to contradict myself.  They are 
certainly responsible for that, but both parties are responsible for ensuring that the CP 
is met. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I take your point.  It is the one that has to initiate. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Initiate, correct ja. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Now we have looked at one set of the suspensive 
conditions.  There were additional suspensive conditions which are set out in 169 
paragraph 3.1.4. 
“On or before 31 March 2016 the purchaser shall have obtained 
in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to the seller 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 179 of 204 
 
and the purchaser.  The irrevocable and unconditional consent 
of Eskom...” 
Do you see that? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  “…and release by Eskom of the Eskom 
guarantee.” 
Do you see that? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So it seems when I look at that the obligation is on 
10 
Tegeta to procure Eskom’s consent to the deal. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  The obligation is also on Tegeta to make sure that 
Optimum Coal Holdings is released from the guarantee. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is right. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Correct; but the last issue which I would like to look at 
on this agreement is the calculation of the purchase price at page 175.  Do you see 
that? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I have got it yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It is disaggregated into different components.  You will 
20 
see that insofar as the sale of shares and claim in Koornfontein there is an amount of 
R340 million which is designated as a purchase price.  Do you agree? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay and you will see that insofar as the sale of shares 
in Koornfontein is concerned I think the price is R1. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 180 of 204 
 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then insofar as the sale of the claims in OCT the 
profitable entity is concerned the purchase price is R140 million.  I ask you this because 
as an accountant if you were to account in the books of the seller the value for these 
things you will start firstly with the purchase price. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And thereafter you can value it and do your own 
financial engineering, but on date one of purchase as you account for these assets you 
will say well the purchase price is a fair value. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright and then I would ask you to go to page 227 
paragraph 12.  It deals with the rehabilitation trust.  It is a matter that is of interest to 
you and you want to, we will debate it later on, because you deal with it in the 
concluding part of your statement. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It records that there have been some investments held 
in the rehabilitation trust for both Optimum and Koornfontein and those investments at 
that point in time as at 31 January 2016 reflected a cash positive or cash equivalent 
balance of R1.75 billion.  Correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So this agreement was signed on 10 December and 
20 
this is effectively stating that by 31 January 2016 some month and a half later the 
aggregate value of those two should be no less than 1.750 and be held in cash and/or 
cash equivalents. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  So what it anticipates is that whereas you as 
Glencore would have arranged those investments differently by this date a cash or cash 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 181 of 204 
 
equivalent had to be in a trust account held for the benefit of the trust? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is right.  Just remember the Optimum Coal 
Mine is simply a beneficiary to the trust. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  The trustees determine into which assets they 
would like those funds to be invested. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  And the trustees in terms of this agreement took it 
out of long term assets and put it into cash and/or cash equivalents. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Into cash, yes.  Alright.  I have completed my evidence 
10 
relating to this agreement.  Unless you want to something about it I will take you back 
to your statement. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  No, I am fine.  Thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You deal with the fulfilment of the conditions precedent 
at page 16 and you talk about your concerns concerning question marks around the 
ability of Tegeta to fund the purchase price in paragraph 48.1. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  All I want to ask you there is why were you concerned 
that Tegeta would not have the ability to fund the purchase price at that point in time? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  They were not a publically traded organisation.  So 
20 
financial information was not available to us.  It is a substantial amount of cash.  They 
had given us assurances that they had the means with which to meet their obligations, 
but we wanted to see something beyond verbal or written assurances. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you said the banks also required something more? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes, absolutely.  So the banks we have just dealt 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 182 of 204 
 
with the conditions precedent one of which was the banking consortium which held the 
security was required to consent to the transaction and in my discussions with the bank 
consortium that was one of their fundamental components, because if we go down this 
particular path we need to make sure that when we get to the end the party has 
sufficient funds in order to meet the obligation and they had a very specific format and 
delivery mechanism that they wanted. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Which was? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Via the Swift System.  They wanted very specific 
language around proof of funding and in order to ensure the veracity and the custody 
they wanted that letter to be delivered via the Swift System which is a secure banking 
10 
system as far as I understand. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Chair Swift is something that makes sure that 
when you put in and lock in payment it gets sort quite quickly.  There is no debate about 
whether the money has gone in or not, you know, and that is why they call it Swift.  It is 
very swift. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  It is very swift, ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay, but in the end the bank could not get a letter 
secured by Swift Payment System? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  No.  What was delivered, once again unfortunately I 
do not have the exact date, but sometime after 10 December agreement was signed 
20 
and prior to the end of that month we had a meeting with the bank consortium as well 
as with representatives of Tegeta and a letter on the letterhead of the Bank of Baroda 
was presented to us.  We were not allowed to retain a copy.  We were not allowed to 
otherwise duplicate it and it essentially recorded I do not have the wording, because we 
do not have a copy that in the event that all the conditions precedent are met the 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 183 of 204 
 
company would have sufficient to discharge the 2.15-odd billion that was there. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  A portion of the purchase price. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  In paragraph 48.2 you refer to a letter that you 
received from the Bank of Baroda. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  It is at page 275 Chair. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes.  So this was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Very similar to the letter that we had been shown in 
10 
late December.  We eventually got a copy of and I cannot recall if it is an identical letter 
for obvious reasons, but it appears to be very similar to the letter that we were shown in 
December. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  This is, well the first time that the Bank of Baroda 
commits itself to funding of the purchase price on behalf of Tegeta. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Well they had committed to it in December. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  But we were not able to retain a copy of it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I understand, but this is; the letter that you annex here. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Is a letter that you ultimately got? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And you say you got it around 3 March 2016, I think. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think it is dated 4 March.  It must have been 
around then. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 184 of 204 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and what I want to understand is did you manage to 
establish why the Bank of Baroda would be so confident to guarantee payment of 
R2.15 billion on behalf of Tegeta? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  We took as read that there were sufficient funds 
through it. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  There has been some anecdotal evidence that the Bank 
of Baroda was prepared to do this because by this time Eskom had put up a R1.7 billion 
guarantee at Absa for the benefit of Tegeta.  Are you aware of such evidence? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I am aware of them now.  I was not obviously at the 
time. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  Chair I am not going to ask Mr Marsden to deal 
with the contents of the letter, because it is essentially repeats the relevant suspensive 
conditions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  That we have dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Unless you insist Mr Marsden I would move away from 
that letter. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think the only point perhaps that I could add to it, 
is that that letter did not satisfy the banking consortium.  So that CP ultimately was not 
20 
met.  How that was dealt with was given that the banks would be settled in full the legal 
opinion was you no longer require their consent.  So that particular condition precedent 
was waived rather than being met. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  They were unsatisfied with that letter given that it 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 185 of 204 
 
had not come through the protocols. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That they requested. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  The structure of payment as I understand is that 
the agreement established an escrow agent which was Werksmans. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And it is the one which was going to receive payment 
and confirm by a specific date that monies have been paid both by Optimum Holdings 
for its portion and also Oakbay for its portion. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Amongst various statutory documents, Directors 
10 
resignations, company books and records.  So they acted as the repository for what 
everybody had to deliver including importantly of course the cash. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And their view about the compliance of that part of the 
agreement was quite key? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  I mean you deal with all of those things 
Mr Marsden from paragraph, I think, page 50 sorry paragraph 50 on page 18.  I would 
like to move quite quickly. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes of course. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You say in paragraph 51: 
20 
“On 11 April you had a telephone call from Mr Howa.” 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What did he say to you? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So contextually this was post all the conditions 
being met and essentially the clock was for the funds to arrive as you mentioned in the 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 186 of 204 
 
escrow agreement.  Mr Howa mentioned to me that they were short on their 
contribution i.e. they did not have sufficient funds to meet their obligation which was 
due in two or three days’ time given that the contract CPs had been met and he 
requested me to see if the bank consortium would allow the transaction to close and 
effectively bridge them for the R600 million that they were short. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What I fund surprising is this.  That they had already 
displayed to you a letter from the Bank of Baroda which says that we are good for 2.15 
billion and that was around what?  April or March? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  March, 4 March. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  I mean his bank has already said we are good for 
10 
the money and more or less three weeks later he tells you that look we are short to the 
extent of a third of the purchase price. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I was equally surprised. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  Did he explain to you why they were short? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  He did not? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You did not ask him about the undertaking by the Bank 
of Baroda? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  We did.  He did not give us an explanation. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Must have worried you by that point in time? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think so. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And then you arranged a meeting with the consortium of 
banks and they said no, they were not prepared to fund the shortfall? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Exactly right. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And what happened thereafter? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I took that message back to Mr Howa and then we 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 187 of 204 
 
sat back and waited for the funds to arrive or not arrive. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And I am sure you must have been worried? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  We were extremely worried. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and did you get a call from Werksmans? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I was on the call with the bank that held the 
accounts and we saw the funds coming in, in tranches, live essentially and the full 
purchase price came in. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Were you able to track from which banks were the funds 
transmitted? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I do not have that information. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You do not have that information? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  No. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  What is quite clear is that Eskom advanced a 
prepayment to Tegeta under a prepayment agreement for the supply of coal.  The total 
amount that Eskom paid under that prepayment agreement was R669-odd million VAT 
inclusive? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  There is a substantial controversy around that 
prepayment and I am sure you are aware of it? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes in fact we, when we were watching, it is 
20 
covered so I do not, I do not [intervenes]. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We will get to it. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  The 34, ja. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  All I wanted to find out is when did you become aware of 
that prepayment? 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 188 of 204 
 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  On a Carte Blanche episode. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Not. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Some weeks after the transaction had [indistinct]. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Some weeks after the transaction? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Maybe even some months, yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  Alright.  I am going to ask you to go back to your 
statement. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And in paragraph 55 on page 19 you confirm that 
Werksmans as the escrow agent did confirm that the money was paid/ 
10 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Exactly right. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and then. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  The full extent of the purchase price. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  To the full extent, ja which is R2.15 billion? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Good.  Then you talk about the discharge of OCM from, 
sorry the discharge of OCH from business rescue.  So that is the parent company? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes.  It no longer has any assets or any liabilities. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  It is effectively. 
20 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes and you say it was discharge on 15 April 2016? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  Nothing substantial turns around it. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  No. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Then you talk about the funding of OCM by Tegeta, and 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 189 of 204 
 
the sale of coal to Tegeta, and this topic arises in the context of the fact that although 
the sale agreement was executed the change of ownership had not yet become 
effective. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  No, the change of ownership was effective but the 
legal entity remained in business rescue, so the entity itself has its own liabilities, its 
own creditors so we remained in control of the legal entity, it’s shareholders had simply 
changed. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Oh I see.  So it was still in business rescue that’s why 
you were present on the ground? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  And that’s why we were in operation exactly yes. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Alright, so you were controlling the business? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That’s right. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Okay, and you talk about that question of the sale of 
coal to Tegeta from paragraph 16. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:   Mmm.  
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Can I ask you to summarise that topic for us. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Sure, so even prior to the close of the transaction 
as catered for in the agreement which we’ve been through the conditions precedent 
20 
there was a requirement from 1 January 2016 that any shortfall as we’ve discussed 
there is a substantial shortfall at OCM would be required to be funded by 
Tegeta/Oakbay, so there was a post-commencement finance agreement that was put in 
place and essentially any shortfalls in the mine from the period January  until the 
transaction closed would have to be funded by Tegeta.  We did that and we were able 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 190 of 204 
 
to extract a number of draws.  What happened concurrently with that is the mine was 
designed to operate to produce just enough coal to meet the obligations of Hendriena.  
However from a risk perspective you tend to produce slightly more in the event of any 
stoppage or anything else, so on an ad hoc basis there was additional coal available for 
sale and even prior to this in 2015 any  surplus coal that we had we sold out into the 
open market, notably to Glencore in previous to 2015.  However in 2016 from sometime 
in mid-January we had two competing bids for that surplus coal, and Tegeta were able 
to offer more for that coal than Glencore.  The impact of that be it reduced their funding 
obligation in terms of the PCF, so there is both a sale of coal, the process of which gets 
paid to OCM which then subsequently reduces the need for post-commencement 
10 
finance. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   In fact I suggest to you that Tegeta is benefitting twice 
as a result of your supply of coal to them, because on the one hand they buy coal from 
you, as Optimum Coal Mine, and they pay you and that is part and parcel of their 
obligation to fund you under their post-commencement finance agreement, correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   And to the extent that they take that coal to the market 
we know that they took it to Arnot, are you aware of that fact? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes I am. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   And they sold it to Arnot at prices higher than your 
20 
would have sold to Hendriena. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I understand. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   And that were high rates. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   So they were benefitting twice. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 191 of 204 
 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I certainly understand your logic, in the event that 
they ultimately were the acquirers of OCM that kind of would come out in the wash 
because the first pocket of benefit is a funding obligation that’s not either a profit or a 
loss, but I understand your logic absolutely. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   No, no, no Mr Marsden, absent the supply of coal to 
them they would have to search in their pockets to fund? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   At that level they’re buying coal to reduce their financial 
exposure. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That’s correct. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes.  Anyway we have dealt with the issue of the post-
finance agreement, you refer to it in paragraph 62.  Chair it is part and parcel of the 
Annexures, I am not going to take Mr Marsden there, and then you explain what 
happened thereafter and you talk about your discussion with Mr Gert Opperman about 
the Hendriena coal requirements at paragraph 64. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes, it wasn’t a discussion, it was an email, we as I 
mentioned you produce just enough coal to satisfy the obligations and if there’s surplus 
you put that out into the open market, but clearly your primary obligation is to ensure 
that you first supply to Hendriena so we were requested to supply more than I thought 
was available out of that equation and then I sent an email to the mine manager at the 
20 
time to say but do we have sufficient product on the floor to enter into a third party sale, 
and the response that we got is recorded in the email from Mr Opperman whereby – by 
Hendriena not taking their full obligation they had obviously made excess available for 
us to sell to third parties. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes, Chair the email is at page 318. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 192 of 204 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’ve got it thank you. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Are you aware that sometime before December 2015 
Mr Opperman sought to motivate to his superiors and ultimately the Board of Eskom to 
authorise additional supply of coal during what he called the festive seasons? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I’m not aware no. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   You’re not aware of this, okay I will not trouble you with 
it then. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  It seems to me that you have dealt with the issues 
of the post-finance supply agreement up to page 23 paragraph 74 of your statement. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes.  You begin with the question of rehabilitation of 
10 
funds from ...(intervention)  
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Sorry Mr Maleka can I just raise one issue that I 
think is important before we do that. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I am referring to paragraph 72. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   72. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  72, because this impacts when it comes to the 
discussion around the prepayment which we no doubt will get to, then once again dates 
being fundamentally important the supply of contract draft unsigned was dated the 21 st 
of April 2016 and this related to the ongoing supply and the material terms of that 
20 
supply beyond that date which was in other words post Glencore having exited as the 
shareholder but now Tegeta coming in as the shareholder. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So that may be relevant for later, so I just wanted to 
highlight that. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 193 of 204 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   But my recollection is that although the agreement was 
not signed the parties behaved as if it was effective? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Agreed but the date at which the parties started to 
bring effect to that agreement is the 21st of April. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Okay.  Unless you have any further qualifications with 
speed I would like to go to the rehabilitation funds. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   You deal with that topic from paragraph 77, correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That’s correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   We have looked at what the agreement said in that 
10 
regard, we have looked at what the agreement contemplated in terms of the balance 
that had to be in the rehabilitation funds by the 31 st of January 2016 and you say in 
paragraph 78 that when you took appointment as BRP’s the amount standing to the 
credit of the funds was R1.456billion, correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That’s right. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   And it was invested in Standard Bank? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  When we took control as BRP it was invested in a 
number of different instruments, it was then converted to cash at this point and it was 
sitting in one lump sum in a bank account. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes, I understand that, so it had been converted as a 
20 
result of that clause in the agreement? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And it’s sitting in Standard Bank’s account.  
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  That is correct. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   I think you were here yesterday when Mr Sinton 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 194 of 204 
 
testified. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I was. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   You heard his evidence? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I did. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Is there any aspect of it that you would want to detail, 
qualify or elaborate on? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  No. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   I mean your evidence is fairly consistent with what he 
said. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I hope so. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes, in terms of the desire by Tegeta to get hold of the 
funds to transfer them into a different bank account. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   And you heard his explanation that he needed authority 
from the trustees, he needed authority from the DMR. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes I think maybe the only thing to add is further to 
that point we were equally distressed when we were made aware of that request, we 
were in the unfortunate position of being in control of the beneficiary of the trust, so we 
were in charge of OCM who was the beneficiary of the trust on behalf of the DMR but 
we were not trustees, those were appointed by Tegeta.  We also faced a further 
20 
problem in that with the closure of the bank accounts that R1.45billion had to go 
somewhere and so we were particularly concerned around where it would go, the 
manner in which it would be managed and handled by the trustees and so we sent a 
variety of documents to whoever would listen to us at the time in order to try our best to 
ensure that those funds remained intact. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 195 of 204 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   Yes.  My reading of your statement is that you were so 
concerned about the fate of the trust funds to a point where you escalated this issue 
with the Tegeta representatives to insist that they should tell you which bank was going 
to hold those funds. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think we did a lot more than that, certainly that 
was one aspect, we wanted the bank account to be in the name of the rehabilitation 
trust, as a starting point, which bank it is in is perhaps less important than the name of 
the bank account.  I think we requested assurances from the bank itself, we had a 
meeting with the bank whereby we walked them through our understanding of what the 
purpose of those trust funds were and what the ...(intervention)  
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:   When you say the bank you say the Bank of Baroda? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Bank of Baroda, absolutely and that was the 
nominated bank, sorry I missed that point, that they had done, we insisted that the 
trustees as appointed by Tegeta gave us assurances around their understanding of the 
trust funds etcetera, so you know we sent a letter to the Reserve Bank ...(intervention)  
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  At that point you escalated the matter even to the 
Reserve Bank? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  As much as possible, that’s correct yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Why were you so much concerned about the fate of the 
trust funds to a point where you even involved the engagement of SARB to deal with 
20 
the matter?  
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think we were very distressed by the request from 
Tegeta to withdraw, that Mr Sinton testified to yesterday, to withdraw the funds to this 
unknown entity and we were concerned that if we didn’t act there was the possibility 
that they may try again. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 196 of 204 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Do you know that there was litigation commenced by 
one of the NGO’s, if I’m not mistaken I think it was an Organisation for Undoing Tax 
Abuse, OUTA, against the trustees and some entities in the Oakbay stable, about 
allegations of abuse over trust funds, are you aware of that litigation? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Not in detail but I’m aware that it exists. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think the Public Protector also made some findings 
with regards to (indistinct) the funds in her report as well. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So what you feared then ultimately led to litigation? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  So it seems as if you knew something more at that point 
in time when you were trying to make sure that the funds of the trusts are secure. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think I’m professional cynic as a start, but certainly 
the actions of Ms Ragavan as highlighted by Mr Sinton would have heightened those 
concerns. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay, alright.  You deal with the next topic which is the 
Carte Blanche story at page 28, paragraph 94 of your statement.  Chair I see it’s 
already past four, I think we are reaching the conclusion of Mr Marsden’s evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no I think we can finish. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We can finish, thank you Chair.  You deal with it from 
20 
paragraph 94. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What gave rise to your concerns immediately after you 
watched this episode of Carte Blanche? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  So there were two episodes across two weeks that 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 197 of 204 
 
were aired by investigative journalists and specifically Carte Blanche and a number of 
articles following on that and there was a full interview with Mr Howa which was 
available on the website and obviously given our interest I watched those and pursuant 
to the interview I learnt for the first time that Eskom had actually made a pre-payment to 
Tegeta for the purchase of coal from Tegeta, an amount of R586 excluding VAT and the 
coal for which the prepayment was made appear to have been or was procured from 
Optimum Coal Mine.  I came to learn from the episodes, the interviews and the articles 
that the prepayment was approved by a committee of Eskom late in the evening at nine 
o’clock on the 11th of April coincidentally the same date that I had been requested to 
ask the banks for the bridging finance and for a very similar amount, so pursuant 
10 
interview Mr Howa also remarked that the prepayment had been made to the basis that 
OCM, which was in BR and therefore under my control, required money for its liquidity, 
which was factually inaccurate and for the start-up of equipment which was also 
inaccurate.  The prepayment was not made to OCM, we did not receive any 
prepayment and from April 2016 in fact the coal that we supplied to Tegeta that they on-
supplied was actually on 30 day payment terms as well, so the events surrounding the 
prepayment came as a surprise in terms of the quantum and in terms of the timing with 
the knowledge that I had of the meeting of 11th of April and in that context myself and 
my fellow practitioners submitted our reports in terms of 34. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes, I would like to establish some few facts from you in 
20 
relation to immediately what you learnt from the episodes of Carte Blanche. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  By the time you conclude the sale agreement Mr Howa 
was someone that was well known to you. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 198 of 204 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Even thereafter it was someone that was known to you, 
correct? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Absolutely. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Did you have any engagements with him as the 
representative or the new owner. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:   Extensive yes.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  In any of those engagements did he disclose to you that 
there were negotiations relating to prepayment between Tegeta and Eskom? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  No. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Did he ever disclose to you that Tegeta would approach 
10 
Eskom to talk about any funds relating to the operational requirements of OCM? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  No. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Why do you think that he would go to Carte Blanche and 
say things about OCM which he did not talk to you, it must have been obvious to him 
that you would be amongst persons who have the primary knowledge of the true facts. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I presume so. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  And that when he goes public around misstatements of 
fact you will obviously reveal the truth set of facts as you did. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I would hope so. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  What would be the reason for him to do so, I am asking 
20 
you an unfair question but you are the only person who can help us for now? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I think that they may have been caught by surprise 
at the fact that the prepayment was made and the fact that that was then publically 
available may have caught them off-guard and in an attempt to justify he maybe he 
complicated the issue with the statements of mis-facts. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 199 of 204 
 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You know what I find surprising with this and maybe it 
should be a proposition I put on the table Chair is that this project of State Capture 
goes about making public statements that are untrue in the light of information which is 
captured on documentation, as if this information would not at some point become 
public, because I don’t understand from the example that we are dealing with that Mr 
Howa would know that you, a BRP, essentially a public representative in a company, 
that is in financial distress and that you have the facts at your disposal and yet he will 
go about making statements publically that are untrue.  I really don’t understand how he 
would have expected that a public representative such as you would keep quiet once 
the untruths are told by him in public. 
10 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I can’t answer that unfortunately.   
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright, you can’t answer that but what you can answer 
is your last leg of the BRP process. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  You deal with it in page 30 paragraph 101. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Yes, so effective in mid-April OCH was discharged, 
we had new shareholders at OCM, but OCM itself remained in business rescue until it 
could satisfy practitioners that it was no longer financially distressed, and the test in 
that regard is a six month test. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  In terms of the Companies Act, that it will 
reasonably be able to meet its obligations as they fall due in the ensuing six months.  
We requested therefore a couple of things had to be achieved in order to satisfy that 
requirement; number one all of the pre-commencement creditors, ie the creditors who 
were stuck in the moratorium from the date of business rescue, needed to be satisfied, 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65

in the absence of a plan, so we ensured that all of those creditors had either been paid 
or signed settlement agreements.  The second test is that – the six month looking test, 
so we interrogated the financial forecast that was provided to us by Tegeta, it did show 
a shortfall, not as big as the numbers that we had done, largely as a result of the 
increase in supply of excess coal to Tegeta, and we ensured that we had confirmation 
from the bank that they had the resources to meet that shortfall and they subordinated 
all of their claims in favour of other creditors, and in that context we deemed that OCM 
was not longer financially distressed.  Sorry, one important point, the issue of the 
R2billion fine we believe that an arbitration proceeding would not be resolved within the 
ensuing six months and therefore it did not fall within the jurisdiction of the six month 
10 
test.   
 
So on that basis we deemed that the company was no longer financially 
distressed and we discharged it from business rescue.  
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Alright.  There are two concluding points that I would like 
to raise with you, the first is that it is now clear that the penalties, the R2.1billion 
arbitration claim were ultimately settled between Eskom and Tegeta, at about 
R255million, are you aware of that fact? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I’ve heard about it yes. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay, as the BRP’s you did not have the occasion to 
assess and value a reasonable estimate of the penalties did you? 
20 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  No we didn’t. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay, the next thing is you know that Tegeta, sorry not 
Tegeta, Optimum Coal Mine experienced a second business rescue process. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Is experiencing I think still. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay, fair enough, it is still in business rescue.  Do you 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 201 of 204 
 
know the grounds on which it was put in business rescue? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I do  not. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay, I think you have indicated that the mine is no 
longer operational? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I can suspect – I just had a thought.  I think the 
rationale given, and I have not seen the sworn statement but from the press reports I 
believe it is as a result of the closure of the bank accounts, as the purported reason. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Yes.  You’re correct, the reason is they could not operate 
because the bank accounts were closed, but we had evidence that this mine is no 
longer operational, are you aware of that fact? 
10 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I am. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Okay.  From your knowledge what’s happening to that 
mine? 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  I have no direct knowledge of what’s happened but 
of course I keep my ear relatively close to the ground, and my understanding is given 
the financial constraints it’s faced it is not in the condition that it was in when we 
discharged it from business rescue. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Right.  Chair that would be the end of our questions to 
Mr Marsden. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Mr Marsden, should we require you again you 
20 
will be contacted but for now you are excused. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  With pleasure, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair I take it that Mr Marsden is released for going 
back to Canada, he is on a flight tonight, we won’t need him tomorrow. 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 202 of 204 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes, it would be quite expensive to require him.  Yes no thank 
you, you are excused, thank you for coming. 
MR PIERS MICHAEL MARSDEN:  Thank you very much, I am both relieved and 
released. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair the next witness is Dr Ramontja, I see that it is 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  And he was ready ...(intervention)  
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  He was ready since yesterday, we released him, he has 
been here and he has been kind enough and tolerant to accommodate us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How much time do we need for him? 
10 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair I think even if we were start today I won’t finish, 
but I’m aware that tomorrow you have other things, I won’t need more than an hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, you won’t need more than an hour, and how is his situation? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  I believe that he is here and he is represented. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, in terms of tomorrow? 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Oh he indicates that he will accommodate us once 
again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, okay, that’s fine, maybe we should – what if we start at 
half past nine in terms of the arrangement for this week. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  We can start at nine. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which is likely to go on for some time, I am thinking that maybe we 
should start at nine, but it depends on whether we will be able to use the rest of the day 
fully, number one, number two, whether Dr Ramontja he wishes to finish and rush or 
whether he will be more or less quite flexible in case we start at half past nine he can 
still be around until we are finished in an hour or hour and a half’s time, I have a 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65 
 
Page 203 of 204 
 
suspicion he will not mind. 
ADV VINCENT MALEKA SC:  Chair would he accommodate us if we start at nine with 
the view to finish at ten. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m thinking we – I am thinking about that but I would like not to do 
that unless the situation compels us to, maybe let me start by saying and I say – Ms 
Norman is looking at you and at me, what is the situation about the rest of the day, I 
know we have a witness that’s scheduled for tomorrow, but is he likely to take the whole 
day. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman, Pretorius SC had indicated that 
we might have a few hours available to us if we do not finish with some of the Eskom 
10 
witnesses tomorrow, he doesn’t think that he will take the whole day with the witness for 
tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Mr Pretorius yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay how many witnesses other than apart from Dr Ramontja are we 
looking at for tomorrow? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  For tomorrow only one as far as I understand, only Dr 
Ramontja yes.  Oh, and also Mr Nene tomorrow, that’s the witness yes, but according 
to him he said – he offered in the morning that if there is one witness that we can’t 
finish today we will have time for that witness tomorrow. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but do we know how long Mr Nene is likely to be? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Not the entire day according to Mr Mokena yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not the entire day, well then in that event I would only we say at nine 
o’clock if Dr Ramontja would be inconvenienced a lot if we start at half past nine and 
finish half past ten, eleven or thereabouts.  Maybe he might be – or if he is represented 
13 MARCH 2019 – DAY 65

here somebody might be indicate.  Do you want to come forward and indicate? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR KOMA RAMONTJA:  Good afternoon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good afternoon yes. 
MR KOMA RAMONTJA:  Koma Ramontja from Koma Ramontja Attorneys on behalf of 
Dr Ramontja, I have consulted with Dr Ramontja, we don’t have a problem, either we 
start at nine o’clock or half past nine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Half past nine, there’s no problem. 
MR KOMA RAMONTJA:  Yes, we are comfortable with that time. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no thank you very much.  Okay then in that event let’s start at 
half past nine tomorrow.  We will adjourn the proceedings for today and we will start at 
half past nine tomorrow morning.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 14 MARCH 2019
