PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 4 DECEMBER 2019  
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Sello. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Good morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning everybody. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that when we are going to have this technical 
evidence of Mr Chabi we do not have any journalists at the back.  I 
think Mr Chabi chased them away with all the technical terms.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Perhaps Chair it might be they prefer to follow 
it on TV. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well maybe this is because we are starting early 
they will come later. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Later.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Chabi. 
MR CHABI:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us – I think let us just redo the oath and – or 
affirmation?  I think Ms Sello yesterday we were dealing with the types 
of evidence – you not listening to me. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I apologise Chair.  I got distracted.  My 
apologies. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – Ms Molefe is much more compelling too.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  She is a persuasive junior that I will admit.  
Chair I do apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She is powerful.  But it is not her fault.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Not at – it is mine Chair. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196

CHAIRPERSON:  Now I was saying that yesterday we were listening to 
evidence that is very non -technical. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Very non-technical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Very non-technical and after Mr Chabi we will listen 
to evidence that is very non-technical. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Still. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record?  
MR CHABI:  My name is Alister Ouemakoua Chabi.  
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed 
10 
oath? 
MR CHABI:  I do not. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MR CHABI:  I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence which you will give will 
be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth, if so please 
raise your right hand and say, so help me God.  
MR CHABI:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  I think to the extent that it is necessary – 
20 
it may be necessary to refresh our memories just a little bit with what – 
on what Mr Chabi testified about last time.  You may do so but I think if 
at all possible let us not stretch it.  Let us do only insofar as it is really 
necessary. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 4 of 168 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got – we have got two other witnesses coming 
up today. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Understood. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we would like to – I would like us to finish as soon 
as possible without doing any injustice to Mr Chabi’s evidence.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair.  In anticipation of that we have 
taken the liberty to prepare something that we call a working tool.  It is 
a little document we are going to hand over to the Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And basically it is to extract the salient issues 
10 
coming out of Mr Chabi’s eveidence last Wednesday.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Last time. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And confine ourselves really to those aspects 
that are relevant to the issue he will be speaking to.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We all have a copy we can just – he will … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Chabi will lead us very briefly – quickly 
20 
through it [indistinct] copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then we get to the issue at hand for 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 5 of 168 
 
today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We have also prepared for you Chair a 
glossary of terms. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes that is…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is – the glossary of terms will in time form 
part of your file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it is… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes the working document is just for today to 
help us work through the next part of the evidence.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is the glossary of terms is not paginated yet 
because it is assumed it is not final.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hml. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As we go through his evidence today it might 
grow and we will update and then…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Update your file accordingly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  So the first document the 
20 
landscaped document is what we call a summary of Mr Chabi’s p revious 
evidence.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 6 of 168 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it is that which Mr Chabi will take us 
through very quickly now.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Just so we – we locate ourselves in h is 
statement the Chair will recall that at paragraph 2.1 of Mr Chabi’s 
statement he sets out he tasks that he had to undertake.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The first was to review the business case of 
38.6 billion and the second was to assess the  accuracy of the 38.6 
billion.  The third was to identify the reasons for the increase from 38.6 
10 
to 54 billion.  And then to test the possibility of the reasons advanced 
for that increase.  The first two is what we dealt with last week which is 
– and he is conclusion was that he was happy with the review – with 
the business case itself and he considered that the ETC Estimated 
Total Cost of 38.6 billion fully validated.  What we then are going to 
deal with today is the final aspect.  Now Mr Chabi we have pre pared 
this little table for ourselves to try and understand where you were at 
last week so that we are better able to follow your evidence today.  If 
you could just quickly take us through the document – the work tool 
that we provided you with?  
20 
MR CHABI:  Okay.  Thank you Advocate.  I can just starting off Chair 
with page 1 I think.  What we looked at to start off with having read the 
mandate address what the mandate required of us was the review of 
the business case.  We looked at the – how revenue was modelled in 
the business case.  We looked at the sub -variables making up revenue 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 7 of 168 
 
components, tariffs, volume, and distance.  We also looked at how the 
costs components were modelled.  And I think all of those were over a 
36 year period.  We then went on to loot at where ETC fell within that.  
We were happy that their assumptions in relation to those variables 
were reasonable.  And as [indistinct] which they were escalated over 
the period.  And then just to highlight the components making up 
revenue as we looked at them.  We looked at the total cost of 
ownership and those relate to the immediate costs of acquiring and 
operating the locomotive.  We looked at the infrastructure costs.  We 
looked at the wagon costs.  We looked at overhead and tax costs.  We 
10 
spoke a bit of how tax was modelled.  We were happy with the way it 
was done because it was conservative.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Just before – just before you go overleaf you 
– you have a point there and Chair this is – this being a working 
document sometimes it is corrected and amended by hand.  We 
apologise.  We – you indicate that the NPV was validated?  
MR CHABI:  Correct so we were happy with the final result of 2.7 
billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that – as we said last week that is just 
basically profit. 
20 
MR CHABI:  It is. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Over the life of the project. 
MR CHABI:  Over the life of the project.  Correct.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Over the life of the project yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Correct.  We then went on to test the accuracy of the 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 8 of 168 
 
38.6 billion delving into the components of the 38.6 billion and we 
looked at the forex costs – the forex hedging costs allowed for 
[indistinct] okay.  We also looked at the inflation costs allowed for and 
we looked at inflation locally and inflation abroad.  In this insta nce we 
used the US as an indicator of the inflation abroad.  We were happy 
with the – the assumptions made around those variables and the 
inclusion of those variables.  We found them to be reasonable, 
justifiable in the business case.  Also to note that th e 38.6 billion 
included continuance costs of about R2.2 billion.  So we were happy 
with that figure.   
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay you then briefly deal with the question 
of profitability at 38.6 billion. 
MR CHABI:  Correct.  So on the profitability end we lo oked at the 
present value of the revenue which sat about R109 billion.  We had a 
slide on that.  We also looked at the present value of a cost which sat 
at about R106 billion.  In that R106 billion you had ETC costs of 38.6 
billion but as mentioned the R10 6 billion is the present value of all 
costs.  So the present value of the ETC and I think we touched it very 
high level on this was about R20 billion.  That is when you bring back 
the ETC costs of 38.6 billion to current terms.  At that time it was 18 
20 
April 2013.  We spoke about Transnet’s hurdle rate at the time which 
was 18.56 %.  And we also did some sensitivity analysis around that 
rate to give you Chair an indication of how that profit of 2.7 billion 
varied or changed with the change in the risk and in  the hurdle rate.    
Sorry so the hurdle rate was also – was equal to the risk discount rate 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 9 of 168 
 
in this instance.  Apologies.  I think we touched of this – the nett 
present value reflects the profitability of the project.  In fact we used 
profitability and nett present value synonymously in last week’s 
presentation.  We also spoke about a lower of the hurdle rates in this 
case also the risk discount rate resulting in an increase in your profit 
position in this instance the nett present value.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So – so the hurdle rate at 18.56 gives an NPV 
of 2.7 billion? 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But is that NPV were to reduce – no if that 
10 
hurdle rate were to reduce say to 14 we expect a higher NPV.  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Because the higher profit. 
MR CHABI:  Correct.  In fact the 12.56 which was the weighted average 
cost of capital.  Essentially which just collectively what your capital 
providers are levying on you to give you the capital.  And I say 
collective because we are looking at debt and equity in this instance.  
Okay.  The weight average cost of capital at the time was 12.56%. At 
12.56% the profitability of the project was around R34.1 billion.  Okay.  
It is an indication that that profitability increases as you lower your 
20 
discounts or hurdle rate. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So would we be correct then in drawing the 
conclusion that the hurdle rate is – is one of the tools that in this case 
Transnet used to determine whether the project is profitable or not an 
to enable Transnet to take the appropriate decision about that going 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 10 of 168 
 
forward with the project or not?  
MR CHABI:  It is was a key parameter in determining the profitability of 
the project. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.   Thank you, you may continue.  
MR CHABI:  We move onto … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We move onto forex and escalation now.  
MR CHABI:  Okay.  We also looked at forex hedging and that was a – 
well it was a discussion to be had considering that the mandate 
required asked to determine whether 3.6 billion allowed for forex 
hedging costs and inflation.  So we discussed that at length and went 
10 
as far as validating [indistinct] that is inflation as opposed to.  Okay.  It 
is [indistinct]. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR CHABI:  Okay so forex hedging escalation cost were considered 
amongst other variables.  So we looked at other variables outside of 
ETC as mentioned to be able to speak the 2.7 you had to look at the 
project in its entirety and not just the ETC which made up a – a tiny 
proportion of the total cost.  In this instance 20%  of the total project 
costs and about 47% of the total cost of ownership.  Okay.  So we were 
happy with those variables.   
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR CHABI:  I think the next page just speaks to the definition of what 
hedging is. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then you deal specifically – you told – you 
just us that you considered two factors which the forex hedging.  
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 11 of 168 
 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  On the one hand and inflation on the other.  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And your mandate required you to determine 
whether they were included in the 38.6 billion ETC. So from your page 
4 at – under 4 you first deal with forex hedging and if one looks 
overleaf you deal with inflation. 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So just so we understand the co ncepts and 
how they apply just briefly take us through page 4 as regards forex and 
10 
then you move over to the inflation overleaf.  
MR CHABI:  Okay.  So hedging as I explained the last session was – is 
simply a transaction that you enter into to eliminate ris k.  We spoke 
about forex hedging in this instance.  So to protect – Transnet to 
protect itself against the changes in values resulting from fluctuations 
in the foreign currency in the future would have entered or would have 
had its suppliers enter into a hedging so that the cost is not passed on 
to them.  Okay.  At the very least would have entered into those 
transactions itself if it found that the OEM’ s costs were excessive.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
20 
MR CHABI:  Yes by the policy requirements.  I mean y ou can hedge 
almost anything.  I see you have highlighted there some of the 
elements you could hedge.  You can hedge almost anything.  In this day 
and age you can price almost anything, you can hedge almost anything.  
I think some of the things you can hed ge are commodities, maize, oil.  
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 12 of 168 
 
So anything that you can price essentially can be hedged.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that would be the price going forward?  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So you are hedging what is yet to happen.  
MR CHABI:  What is yet to come. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja. 
MR CHABI:  That is correct.  Yes.  In this instance we were largely 
concerned with the hedging of foreign exchange risk.  And to a certain 
extent inflation but I think we will touch on that.  And the idea was to 
pass the inflation costs onto the OEM’s but then there were alternatives 
10 
that Transnet could have looked at.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where inflation costs were concerned.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So if – if you enter into a long term seven 
year contract of which are component the price thereof is reflected in 
foreign currency you would – it make – it is prudent to hedge that 
currency going forward?  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is that what …  
MR CHABI:  The policy required Transnet to do so.  So  you would 
20 
actually hedge the escalated price.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  And the effect of that would be if the 
fluctuation – if the fluctuation is adverse to the rand going forward you 
are locked into a lower rate of exchange as at the date of concluding  
the hedging agreement. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 13 of 168 
 
MR CHABI:  That is correct.  So with hedging you give up any upside.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja. 
MR CHABI:  And you also give up – you also protect yourself against 
the downside.  In this instance because as mentioned Transnet did not 
want – wanted to eliminate the risk not take advantage of upside and 
protect the downside.  That is partial hedging.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR CHABI:  So in this instance it was full hedge giving up the upside. 
So if the rand did well Transnet will not b enefit from it.  If the rand did 
poorly Transnet will not suffer from it.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Thank you.  Then I think we can deal 
with the inflation issue.  
MR CHABI:  We also looked at the inclusion of inflation which is 
synonymous with escalation  costs in the case of 3.6 billion. We looked 
at the assumptions around inflation on the local side.  The assumptions 
around inflation on the foreign side.  We were happy with those 
assumptions. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now let us remind ourselves why do we look  
at both local and foreign. 
MR CHABI:  Because the locomotive had a foreign component and a 
20 
local component.  It would have acquired the foreign component 
abroad.  So that would have been subjected to foreign economic 
conditions.  In this instance the Unit ed States. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the local component would then be South 
– subjected to South African conditions?  
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 14 of 168 
 
MR CHABI:  Economic – correct.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR CHABI:  Correct.  So you had to look at both economies and allow 
for the variations in those economies on the price of the locomotive.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And – and – we have heard from previous 
witnesses such as Mr Callard and MNS who conducted an investigation 
into this transaction that the production of the locomotives was on 
average split as to 60% foreign component and 40% local component.  
But each OEM manufacturer had provided their own split between 
foreign and local components.  
10 
MR CHABI:  Okay so the requirement on diesel locomotives was 55 as 
per the Department of Trade and  Industry requirements – sorry – 55 
local components. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR CHABI:  For diesel locomotives and 40% minimum 55% had to be 
acquired locally. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR CHABI:  Sourced locally – manufactured locally.  That is on the 
diesel end.  On the electric end a minimum of 60% had to be 
manufactured locally. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now on those percentages for electric and 
diesel that is where we will apply the South African economic 
conditions? 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 15 of 168 
 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The remainder then would then be sourced 
from abroad? 
MR CHABI:  It would be subjected to foreign economic conditions.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR CHABI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then would we be correct in  concluding 
that in calculating inflation going forward you must be mindful of that 
local foreign split? 
MR CHABI:  You must be. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And apply the inflation of – on the local 
component – you apply to the local component the South African 
inflation rates and you apply to the foreign component the foreign rate?  
MR CHABI:  That is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR CHABI:  And each OEM would have provided their foreign 
components at the time of the negotiation but I suppose we will deal 
with that a bit later. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So we are happy with the variables 
using the R38.6 billion validation exercise when we analysed the 
20 
financial model.  PPI which is a producer price index – producer price 
inflation okay was applied locally.  On  the foreign the United States CPI 
was applied.  I ideally would have preferred as mentioned last week 
PPI to have been applied on that component – on the foreign 
component however having analysed the differences between CPI and 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 16 of 168 
 
PPI we found them to be very highly correlated and positively so.  The 
difference has been very marginal to the tune of about 0.3%.  The 
impact on the 38.6 billion was also negligible so we were happy with 
the assumptions. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So then it is on – on this basis inter 
alia that you make you conclusion at page 6.  
MR CHABI:  Correct.  So in concluding the 38.6 billion as per the 
recommendations of the mandate included forex hedging costs.  So 
they allowed for foreign currency hedging costs.  They included 
escalation costs locally and abroad.  And the 38.6 billion was an 
10 
acceptable estimated total cost for the 1064 locomotives.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Just briefly talk to us about the rates to – for 
inflation to be applied where accepting that inflation is a forward 
looking calculation of inflation.  It is a forward looking exercise where – 
we just do not dream up numbers they come from somewhere.  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So in order the validate firstly whether 
inflation was applied and whether it was appli ed at a correct rate, what 
do we have regard to? 
MR CHABI:  Okay so ideally you want to look at what inflation has been 
20 
historically. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR CHABI:  And that is on the PPI end.  If my recollection serves me 
right.  It was about – on the PPI end it was about 3.6% I think over ten 
years and about 5.4% over five years.  I will have to check that again.  
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 17 of 168 
 
I do not have the facts at hand.  What was applied in the business case 
was a figure ranging from 5.7 to about 5.9.  You also want to look  at 
what the market implies in going forward and you often get that from 
instruments on the market.  Floating rate – sorry floating rate notes 
versus nominal bonds.  At the time what the market had implied going 
forward was about 5.7%.  What you would have  gotten at the time on a 
ten year government bond was about 8%.  It was between 8 and 9%.  I 
think what you would have gotten on a floating rate note at the time 
was about 2% thereabouts.  I think looking at the average over that 
month in April what was implied was about 5.7%. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You do – you do at page 5 indicate that both 
indices can be measured and compared locally and to do so we obtain 
our information from Stats SA.  
MR CHABI:  On inflation correct.  You also obtain information from 
Stats SA and Stats SA will give you the historical inflation rates.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR CHABI:  And hence my comment on the history what it has been in 
the past but BOSS is not always a good indication of what you can 
expect going forward.  So you hav e got to look at in addition to what 
the market [indistinct] imply policies very key. We have got our own 
20 
monetary policy committee here which – of which has one of its targets 
to limit inflation between 3 and 6%.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And insofar as an international component is 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 18 of 168 
 
concerned. 
MR CHABI:  You adopt the same approach.  You look at those.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And what organisations do we look for for – to 
obtain that information so in planning a projec t we can apply the 
correct inflation rates going forward.  
MR CHABI:  Well wherever you can obtain inflation data from – on the 
United States the EU.  You have got the OECD.  OECD produces 
inflation information, inflation both PPI and CPI.  I am going back 
historic data.  Provides historic data on those two variables.  You have 
got the Federal Reserve Bank of San Louis, Fred also does the same.  
10 
Trade Economics.  So all of these various sites provide you with 
historical information.  We looked at the vast ma jority of them just to 
ensure that what we were getting was consistent and it was consistent.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So if – if – would I be correct then in 
concluding that if two people worked on the same project and each was 
to independently provide for inflation going forward both locally and on 
the foreign component they should in all probability arrive at the same 
figures as to what the inflation will be because they are working off the 
same base information. 
MR CHABI:  Well not necessarily the same figures going forward okay 
20 
but they should not be too far apart.  You would not expect their 
projection of the inflation going forward to be too far apart.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  What is an acceptable margin of the 
difference between the two?  
MR CHABI:  I would say about 0.5%. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 19 of 168 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  .5%. 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the – what I arrive at and what you arrive 
– no not I because I could not never but if another accountant or 
actuary were to arrive at a figure for inflation going forward an d you did 
the same exercise you would expect a margin of 0.5% difference?  
MR CHABI:  Difference between the two ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Thank you.  So Chair that is where we 
parted last week Wednesday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I must just say that I mean last time we 
10 
struggled for some time. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With me hearing his evidence and at some stage I 
would hear him quite well and I think that is when he would sit a little 
bit distance from the microphone and so on.  But then of course he 
would raise his voice then it would be audible, then it would go down.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I saw a clip on television where he was giving 
evidence and listening on TV his evidence was very audible, very clear.  
So I do not know whether there is something with the technical stuff we 
20 
are using that those who are watching on TV will hear him very well and 
certainly I sometimes do not and sometimes I do.  But it is okay we will 
– we will just continue and at least the transcript will be there. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes but in listening to his sum -up Chair I was 
of the view that the audio had improved even on the – in the room not 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 20 of 168 
 
much? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is not as bad as …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As it was then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was at some stage last time.  Because it was not 
bad throughout.  There were times when it was okay.  There were times 
when it was not so okay.  So it is not as bad as it was at some stage so 
– so it is fine I can hear sometimes, sometimes I can hear but it i s 
okay.  We are two – we have gone – we have advanced too far to try 
anything new. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Anything new. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja let us just continue and try the tricks that we were 
trying last time. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then –  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then Mr Chabi is to bear in mind that perhaps 
– you – watch out that your voice does not dip.  
MR CHABI:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Because then I think that is when you become 
most inaudible. 
CHAIRPERSON: Ja. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And if you do sometimes and I hear it I will 
step in and remind you to raise your voice.  
CHAIRPERSON:  No that – if it becomes too bad I will tell you also 
then we will see but … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hopefully it does not get bad Chair.  
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 21 of 168 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja let us hope it does not get bad.  Okay alright.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So Chair then – with that summary of the 
evidence coming out of last week we are technically now at page 36 of 
Mr Chabi’s statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  36? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  36 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  I wonder why you say technically.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I wonder why you say technically.  I thought you say – 
you said we are technically at page 36.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I say technically because we had started it 
but I am restarting it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  In order for the remainder to make 
sense it is necessary again to retrace our steps.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You have got your statement with you Mr 
Chabi?  BB8B1.  Oh you used it as a -  
20 
MR CHABI:  As a pedestal. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Then if you could just turn to page 36 
of that file.  From you paragraph 9.47 you in part deal with the original 
ETC of 38.6 billion right.  You introduce a memorandum – no before I 
say that let me retrace my steps.  Just remind us when was the 38.6 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 22 of 168 
 
billion ETC approved? 
MR CHABI:  To my recollection it was sometime in April.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of which year? 
MR CHABI:  2013 sorry. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the 36 – 38.6 billion is approved April 
2013.  We are now according to your paragraph in 2014 because you 
refer us to a memorandum dated 23 May 2014.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  According to which paragraph?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  9.4-7 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then that memorandum is - is annexed as 
AC5.  You confirm that?  Mr  Chabi. 
MR CHABI:  Just checking.  Confirm.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR CHABI:  It is. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now your - your AC5 as at page 165 of your 
file is a document running into some 20 pages and it appears at the 
last page at page 182 to have been signed and/or recommended by the 
Group Chief Financial Officer of Transnet.  TFR Chief Executive and 
that is Transnet Freight. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you say that document ends at page 1-2-2? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  1-8-2 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  182? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  1-8-2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 23 of 168 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It runs from …  
CHAIRPERSON:  On the same page where his statement is?  On the 
same bundle? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  In the same bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  One … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It starts at 1-6-5.  It is AC5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It starts at 165? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  165 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it is Annexure AC5. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is before the divider Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why did I think I was hearing page 85?  A 
memorandum at page 85. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I apologise.  I - I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  165 going up to …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
 
The 
Chair 
confirms 
that 
that 
is 
the 
memorandum.  It is - it is on a Transnet letterhead. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That document runs up to page 1-8-2. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you and I am just pointing out that at 
page 1-0-2 that it is signed by the Group - the then Group Chief 
Financial Officer of Transnet.  It is recommended by him.  Followed by 
the TFR Chief Executive and TFR would be Transnet Freight and the 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 24 of 168 
 
Group Chief Executive and it is signed by the three of them betw een 
the period 21 May and the last signature is 23  May 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was wondering why all the people who signed on 
page 182 were recommending and there was nobody approving, but that 
is because it was addressed to the Board to approve.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We have encountered this memorandum 
10 
before in - with other witnesses Chair, but we did not deal with the 
figures set out therein and just to - to remind ourselves as - as 
Mr Chabi has pointed out the 38.6 billion was approved by the Transnet 
Board in April 2013.  From then there were bids and there were the 
evaluations and you know all the necessary steps that go with public 
procurement and in May 2014 this memorandum is generated and 
presented to the Board. 
The purpose of which was to seek Board approval to increase 
the 38.6 billion ETC to 54.9 billion.  Mr  Chabi - 50 - 54.5.  I always get 
the figures wrong.  Thank you Mr  Chabi.  Mr Chabi’s task here was to 
20 
test the validity of that increase and as his statement indicates he does 
so with reference to the same memorandum, because the memorandum 
sets out the basis on which that - that increase is justified. 
He then looks at the various factors adv anced in support of 
that increase and then expresses a view on them and the basis for why 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 25 of 168 
 
his view is different where it is different.  So that is what we will be 
dealing with.  Am I correctly summarising what you are about to do?  
MR CHABI:  That is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And of course what would be important is to see 
whether the information and motivation that was placed before the 
Board is correct information and the motivation whether it is sound and 
there was no misleading information placed before the Board.  That - 
that would also be important quite apart from any information or 
motivation that might be wrong but bona fide.  
10 
So one would look for wrong information that might be placed 
before the Board which is not bona fide, but maybe placed before the 
Board to achieve an approval in circumstances where there should be 
no approval.  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I - I seem to recall that previously last 
Wednesday you had that summary - the table 1 - the executive 
summary as appears at page 1 of that memorandum on - on a screen.  
Do - was I - was I correct?  Am I correct or I have looked at it so often 
20 
that I - sometimes I assume that it is on your screen.  When in fact it i s 
only in hard copy. 
MR CHABI:  Is that what you are referring to?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  Yes.  Your slide 24.  Correct.  
MR CHABI:  Okay. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 26 of 168 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR CHABI:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And - and we did touch on this last week 
Wednesday and you said what we have on - on slide 24 is basically 
directly extracted from page 165 of the memorandum under executive 
summary. 
MR CHABI:  Correct.  Thanks advocate. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If you may then take us through it.  
MR CHABI:  Okay.  I think before I jump into the table which is on page 
1 of the memorandum.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR CHABI:  The recommendation to the Board to increase the ETC 
from 38.6 billion to 54.5 billion is on the basis and in this instance I 
quote directly from page 1-8-2 of the memorandum that: 
“The cost of 38.6 billion - 0.6 billion - presented to 
the Board excluded the cost of hedging for foreign 
exchange movements.  The cost of future inflation 
escalation for foreign exchange.”  
Oh sorry. 
“On price.  The cost of additional scope for 
20 
Transnet Engineering.  The cost of changes in 
economic conditions and in this instance forex and 
inflation between the approval of the business case 
and award of the contract.”  
Approval of the business case in this instance being 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 27 of 168 
 
April 2013 and award of the contract being March 2014.  The point of 
the exercise done initially was to show that the 38.6 billion allowed for 
all of those factors except for the cost of additional TE scope.  When 
we broke the 38.6 billion.  Nowhere in there did we speak about 
additional TE scope. 
We spoke about a local - localisation (indistinct) of two 
percent.  However we were informed that that did not relate to the 
Transnet Engineering scope. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  (Indistinct). 
MR CHABI:  So - sorry. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry.  Before we go into that - sorry.  My 
apologies.  Before we go into that detail let us take it a step at a time.  
Sorry.  You - you summarise what the memorandum puts forward as to 
the rationale for the increase and you - you point out that one of the 
rationale put forward is that the 38.6 billion did not - did not provide for 
forex hedging? 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Now before we move on.  Can you 
express a view on that?  
MR CHABI:  It - it allowed for foreign currency. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The 38.6? 
MR CHABI:  The hedging costs. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now are you able to say how they could say it did not 
allow for forex when it actually - it did?  How much room is there that 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 28 of 168 
 
they were just genuinely mistaken  in saying that?  How much room is 
there that this was deliberate misleading of the Board?  
MR CHABI:  Okay.  So I cannot say why that reason was advanced or 
that view was advanced.  However I can put forward a view and I think 
we touched on this in the presentation last week.  It is reasonable to 
question whether what was allowed for in terms of forex was foreign 
exchange hedging costs or just a view on the exchange rate going 
forward. 
In other words forecasted rates.  I think any reasonable 
person would have said well maybe what you saw in the business case 
10 
was not in relation to hedging costs, but it was just a view on the 
exchange rate going forward.  In the submission last week - the 
statement last week we show that the curve that was used in modelling 
the ETC was actually a forward exchange curve.  
How do we verify that?  We took the cash flows over the 
seven year period.  Approached market players and asked them to 
provide us with a curve as at 18 April 2013 going forward seven years.  
That was done allowing for two of the major banks - two major - well 
two of the major banks South Africa’s costs to facilitate the transaction.  
So the curve that we showed in relation to what was applied 
20 
within the business case were pretty much in line.  I think there were  
slight differences of about 0.03 percent there, but you would expect 
that based on the provider of the contract.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that Chair what Mr - Mr Chabi has just 
explained to us is reflected at slide 14 when last week he did a 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 29 of 168 
 
comparison between the rates used by Transnet and the business case 
for 38.6 billion and to test whether those were actual foreign currency 
forward rates. 
He obtained the same rates for that period from Bloomberg 
and - and he - he compares them at page 14 - at - at slide 14 which 
currently is on your screen and the Chair will see that there is not much 
difference, but I guess most importantly to the Chair’s question if I may 
now seek Mr Chabi’s confirmation. 
Would I be correct Mr Chabi and - and concluding from your 
evidence or if the - the Chair were to pose that question to me.  I say I 
10 
know that they are - the 38.6 billion included forex hedging, because 
the financial model tells me so.  Would I be correct in saying that?  
MR CHABI:  Correct.  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The financial model on which the business 
case is predicated.  It tells me so.  
MR CHABI:  It - it tells you it includes some sort - some form of foreign 
exchange allowance, but it does not tell you directly whether it was a 
hedging cost or not. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Oh. 
MR CHABI:  Hence the comparison. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is the - it is the exercise thereafter that 
leads us to the conclusion that it is actual hedging costs?  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And - and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But just before that.  That exercise that you do in 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 30 of 168 
 
order to arrive at that conclusion that it is included.  Would it be 
expected - would it not be expected that anybody with the right 
knowledge of these things would do that exercise before arriving at a - 
at - at any conclusion that it was not included?  
MR CHABI:  It would be expected. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would be expected? 
MR CHABI:  It would be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if such a person did not do that exercise.  What 
would that say to you about that person either in terms of compe tence - 
incompetence or lack of diligence or pursuing a certain agenda?  You 
10 
see.  I - I do not the knowledge that you have, but you have.  If you - if 
a lawyer gives an opinion - a legal opinion and I look at the opinion.  
I am able sometime to say no, but this person particularly if 
you know about his or her experience in practice or the field - relevant 
field and so on.  You say, but there is no way he could have believed 
that this opinion is correct.  There must be some other agenda about 
this opinion and then somebody else could give you the same opinion, 
but because of maybe limited experience and practice.  
Maybe because of his or her unfamiliarity with the branch of 
the law you might say no.  It is just - he or she is wrong, but there is no 
20 
agenda.  It is bona fide.  You know.  So I am just making this examples 
to give you an idea of what I am looking for.  Is it a situation where one 
could say it is just incompetence?  Is it a situation where you say no, 
but this cannot be incompetence?  
When it is done by so and so with so much experience in 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 31 of 168 
 
these type of things, but of course you might not know certain 
information about the people who gave that opinion.  So that - that 
might be nothing, but I just want to give you an idea of what I am 
looking for. 
MR CHABI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if - if the person did not do that exercise what - 
what would it tell you about that person?  
MR CHABI:  Okay.  So I would not want to speak to the character of 
individuals I suppose, because I do not know these individuals.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR CHABI:  I guess you would require a lot more than just this 
financial investigation …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CHABI:  And I think it would have to fall into what MNS …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CHABI:  Has unearthed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CHABI:  Found out who come at a …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR CHABI:  A reasonable view about the individuals, but any of the 
20 
reasons you have advanced are quite possible.  So it could be 
negligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR CHABI:  It could be lack of competence …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  You …  
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 32 of 168 
 
MR CHABI:  Or it could be …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR CHABI:  Wilful desire to mislead …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   
MR CHABI:  But which of the three it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CHABI:  I cannot with …  
CHAIRPERSON:  You might not have enough information to …  
MR CHABI:  I do not. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Go beyond that.  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If I may complicate your life further Mr  Chabi.  
In your file you have Annexure AC4 at page 1 -6-3 which is a worksheet 
from the - the business - from the financial model titled proposed locos 
purchase price - purchase price.  Now if - if one were to appreciate that 
the business case is predicated on the financial model.  Then in - in 
sort of testing the accuracy of 38.6 billion yo u go to the financial 
model.  Correct? 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And if you go to the financial model you come 
20 
across this worksheet at page 163.  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Point one to be precise.  1-6-3.1 for the 
record and when I look at that excel spreadsheet and I read from the 
extreme left at entry - entry three it has got forex shift and if I work - 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 33 of 168 
 
work my way across the entire document over to 2023.  There are 
certain rates appearing there per annum which if I understood your 
evidence correctly last week reflected the foreign exchange rates going 
forward.  Was I correct?  
MR CHABI:  That is correct.  Global insight role.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR CHABI:  The role titled global insight. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  Titled global insight. 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So there is - well I am not saying for a lawyer, 
10 
but would it be reasonable to expect it to be a simple exercise for an 
accountant - the most junior accountant?  Okay.  For an accountant 
period. 
MR CHABI:  I would say it is. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does - does the view that - it is the foreign - foreign 
exchange hedging - what was - that was not - that the opinion was that 
it was not include … (intervenes).  
MR CHABI:  It is foreign hedging costs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  When you see - when you saw that view having 
20 
regard to what was placed before the Board and maybe what the person 
had access to in forming that view.  What they would have had to look 
at in forming that view.  Does - was your reaction this is shocking?  
How could they say that or was it - it is wrong, but okay or none of the 
above? 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 34 of 168 
 
MR CHABI:  I guess - not a guess.  The (indistinct) was a bit shocking.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It was shocking. 
MR CHABI:  I would suggest it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  That helps me.  Thank you.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Then if - if we - so now you - you have 
expressed an opinion on whether or not the forex hedging was 
included.  Going back which is a few minutes back.  You also said to 
the Chair that the memorandum suggested that inflation was also not 
catered for in 38.6 billion?  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Now what - what - can you express a 
view on that claim in the memorandum?  
MR CHABI:  Well the verifications are in my view very si mple 
exercises.  For financial people it is not a very complex thing to do.  
Excel is a very basic platform for modelling.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR CHABI:  You will not expect it to pose any challenge to anybody in 
the financial services industry.  So i t was equally shocking to see the 
note about escalation not having been included especially given that we 
have a policy in place that requires you to appropriately allow for these 
20 
costs before budgeting. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And - and again I am having regard to your - 
the excel spreadsheet - the worksheet.  At page 1-6-3.1 which is the - 
the spreadsheet we looked at just a short while ago when trying to 
determine whether or not forex hedging costs were taken into 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 35 of 168 
 
consideration and the last entry on that ver y same page tells me about 
SAPPI and US inflation. 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is that not the escalation rates?  
MR CHABI:  That is - those are the escalation rates. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the one document would have told me 
about forex and told me about inflation.  Whether or not it was part of 
the 38.6 billion? 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Then if - if you could take us then to - 
10 
to your table on the screen.  That we had on the screen previously 
before we dealt with this deta il.  Yes.  This one.  Now that table just 
summarises the globular figures that have been introduced and which 
figures it is claimed are responsible for the increase of 15.9 billion in 
ETC.  Correct? 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Can you quickly take us through them?  So we 
understand what is happening there.  Let us deal with the first.  
MR CHABI:  Okay.  So the reasons advanced for the increase in ETC 
from 38.6 billion to 54 billion how it is shown overhead.  Starting off 
20 
with an update of busines s case for updated economic factors.  These 
are essentially backward looking adjustment costs.  So because the 
price is provided as at April  2013 by these OEMs and the negotiations 
were taking place - place as at March 2014. 
There was a need to adjust thos e prices to reflect the value 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 36 of 168 
 
as at the negotiation stage.  So you had to escalate by inflation.  You 
had to allow for exchange rate fluctuations over the same period just to 
bring the value to present terms and present in this instance being 
March 2014.  So those are the factors referred to there as an update.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So basically where - 38.6 billion was as at 
April 2018?  Ag - 2013? 
MR CHABI:  2013.  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  My apologies.  I do not know where I get 18.  
The memorandum there dated May 2014 says: 
“You cannot look at the economic factors as they 
10 
were in April 2013.  We must bring them forward 
today.” 
And that 38.6 billion ought to be amended to take into consideration the 
changed economic circumstances.  Am I correct?  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
 
So 
basically 
it 
is 
- 
it 
is 
economic 
circumstances over a period of one year?  
MR CHABI:  That is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  You may proceed. 
MR CHABI:  Okay.  So that cost amounted to 5.4 billion as per the 
20 
memorandum.  The … (intervenes). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before you go further what - what would - 
what goes into the economic factors?  
MR CHABI:  So you have … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That we should consider here. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 37 of 168 
 
MR CHABI:  Basically it is just exchange rate fluctu ations. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Exchange rate fluctuations and what?  
MR CHABI:  And escalation - price escalation/inflation. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then would I be correct when I look at your 
update of business case for updated economic factors at 5.4 billion to 
interpret that to mean since April  2013 to May 2014 there are certain 
factors we should take into consideration.  That the 38.6 billion did not 
and the - the cost of that is 5.4 billion?  
MR CHABI:  That is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the cost for forex hedging in fact was or 
10 
the - then would be the change in forex fluctuation and the escalation 
have added a cost of 5.4 billion.  Would that be a correct summation?  
MR CHABI:  Sorry.  I think I just missed the point advocate.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The point is I read that - would I - would we 
be correct in interpreting that to mean the memorandum suggests that 
since April 2013 to date being May  2014 … 
MR CHABI:  March 2014. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  March 2014. 
MR CHABI:  April 2013 to March 2014. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  March 2014.  Okay. 
20 
MR CHABI:  17 March 2014 there about. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But the memorandum as in May  2014 suggest 
… 
MR CHABI:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  This is what had happened over that period of 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 38 of 168 
 
time which is that there was certain - I will call them certain - currency 
fluctuations …  
MR CHABI:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which you must add to the - and there was 
escalation … 
MR CHABI:  That is correct.  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Costs. 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And those costs combined over a period of a 
year are 5.4 billion? 
10 
MR CHABI:  That is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  We - we understand you. 
MR CHABI:  And the memorandum then advances a cost for risk 
mitigation.  It is basically the same variables.  You look at escalation 
costs going forward from March  2014 to the end of the delivery 
schedule.  It is important to note that the delivery schedule in this 
instance changed from seven years to three to four years.  Okay.  With 
the last delivery I think expected in February  2018.  At the time. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR CHABI:  So it was a maximum delivery period of four years.  So the 
20 
delivery schedule was shrunk.  So those costs - so then you would have 
hedging costs from March  2014 all the way to the last delivery - of 
locomotive delivery and you would also have inflation costs all the way 
to that last locomotive delivery.  Those costs as per the memorandum 
amounted to 9.5 - 9.5 billion.  9.45 to be exact.  Ja. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 39 of 168 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So it would be 9.5 billion over a four year 
period? 
MR CHABI:  That is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Whereas the forex and escalation cost 
in the 38.6 billion was over a seven year period?  
MR CHABI:  That is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Right.  Then there is a next factor which is TE 
scope. 
MR CHABI:  That came in at 2.6 billion and that included the original 
TE scope and the additional TE scope.  I think we will look at that 
10 
breakdown when we get to table two where the build up to 4.5 billion is 
laid out. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So this extra TE scope is as further cost of 
2.59 billion or is that the cost of the TE scope itself?  
MR CHABI:  I missed the question advocate. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I said they TE scope costed there at two …  
MR CHABI:  2.6 billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  2.6 billion.  Is that additional TE scope nor 
generally all the TE scope?  
MR CHABI:  It is the combination of the original TE scope and …  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The additional. 
MR CHABI:  The additional TE scope. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Alright.  Then we get to contingencies …  
MR CHABI:  Correct and …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that as we understand it is just a - an 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 40 of 168 
 
arithmetic exercise? 
MR CHABI:  Correct.  It was 10 percent of the overall costs of 49.5 
billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We then have a negative figure of 6.5 billion 
on that table. 
MR CHABI:  And that is … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Can you explain to the Chair what - what that 
is supposed to be? 
MR CHABI:  Well … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Let us first read what it says …  
10 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  On the table. 
MR CHABI:  So the memorandum attributes a R6.5 billion saving to 
lower capital acquisition costs of the locomotive obtained through a 
competitive tender and negotiation process.  It actually says less the 
bench pricing adjustment of 2.7 billion.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Is that line supposed to say the fact that 
there was a tender process involving different leaders and the 
negotiation process that came after that resulted in Transnet saving 
20 
that amount?  Is that what that line is supposed to say?  Is  that what it 
means? 
MR CHABI:  That is how we interpret it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It seems to be written in a fairly complex way 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 41 of 168 
 
and I’m going to try and interpret it, at least for myself and I want to 
test whether you get the same  result.  It would appear to suggest that 
there was an over R9billion savings achieved to which must then be 
deducted, the new cost called batch pricing of R2.7billion, is that a 
correct interpretation?  
MR CHABI:   I would say it is yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   So the net effect of the saving becomes 
R6.5billion? 
MR CHABI:   Correct.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Which would suggest had it not been 
10 
necessary to add the batch pricing at R2.7billion the actual saving 
would be over R9billion?  
MR CHABI:   Well if you account for batch pricing the actual saving is 
R9.2billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   R9.2billion? 
MR CHABI:   Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Okay, alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I may have missed something and it’s been – we 
have been listening to this in piecemeal, if you say there was a saving  
of R6.5billion that suggests that there had previously been a 
20 
determination or estimation that was higher for the project or for the 
particular item but something has happened and as a result of that the 
amount has gone low so you’re no longer going to spend as much as 
you had anticipated, is my understanding correct?  
MR CHABI:   That is correct Chair. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 42 of 168 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But how would that initial determination or estimation 
be made for it to result in saying a saving because of t he competitive 
tender process.  Maybe the negotiations, I can understand because the 
competitive tender process would involve just different bidders putting 
in their bids not knowing what the other one’s prices are, do you 
understand that part? 
MR CHABI:   I do not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I mean if – with regard to negotiation, if you had 
made a certain determination or estimation and you negotiated, you 
bring the people down that part I can I can [indistinct] tender effect – 
10 
process effect that I’m not s ure if I understand, are you able to assist.  
MR CHABI:  Yes, I say yes Chair and I’ll do so in part with reference to 
the evidence that has already been deduced and then I asked Mr Chabi, 
based on the work he’s done to comment.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We know that the bids were submitted and 
each bid had a price – had a locomotive price and last week they Chair, 
I think, enquired of Mr Chabi if they were on the shelves, these 
locomotives and where to be bought that day what would the price b e 
and that’s what, you know, we’d call the price as at that day.  So each 
20 
of the did indicating the locomotive price separate from all other 
adjustments that must be effected.  So that was on the bids and the 
first quarter of 2014, negotiations began with successful bidders and in 
the course of – before the negotiations they were requested – because 
we’re almost a year later to submit their respective best and final 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 43 of 168 
 
offers.  So let’s say when the bids came in they came at a certain 
figure of 30 and their be st and final offer then it might be 29.  Then the 
negotiation starts and there’s haggling over the price and then 
eventually Transnet and each party reach an agreement as to price and 
maybe that’s 25.  So that’s the evidence that we’ve understood to have 
been led.  Compared to that would be what the business case 
anticipated the locomotive price to be, so for budgeting purposes and 
determining whether or not we are undertaken this project, what do we 
expect that price to be and I just want to check that I a m correct with, 
you know, Mr Chabi. 
10 
MR CHABI:   I agree. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Then if you could take us to your slide 21 
because the slide 21 is going to help us understand, hopefully, where 
exactly it is we obtained the saving of R6.5billion, go on still,  yes this 
one.  The Chair will see at the top row of that slide its locomotive price 
it indicates what the business case price was which is just slightly over 
R30billion and it says the memo pointed to at R29.355billion and the 
assessed value, assessed val ue being what Mr Chabi assessed. 
MR CHABI:   Correct it was originally R29.53billion based on the 
January 2014 [indistinct]. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   So we take the R30billion, that is what the 
business case told us to expect or the basis on which we are going  to 
go into this project, between that and May 2014 we should put in the 
best and final offer, we have a better slide that shows that and that 
tells us what their best and final offers were and then followed by the 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 44 of 168 
 
negotiated 23 I’m told.  Now that’s the b est and final offer I’m sorry, we 
will find where the comparison is made but the take out Chair is – the 
business case anticipated R34.6billion, the contracted for price was 
R29.335billion, those are the two extremes.   In between the best and 
final offers came to around R29.5billion.  Now we know that the memo 
tells us that a lower capital acquisition cost of the locomotive obtained 
is R6.5billion.  Now I’m going to test this with Mr Chabi, if I read that 
statement that the lower capital acquisition cost o f the locomotives 
obtained is R6.5billion, would I be correct in expecting a price 
difference in the actual locomotive price.  There should be some price, 
10 
I know we contracted at R29.3billion, there must be some price that 
adds R6.5billion which would have  been the original price because that 
is what I should have negotiated away, would I be correct?  
MR CHABI:   Yes so you would have expected the price of about 
R35.9billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   We should have expected a R35.9billion?  
MR CHABI:   Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   But we know we never got to R35.9billion, 
not in the business case, not in the best and final offer?  
MR CHABI:   Correct. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   So where would that R35billion you call it, 
where would it come from?  
MR CHABI:   I suppose my guess is as good as yours Advocate.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry what was that answer?  
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 45 of 168 
 
MR CHABI:   I have no idea. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   So to take this forward, in your statement you 
deal with table two of that very memo, okay and that is at page 169.  
Chair last week we gave you a legible copy of 169 and you suggested it 
be numbered 169.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   169.1 okay – well there’s a 169.1 that I see, it must 
be the one. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Yes it’s a much better copy than what 
appears at 169. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay I’ve got 169.1. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Okay, now firstly Mr Chabi, just briefly 
explain what is this document, what is this table about?  
MR CHABI:   So the table, basically is a build up of the costs lea ding 
up to the R54.5billion starting with the base price of the locomotive of 
R29.36billion so it looks at your backward looking escalation, it looks 
at your backward looking Forex, it looks at your TE, your batch price 
adjustment 
and your 
forward risk 
mit igation 
factors 
and your 
contingencies and it arrives at R54.5billion.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   So – because we have worked through this 
20 
memo it would not be misleading to the Chair if we suggested the 
summary at paragraph two of the memo giving the globular f igures of 
the increases, the detail of that is to be found in table two?  
MR CHABI:   That’s correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   So table two is a more, you know, granular 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 46 of 168 
 
calculation. 
MR CHABI:   Correct, should I provide…[intervenes].  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Yes just, like for instance give us R5.4billion 
and relate that to table two and see how exactly it’s arrived at.  
MR CHABI:   Okay so the R5.4billion looks at that – it’s an update of 
economic conditions, so it’s backward looking and if you look at table 
two that’s item A and item C.  The sum of item A at R2.362 billion and 
item C at R3.03billion gives you R5.4billion.  The R9.5billion is 
essentially a forward looking, your risk mitigation costs and that would 
be item E and F, item E being your escalation costs at R6.725billion 
10 
and your Forex hedging costs at R2.729billion, so the combination of 
those gives the R9.5billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you have captured then all this in your 
slide 21 and at the same time you express a view on each one of those 
items?  
MR CHABI:   Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   The slides that precede this one would 
explain, there are some items in red and some items in black, just 
explain to the Chair why that is?  
MR CHABI:   Okay so the items in red are the line items we took issue 
20 
with and the items in blue are the line items we accepted, although it’s 
some justification around why we accepted them.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Alright then going back to slide 21 and 
following on the discussion we had we know the business case 
anticipated R30billion for the locomotive price the memo indicated the 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 47 of 168 
 
negotiated end price was R29.3billion.  
MR CHABI:   Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   And what you have under assessed value is 
Chabi’s work, right? 
MR CHABI:   Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   And as far as the locomotive price is 
concerned you agreed to a price of R29.3billion, that is what was 
negotiated, that is what was offered.  
MR CHABI:   It wasn’t higher than what we saw at the best and final 
offer stages so we had reason to believe that the negotiation  in this 
10 
instance worked to Transnet’s advantage.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   So there – and it wasn’t higher than the 
business case you still came in less at the business case.  
MR CHABI:   That is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    My very dangerous mathematics woul d give 
me a difference of about R700million.  
MR 
CHABI: 
 
 
You 
mean 
from 
the 
business 
case 
or 
from 
the…[intervenes]. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   From the business case. 
MR CHABI:   Correct, roughly R700million. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Now if it is R700million, with re ference to the 
business case that’s the best I can say the saving amounted to.  If I 
say to the Board you anticipated to spend R30billion but I’ve negotiated 
a price for R23.3billion. 
MR CHABI:   R29.4. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 48 of 168 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Ja R29.4 so that is a saving with reference to 
the business case of R700million. 
MR CHABI:   That’s correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   But to tell you that their best and final offer 
was R29.5billion during negotiation I squeeze them further to 
R29.3billion that would be a saving of R177milli on? 
MR CHABI:   That’s correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   That’s a far cry from R6.5billion.  
MR CHABI:   Sorry? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   That’s a far cry in that figure from 
10 
R6.5billion. 
MR CHABI:  It is.    
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Okay you then deal with backward esc alation, 
now just briefly remind us what that involves and why it is you take 
issue with it? 
MR CHABI:   Okay so backwards escalation essentially looks at the 
change in price over the year, April 2013 to March 2014 a good 
indicator in this instance would have been the PPI index, we saw that in 
the business case, locally and abroad.  The number comes up to a 
figure of 2.362 based on what was observed over the period in terms of 
20 
inflation we come to a figure of 1.392.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Now how would you do that, we know that 
there was a projected figure in April 2013 for inflation, our model, the 
business case had projected a particular inflation?  
MR CHABI:   Correct. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 49 of 168 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   And that [indistinct] a specific amount to it.  
MR CHABI:   Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   So now we are in March or May 2014, what 
was a one-year projection in 2013 for escalation has now become 
today’s reality? 
MR CHABI:   Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   So what then would happen is, I take the 
price as it was in 2013 and I a pply what the inflation actually became, 
is that correct? 
MR CHABI:   What you experienced yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Yes, and that is the exercise you conducted 
to arrive at R1.3billion?  
MR CHABI:   That’s correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   They arrived at R2.6billion, do you have an 
idea, an understanding of how – that’s almost double of your 
calculation do you know how they arrived at that?  
MR CHABI:   Well looking at table two that is an 8% increase over the 
period, the average rate we came up to was about fo ur odd and just to 
explain, looking at what local inflation was over the period, April 2013 
to March 2014 I think it was a move from about 104 to 112, that was 
20 
bout 7.7% on the local hand, so inflation over that period PPI 
[indistinct] indices changed by 7 .74% over that period and that’s the 
overall Producer Price Index.  Digging deeper into the index trying to 
find the more appropriate index, in this instance relating to metals, 
machinery and what not, something that relates pretty close because 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 50 of 168 
 
remember the overall index includes a variety of producer goods, foods, 
textiles, chemicals and so forth, looking purely at the transport index 
that went up by about 7.3% over the period, we however chose to apply 
the 7.4% the overall index as apposed to 7.33% givin g the memo the 
benefit of the doubt but that’s just on the local and it’s important to 
highlight again here that the locomotive had a foreign component and 
had a local component.  It would have been unjust, incorrect to apply 
local inflation indices on both the local component and the foreign 
component.  We went on to look at what foreign inflation was over the 
period in the EU it was extremely low I think it was below 1% over the 
10 
period, the one-year period.  In the United States it was 1 – most of the 
prices were quoted in US Dollars hence the reference to the United 
States in Dollars in this instance, it was 1.65% on the PPI and in the 
United States, it was 1.83% on the CPI and in the United States, we 
just applied 2% over the period, we still …[intervene s]. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   If I may then – and we have dealt with this 
concept that the production of the locomotive was split locally and 
foreign so if we are going to adjust the price to reflect escalation I must 
do that split again.  I must understand which component is foreign and 
which component is local. 
20 
MR CHABI:   That’s correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   And the component that is local will be 
subjected to the inflation rate as applicable in South Africa at that 
time? 
MR CHABI:   Correct. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 51 of 168 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELL O:   And you say, officially it was 7.74%.  
MR CHABI:   The overall index yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   The overall index and is that the rate I would 
apply to the South African component?  
MR CHABI:   Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   The other foreign component I then would 
have to use the US PPI or CPI because their business case was based 
on CPI but having said that, the two were – there was not much 
difference between the two, nothing much turns on that.  
MR CHABI:   In the business case yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   And now you’re telling the Chair that when 
one has regard to the US PPI around that time and CPI they were 
somewhere in the range of 1.68%. 
MR CHABI:   1.6 to 1.8% yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   So what ought to have happened is you 
inflate the South African 60% component. 
MR CHABI:   If it is 60. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   If it is 60 of course by the applicable rate and 
you inflate the foreign by the applicable US PPI rate?  
MR CHABI:   Correct. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   You said that at R2.3billion it would appear 
that the full locomotive price was inflated by the higher South African 
inflation rate? 
MR CHABI:   Eight percent. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Eight percent? 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 52 of 168 
 
MR CHABI:   Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Okay, now when you do the mathematic 
exercise you take that price you in flate it by 8% and you come to 
R2.262. 
MR CHABI:   Billion correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Was it a correct approach to calculating the 
backward escalation? 
MR CHABI:   Well it’s not to say that they actually applied eight locally 
and eight abroad, I think there are infinitely many solutions to the 
ratios, to the rates applied there and the rates applied here that you 
10 
could come up with given the weightings, I mean, looking at CNR, their 
foreign component was about – sorry their local component was about 
37 to 38% I think at the time only GE matched the local content 
requirement of 55, all the other three fell below the DTI requirements of 
local content. It was 46 for Bombardier it was 49.6% for CSR so 
applying those relative splits to the indices I’ve just me ntioned 7.74 
and 2% the figure is much lower.   It could have been a 10, 2% case 
there was applied 10 locally 2% abroad, nobody knows what rate was 
applied locally and what it was applied abroad, however the weighed 
average of those rates comes to 8% which  is equivalent to applying 8% 
20 
locally and 8% abroad. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   And if that’s your theory when you test the 
theory and apply the 8% to both you come to 2.362?  
MR CHABI:   Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   You then deal on the table with original TE 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 53 of 168 
 
scope, just very briefly Chair, this involved – perhaps you explain it 
because you don’t take issue with it, what did you understand the TE 
scope to be and why don’t you take issue with it?  
MR CHABI:   Okay so at the time of producing the report and I suppo se 
writing this statement because no additional work was carried on TE 
scope between the writing of the report and the production of the 
statement we were not too sure what TE scope related to.  The 
numerous interviews with MNS and Transnet officials did n ot shed any 
light on what that TE scope was.  Some questions we contended with 
was if TE had a role, a part to play in the production of the locomotives 
10 
should we not have seen a reduction in the base price of locomotive, 
given that they producing a part o f it, if not then maybe it’s just a 
premium to reflect that TE is involved in the locomotive manufacturing 
process and because we’re using a local entity, again like the 
localisation premium in the business case there’s a premium to be 
added on to the price…[intervenes]. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Just sorry to remind ourselves, TE stands for 
Transnet Engineering a division of Transnet?  
MR CHABI:   Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   So this is a provision for the scope of work 
20 
anticipated to be done by Transnet Engine ering? 
MR CHABI:   Correct and that included things like assembling the bogie 
– basically assembly of the locomotive.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   So you are saying you were never able to 
determine whether or not the project anticipated the TE scope as 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 54 of 168 
 
defined? 
MR CHABI:   When you say the project, you’re referring to 
the…[intervenes]. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   The business case. 
MR CHABI:   No we could not tie the 2% localisation to TE.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Yes. 
MR CHABI:   Yes, our understanding was they did not relat e to TE. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   And when we look at the original R36.8billion 
ETC, is there any reference to TE scope in that R38.6billion?  
MR CHABI:   No it is just referred to as a localisation premium.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Of 2%? 
MR CHABI:   Of 2%. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   And mathematically R1.7billion does not 
reflect 2%? 
MR CHABI:   Well I think if you take the combined value of – just a 
second, of 2.5 which is the original and the added I think you’re looking 
at about nine. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   So what you’re saying to the Chair is that 
could be the 2% - that could have, as part of it, the 2% localisation 
premium plus something else but you are not in a position to say 
20 
exactly what goes into the TE scope?  
MR CHABI:   Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Now you reflected as an accepted figure of 
1.7 you have starred that, it doesn’t – you have put an asterix against 
that number it doesn’t appear in the slide, can you just explain to the 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 55 of 168 
 
Chair it’s – you indicate in your statement that it’s almost like a 
conditional acceptance of that figure, what is the basis – what is the 
condition and the basis thereof?  
MR CHABI:   So we had no basis to refute the cost of R17billin for the 
original TE scope so we just accepted it as it was there.  Again the 
whole exercise is to de termine the reasonability of the ETC, increasing 
ETC not so much the accuracy of the increase but he reasonability and 
in doing that we did as much as possible to give the memo the benefit 
of the doubt. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   So in your – it’s apparent from your 
10 
statement that MNS is still involved in further investigation of this TE, 
Transnet Engineering involvement and if it were determined that there 
was no extra cost attaching to TE’s involvement then you will – that 
R1.707billion you have accepted, you w ill reject? 
MR CHABI:   If there’s no extra cost or if the locomotive price comes 
down to reflect TE’s involvement yes we will adjust accordingly.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   You then deal with Forex adjustment.  
MR CHABI:   Correct so. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   And the memo suggests R3billion you assess 
the value also at R3billion, so you don’t take issue?  
20 
MR CHABI:   We came to a slightly higher figure but of course all we 
had to work with was the baffle price which is about R177million higher 
so you would expect us to come to a higher figure in this instance.  We 
accepted the 3.03, we came to about R3.1billion so we took the 3.03 to 
be a reasonable number in that instance.  Had it been too far off let’s 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 56 of 168 
 
say 5% off then we would have questioned…[intervenes].  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   This is red now is the batch price adjustment 
just to remind ourselves and to give you a heads up, both Mr Callard 
and Mr Sedumedi testified at length regarding the batch pricing.  Mr 
Sedumedi’s legal view, being a lawyer was that an adjustment,  a batch 
price adjustment was not justifiable on the basis of the RFP it was not 
a course that was anticipated in the RFP it has got no basis in the bid 
as a concept that seems to have arisen during the course of 
negotiation, that is the background.  
MR CHABI:   Okay. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Now I see you’ve got batch pricing in red, 
what are you trying to express with that?  
MR CHABI:   So we accept the view that batch pricing was not – the 
batch pricing cost was not a cost anticipated in the request for 
proposals by Transnet, we tried to compute this R2.7billion derive it 
and the only schedule that gave us a cost of R2.7billion was the break 
point pricing schedule which was anticipated in the request for 
proposal.  It was the only table with costs, lack for a b etter word, that 
allowed us to arrive at R2.7billion.  When you look at what the OEM’s 
provided in the RFP, in the break pricing schedule, considering that 
20 
there was a 50/50 split on the diesel and 233 diesels to GE, 232 to 
CNR and a 60/40 on the electric and 359 to CSR and 240 to 
Bombardier, we come to a cost of about R2.7billion.  We then 
concluded that, okay this must have been computed using the break 
pricing, break point pricing schedule, that of course can not be proven 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 57 of 168 
 
on our hand, however like I say when you take the table and you do the 
computation you get to R2.7billion.  The RFP in section 2.3.1 if I recall 
right clearly states that Transnet requires the option to change 
quantities and does not expect to pay a price premium for it.  Now when 
we look at the negotiation sheets I think presented by Mr Sedumedi I 
think even in the negotiation stages it was pretty clear that that pricing 
was not anticipated – the negotiation in the RFP sorry and should not 
have been a cost that would be affected.  And o ur understanding of 
break point pricing is it is a premature termination of the contract but it 
occurs in contract.  It assumes loss of economies of scale in addition to 
10 
that set up costs.  So there are costs you would have incurred in 
setting yourself up for a certain number of locomotives to be 
manufactured to have that then subsequently cut means that you 
cannot recoup those costs because they are sunk costs.  And that 
Transnet was prepared to pay a penalty for.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Just if I may?  So y ou what you suggesting is 
whatever I understand – understanding of what of batch pricing is it 
should not be conflated with break point pricing?  These are two 
different concepts. 
MR CHABI:  They are two different concepts and I think just to add a 
20 
further note and hopefully not to confuse in this instance.  Even if and 
this is not say it was batch pricing was contemplated it should not have 
been to the tune of 2.7 billion because break point pricing allows for 
cost that would not have incurred prior to the  contract being signed.  It 
is understandable on a loss of economies scale basis but not on a 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 58 of 168 
 
setup of production lines and all of those other factors raised in the 
memorandum.  No contract was agreed upon none of the OEM’s had 
reason to go and setup production lines on the basis that they have 
already been awarded the contract so such costs should not have been 
levied onto Transnet.  However just to reiterate batch pricing was not 
contemplated for in the RFP.  And instances like that do arise where as 
a supplier you are told you – it is uncertain how much after contract 
you are going to be given price the premium into your price, allow for it 
in your price and give us a price but do not charge us a penalty if what 
you get is not what you expected.  It is no t unimaginable to think that 
10 
the temptation is quite high to price at 465 because it makes you 
competitive.  So there might have been a temptation to price at the 
highest possible number just to be able to get in it is just a view.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So what you are suggesting to us as regard 
batch pricing as you rejected it because the RFP did not provide for 
batch pricing. 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And if you were to be kind and read that as a 
break point pricing you would still reject the cost of 2.7 billion? 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  You then deal with additional TE scope 
and am I correct to interpret that to mean it relates to what we call the 
original TE scope above and it is all about the participation of Transnet 
Engineering in the delivery of the locomotives?  
MR CHABI:  That is correct. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 59 of 168 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And I see with that one you do not take issue?  
MR CHABI:  We take it as is because we got no reason to refute the 
numbers put forward. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  We then get to the biggest increase 
which is the forward escalation.  The business case had worked on an 
escalation of 2.53 billion but reminding ourselves that was as at April 
2013.  You I will jump your assessed value as at May 20 – April 2014 is 
that inflation – forward escalation should have been provided for – 
costs should have been provided for 3.4 billion.  Correct.  
MR CHABI:  3.4 billion yes we thought was a reasonable figure.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But the memorandum indicates that forward 
escalation is 6.7 billion. Why such a big difference between your 
calculation and the memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well there is a big difference between the calculation 
in the business case compared to the May 2014 memorandum and a big 
difference between the calculatio n on the May 2014 memorandum and 
the assessed version.  They are all quite – the gaps are quite big. 
MR CHABI:  Material correct yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Hm ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why is that? 
20 
MR CHABI:  Okay so – I will first address the difference between  the 
memorandum and the reassessed value and then touch onto that in the 
business case.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  May I suggest this?  Can you explain to the 
Chair how you get to the figure of 3.4 billion?  
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 60 of 168 
 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then perhaps once we understand that we will 
try and understand perhaps how they got to their figure of 6.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ys. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If you can explain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that is the best way.  You explain your own 
assessment. 
MR CHABI:  Assessment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then maybe you might then be able to say what 
you think the others did wrong that led them to the figures that do not 
10 
agree with your figure. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
MR CHABI:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You do not have to be very harsh  on the 
percentages and – just we need the concept to apply.  
MR CHABI:  Alright.  Okay so what is the approach used to arrive at 
the 3.4 billion.  I think just to give you the assumptions upfront.  We 
took a flat 6% locally and 2% abroad.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then just to remind – sorry ourselves that 
you – why specifically 6 and 2?  
20 
MR CHABI:  Okay so again in keeping with the basis in the 
memorandum that is one aspect and secondly assessing that base to 
see if it was reasonable.  The memorandum speaks  about 6% being a 
reasonable number to compare the inflation figure to. Do we agree with 
that?  Yes we do. Why do we agree with it?  Again for the reasons 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 61 of 168 
 
outlined before if you look at history inflation rates were below 6%.  If 
you look at rates implied by the market going forward over a ten year 
period we are looking at about 6.3% that is the average picked up or 
between – over the period of March. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR CHABI:  And if we average that from March 1 to March 31 it is 
about 65 thereabout.  That is what the market focussed inflation to be 
going forward over a ten year period.  Again most importantly is what 
our own monetary policy committee targets.  The job of the monetary 
policy committee is to ensure price stability.  Keep inflation as  low as 
10 
possible and also stable. That is one of the targets amidst ensuring 
high and stable economic growth and low unemployment and so forth.  
It is their role to be sure and how do they do that?  They change the 
policy rates – interest rates up or down to influence inflation.  So over 
the long term you can expect the inflation you experience to be that 
envisaged by the monetary policy committee.  Customised back to 
March 2014 the Reserve Bank Governor at the time had spoken about 
increasing interest rates to lower inflation which points to inflation 
likely falling over the three/four year period.  So 6% for us was a 
reasonable number to assign.  Ja to assume for inflation going forward.  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR CHABI:  The memorandum seems to support that as well.  You 
adopt the same philosophy abroad. Abroad they target 2%.  The 
Federal Open Market Committee in the United States targets a – 
targets 2% inflation.  The EU the Monetary Policy in the EU has the 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 62 of 168 
 
same target of 2%  with the same abroad objectives as we would expect 
here.  Price stability, economic growth, low unemployment and so forth.  
So 2% again on the foreign and made sense to us as an assumption 
going forward.  Weighing that between local and foreign rough 
estimating 50/50 you looking at about 4%.  I think what we have here is 
way in excess of percent.  I think when we read – if my recollection 
serves me right it must be paragraph 80 I think.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of the memorandum? 
MR CHABI:  Of the memorandum.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is the memorandum again?  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It starts at page 165. 
CHAIRPERSON:  165. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair. 
MR CHABI:  Actually I think it is paragraph 56.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is the MPV at 80.   
MR CHABI:  So I will read that. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Try page 171. 
MR CHABI:  Oh sorry 175 I think in my pack. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You at 175? 
MR CHABI:  Yes. In my bundle.  Paragraph 56.   
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Paragraph 58? 
MR CHABI:  Well we will start on 56 I suppose.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR CHABI:  And then 58.  56 speaks to the local content.  So it says:  
“The high level of local content being 60% makes 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 63 of 168 
 
local indices more applicable to assess the cost of 
escalation going forward.”  
That of course presents with a challenge sitting on the Transnet end 
because this serves to increase the cost and not reduce the cost.  You 
have – even if it was 90% local content it will still try to reduce the cost 
by ensuring that the remaining 10% has a lower inflation rate applied to 
it and not apply the local indices across the 100% just because you got 
a high local content.  So that is our interpretation of 56 in this instance.  
Not only that not all locomotive suppliers, OEM’s met the DGI 
requirements. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So what are – I take out from 56 is that the 
memorandum appreciates that the manufacture of the locomotives has 
got a local and foreign component.  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it works on the basis that the local 
component disregarding the specifics of what the OEM’s had co ntracted 
for they shall work on the basis that constitutes 60%?  The local of the 
component of all the locomotives equal 60% that is what they are 
suggesting. 
MR CHABI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The detail of whether or not they are wrong or 
right is neither here nor there but this is the basis on which they then 
do a computation – they must do a computation.  Appreciating the 60% 
local component.  That is only 60% is local component.  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 64 of 168 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You then where I think leading to  58 which is 
notwithstanding what is set out in 56 appreciating that 60% constitutes 
local component what the memorandum actually does in inflate – in 
calculating inflation going forward.  
MR CHABI:  Should I read that? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Please do. 
MR CHABI:  Okay so it says: 
“Hence a CPI of 6% escalated for 35 months which is 
roughly three years on a compound basis excluding a 
premium for risk results in 18.5 – an 18.54% 
10 
increase.  That is the nett 16.8% as per E in table 2 
above is reasonable.  That is b ecause the 6.7 billion 
represents a 16.8% increase.”  
The problem with that is it assumes that all your locomotives are 
purchased in the 35 t h month. We know however that they are spread out 
over the delivery period of three to four years.  So to have to com pare 
18.6 – 16.8 to 18 odd% is incorrect. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  And – so what you are suggesting to 
the Chair is you take issue with the method of computation of the 
escalation going forward.  It is how it was calculated that you have a 
20 
difficulty with. 
MR CHABI:  So I take issue with point 58 which seems to suggest that 
all locomotives are acquired in the last month  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR CHABI:  I also take issue with point 56 which seems to suggest that 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 65 of 168 
 
applying local inflation rates across the  entire batch – across the local 
and foreign component is the right way to go about it.  We know that if 
we have to look at a 6 and 2% - 6 local and 2% abroad the differential 
is 4% it is quite a significant difference.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So for you to arrive at – at 3.4 you applied the 
South African inflation rate going forward to the 60% of the locomotive 
price. 
MR CHABI:  To the respective. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To each. 
MR CHABI:  Correct each locomotive supplier’s respective local 
10 
content declaration.  Because they declared it in negotiation stages 
what their foreign components would be in the total locomotive price.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The let us look at what is the – what ranges 
were they in?  What was the lowest of our – of local component and 
what was the highest offer among the OEM’s?  
MR CHABI:  The lowest was 36.7. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR CHABI:  And the highest I think was 49.6. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  9? 
MR CHABI:  .6. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  .6.  So your 3.4 billion for forward escalation 
is it based on the average of that range or is it based on the highest of 
49 or on the lowest of 36. 
MR CHABI:  The respective.  So we created an index for the local 
inflation. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 66 of 168 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR CHABI:  Assumption and index for the foreign inflation assumpt ion. 
From there we then went onto creating an index for each OEM based on 
their local and foreign content declarations and that we applied to the 
price and the delivery schedule. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now did you try and reach the figure of 6.7 
billion?  Did you do any calculation to see how they arrived at 6.7 
billion? 
MR CHABI:  I did.  So the number – the weighted average number that 
gives us 6.7 billion is about 7.35%.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  7.35? 
MR CHABI:  % yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So in layman’s terms do we take it that 
they applied – would I be correct if I say they applied 6% across the 
board or is it 8% across the board?  
MR CHABI:  No, no so not 6 but their approach was equivalent to them 
applying. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR CHABI:  7.35% across the board. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.   
20 
MR CHABI:  It is not to say that they applied 7.35% locally.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I am with you. 
MR CHABI:  And 7 – it could have been any combination however the 
weighted average of that was 7.35%.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you say equivalent because when you do 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 67 of 168 
 
that exercise at 7.35% you too get the figure of 6.7 billion?  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is that – okay.  Now are you able to express 
an opinion as to the reasonability or otherwise of such an approach 
understanding the intricacies of this locomotives acquisition process?  
MR CHABI:  In a negotiation process I guess on the side of Transnet I 
will try as much as possible to reduce the cost.  On the side of the 
OEM’s as much as possible to increase the cost.  How we arrive at 7% 
as a weighted average on both ends I do not know.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But it is not open for me or a Transnet official 
10 
to decide that I like 7% more so I am going to apply 7% across the 
board.  They are required to comply  with the applicable inflation policy.  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Whether it is South Africa or whether it is the 
US? 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I do not see much of that happening in this 
calculation.  Would I be wrong in conclud ing that? 
MR CHABI:  I do not see it either. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I do not see an appreciation of applying the 
20 
correct inflation policy?  
MR CHABI:  Oh yes.  I agree with you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Alright.  We then deal with the next item which 
is forex hedging and we have discussed forex hedging before.  This is 
the forex going forward right?  
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 68 of 168 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you proceed Ms Sello. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know we have to do justice to Mr Chabi’s evidence 
which is quite important but we must keep an eye on our time 
allocation.  I want to check how we are doing?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are doing very well Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We doing very well? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Very, very well.  Thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Our target was what time ? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It was – we had three hours. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We were budgeted three hours which would 
take us to midday but we said we will try and bring it in two and a half.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I am looking at the last one not the first one. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you initially told about twelve o’clock we 
ultimately if I remember correctly we either ended up at aiming for 
eleven or half past eleven. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No we aiming two and a half.  We  said that is 
what we will push to achieve. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no that is what I am talking about.  
MR CHABI:  Yes two and a half. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Let us take it at half past eleven.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And two and a half takes us to?  
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 69 of 168 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Half past eleven. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Half past eleven. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I think that is what is in my mind.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you saying we doing well even with that?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We doing okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay I just want to make sure that we are on 
the same page. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No – but we are still aiming for that two and a 
10 
half. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And we just might make it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I fear the Chair should not hold me strictly to 
two and a half so – but I – it is still an objective on my part.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I – it would be I think it would be nice if that 
target can be achieved. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I will try and do better than the timing.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Then talking about forex 
hedging on your slide.  We do not have – you come to the same figure 
as the memorandum? 
MR CHABI:  Take the figure yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja that is what is reflected there which means 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 70 of 168 
 
you do not take issue with 2.7 billion?  
MR CHABI:  Not – we do not take issue with that yes.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But there is an issue with that.  Please tell 
the Chair about it. 
MR CHABI:  So based on the delivery schedule per OEM using the 
March – the April 2013 curve we get to a figure of about 3.4 billion. 
Because we are trying as much as possible to get to this 2.7 billion.  
We could not understand how they got to it.  The March – the April 
2013 Curves however are not the right curves to apply in this instance 
so we thought could they have applied a slight premium onto the curve 
10 
to get them to 2.7?  We tried to test that and that is roughly 12.5% 
premium that you would have to apply to get that considering that the 
US Dollar – the rand depreciated by 18% against the Dollar and by 
about 24% against the Euro over that period.  We then went onto 
source the March 2014 curves because those would be the correct 
curves to apply on that and we g ot to a figure of R3.9 billion.  So we 
could not make sense of the R2.7 billion applied.  We thought okay 
maybe it was a benefit of the negotiation however it is not unthinkable 
to think that the hedging costs to have the hedging costs come in lower 
than what it would cost Transnet to hedge the transactions on the 
20 
market.  Reason being each OEM has its own cost structures.  If one 
OEM decides to take the risk on his balance sheet then he can afford to 
reduce the cost to Transnet.  For example if one OEM has  an operation 
in South Africa it does not need to have the rands converted to Euro or 
to United States Dollars and brought back in to that corporation.  It is 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 71 of 168 
 
unnecessary transaction costs.  That means it does not carry any 
foreign currency risk on that portion of revenue that it wishes to 
allocate to its secondary operation within the country.  If that is the 
case we can afford to lower its effects hedging costs.  So we took the 
2.7 as is as opposed to the 3.9 billion that we got.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So your calculation – a proper calculation for 
forex hedging cost going forward was over 3 billion?  
MR CHABI:  It was just over 3 billion yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The memorandum tells you that it is going to 
come in at 2.7 billion. 
10 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You accept that on two basis.  Firstly that it is 
lower than your 3 billion calculation.  
MR CHABI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay and secondly that this is actually a risk 
assumed by the OEM? 
MR CHABI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So if the OEM is – made a mistake and 
negotiated on a wrong forex hedging cost that mistake will not – should 
not by right impact Transnet. 
20 
MR CHABI:  No it should not. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Because that is what the OEM offered?  
MR CHABI:  Agreed to yes.  That is what you signed off on the 
contract.  And I think just to add there was reason why the forex curve 
actually – why the costs were that high.  We had a depreciation in the 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 72 of 168 
 
rand and not only that interest rates locally went up abroad went down 
so that increased the hedg ing costs. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Now I do not know whether it is 
through your control or the technical people.  I do not see that this 
memorandum – ag – the slide we talking about I do not see it on the 
screen.  If we may because now we are getting to  the end of this entire 
exercise.  You – the last item you deal with is contingency and by virtue 
of it being read you take issue with it?  
MR CHABI:  It is again as we mentioned earlier simply a arithmetic 
exercise. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja. 
MR CHABI:  But over and above that the memorandum makes clear 
what the contingencies are for.  It is in respect of options, variations, 
spare parts, capital spares in general. So these are I guess 
components relating to the locomotive that may need replacement in 
future I suppose.  When we go back to the buffer letters we come to a 
totally different figure.  We come to about 600 million when we total 
those options, spares, variation across all 1064 because the OEM’s 
provide us with information on those.  So we simply took the 2.2 billion 
from the business case and just added the spares which could have 
20 
been a duplication of costs but nonetheless we thought 2.8 would have 
been a more reasonable number as a contingency as opposed to 4.9 
billion.  The 4.9 billion is 10% across  the entire line items that you see 
in the memorandum.  Contingency costs usually within the region of 5 
to 10% on projects.  10% for highly risky projects and 5% for projects 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 73 of 168 
 
within an acceptable level of risk.  That 2.8 represents about 7% of the 
capital cost of base locomotive price. So we also thought 7% is not a 
bad figure it sits in well between 5 and 10%.  To have to take in this 
instance on project where you have you are pretty certain about your 
risk you have mitigated them well.  You have transfer red the inflation 
risk to your OEM.  You have transferred the currency risk to your OEM.  
You have adjusted for economic conditions up to March 2014.  To then 
take an additional 10% on those escalation costs and those forex costs 
in our view was unnecessary.  It is similar to you purchasing insurance 
on your motor vehicle and then setting aside a reserved [indistinct] for 
10 
the same risk but you have transferred the risk to the insurer so there 
is no need for you to again set aside premiums every month for th e 
same risk which is essentially what we seem to be observing here.  If 
120% if taken off the escalation and off…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the contingency is a provision for some 
risks that may arise in the future that is not catered for in the 
calculation you know but you are saying that insofar as forex and 
escalation going forward are concerned Transnet cannot face a risk on 
that because those are transferred to the manufacturers?  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So it should not be – the cost associated 
there with should not be taken into consideration when we are trying to 
determine the contingency which must provide for in this?  
MR CHABI:  And the contingency also includes 10% of your batch 
pricing adjustment which is a penalty that has been levie d onto 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 74 of 168 
 
Transnet.  So there is no reason…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you still take a contingency for it?  
MR CHABI:  On it. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  You then draw conclusions.  You 
compare the price, the business case price which is 38.6 billion after 
all this exercise and you say the business case arrived at 38.6, you 
arrived at 45.3 billion and the memorandum arrived at 54.5 billion.  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And at the bottom there you indicate with a 
green amount of 6.8 billion. That is a di fference between your 
10 
calculation – the increase from the business – the 38.6 billion of the 
business case to your worked out figure?  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then you compare in red the business 
case and the memorandum.  So you arrive a t 6.8 the memorandum 
arrives at 15.9 billion. 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And this is a summary in part of the 
memorandum.  You remember we started this conversation with a 6.5 
billion saving? 
20 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Should it not be reflected somewhere and I 
say if my total is 4.5 billion I should reduce it by 6.5 billion as a saving 
or how would I work with that?  Where do I see a saving?  We 
understood the middle column to reflect figures taken from table 2 at 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 75 of 168 
 
page 169.1 – 169.1.  You remember?  Table 2.   
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Now I look at table two.  I - I do not 
see the saving of 6.5 billion.  What is - I do not see a line item that 
even calls a saving. 
MR CHABI:  Correct.  Unless the table two is t he result after the 
saving. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So by the time table two you are suggesting is 
created the saving has been achieved?  
MR CHABI:  That is as you …  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Where would it be placed?  The saving.  
MR CHABI:  I guess the question then  would be in which line item was 
the saving achieved. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR CHABI:  Would it have been in … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR CHABI:  The TE scope. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Approaching it that way then.  Are you able to 
point us to a line item?  
MR CHABI:  I am not. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay and in your slides overleaf at 23 - at 22.  
No.  You would be 23.  I do not know why our numbering is different.  
You say an opinion on a reasonable ETC, but you - you qualify without 
TE costs.  The Chair will recall that you had accepted the TE costs - 
the additional TE costs of eight - 800 million.  Right and the original TE 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 76 of 168 
 
cost of 1.7 billion …  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that is what led you in the previous slide 
to a total of 45.3 billion as an ETC? 
MR CHABI:  That is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  On this line all you are doing is because your 
acceptance of those costs is conditional upon the results of the 
investigation currently being undertaken by MNS.  Should the 
investigations result de monstrate that TE costs whether the original or 
additional should not form part of the ETC?  What you are doing here is 
10 
taking them out. 
MR CHABI:  Correct and …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you say in that case then my ETC would 
drop from 45 to 42 billion?  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And whereas previously there was a - the 
increase from the 38.6 billion taking into consideration TE costs 
relative to your calculation was 6.8 billion.  When you take out the TE 
related costs the - the escalation drops  down to 4.2 billion? 
MR CHABI:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But we know that the - the actual escalation 
effected was 15.9 billion?  
MR CHABI:  That is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair I think that brings us actually to - 
around in a slightly different way.  We have worked through the 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 77 of 168 
 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And just a question.  Is there anything else 
you would like to bring to the Chair’s attention?  He has got your - your 
statement and your presentation and your transcript already.  Is there 
anything in particular you would like to bring to his attention as regards 
this 1064 transaction and the mandate you had that perhaps we have - 
you - you feel we have not covered in suffic ient detail that is important?  
10 
MR CHABI:  Well I suppose maybe two additional inclusions in the 
statement. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR CHABI:  I guess the hurdle rate and NPV computation.  I think that  
was addressed in - at the very high level in the state ment.  So the 
profitability of the project after the change in the delivery schedule 
from seven to three to four years.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  You are quite correct and thank you for 
bringing that to my attention.  Let me just recap then you - you can 
explain to the Chair what it is you are talking about.  Chair will recall 
20 
that the 38.6 billion - ETC produced a NPV.  A profit of 2.7 billion …  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that was applying the hurdle rate and 
18.56 percent.  Correct?  
MR CHABI:  That is correct. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 78 of 168 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And we know that we get the hurdle rate from 
the work policy. 
MR CHABI:  The Work and Hurdle Rate Policy. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Work and Hurdle Rate Policy of Transnet?  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That policy tells us when you are dealing with 
Greenfields Projects you use a hurdle rate of 18.56 percent?  
MR CHABI:  For TFR.  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So it is a binding kind of requirement.  
So it would make sense that in the computation of 38.6 perc ent - 38.6 
10 
billion they would use that hurdle rate?  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now we are adjusting this to 54.  Okay.  
Billion per the memorandum.  There were changes to the rate - the 
hurdle rate applied.  Two questions.  Applying the hurdle  rate of 18.56 
percent.  What was the - what was the result NPV?  That is the first and 
second, what changes - and secondly whether this project in the end is 
presented to the Board as a profitable project and the basis for such 
contention.  Let us start with the first. 
MR CHABI:  Okay.  So applying the rate of 18.56 and the memorandum 
20 
clearly states that.  It resulted in the project turning loss - becoming 
loss making.  So turning - the NPV turning negative and I think it 
attributable value of R1.67 billion.  The correctness of that was not 
verified because the model (indistinct) that was not provided to us.  
The hurdle rate then had to be changed to 15.2 percent.  So 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 79 of 168 
 
it says not - not had to be changed.  It says using a hurdle rate of 15.2 
percent the project becomes profitable at R12 billion.  I just the 
challenge here is why a hurdle rate of 15.2 percent.  When the rate 
applicable at the time was 18.56 and I suppose that still needs to be 
answered. 
We then tried to find policies that spoke to the 15.2 hurd le 
rate.  We could not come across one.  We however came across a 
policy that referred to 16.2 percent, but that was only applicable after 
the conclusion of the transaction.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If - if I may just perhaps interject.  In the 
10 
memorandum still at page 178 paragraphs 77 and 78 deal with - with 
these aspects.  It might be important to go to that.  At 77 the 
memorandum states that: 
“The business case resulted in a positive NPV (2.7 
billion) and the TFR had a rate of 18.56 percent and 
34.1 billion at the rate of 12.56.”  
Okay. 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But we know that we - we could never have 
achieved an NPV of 34.1 billion, because the policy required us to 
20 
apply 18.6 - 18.56? 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So we could only get 2.7 billion.  At 79 - at 78 
rather.  The memorandum states: 
“The Transnet Hurdle Rate has since been amended 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 80 of 168 
 
to 15.2 percent and the NPV at this hurdle rate 
using the business case assumptions would be 16.2 
billion.” 
So two things here.  78 - paragraph 78 suggests that 
Transnet has relooked its hurdle rate and the new policy provides for a 
15.2 percent hurdle rate.  Do you agree?  That is what the paragraph 
suggests. 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Have you seen such a policy reflecting a 
hurdle rate of 15.2 percent? 
10 
MR CHABI:  No. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Have you inquired as to whether it existed at 
the time? 
MR CHABI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And what response did you get?  
MR CHABI:  We got provided all the policies that applied and none of 
them made reference to 15.2. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I will ask a question perhaps to which you do 
not know the answer?  Where do you think the 15.2 percent applied 
here came from? 
20 
MR CHABI:  I have no idea. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Conjecture.  Okay.  I am inviting that,  but then 
accepting that they decided to use a 15.2 percent hurdle rate the 
project actually has improved by - with profitability, because now it - it 
gives an NPV of 16 billion. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 81 of 168 
 
MR CHABI:  Which is in contradiction to paragraph 7 of the same 
memorandum which speaks to 11.68 billion, but that could have been a 
typing error. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So the - would I be correct in 
understanding the memorandum to suggest that at 50 - at a cost of 54 
billion the project is more profitable to Transnet than at a cost of 38 
billion, because at 38 billion I know I am going to make NPV of 2.7 
billion, but at 54 I am going to make a - a NPV of 16 billion. 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Can you explain that?  The rationale behind 
10 
that.  I - I do not understand. 
MR CHABI:  It would be very difficult to explain.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay and all that improved NPV is - is as a - 
is a result of manipulation of the applicable hurdle rate.  That is all it 
is. 
MR CHABI:  It could be. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No.  I say this on the basis that if I applied 
18.56 percent hurdle rate then I am in a loss making position.  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  In order to get a profit of 16.02 I must 
20 
massage that hurdle rate and bring it down to 15.2.  That is what gives 
me mathematically an NPV of 16 billion. 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Okay.  I - I think that was - that was 
quite important and I overlooked it in a bid to meet my commitment to 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 82 of 168 
 
the DCJ and thank you - to the Chair and thank you for pointing it  out.  
Is there something else?  
MR CHABI:  Well they also provide a view on the (indistinct) of the 6.5 
billion in the statement - I think - for the Chair to consider when - 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  We - you could find that there are requests for 
clarification of part of your evidence after I have gone through the 
transcript and everything in due course.  
MR CHABI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair a quick one.  The Chair will recall we - 
when we started we said we are dealing with two transactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The 1064 transaction and the 100 transaction.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The statement to the 100 transaction appears 
under tab two …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of BB8B2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  This is a much …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Under tab two? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Two - tab two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is a much smaller transaction …  
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 83 of 168 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And - and in the interest of time  I think I can 
explain to the Chair that in scope Mr  Chabi’s mandate was narrower.  If 
one compares it to the 1064 transaction.  His mandate appears at page 
6 of that paragraph 2 and it was - before I say that.  Transaction 100 
also experienced a change - an increase in ETC.  It was a movement 
from a 3.8 billion Board approved ETC to a 4.84 billion.  A year later.  
So Mr Chabi’s mandate as set out in his - his paragraph 2 
was to identify the reasons for that movement to test the possibility - 
the reasons put forward for that and to give a - an opinion as to the 
10 
reasonability of the increase in ETC.  The - that particular transaction 
as well in Annexure AOC1 starting at 0 - no. 
At page 22 was based on a memorandum to the Board 
seeking approval for the increase  in the ETC.  Signed at page 36 over a 
period of what would look like the 22 n d to 23 May 2014.  Much like the 
memorandum for the 1064 increase. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am - I am looking at the wrong …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are in the statement.  We a re in the 
second - behind the second tab.  We are in the second tab now.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Same - same bundle that has his statement?  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That has his statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then tab 2? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is followed by - no, no, no.  We are at tab 
two first.  The cardboard tab. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 84 of 168 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  Then we get his statement as regards 
100 and if you go to page - that - that statement starts pagination all 
over again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let - let us start afresh. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  This is the exhibit.  This is the bundle that has 
got Mr Chabi’s statement.  Is that the correct one you want me to look 
at? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  May I say it contains Mr  Chabi’s statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then we go to tab two? 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Tab two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Right.  Which is at page …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair.  No, no, no.  Do not.  The Chair should 
not look at the plastic flags.  Those are annexures to Mr  Chabi’s first 
statement.  Way behind the annexures is a tab. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You people. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Marked two and yes we have taken note that I 
cannot say that our colours of the tab should be different.  It should be 
the same colour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also the - the tab should not be o bscured by the 
20 
annexures. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  The flags for the annexures.  
CHAIRPERSON:  The - the tabs to the annexures.  The - the dividers 
must stand out. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will request longer dividers so that you 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 85 of 168 
 
know the eye will just fall on the divider. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It - it makes life easier. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  I will … (intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So we are now in tab two and …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The Chair will see tha t is a statement in 
relation to 100. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  100 transaction. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is a 21 page statement and at - from page 
22 is a singular annexure that Mr  Chabi relies on.  The point I was 
making is if the Chair goes to page 36 that is a signature page.  It also 
is a memorandum prepared by the Group Chief Financial Officer.  The 
Transnet Freight Chief Executive and the Group Chief Executive 
Officer.  Signed it would appear somewhere in the period the 21 s t - 
between 21 May … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Recommended by the same three officials?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As - as with the 1064 …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And again it is - it is a memorandum to the 
Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  In justifying this increase …  
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 86 of 168 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of six - 969 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So that is the background. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now that is - that is what we are supposed to 
deal with …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And I am confident that we can deal with it 
very briefly. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  There are - the issues arising therefrom are 
slightly different. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The conclusion maybe the same, but I think 
that transaction or the costing for that transaction was set - beset with 
its own problems. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That Mr Chabi I think would be in a position to 
quickly take us through them …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But the reading of the statement makes it 
clear what the issues identified were and Mr  Chabi’s conclusions.  
Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 87 of 168 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So I see that the time is quarter past.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  13 minutes past. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us - what is your estimate of how much time we 
need to finish this part?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I was going to say to Mr  Chabi to - I pose one 
question and he should give a full answer in 15 minutes.  At the end of 
which we are done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That would have been my suggestion.  I have 
10 
not checked whether it is doable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well check …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  This is a race against time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us check with him whether it is doable that way. 
MR CHABI:  I suppose it is. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is doable? 
MR CHABI:  I suppose.  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Maybe let us do that with a view that we can 
take the tea break at half past 11 and then we know we hav e done with 
20 
him. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  May I just check something?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Because we had been given three hours.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 88 of 168 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I just want to see whether the next witness is 
ready and the next evidence leader is ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja.  I am - I am told … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I do not but there is no reason why they should not 
be ready. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I am - I am told they are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No.  It is because we had given them the hour 
of 12 o’ clock.  Now that we are …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But I am - I am assured that they are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So we can do a run through then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hopefully to finish Mr  Chabi by half past 11. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No.  That is - that is fine.  Let us do that. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So Mr Chabi, I - I tried to give the - the Chair 
20 
a brief background to this 100 transaction - 100 locomotives and just to 
remind you Mr Sedumedi during his testimony took the Chair through 
the various transactions and - and showed how they all fit together.  So 
you do not have to worry about the background to this 100 transaction.   
That - that one has been laid before the Chair.  
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 89 of 168 
 
Considering your mandate as you set out in your paragraph 
2.1 just briefly - we accept and I do not think any issue arises from 
your paragraph 3 which sets out the methodology and you confirm that 
the methodology is in keeping with the same methodology you followed 
for 1064? 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So the methodology is not an issue.  
We are clear as to what your mandate was.  Can you then speak to the 
issues and difficulties you identified in this transaction and when you 
are done to then express an opinion as - as regards the issues you 
10 
were supposed to express an opinion on which is the possibility of the 
reasons advanced for an ETC increase by 969 million and you 
undertook to the Chair you can do all that in 15 minutes or less?  
MR CHABI:  Sorry.  I do not have the slide in my hand to project it.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, but the Chair has the slide.  What you 
perhaps do not have - Chair on - if you go to your slide 33. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What number? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is where …  
CHAIRPERSON:  36? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Slide 3-3. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  3-3? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja.  33 Chair.  That is where 100 starts.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Chabi you had said - so you do have the 
slides.  What you do not have is the slides on the computer to project 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 90 of 168 
 
onto the screen? 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But you have your own witness copy of the 
slide. 
MR CHABI:  I do. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  We are now at transaction  100 starting 
at page 33 and - and what would you like to draw the Chair’s attention 
to in response to the question?  
MR CHABI:  I suppose if you go to slide 4 Chair …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
10 
MR CHABI:  Which are the reasons put forward for the increase in th e 
memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR CHABI:  We have the numbers in red as per the memorandum and 
the numbers in blue as per …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR CHABI:  The recalculations.  Again in this instance we have got an 
update of the business case for eco nomic factors at 495 million.  We 
came to a figure of 194 million.  That is about 40 percent - 40/50 
percent.  In this instance like the 1064 we have a scope change, 
20 
because this transaction was awarded to CSR.  
CSR did not have the right locomotive which w as a 19E 
locomotive with a level of tractive power.  So their solution was to 
convert a 20E locomotive to a 19E locomotive and that conversion 
required certain costs to be effected and those costs came to 347 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 91 of 168 
 
million.  Those costs were valid as at March  2014. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So - so you are suggesting that CSR was 
awarded a tender for locomotives they did not have and they - they did 
not at the time have? 
MR CHABI:  In their arsenal.  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And of the locomotives it had it had to effe ct 
certain changes to the existing locomotives in order to comply with the 
bid? 
MR CHABI:  Design changes and modifications yes.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
 
But 
appreciating 
that 
because 
the 
10 
memorandum is dated May  2014.  Nonetheless they were awarded the - 
the contract? 
MR CHABI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay and, because they did not have that it 
cost Transnet - Transnet an extra 347 million for the scope change?  As 
- as … 
MR CHABI:  Not that it cost …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As regards of course the - the make.  You 
spoke of 19E/20E. 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So to bring the - the locomotive to actual 
speck … 
MR CHABI:  Yes.  That … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At this bid.  Transnet had to fork out another 
347 million? 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 92 of 168 
 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja.  Yes. 
MR CHABI:  Risk mitigation costs in this instance amounted to 371 
million.  We came to about 300 million.  Contingents at about 440 
million.  We came to 373 million.  Unlike the previous case where we 
applied a seven percent contingency.  We appl ied 10 to the entire 
contract here, because there were just so many uncertainties from the 
memorandum and one major one for us was it kept referring to a 
Rand/Yen exchange rate. 
In keeping with the mandate and trying to reproduce the cost 
10 
based on the - using the basis put forward in the - in the memorandum.  
There was a cost of about 765, but I think we will get to that.  It was a 
problem for us, because we thought okay.  If CSR’s submission were in 
Dollars why is the memorandum making reference to Yen.  I f you look at 
the currency movements between the Yen and the Dollar they were 
quite - they were materially different. 
In certain instances the Rand appreciated against the - the 
Yen.  Counting as a benefit to Transnet.  However when you compare it 
to the Dollar right through we see a depreciation in the Rand.  So that 
would have material effects on the - well a material impact.  Sorry.  On 
20 
the results.  In other words the increase in ETC that we put forward as 
a reasonable increase in ETC. 
The memorandum also speaks to a discount negotiated of 247 
million.  I would like to note here that looking at the first page of the 
memorandum we did pick up certain errors in that table.  In fact that 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 93 of 168 
 
discount should have been higher than 247 million, because the costs 
of 373 million in the executive summary should have been 1100 - sorry.  
811 million.  So that is understate about 400 million.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR CHABI:  In trying to get to an increase of R969 million in this 
instance.  You are going to get a muc h bigger discount than 2.47.  We 
however did not dispute that discount which made up five percent.  
Roughly five.  Actually 5.32 percent of the locomotive costs.  So we 
applied the same principle in our calculation allowing for a five percent 
discount, because it is unlikely that at a reduced fee Transnet would 
10 
have gotten a similar level of discount.  So we adjust the discount 
downwards to reflect the law - a contract price. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Then I think we can then move on to 
your slide 38 - slide 6. 
MR CHABI:  Slide 6. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair it would be page 38 of your slide pack 
and - and that slide that is where you all - you put it all together. 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As you did previously with the 1064.  You 
made a comparison between your figures and the memorandum’s 
20 
figures per line item.  The one thing you do not do at slide 8 is to 
consider the - the business case itself. 
MR CHABI:  Correct.  Although in the statement we provide some 
comments on it. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is headed “Opinion on a Reasonable ETC” 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 94 of 168 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I have found it.  Slide 6 page 38.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Page - slide 6 page 38 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR CHABI:  Correct.  So if I may.  So that slide gives you the build up 
to 4.8 billion, because the increase was from 3.871 billion to 4.87 -odd 
billion.  That is a R969 million increase in the ETC.  That slide gives 
you the build up to the 4.8 billion.  Similar to what we saw in 1064.  We 
can see they start with the price per locomotive  as at May 2013 of 
34.34. 
10 
It was not our mandate to at the time of putting this report 
together to look into the initial ETC of 3.8 billion.  However MNS had a 
subsequent stage through the advocate’s request asked to have a quick 
look at the initial ETC of 3.8 billion.  Maybe before I carry on having 
looked at that ETC we came to the view that that ETC should have been 
about 4.3 billion as opposed to 3.8.  
A number of errors were made in the computation of the 3.8 
billion.  One of them being that on the loca l content and instead of 
applying 60 percent as per the DTI requirement.  A 40 percent figure 
was applied and on the foreign component instead of applying 40 
20 
percent, 50 percent was applied.  I think we speak to the effect of those 
errors on the - on the ETC. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the 4.2 you - you arrive at as what the 
ETC ought to have been instead of 3.8.  Is as a function of your 
correcting the errors you identified?  
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 95 of 168 
 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay and you come to 4.2. 
MR CHABI:  In addition that there was a third error that - there was a 
10 percent deposit paid in the third 2013/2014 period.  That would have 
been paid as per the business case and the rest of the cost would have 
been incurred in 2014/2015.  So essentially 2015/2016.  So 56 
locomotives in 2015.  44 in 2016.  The application of the discount to 
those costs was - had I suppose some mathematical errors that we 
adjusted for … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
10 
MR CHABI:  And that brought us to a cost of about 4.3 …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR CHABI:  Six billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
 
But 
you 
- 
you 
are 
saying 
that 
the 
memorandum - the 2014 memorandum departed from the premise that 
the 3.8 billion was correct?  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it is to the 3.8 billion that the 969 m illion 
is added? 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To give a new ETC of 4.8 billion?  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is what you have at your slide 6.  You 
recalculated and you start off with a price of 30.95 per locomotive and 
not 34.34 as set out in the memorandum. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 96 of 168 
 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Why - why the difference in that?  Why do you 
apply - do you arrive at a slightly less price per locomotive?  
MR CHABI:  Okay.  So the 34.34 is derived from a Yen price of R384 
million - million Yen.  Sorry and that is on the basis that the ETC was 
30 - 3.8 billion.  So the 34.34 is wrong on the basis that the - for the 
reasons we have just mentioned.  The incorrect local and foreign 
components applied and …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So a base price of 34.34 plus whatever errors 
is what gives us to 3.8 billion?  
10 
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, but you arrived at 30.95 million?  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Quickly briefly tell us how and why?  
MR CHABI:  Okay.  So CSR in its submissions put forward a price as at 
April 2012 of 28.86 million. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Per locomotive? 
MR CHABI:  Per locomotive, but remember that was for the 20E 
locomotive.  Not the 19E locomotive.  We thought it best to work from 
that basis.  Build it up and then allow for the modification costs to 
20 
arrive at a cost for an equivalent - well what they term an equivalent 
19E … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja. 
MR CHABI:  Locomotive … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 97 of 168 
 
MR CHABI:  As at March 2014.  We will get to that …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So you - you arrive at 30 million. 
MR CHABI:  30.95. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Million … 
MR CHABI:  Million. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Per locomotive? 
MR CHABI:  As at May 2013 … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja. 
MR CHABI:  But this is still on the 20E locomotiv e. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of course. 
10 
MR CHABI:  Because they allowed for the modification costs.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But then you do factor in the modification 
costs? 
MR CHABI:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The 300 - that … 
MR CHABI:  3.47 million. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  3.47 - 347 for all 100.  Right?  
MR CHABI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the price then would be with the 
modification costs 34 million per - per locomotive as at that date.  
20 
Right? 
MR CHABI:   At which date sorry? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   As at May 2013. 
MR CHABI:   No because the modification costs with 3.47 as at 28 Feb 
2014 valid for a month. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 98 of 168 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   So it’s 2014 or 2013?   Is it May 2014 you 
say? 
MR CHABI:   No, no so 30.95 is as at May 2013.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Yes. 
MR CHABI:   But it’s a price for a 20E locomotive as at May 2013.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   I’m with you.  And the memo starts from the 
premise that the price per locomotive was 34.34?  
MR CHABI:   Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   And you say that can’t be correct because it 
does not correlate with the bid received from CSR, their own costing?  
10 
MR CHABI:   Correct CSR’s submission is in dollars ...[intervenes]  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   They came in 2828. 
MR CHABI:   34.34 it is a 385million Yen price.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Okay the memo takes into account the 
modification cost like – which is what you did as well, so 3.47?  
MR CHABI:   Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   So the modified locomotive according to the 
memo is 34.34million plus 3.47 that brings me roughly into the 
38million mark? 
MR CHABI:   Correct. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Whereas you are at 34million?  
MR CHABI:   Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   And then we follow that table, we get to your 
final price per locomotive of 37.27, the memo comes to a price of 
44million per locomotive 440?  
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 99 of 168 
 
MR CHABI:   Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Okay then there are adjustments to allow for 
the contingencies and the it gets to a final increase number.  You – the 
memo suggests was seeking authorisation or approval for an increase 
by 969million and your calculation or  recalculation can only justify an 
increase of 229million?  
MR CHABI:   Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   And that is the primary difference between 
yourselves, your calculations and the memo?  
MR CHABI:   Correct. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   You have at that slide complication of 25%, 
5.9% and just so when we read it tomorrow we know exactly what 
you’re talking about, can you talk us through it you’ve got your 
contingency and just below you’ve got ETC for 100 ;locomotives plus 
contingency 4.8billion per memo where you get 4.1 and you say or you 
compare with original ETC then it was 3.871 and you use also 3.871, 
then you’ve got an RO next to it, it indicates 25% as far as the 
calculation is concerned and looking at your recalculation it’s 5.9% 
what do those percentages represent? 
MR CHABI:   Basically we’re saying that an increase of 6% on the 
20 
regional ETC assuming the ETC is correct would have been more 
acceptable ...[intervenes]  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Okay. 
MR CHABI:   Compared to the 25% increase in ETC that the memo pu t 
forward. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 100 of 168 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   So your finding is that you would permit only 
an increase of the original ETC by – it’s 5.9%. 
MR CHABI:   6%. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   6%, approval sought and granted by the 
Board was to increase that 3.8billion ETC by 25%.  
MR CHABI:   Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Is there anything else you would like to say 
on the ETC, on the 100 locomotives.  
MR CHABI:   That’s it, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you look at what the Board approved and the 
difference between that and what you arrived at and the information 
placed before the Board are you able or are you not able to say 
whether the probabilities are that the Board was misled when you have 
regard to all factors or are you not able – when I say misled I mean 
deliberately. 
MR CHABI:   So Chair I think that submission will probably hold more 
in the 1064 case than it would here.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CHABI:   And here I highlight that the memo was not consistent.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MR CHABI:   The memorandum on the 100 was largely inconsistent.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CHABI:   With the facts provided from CSR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 101 of 168 
 
MR CHABI:   It is then very difficult to say whether it was management 
misleading the Board, or management having mis calculated from the 
business case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Genuinely? 
MR CHABI:   Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Having genuinely miscalculated. 
MR CHABI:   On the business case stage yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes. 
MR CHABI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if it was genuine w ould you say they must have 
10 
been negligence, maybe gross negligence or that’s something that you 
wouldn’t be able to – well you wouldn’t be able to go that far, it might 
just be a question of them having been wrong and maybe very wrong 
but that’s as far as  you can take it. 
MR CHABI:   Yes, it will be very difficult Chair to opine on that, I think 
MNS’s that are placed having I supposed included or allowed for these 
findings in their overall findings.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.    
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Chair I note that the time is now 11:34 and I 
would like to place on record that I have finished with Mr Chabi at 
20 
11:31 so I was one minute out on my undertaking.  
CHAIRPERSON:  (laughing)  You want to protect your skills in 
assessment of time and how much time you  need to ...[intervenes]  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   My reputation going forward so that the Chair 
can still trust me tomorrow on my estimations.  
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 102 of 168 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that influenced by the number of attorneys around 
today? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   And counsel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And counsel. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   So unless the Chair has further questions 
that is the evidence of Mr Chabi regarding the 1064 transaction and 
100. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   And I think that brings to a close Mr Chabi’s 
testimony. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that’s fine.   Thank you very much Mr Chabi for 
your evidence and for having been able to come at earlier than normal 
time to day to be here to give evidence.  Should the need arise we will 
ask you to come back again but as I said you might fi nd that there are 
questions for clarification that you must be asked, clarifications that 
you must be asked to give just in writing without coming back but thank 
you very much, and you are excused.  
MR CHABI:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   Ms Sello I would like a full set of all the 
exhibits and Transnet statements to be made available, a full set and 
20 
statements but I would like the same thing in regard to Eskom, if you 
can convey the message to your colleagues.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the transcript of evidence of all the witnesses 
who have given evidence in regard to both work streams because of 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 103 of 168 
 
how we have been hearing witnesses, in other words not according to 
themes but according to availability in order to ma ximise our time might 
or might not be difficult to put together but in the end I would want the 
transcript as well so – but I think the exhibits will be easy to and all the 
statements will be easy to achieve, they can be achieved quicker so if 
you could maybe make sure people who know what needs to be done to 
get that done, they know, but you having been fully involved in at least 
Transnet, I can’t remember whether you were involved in Eskom as 
well. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   No. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  In Transnet you and your colleagues who have been 
assisting you might be able to assist by making sure that there is a full 
list of the names of witnesses plus maybe your own bundles to say here 
is a complete set then they can make copies from those and then I can 
be told once those are available. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Just to make sure we get the message 
correctly and convey a correct message, we are giving the Chair all 
statements and their annexures I take it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, basically everything that has been handed up . 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Everything that has been dealt with in oral 
20 
testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   When I say this I try to distinguish between 
that and what we call for instance the Transnet reference bundle, the 
Transnet reference bundle is huge, and there are other reports in that 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 104 of 168 
 
reference bundle that we have not dealt with in open hearing.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   So am I understanding the Chair correctly 
that we confine copies of the exhibits to those that have b een dealt 
with through witnesses here in open hearing.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well everything that has been placed before me.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Through witnesses? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even without witnesses as long as it has been placed 
before me.   It may be that we start with what has been placed before 
me through witnesses. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then seeing from your reaction you are thinking 
about me, ...[indistinct]  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   For the Chair because if we do it that way 
then the Chair can express an opinion as to whether that is what he 
wanted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja, ja, ja, we can start that way, ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Because I am thinking if the Chair will recall 
when we did the Transnet reference bundle we in effect gave t he Chair 
the reports only and the actual exhibits that sit behind those reports we 
20 
didn’t give in hard copy because the Chair would have ended probably 
with 60 arch lever files. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, that’s fine, let’s limit it for now to the 
witnesses and their bundles. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   To the witnesses. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 105 of 168 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And so on. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Then we will just add then copies of 
transcripts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then we can take, ja, I mean I have got mine, that is 
fine, but there is a reason why I nee d a separate set. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   No, no we should be able to do that, and we 
will communicate that to Eskom team as well.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay and same thing with Eskom.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, thank you.   Okay, we are going to take the tea 
10 
adjournment now, it is about 18/nineteen minutes to, we will resume at 
twelve for the next witness.  We adjourn.  
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Rangata are you ready?  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Good morning DCJ yes, yes I am ready.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning, good afternoon. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Good afternoon Chair.  Good afternoon 
Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is only a few seconds into the after noon. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 106 of 168 
 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Good morning Mr Hlongwane and 
welcome.  Chair we are here today to – to ask Mr Hlongwane some few 
questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will have to raise your voice.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Oh sorry about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA :  Chair we are here today – the witness 
today is Mr Hlongwane – Mr Fana Hlongwane he is here today to 
answer some few questions.  We do not think that this session is going 
to be that long because the questions are very particular.  They arise 
10 
out of the evidence of Mr Jonas from his statement which he has 
provided to this commission in August 2018.  Mr Hlongwane has 
received – he is here because he has received summons I want to say 
from the legal team and the task team that is out of not – of distrust or 
any reason but it is just for easier measures to make sure that 
everything is done properly but we really appreciate you coming here 
and please no offence I understand we had a discuss ion earlier.  But 
thank you very much for coming.  I must also acknowledge that we have 
attempted previously to – to have this session Sir – Chair and for 
obvious reasons and reasons why we have received from him 
20 
unfortunate reasons from the sickness of his father he could not make 
it during that time.  And we thank the Chair for understanding for that.  
So today we are ready to proceed and Mr Hlongwane is here with his 
legal representative.  I think it is an opportune time to let – to put 
themselves on rec ord. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 107 of 168 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja let us – let us have his counsel placing himself on 
record.  Thank you. 
ADV J C CILLLIERS SC:   May it please you Chair yes I am J C Cilliers 
senior counsel practicing as such at the Pretoria Bar and I am here on 
behalf of Mr Hlongwane instructed by my attorneys Mrs Stockenstroom 
Fouche Attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you very much.  Thank you.  I think we 
must also have the legal representative for Mr Jonas placing herself on 
record as well. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you Chair.

ADV LEAGO BATABATE:  Good morning Chair my name is Leago 
Batabate[?] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning, good afternoon. 
ADV LEAGO BATABATE:  Good afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAGO BATABATE:  I appear on Mr – on behalf of Mr Jonas.  I 
am here on a watching brief as we did not receive notification that Mr 
Hlongwane would be providing evidence today.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAGO BATABATE:  So we just wish to place on record that our 
20 
client reserves his rights. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAGO BATABATE:  Should the need arise to present an 
application to cross-examine Mr Hlongwane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Thank you.  Okay let us have the oath 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 108 of 168 
 
administered or affirmation. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Administered. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record?  
MR HLONGWANE:  Fana Hlongwane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please speak up a little bit more Mr Hlongwane.  
MR HLONGWANE:  Fana Hlongwane. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to making the prescribed 
affirmation? 
MR HLONGWANE:  No. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you solemnly affirm that the evidence you will give 
shall be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth, if so please 
raise your right hand and say, I truly affirm?  
MR HLONGWANE:  I truly affirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Essentially Mr Hlongwane the 
evidence that is required by the commission from you really relates to 
the evidence given by Mr Jonas about a meeting that you both agreed 
took place on the 23 October 2015 at the Gupta residence in 
Saxonwold.  As I understand the pos ition you both agreed that a 
meeting took place, you disagree about the content of the discussion in 
20 
that meeting and whether or not there was a member of the Gupta 
family in the meeting or not.  Everything else revolves around that and 
the questions that you will be asked will relate to that.  You 
understand? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Thank you Chair. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 109 of 168 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Rangata. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may – you may – you may ahead. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you for that – for that [indistinct] 
yes Chair.  Chair for today’s process we – we going to be relying on the 
following documents.  We have in front of us LL8 which has got an 
index of documents that we are going  to rely on. But as the Chair has 
already correctly pointed most we are going to rely on item 1.7.3 that 
10 
appears on the index.  So we going to be relying on three files. Chair if 
I can enter into the record with your permission LL8.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on I have got three lever arch files here.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One is marked Exhibit LL and LL1A another one 
Exhibit LL1B and then Exhibit LL8.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now has any one of these been previously  admitted 
already? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which ones? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  LL1A and LL1B has already been entered 
into the record as such during the evidence of Mr Duduzane.  
CHAIRPERSON:  They have been admitted. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 110 of 168 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And LL8? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  LL8 is the new introduced by me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It has not been? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Admitted. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And LL8 consists of? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA :  LL8 Chair it consists of – it consists of the 
10 
item 2 and item 3.  Item 2 being the transcripts of Mr Duduzane Zuma 
for both days the 8 October and the 7 t h.  And item 3 that is other 
documents in particularly being the phone analysis – phone number 
analysis for Mr Jonas – Mcebesi Jonas as well as the draft statement of 
Mr Bongani More together with a signed statement that is more 
identical to 3.2 and 3.3 are more identical they have just been provi ded 
for convenience and because the other one is not that much clear.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am tempted to [indistinct] take out the transcripts 
but that is going to cause some problems with the planning that you 
have already done.  So we will just have to make d o. 
20 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  The lever arch file containing the transcript of 
the evidence of Mr Duduzane Zuma as well as – what comes after that?  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  It is the phone number analysis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no,no.  After the transcript of Mr Duduzane Zuma.  
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 111 of 168 
 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Other documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well after 2.2 what transcript is that – is that 
argument or is that still Mr Zuma continuing?  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Under 2 we have got 2.1 being day 1  178 
and 2.2 being day 179.  And then it is sub -folder 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But why is it separated if it is the same evidence with 
2.2? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  2.2 it is – it is 2 contents of 1 and 2 being 
10 
separate dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja why – why separate them? But we separate days 
but it is the same witness, same evidence.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  I take that point Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it causes confusion.  Okay the lever arch file 
which contains Mr Duduzane Zuma’s tr anscript of evidence and a 
document marked SCC digital forensic technologies data analysis 
output will be marked Exhibit – will be admitted as Exhibit LL8. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you very much for that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA :  Chair I want to move straight to – to our 
file LL1B under item 1.7.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 112 of 168 
 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA :  And let me go to – straight to page 813.  
Mr Hlongwane if you – if you go to file – if you look at your spine you 
will find that this is marked as LL1B and if you go to – if you look at 
your extreme left on each page there is red numbering.  That is the 
number that I will be referring to when I call the numbers and I will only 
be calling the last number.  Are you struggling with?  
MR HLONGWANE:  I will manage.  What number is it?  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Are you – okay page 613. 
CHAIRPERSON:  613? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes DCJ.   
10 
MR HLONGWANE:  613. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On which Exhibit? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Exhibit LL1.1B. 
MR HLONGWANE:  613?  I do not see 613. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  They – they are coming to assist you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you going to be using the right numbers?  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes Chair.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page did you say we must go to?  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Chair it is page 613 it is a document 
entitled Affidavit of Mr Fana Hlongwane.  Are you there Sir?  
20 
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes I am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes.  Can you identify – Chair are we? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  You – you got the document? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 113 of 168 
 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  thank you Chair.  Can you identify that 
document that appears on page 613?  
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes it is an affidavit by myself Chair.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay that is you Fana Hlongwane, you 
confirm that? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes Ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you.  If you go to the same pattern 
in numbering if you go to page 622.   
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Are you there?  If you look at the bottom 
10 
of that page there is a name there or a signature there, can you identify 
that? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes I can. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Is that your signature?  
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes it is. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay can you confirm this – that this is 
your statement or your affidavit that you have signed?  
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes I can. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Can you confirm that? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes I do. 
20 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you.  Can we then accept that the 
contents of this document that this is what – this is what you say to this 
– to this – to the Chair contained in this affidavit?  
MR HLONGWANE:  Correct. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you.  Thank you very much. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 114 of 168 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to also confirm is this an affi – is this the 
affidavit that you filed with the commission in support of your 
application for Leave to Cross-examine Mr Jonas? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes I – casually reading yes.  That would be the 
same thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. Okay. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you Mr Hlongwane.  I am going to 
try and attempt to – to deal with issues that I think they might not be 
that much of a dispute.  Please tell me if you do not agree if you think 
it is something that we need to debate or if you agree with it.  For 
10 
example I am going to deal with the issue of the meeting that you had 
with Mr Duduzane and Mr Jonas and youself.  Can we accept that the 
three of you had a meeting on the 23 October 2015?  
MR HLONGWANE:  That is correct. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay can we confirm that the meeting was 
arranged by Mr Duduzane Zuma? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Correct. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Can we also confirm that the meeting was 
initially arranged to take place at the Hyatt Hotel in Rosebank, would 
you know that? 
20 
MR HLONGWANE:  I can confirm that they had the meeting initially at 
the Hyatt in Rosebank not that it was arranged to be at the Hyatt in 
Rosebank yes. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe we could – maybe we could do it this way.  
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 115 of 168 
 
Maybe because it is not a long story.  Maybe we could let Mr 
Hlongwane tell me in his own words how that meeting came about and 
once he has finished then you can ask questions.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just tell me in your own words as far as you know 
how that meeting came about, who was at the meeting, what was the 
purpose of the meeting, what was discussed at the meeting and insofar 
as there may be anything that happened after that is relevant mention it 
10 
as well? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and fell free to tell me about yourself.  If you – 
if there is something about yourself and the background that you think I 
should know for purposes of today but if there is nothing it is fine.  
MR HLONGWANE:  The genesis of the meeting Chair was Dud uzane 
Zuma highlighting to me that he has hearing rumours that I was 
allegedly blackmailing Mr Jonas. He mentioned it several times on 
different occasions.  I did not take up the matter at the time because I 
thought it improbable because of the relationshi p I had with Jonas.  
20 
And after several times of trying...  
CHAIRPERSON:  And you had been friends with him for a long time Mr 
Jonas? 
MR HLONGWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 116 of 168 
 
MR HLONGWANE:  Friends and comrades.  I believe the same still  
prevails now.  However…  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Sorry I did not get that. 
MR HLONGWANE:  I believe the same still prevails now.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Alright. 
MR HLONGWANE:  I still believe he is comrade.  So it worried me a lot.  
I could not understand it there is all manner of conspiracies in the 
political space so first, second time I did not take up the matter but the 
young man raised it again then I said, listen just arrange a meeting at 
the source of the story arrange a meeting let us deal with this issue 
10 
decisively because he is a man I hold in high regard.  I do not believe 
in stabbing anybody in the back.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me just understand.  His reports to you was – 
were that he had heard that Mr Jonas was blackmailing you.  Is that 
what he said to you? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes I think the background to that Chair is he knew 
I had a close relationship with Jonas, a gentleman I held in high 
esteem and I think what he found at odds is how I spoke highly of him 
and what was picking up in the market place .  So he raised it several 
times and then it was difficult for me to believe that, that is why I said 
20 
let us have that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes just one second Mr Hlongwane.  The technicians 
if they can have a look. 
MR HLONGWANE:  Am I not audible? 
MR HLONGWANE:  I do not know whether – you are not as clearly 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 117 of 168 
 
audible as I would like you but it was happening with the previous 
witness as well but I thought – so it may be that if – no actually 
bringing in the microphone closer might complicate it – the situation 
more.  Maybe if you are – you lift quite some distance – just talk now 
before they do anything without coming closer.  Just talk.  What – tell 
us what Mr Duduzane said to you then I am going to see how audible it 
is. 
MR HLONGWANE:  What he found at odds was the contradiction 
between the esteem which I held. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is much clearer for me.  That is much clearer.  
10 
So maybe do not come close just speak from a distance but I will ask 
you to raise your voice a bit. Okay I think let us leave it li ke that.  If 
there is a problem then we will ask the technicians to check if there is 
anything. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can you hear well from that side?  Are you able to 
hear? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes I can hear Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you may continue. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  You going to proceed. 
MR HLONGWANE:  So in the intervening period I made an undertaking 
which he had asked me to make that I am not going  to raise the issue 
prior to that meeting that I demanded must be held  Because it what – I 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 118 of 168 
 
might have been hot under the collar.  I made that undertaking that I 
will not raise it until such time that we have a three way meeting with 
Jonas.  He sought to have that meeting.  I placed the responsibility on 
him squarely.  We are raising this issue with somebody who is close to 
me whatever your sources are I would like you to [indistinct] this issue 
in my and his presence.  Which meeting was duly arranged betwe en 
them and Jonas.  They met at the Hyatt for whatever reasons.  One was 
at Ned [indistinct] one was at [indistinct] that was the nearest venue for 
them.  The Hyatt was a problem for me Chair.  I said to both of them I 
called Mr Zuma let us find a private venue for this meeting.  I called Mr 
10 
Zuma on the same telephone conversation I spoke to Jonas.  We 
agreed to move the meeting.  The young man [indistinct] respond really 
to us to ascertain a venue nearby.  Ja ascertain the venue which was 
both the business  centre and the residence.  I think that is where he 
operated from most of the time.  We went to that venue Chair and the 
meeting duly took place.  Given that I was not supposed to raise any 
issue before it was – fell upon the young man to raise the issue for the 
reason of that particular meeting.  Because for anything else to take 
place we had to clear the air.  I had my own issues in my mind so I 
needed to clear the air.  And the point was duly raised.  Mr Jonas’ 
20 
response to the best of my recollection wa s – he said he does not have 
a recollection of ever having said that.  That is what he said.  Beside 
the basic niceties it was not a long meeting.  He had a flight to catch 
and those kinds of things.  My only brief was to establish that because 
of the nature of the relationship that we had until then.  There were a 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 119 of 168 
 
number things happening in the political space some of which resulted 
in this commission.  So I just needed to understand what would be the 
issue around me?  Why would I be dragged into any – essentially that 
was it in brief Chair. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  How long was the meeting?  
MR HLONGWANE:  It was very brief Ma’am I do not know.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  If you have to estimate was five – ten 
minutes? 
MR HLONGWANE:  I do not want to mislead the C hair. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay. 
10 
MR HLONGWANE:  The meeting was very brief you can say under a 
half an hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Twenty minutes, thirty minutes, one hour?  
MR HLONGWANE:  You can say around half an hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  hm. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  About thirty minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm; 
MR HLONGWANE:  Ja. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  So I want you to just take me back to 
when you met – when you went into that meeting who broke the ice?  
20 
Who spoke? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Who broke the ice? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes who started? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Ma’am look we arrived simultaneously.  We got into 
the place.  Naturally the issue is not raised.  We all greet.  I do not 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 120 of 168 
 
know which part is breaking the ice.  We greet.  We know each other 
that kind of thing so I am not sur e which part would be breaking the 
ice. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  The – the main issue that we are there to 
discuss who started on it?  Was it yourself or was it Duduzane?  
MR HLONGWANE:  It was Mr Duduzane.  It had to be Mr Duduzane.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Right okay. 
MR HLONGWANE:  My recollection tells me that yes.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA :  Alright and when he started what was his 
context of the discussion?  What did he say?  
10 
MR HLONGWANE:  Huh? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  What did he say exactly?  
MR HLONGWANE:  Exactly I cannot tell you but essentially I know you 
guys to be my senior comrades’ etcetera.  Fana holds you in high 
esteem etcetera.  I was picking up these things in the market place so 
it was important to clear it up.  Because yes I did – I do hold both of 
them in high esteem.  That does not change now.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay alright.  You mentioned that when 
you – when you were advised that the meeting was going to take place 
at the Hyatt you had a problem with the venue  
20 
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Of the Hyatt.  What exactly was the 
problem with the Hyatt Hotel?  
MR HLONGWANE:  They were seated at the lobby.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I do not know whether it is your voice or 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 121 of 168 
 
the microphone is too far from you.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay I will… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like… 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I cannot hear anybody today. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you Chair.  I just – ja so I apologise 
for that.  I wanted to know your concern with the…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is a – that is a better volume.  So – so if you 
raise your voice it becomes quite audible.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA :  Can you tell us what exactly what is the 
problem – what made you made uncomfortable having the meeting at 
the Hyatt Hotel? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Privacy Ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Privacy. 
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes Ma’am.   
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  The – and the hotel could not provide you 
with a private rooms? 
MR HLONGWANE:  How? 
20 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  The hotel has – it did not have the 
business section where you can make use of the business side of the 
meeting or the rooms? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Okay Chair our chance of that nature generally 
have those facilities available. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 122 of 168 
 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:  There was time pressure.  Somebody had to catch a 
flight. In order to get that facility there is  
1. Availability issues. 
2. There is time issues.  You need to book.  
3. There is cost issues. 
So it is not a given that because you are  there you can walk into any 
private room no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  So you could not consider the Hyatt 
10 
because it needed to have been prearranged for that facility for 
business meetings? 
MR HLONGWANE:  I did not hear that. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  So you could not have the meeting at the 
Hyatt for privacy reasons but because you could not have arranged a 
business room at that time?  
MR HLONGWANE:  Okay context Ma’am again.  The meeting at the 
Hyatt the convergence was not arranged by myself . 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:  The two gentlemen, one was nearby do – in the 
20 
[indistinct] meeting finished so what was the easiest place for them to 
meet.  They converged at the Hyatt.  So prearrangements does not 
arise because I was not party to that. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Alright. 
MR HLONGWANE:  So when they were there they told me they were 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 123 of 168 
 
there I raised the issue of privacy.  So the prearrangement could not 
arise at the time. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA :  Okay.  I am just not getting – getting to 
your response on this one because if privacy was the main issue and if 
you have to look at the time pressures obviously I would imagine that 
you talking about Mr Jonas because he had to go to the airport.  Would 
it not have been quicker to have actually  the hotel to provide you with 
that facility rather than to go outside the hotel?  
MR HLONGWANE:  I do not think it would have been quicker. Like I 
said in order to get a room you need to prearrange and 2. Its 
10 
availability.  These placed are always busy.  3 . There is a cost element. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  I understand you and they could not have 
establishedat at that time if it was available?  We – I am not hearing 
that it was not available I am hearing that availability.  So what I am 
asking is was it asked and they said they were full?  
MR HLONGWANE:  The issue never arose. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I said we must find a private place it is a hotel they 
are in the lobby.  The issue never arose.  I asked for a private space.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Alright.  And when you – when you asked 
20 
about the privacy is it Duduzane who suggested an alternative venue?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Duduzane Zuma. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Mr Dududuzane Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not Duduzane. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Sorry Sir. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196

MR HLONGWANE:  As far as I can remember yes Ma’am.

ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  When you received that address or when it 
was communicated to you was it familiar to you?  
20 
MR HLONGWANE:  What was familiar?  Saxonwold?  Yes it was 
familiar. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  The address itself did you have an idea 
what kind of a place it was?  Whether it will provide you with the same 
privacy that you desired?  
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 125 of 168 
 
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  You could – you were satisfied? 
MR HLONGWANE:  That is his work space.  It had the necessary 
facilities yes. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  At that stage did you understand that 
address to be a residence area?  
MR HLONGWANE:  Excuse me? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Did you understand that address to be a 
residential place? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes ma’am.  I understood it to be both a residential 
10 
place and a business centre, because I have interactions with the 
Duduzane over a period of time. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  So you have been there before - before 
that - on that date? 
MR HLONGWANE:  At this point I do not remember ma’am.  It is a long 
time ago. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  I just want to - to imagine this.  You - you 
are not happy with - with the address that you - you have been provided 
and you suggest that you need a private space and then they give you 
an alternative space or an address which happens to be 5 Saxonwold 
20 
which I am sure you can agree that it is - it is a Gupta residence.  You - 
can you confirm that? 
MR HLONGWANE:  What was the question ma’am?  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Can you confirm that 5 Saxonwold is a 
Gupta residence - residence? 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 126 of 168 
 
MR HLONGWANE:  I do not understand the se nse of the question 
though. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She is asking whether you are able to confirm that 
the place where you had this meeting was a residence for the Gupta 
family. 
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes.  Of course.  Certainly. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  And at that time when you were given the 
address you - you identified that as the Gupta residence?  
MR HLONGWANE:  Duduzane had a business centre where he operated 
from.  I have known the gentleman.  So I knew about this thing.  Just 
10 
like he came to my house.  I - I knew his - his business.  I do not 
understand what is the point. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Please forgive me sir.  I am just …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Hlongwane the question is whether you were 
given the address you knew or were told that the venue to which the 
meeting was shifted was a Gupta residence. 
MR HLONGWANE:  I can confirm that Chair.  I understand the question 
better now.  I confirm that.  Thank you.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
MR HLONGWANE:  (Intervenes). 
20 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you for that Chair. 
MR HLONGWANE:  My apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HLONGWANE:  That is … (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 127 of 168 
 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  So we now under - understand that when 
you received the address you - you knew at the time that you were now 
given the Gupta residence address and that you are going to have your 
meeting at the Gupta residence.  At some - a third party’s residential 
area. 
MR HLONGWANE:  I knew the address.  Third party or not.  That is a 
different issue, because the young man worked from there.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  You were comfortable going into that - in 
that - in that area? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes.  It is a venue that is private.  Yes.  I was 
10 
comfortable. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Let me ask you this.  Are you aware that 
Duduzane owns a house at Saxonwold?  Actually when he gave his 
evidence he said to the Chair that he is residence is more or less about 
600 metres from - from the Gupta residence. 
MR HLONGWANE:  That is correct. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Are you aware of that? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes.  I am aware. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Can I - can I ask why you - you - a 
meeting was not - did not take place at his residence?  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
MR HLONGWANE:  I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember that - as I understand his evidence.  He 
said it was Mr Duduzane Zuma who decided which venue. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes Chair. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 128 of 168 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is not him. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay.  I can - I cannot take it any further 
Chair.  So you - you go into this - in - into this house. It is yourself.  It 
is Mr Jonas.  It is Mr Duduzane and you enter the house.  Is it in - 
inside the house or is it - is it a separate - is a separate office where 
you can work or is it inside the - the - is it - is a separate business side 
where you can work? 
MR HLONGWANE:  It is - it is a lounge ma’am.  
10 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  It is a lounge? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Ja.  Meeting lounge. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  It is a meeting lounge?  
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Is if office - does it have office utensil s 
like your proper boardroom tables?  
MR HLONGWANE:  It is a lounge ma’am.  A lounge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  So you - you enter the house and anybody 
that received you when you entered the hou se? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Mr Duduzane Zuma was familiar with the place. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay. 
MR HLONGWANE:  So he led us to the relevant lounge.  
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 129 of 168 
 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Was there somebody in the house when 
you entered? 
MR HLONGWANE:  The house was buzzing.  Yes.  I am sure there are 
people.  The securities.  People walking around.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Alright.  Except for the three of you did 
anyone join you for the meeting?  
MR HLONGWANE:  Except for the three of us during the course of the 
meeting ma’am there were a number what I would call interruptions.  
Somebody coming for coffee.  Somebody for this.  Somebody looking 
for this, but anybody joining to sit us for the substantive meeting.  No 
10 
ma’am. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As I understand the position you were frie nds with 
both Mr Jonas and Mr Duduzane Zuma.  Is that correct?  
MR HLONGWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and as far as you know and as far as you are 
concerned the purpose for the meeting was to discuss what 
Mr Duduzane Zuma had reported to you about rumours of blackmailing 
and to discuss this in the presence of Mr  Jonas.  So that you could 
hear what he has to say?  Is that right?  
MR HLONGWANE:  That is right.  Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now you - you did say that Mr Duduzane Zuma 
is the one who - if I understood you correctly - introduced the subject.  
Is that correct? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now let us - let us look at the content of what 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 130 of 168 
 
he said in introducing the subject.  Are you able to remember whether 
he said I heard from so and so that you are blackmailing Mr  Hlongwane 
and gave whatever details and I reported this to Mr  Hlongwane and that 
is why we have this meeting.  So as to find out from you what you know 
about this.  Are you able to remember how he put it without ne cessarily 
looking for his exact words?  
MR HLONGWANE:  Chair, as I said earlier it took me sometime before I 
said he should convene the meeting.  I think his issue was here I am 
speaking highly of somebody and this is what he is picking up.  So it 
happened several times.  Then I said okay.  Convene this meeting.  We 
10 
will flash out the issues there.  I was very keen on knowing the source 
or sources.  I am keen up to now. 
I was hoping at some point or during this Commission 
somebody will come up with the story, because there was a rumour that 
mentioned all sort of games.  He indicated that this is a set up.  One 
holds in high esteem.  There is this thing happening in the marketplace 
and he thought it would be important to - to clear the matter.  So to the 
best of my recollection sir it was facts around the discussions around 
those facts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So from what you say it seems to me that 
20 
Mr Duduzane Zuma did not at that meeting say to Mr  Jonas and to you 
who the source of the rumour was.  Is that right?  
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes.  To the best of my recollection sir.  No.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:  And in my - in my case what was more important 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 131 of 168 
 
was to look the man in the face, because he is a friend.  Is this thing 
reasonably possible?  Could it be said and I was hoping the discussion 
will go further and get into the debate.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Do - do you remember or let me put this 
question.  It would seem from what you have said that even on the 
occasions when Mr Duduzane Zuma told you about these rumours or  
reports that he made to you before you asked him to convene a meeting 
with Mr Jonas.  It seems that he did not tell you the source even at that 
time.  Is that right?  Am I right?  
MR HLONGWANE:  That is correct sir. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ask him for the so urce?  Where do you take 
this from? 
MR HLONGWANE:  I duly asked sir, but the source was never divulged.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you asked him even before you asked him to 
convene a meeting when he made the reports.  You asked him for the 
source and he did not give you. 
MR HLONGWANE:  I asked and I was hoping that it would come out at 
that meeting, but no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and you said he made these reports more than 
once to you.  Before you asked him to convene a meeting with 
20 
Mr Jonas. 
MR HLONGWANE:  As far I - as I can remember.  Yes.  He raised the 
matter more than - more than once. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 132 of 168 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to give other details about this rumour 
or allegation of blackmailing that he told about or was it simply that  - 
that there are rumours that - I understand that there are rumours or 
there are rumours that Mr  Jonas is blackmailing you.  Are you able to 
remember other details about this blackmailing?  What was it about and 
so on or were you never given this information? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Chair, all I can remember is broadly the situation at 
the time.  (Indistinct) all manner of agendas, but I am not able to say 
any other details that I remember, but I was hoping with time those 
details were going to emerge. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So am - am I - is my understanding of the 
essence of what Mr Duduzane told you on two or so more occasions 
before you asked him to convene a meeting.  Is my understanding of 
the essence of what he said to you correct?  Namely that he said he - 
he had heard rumours that Mr  Jonas was blackmailing you.  Is my 
understanding of what he said to you correct?  
MR HLONGWANE:  That he had heard rumours?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I just want to make sure I understand clearly 
what report he made to you that made you sa y to him you must convene 
a meeting with Mr Jonas.  So I just want to - to go back.  How he put it. 
20 
MR HLONGWANE:  He put it over a period of time Chair and, because 
he was insistent upon it, because my view was - the view I had was 
different.  So I suspec t maybe out of a sense concern that I have got 
this particular view and there is something else going on.  So he raised 
it over a period of time.  That there is this particular thing.  So instead 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 133 of 168 
 
of being told be careful around whoever and whatever that ki nd of 
thing. 
I decided that let us get this thing clarified.  The tone was 
similar.  The theme was - was the same.  So you - you are correct sir.  
You are understanding that the tone and theme was similar about this 
particular matter, because I was also co nsistent in my views of the 
relationship.  So it clearly bothered me.  I said okay.  Let us deal with 
this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So my understanding is correct of what he reported to 
you in essence? 
10 
MR HLONGWANE:  In essence.  That is correct, sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and - but what he was blackmailing you about 
was also not told to you by Mr  Duduzane Zuma or was it? 
MR HLONGWANE:  What I was supposed to be blackmailing him about 
you mean sir? 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Indistinct). 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  It is the other way around 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I thought - I thought all along it was … 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 134 of 168 
 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  It is the other way around. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So - oh so he - so the report that was made to 
you … 
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By Mr Duduzane Zuma was that Mr Jonas was going 
around saying that you were blackmailing him? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is - that is the report? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but you were not given details in terms of the 
10 
source of - of the rumours and in terms of what you were alleged to be 
blackmailing him about.  Did - did Mr Duduzane Zuma give you those 
details prior to you asking him to convene the meeting?  
MR HLONGWANE:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He did not give you? 
MR HLONGWANE:  He did not.  I thought the meeting would - would 
deal with all those things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Yes 
and 
when 
the 
meeting 
took 
place 
20 
Mr Duduzane Zuma said nothing more in essence at the meeting in 
terms of what this was about than what he had already told you before?  
In other words he did not say anything new in terms of this blackmailing 
rumour or did he? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Look in essence that is what he said.  There might 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 135 of 168 
 
be - might have been other details around the rumour and what he …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:  What he said and so on, but I do not have 
recollection, but …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:  The main thrust of it was that I am alleged to be 
blackmailing …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:  The gentleman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So, but the point - the point that I am - I am 
10 
trying to establish is.  Although he might have mentioned some details 
that he might not have previously mentioned to you.  They did not go to 
the essence.  The essence remained the same.  Namely what he had 
told you before.  Is that correct?  
MR HLONGWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and did Mr Jonas in response to what Mr  Zuma 
said ask Mr Zuma where he got this information from that he was going 
around alleging that you were blackmailing him?  Do you remember 
whether he - he did or you do not remember? 
MR HLONGWANE:  I do not think there was such an engagement.  
20 
What I do remember is him saying he had no recollection of ever saying 
that to anyone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and once he had said that was Mr  Zuma able to 
take the discussion further asking him anything further in relation to 
this rumour or that was basically the end of the discussion of that 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 136 of 168 
 
rumour? 
MR HLONGWANE:  I do not recall Chair.  My - my entire focus was 
more on the response that I would get around - surrounded that issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:  My entire focus was that …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:  Because it was a … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:  It was a big one for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So as far as you are concerned.  It would be fair to 
10 
say Mr Zuma introduced the subject of the meeting - the purpose of the 
meeting that this - it was about this rumour and in essence he - he said 
nothing different from what he had told you previously.  He may have 
given some more details, but really in terms of essen ce it was the same 
thing that he had told you and Mr  Jonas said he had no recollection of 
ever having said anything along the lines that you were blackmailing 
him and the issue could not be taken further after that.  Would that be a 
fair summary of what ha ppened before the three of you might have 
started talking about other things?  
MR HLONGWANE:  That is a fair summary Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a fair summary. 
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Do you want to continue?  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes Chair.  Thank - thank you for that 
Chair.  Mr Hlongwane, in - in that meeting when you - when you asked - 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 137 of 168 
 
when Mr Duduzane asked details or - or introduced the issue.  How was 
Mr Jonas’ reaction?  Was he surprised or - or how did you read his 
reaction? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Well I am no expert, but it was a tense 
engagement. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Was he tense? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  And during the engagement were you able 
to say anything during the meeting?  Did you - did you raise anything 
with him personally? 
10 
MR HLONGWANE:  The issue that was being raised was of such a 
serious nature that and the manner in which it was raised, because 
here is somebody I consider a friend.  There is an issue of that nature.  
So it was important for me to re-establish that thing and he said he had 
no recollection. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Were you satisfied with that answer?  
MR HLONGWANE:  In this business ma’am no I was hoping at some 
point something would emerge as I still - still do hope something will 
come up on this matter, because it could not just have been plucked 
from the air. 
20 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  So you were not - you were not satisfied 
with the answer? 
MR HLONGWANE:  I am not. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Did you take it with him after the meeting?  
MR HLONGWANE:  With who - him? 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 138 of 168 
 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  With Jonas - Mr Jonas Mcebisi? 
MR HLONGWANE:  The source was the one that was there ma’am and 
there was nothing to take up after that.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  I - I want to pick up from the fact that you 
- you are friends.  You - you have just give us a background that you - 
you are friends and you have been friends for - for some time. 
MR HLONGWANE:  Huh-uh. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  So I would imagine that you - you will 
speak occasionally.  Do you visit each other’s house? 
MR HLONGWANE:  We used to a lot before the incident.  
10 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  You used to? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Rangata, at some stage you were very audible.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you raised your voice, but I think af ter I had 
commended you the voice went down.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you.  Thanks.  Sorry about that 
Chair.  Sorry about that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  I want to - to go slightly back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  If you keep it at that l evel. 
20 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you.  I want to go slightly back.  
Before the meeting of 23  October 2015.  Did you have any meeting 
prior to that?  Immediately prior to that just to be more - even more 
clear.  Beginning of October.  Around beginning of October with 
Mr Jonas. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 139 of 168 
 
MR HLONGWANE:  Chair, we had frequent interaction.  So to say 
immediately prior to that.  I cannot remember today, but we had 
frequent interactions.  We were friends.  Comrades.  Frequent 
interactions over a period of time.  It would  be twice a day.  Three 
times.  Frequent interactions. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Right.  Mr Jonas makes reference in his 
statement - I am sure you have read his statement.  To be more - more 
particular if you go to LL1A.  The - the other - that is the other s ub file 
paragraph 4.  He - he makes reference to a meeting that took place 
between yourself and him and - and in this case he mentioned 
10 
Mr Bongani More.  Are you familiar with that name?  
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes.  I am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  And - and what is your - what is your 
relationship with him? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Friends/comrades.  He is one of the gentlemen that 
came to the house regularly with frequent interactions.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Would you say that your friendship was 
more - the same as that of Jon as - Mr Jonas? 
MR HLONGWANE:  We are comrades.  Comrades are the same.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay.  So do - do you recall having such 
20 
kind of a meeting where he was present?  
MR HLONGWANE:  Like I said ma’am we had frequent interactions as 
comrades.  So there is nothing … 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  I am asking in particular beginning of 
October.  Prior to 23 October do you recall having a meeting of such 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 140 of 168 
 
nature where Mr Jonas and - and Mr More were - were in that meeting. 
MR HLONGWANE:  We have had frequent mee tings with Mr Jonas and 
Mr More ma’am.  So there is no particular meeting like you say.  I - I 
remember a particular meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  And do you recall having a meeting where 
you spoke about Mr Duduzane Zuma wanting to speak to Mr Jonas? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Mr Duduzane Zuma wanting to speak to Mr  Jonas it 
is a communication I had with Mr  Duduzane Zuma and Mr Jonas and the 
communicated numbers. 
10 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Do you recall that meeting where you had 
a meeting with Mr Jonas where Mr More was present and you - you 
spoke 
to 
Mr Jonas 
and 
advised 
him 
that 
Mr 
- 
I 
mean 
- 
Mr Duduzane Zuma would like to speak to Mr  Jonas. 
MR HLONGWANE:  No ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Do you recall that meeting?  
MR HLONGWANE:  No ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  You do not recall that meeting?  
MR HLONGWANE:  I recall that conversation between me and 
Duduzane about the names for Mr  Jonas and Jonas, me and him.  Not 
20 
with Mr More.  No.  I do not remember that.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Do you recall Mr Duduzane wanting to 
speak to Mr Jonas about inviting him to some awards?  
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  When was that? 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 141 of 168 
 
MR HLONGWANE:  I do not remember.  Sometime that year.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Sometime? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Sometime in that year. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  During the - just before the meeting of 
October, the 23 r d? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Just before when - no.  I do not remember that, but 
I recall a discussion about that and it was between me and Duduzane 
and me and Jonas and they - they asked for numbers and they duly 
exchanged the numbers.  So there was no Mr  More in that - in … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who - who exchanged numbers?  
10 
MR HLONGWANE:  Mr Jonas and Mr Zuma needed to exchange 
numbers.  I was the medium.  There was no Mr  More in that interaction 
of numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Was it just yourself and Mr Jonas only …  
MR HLONGWANE:  In that communication …  
CHAIRPERSON:  On that particular meeting?  
MR HLONGWANE:  In that communication it was telephonic Chair.  It 
was telephonic.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  So if - if you read the statement of Jonas 
20 
where he makes reference to a meeting that you had in October where 
you had spoken about the importance of the Guptas.  What would be 
your comment to that? 
MR HLONGWANE:  My comment would refer back to my earlier 
comments.  We had frequent interactions at different places with 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 142 of 168 
 
Mr Jonas.  We are friends and comrades and we covered a variety of 
topics.  So to pick out one and say such and such a thing happened 
would be I think asking too much, but I am happy to answer any 
question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From what you have said I think it is seems that prior 
to this meeting of the 23 r d as far as you were concerned your 
friendship/comradeship relationship with Mr  Jonas was normal …  
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you were interacting with him as and when the 
need arose.  There was no problems.  Is that correct?  
10 
MR HLONGWANE:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and with regard to Mr  Bongani More was that the 
same situation as well?  You w ere interacting with him as and when the 
need arises.  There were some interactions among the three of you, 
yourself, Mr Jonas and him, but others maybe not involving all three of 
you necessarily prior to that meeting.  
MR HLONGWANE:  That - that would be correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would be correct.  Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:  That would be correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So one can accept that when you had the report that 
20 
Mr Duduzane Zuma gave - gave to you or made to you about the 
rumours.  You would not ordinarily have had any problem with speaking 
to Mr Jonas or and even raising this as your friend to say I - I have 
heard something that I cannot believe here, but I hear that from 
Mr Duduzane Zuma that there are rumours that you are throwing around 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 143 of 168 
 
saying I am blackmailing you. 
That is not something that you would ordinarily have had a 
problem with doing.  Is that right, but you might have chosen for a 
reason that you gave not to raise it directly with him.  
MR HLONGWANE:  Chair, I think you are raising a valid point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HLONGWANE:  In the space that we are in when we get stuff like 
that you look deeper into what could be the motivation.  It is not just 
like in any ordinary relationship.  Why would this be coming up?  There 
is a number of permutation s.  Then the best option for me was indeed 
10 
as per agreement let us put Jonas here and you are here and you 
articulate the issue. 
So the fact of our friendship within that I could invest in.  It 
would have been a recurring decimal.  Who told you that?  So I  wanted 
that matter to have been closed at that point, but I could not be in 
Duduzane Zuma’s mind to be or force him to tell me, but he may well 
have sources that he may not have with to disclose at that point.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess the - the answer is you did not have any 
problem and you would not have any problem raising any issue with 
Mr Jonas at the time if you wanted to, but for this particular one.  You 
20 
thought it was best not to raise it directly with him, but rather to say 
Mr Zuma please convene a meeting where all three of us will be 
present.  Is that correct?  
MR HLONGWANE:  Sir … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 144 of 168 
 
MR HLONGWANE:  Chair that will be a fair reflection of my …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:  Of my state of mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Chair I am looking at the time and I see it is 1 
o’ clock.  Can I take direction from you?  
CHAIRPERSON:  I - subject to everybody being fine with it.  I am 
inclined to say let us try and see if we can finish with his evidence …  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I do not think we should take much longer …  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  After this. 
MR HLONGWANE:  We will have no problem Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will be fine with that.  Yes.  Is that fine with you 
Mr Hlongwane? 
MR HLONGWANE:  Absolutely fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   
MR HLONGWANE:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let - let us continue.  I think we should be able to 
finish before half past and - and then we - we can be done.  Then we 
20 
can take the lunch break and after lunch have the next witness.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank - thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA: 
 
I 
am 
- 
I 
am 
indebted 
to 
you.  
Mr Hlongwane I meant to take you to LL1A and I want to take you to in 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 145 of 168 
 
particular page 7.  It is a statement by Mr Jonas.  It will help if you go 
there, because you might want to refresh your memory.  I know you 
might have read - read the statement. 
MR HLONGWANE:  Yes ma’am. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  So - so maybe you might need to - as we - 
as we are talking you might need to. 
MR HLONGWANE:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if you tell her - tell him what it says …  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He might not need to - to look it up.  Ja. 
10 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Okay.  That is fine. 
MR HLONGWANE:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  There - there … 
MR HLONGWANE:  I am indebted. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  I am making particular reference to 
paragraphs 17 and 18 of Mr  Jonas’ statement.  This is his version and 
this is his evidence w hat he has told this Commission or the Chair.  
MR HLONGWANE:  Huh-uh. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  He says that on the date, on the 23 r d of 
October 2015 when you were at the Gupta residence it’s common cause 
20 
when you started with your meeting, when you sat and yo u started 
talking, somebody walked into the room, okay, he said that person 
walked in and he started talking.  Walked into the room, started talking 
while you – the three of you were sitting in that space.  He goes on, on 
paragraph 19 and 20, he says, 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 146 of 168 
 
“This person who walked in says, he started by saying, we 
know you and we know that Hlongwane is blackmailing you”,  
referring to Jonas, speaking to Mr Jonas and that they had intelligence 
on him.   
 
Do you recall such conversation taking place or even to star t, 
do you recall somebody walking into your meeting and uttering such 
statements? 
MR HLONGWANE:   Chair at a meeting in which I was present, no such 
happened. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   It did not happen? 
10 
MR HLONGWANE:   At the meeting at which I was present.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA :   You made reference earlier on that 
somebody walked into the room, into the meeting or people were 
walking in and out was there any other particular person who walked in 
and spoke, you might have heard what that person said, is ther e any 
particular person that walked in that space while you were talking?  
MR HLONGWANE:   Ma’am as I recall there were there of us in the 
room I was facing Mr Duduzane Zuma, my back to the door, Mr Jonas to 
the right, if I remember well.  So there would ha ve been a number of 
what you’d call interruptions, doors opening and closing.  
20 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:   Was the question, did anyone speak to Mr 
Duduzane? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:   Indeed as far as I can remember someb ody did 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 147 of 168 
 
peep in briefly but there were a number of doors opening a number of 
times, what they spoke about I do not know but I did think it was a 
member of the Gupta family that was my impression.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   You’ve said that to the Public Protector 
during your interview, maybe just to tap from that we’ve gone through 
the transcript of the interview which we have provided your lawyers 
with.  The interview recorded being asked particular if you are aware of 
the person that walked into that meeting , do you recall such question 
being posed to you by the Public Protector?  
MR HLONGWANE:   Yes I do. 
10 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   And do you recall what the response 
was? 
MR HLONGWANE:   Yes I do, broadly it was somebody did peep in 
briefly and I thought it was a member of the Gupta family. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Of interest, you might not be able to 
comment to that because it’s not you, Mr Duduzane Zuma, when he was 
giving evidence, he said it was Mr Rajesh, what would be your comment 
to that?  He says Mr Rajes h, during the meeting peeped in and came to 
approach him and spoke to him about arranging for a meeting for the 
following day, did you see that happening?  
20 
MR HLONGWANE:   My comment to that Chair, would be Mr Duduzane 
Zuma knows his business partners and these people very well over a 
long period of time, I’d only met only one of the brothers but only but 
once, so objectively speaking I’d have to defer to the version of Mr 
Zuma in terms of identification I would not fight a second world war 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 148 of 168 
 
about the identification issue, I’ll have to defer to Mr Zuma because if I 
also remember well some time ago I think there must have been 
another affidavit deposed to by the same person where they, 
themselves indicate that they peeped in.  So in the face of such I can 
only but accept diversion. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Thank you, which member of the Gupta 
family are you familiar with?  
MR HLONGWANE:   Then or now? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Then. 
MR HLONGWANE:   Familiarity, somebody I’ve spoken to, somebody 
10 
I’ve met I had only had lunch with one member of the Gupta family 
organised by Mr Duduzane Zuma at some place in the Northern 
Suburbs yes. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Yes and do you recall who that was?  
MR HLONGWANE:   Tony. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   That is Rajesh? 
MR HLONGWANE:   I think – otherwise referred to as Rajesh. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA :   Yes, yes I think they use the names 
interchangeably yes.  So you are familiar with Rajesh Gupta, Tony 
Gupta? 
20 
MR HLONGWANE:   At that time, it was a person I knew, familiar, no 
because I’d only met the person but once. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Would you recall if that would have been 
the same person that walked into the room?  
MR HLONGWANE:   Would I recall that it would have been the same 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 149 of 168 
 
person that walked into the room?  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:   Given that my back was to the door and my focus 
was on the discussion I would not lay my head on the line, but like I 
said I will have to defer to the version of Mr Duduzane Zuma who knew 
the people better and very well, I did not a t the time. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Thanks you – during the interview with 
the Public Protector you were asked specifically if it was Mr Rajesh and 
you made a clear – your answer was very clear to say it was not Mr 
Rajesh, so what will be your comment now that Mr Duduzane said that 
10 
it was him, will you still say that you might…[intervenes].  
MR HLONGWANE:   I think I may have answered that question Chair 
but I’ll repeat it for the sake of clarity.  My interviews with the Public 
Protector, I repeat that which  I said is that which I said indeed and I am 
saying in view of what Mr Zuma and the gentleman in question have 
testified to under oath, I’ll have to defer to their version they know 
each other better, that their identification had been correct on my part 
it certainly would then mean it was a misidentification.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said the meeting – you estimate that the meeting 
20 
may have taken about 30 minutes is that right?  
MR HLONGWANE:   Ja about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were estimating? 
MR HLONGWANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and at the end of the meeting did you and Mr 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 150 of 168 
 
Duduzane Zuma remain at the venue while Mr Jonas left, do you recall 
if that is what happened?  
MR HLONGWANE:  As far as I recall Chair we all went down the sta irs 
our cars were parked there, I think Mr Jonas went in a different car 
from the one he came in and we parted.  Whether Mr Duduzane 
remained or not I do not recall.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes okay well you have, I’m sure read Mr Jonas’ 
statement that gives his version and maybe you have even read the 
transcript of his evidence is that correct?  
MR HLONGWANE:   That’s correct sir. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you know what he has told the Commission?  
MR HLONGWANE:   Broadly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Broadly, yes, yes and you know what he says 
happened at the meeting which is different from what you say happened 
in terms of him having been offered by a member of the Gupta family 
the position of Minister of Finance and…[intervenes].  
MR HLONGWANE:   The R600million story Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And being offered a lot of money and that the 
member of the Gupta family told him, if I recall correctly that Mr 
Nhlanhla Nene was Minister of Finance at the time was either going to 
20 
be dismissed or was not going to be Minister of Finance in due c ourse 
or something to that effect do you remember that part of his evidence?  
MR HLONGWANE:   Yes Chair, if I may comment, are you inviting me to 
comment Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, I just want to know whether that’s your – you 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 151 of 168 
 
remember those features of Mr Jonas’ evidence or not. 
MR HLONGWANE:   Yes Chair…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to make sure that we don’t have to ask 
you things that you remember about what Mr Jonas said.  
MR HLONGWANE:   Yes Chair, as – if I may Chair I was not in business  
with the Gupta’s at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:   At any point ever. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:   They were not particularly familiar to me, my point 
10 
of contact was Duduzane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:   I hold no brief for the Gupta’s or anybody else for 
that matter and when I said, if whatever offers were made at the 
meeting in which I was present, no such offer was made.  Maybe if one 
can extrapolate one would have to be in business with them for them to 
make whatever offers of that nature in my presence.  I was not in 
business then I’m not in business now, we never were in business, 
actually Chair if I may say, I’m peripheral to this matter.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR HLONGWANE:   Really peripheral I happened to – there was a 
particular issue that the young man had conversed with me, I needed it 
resolved and it so happened that the meeting took place at the place 
which happens to be controversial for whatever reasons but my issue 
really here was that particular point and as I in dicated now that we’re 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 152 of 168 
 
quoting PP’s things I’ve had a relationship with Jonas we met at my 
place, many other times.  So I have no association nor – and that’s why 
I look dimly upon any attempt to try and throw me into whatever 
narrative of State Capture, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, no the idea was just to make sure that 
you recall at least certain features of Mr Jonas’ evidence.  You might 
disagree and say, at the meeting that you had with him and Mr Zuma, 
no such things happened but you un derstand that, that is his evidence.  
MR HLONGWANE:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You understand that ja. 
10 
MR HLONGWANE:   I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now he says – he said in his evidence, and I think in 
his statement that after he had left the meeting wh ich, if I recall was in 
the afternoon I think maybe after two I’m not sure, he called Minister 
Pravin Gordhan because he felt he wanted to talk to some of the people 
that were close to him or that he had confidence in to tell them what 
had happened to him because it was something that he, I think found 
unacceptable, was unexpected that he should be told the information 
that he was told at this meeting by the Gupta family member that he 
talked about.   
20 
 
He says he called Mr Pravin Gordhan and said he would l ike to 
see him and they arranged that they would meet on Sunday, the 23 r d of 
October was a Friday as I understand the position.  They agreed to 
meet on Sunday, he also called Minister Nene who he says was on his 
way to KZN at the time for the weekend and t hey arranged to meet on 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 153 of 168 
 
Sunday and indeed he says on Sunday he met with them separately 
Minister Pravin Gordhan – no, no he met only Minister Pravin Gordhan 
on Sunday at his official residence in Pretoria with regard to Minister 
Nene they arranged on Sunda y that they would meet on Monday and Mr 
Pravin Gordhan has given evidence that indeed they met and he told 
him something, I think to the effect that he had been made an offer or 
something illegal had been offered to him by the Gupta’s and he had a 
meeting on Monday morning with Minister Nhlanhla Nene and he told 
him what had happened.   
 
Both these ministers have confirmed in evidence before the 
10 
Commission that he told them that at that meeting he was made the 
offer that he has told the Commission about but he also says when he 
arrived in Port Elizabeth, because he was catching  a flight I think, to 
the Eastern Cape, he says he called you and you might have called 
each other during that evening but he says one of the things he said to 
you, I guess in one of the calls was he says, he expressed his disgust 
at what you had done as far as he was concerned that you shouldn’t 
have done this to him and you shouldn’t do it to anybody and as I 
understand his evidence he was talking about, he saw you as having 
played a role in him being taken to the Gupta residence maybe, and I 
20 
say maybe because I don’t want to put words into his mouth, maybe 
more than that, I don’t know but he did say both you and Mr Duduzane 
Zuma, during the meeting on his version were quiet didn’t sa y much 
really.   
 
The person who was talking was the Gupta family member.  So 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 154 of 168 
 
I’ve looked at your affidavit and you didn’t say anything about any calls 
that he may have made to you that evening so I don’t know whether you 
are able to say anything, whether you remember that the two of you did 
speak in the evening and whether he did say anything along the lines 
that he says he said? 
MR HLONGWANE:   Chair, if I may just take us back for a couple of 
seconds, this [indistinct] as I indicated in some of my affida vits, we 
have come up from the Eastern Cape long before he became a Minister 
we tried to put – we put together teams we were pursuing opportunities 
together so pursuing opportunities necessitates whatever it says 
10 
because he had no certainty that he was goi ng to go back to 
Government, we had many such frequent interactions so that’s number 
one, about taking anybody anywhere.   
 
Number two, a communication that I remember with Jonas is 
that I trust too easily, I think subsequent to that meeting, I trust peopl e 
too easily and in my mind that was reference to the fact that somebody 
had indicated that he was making these serious allegations against me.  
So Chair, again by way of context when I said frequent engagements, 
even in my evidence to the Public Protector  I actually indicated that 
they can use this new technology to check whether what I’m saying 
20 
makes sense or not, that we were frequently at my house, my family’s 
family knows each other our teams work together.   
 
A small detail, even on the day he was called to be appointed 
as the Deputy Minister, Chair, he left from my house.  So this particular 
relationship that existed in a particular context and I will not cast 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 155 of 168 
 
aspersions on him or anybody else for that matter I hold no brief for 
Gupta’s or any other person but that’s the relationship as it was then.  
What then happened in the intervening period, I do not know but I 
volunteered to go to the Public Protector, I was subpoenaed here but 
I’m here and I therefore say that which I remember being said was, you  
trust people too easily and yes Chair I’m aware of the version that he 
gave.  I would not say to you what is excluded what’s not included but 
at the meeting which I attended Chair with Duduzane Zuma and the 
gentleman no such things – offers were made.   
 
I’ve had all other manner of things in his statements that I’m 
10 
not familiar with.  It’s unfortunate that whatever it is that was 
[indistinct] to go this direction but not such things, it could have been 
handled better, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I understand that I think from what you say you may 
be feeling constrained to go beyond a certain point because of the 
relationship and friendship that you have had for a long time with him.  
I just want to make two points and you can comment on them.   
 
When he says coming out of the meeting I was in a certain 
state of mind because of what I’d gone through, what had been – what 
had happened at the meeting and I phoned Minister Pravin Gordhan 
20 
and Minister Nene and he actually did meet with them and they 
confirmed that he met with them, it does seem, and I’m not putting it 
higher than that, it does seem like somebody who was quite concerned 
about something, what it may be might be the question of whether it’s 
what he said or something else but it seems that there was something 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 156 of 168 
 
that he was concerned about and then when he says, when I arrived in 
Port Elizabeth I phoned Mr Hlongwane and I expressed my disgust at 
his role in this whole thing.   
 
 
It does seem to be consistent with somebody who left the 
meeting very unhappy whereas Mr Duduzane Zuma when he gave his 
evidence here, he said the meeting ended, you know very – he said it 
was fine there was, it was normal I don’t know if he said positive but he 
said –I think it was normal and so – which is not consistent with  
somebody then phoning and talking about being disgusted and so on.  
So I mention this so that you can comment – offer your comment if 
10 
you’d like to but also I want to say for me there is something a little 
strange about the fact that a whole meeting is co nvened, and I just 
want you to give me your perspective, you know, a whole meeting is 
convened in circumstances where there is hardly any detail about this 
rumour that Mr Duduzane Zuma tells you about, you know so it doesn’t 
give any source there is no detail and of course the moment Mr Jonas 
says at the meeting, on your version and the version of Mr Duduzane 
Zuma says I’ve no recollection of making such allegations that’s about 
the end but you might be able to give me your comments which deal 
with that.   
20 
 
So I’m just giving you a chance to deal with these aspects.  
MR HLONGWANE:   Yes Chair indeed, I myself found a number of 
things strange, number one, the disgust that you talk about the 
surprise, the shock I’m not aware of, number two it was some 
time…[intervenes]. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 157 of 168 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry before you proceed, when you say you are 
not aware of, do you mean you are not aware of that, that’s what Mr 
Jonas says in his statement or evidence or you’re saying you’re aware 
of that but you don’t know what he’s talki ng about? 
MR HLONGWANE:   Okay at the time Chair the expressions of disgust 
and the shock and all these related things I did not see evidence of 
that at the time, I’d sought for the meeting to be at a private place so 
that when these matters are dealt with  there’s no witnesses or that kind 
of thing.   
 
Chair some of my comments would be, since that meeting took 
10 
place I also heard rumours months after, months after that there seems 
to be things that Mr Jonas is saying, months later.  Again it bothered 
me, again rumours, now nothing was said to me, not disgust nothing, 
months after there seems to be these rumours and ultimately at some 
point, now these rumours finally emerged as I’m hoping the other ones 
would also emerge, I think time may prove me right Chair .   
 
So that emerged and when that emerged I saw that there was 
an engagement by the ANC with Mr Jonas getting his view, what is 
strange to me is there was no such engagement with myself as I 
thought would have been the correct thing to do.   
20 
 
If he’s consulting his ANC comrades and there’s this disgust 
surely these comrades must also convene me to say, comrade what is 
this thing that is happening?  That did not happen, maybe things took 
long time to brew in his head before he expressed his disgust but it w as 
strange to me. I went to the Public Protector to kind of understand 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 158 of 168 
 
what’s actually going on, what’s the agenda here. I’m still confused to 
this point because it’s something illegal that’s supposed to have 
happened it was alleged to have been at that me eting, I know myself 
not to have been at that meeting.  Things of that nature, just my 
comment Chair, would be in any serious position is something you take 
to the relevant authorities, so that the relevant authorities pursue this 
matter.  Going to all man ner of social stops addressing this matter may 
be not particularly useful, that’s what brings me here because that 
matter could have been addressed at the time.  
 
 
So Chair I have sympathy indeed from where you are as a 
10 
Chair of this Commission with your pe rspective of somebody says 
there’s a rumour, they don’t go into the detail well slightly different with 
respect sir, the logic is slightly different that’s why I did not raise the 
matter with Jonas, that’s why somebody said but you’re friend, you 
could raise it, that’s not how it works.   
 
I needed to establish in a particular way, I believe some point 
this thing will come out but from where you sit I can understand that 
and especially if somebody says they went to this Minister and that 
Minister, those are big names Ministers in society sir because if I had 
to tell you I went to Joe and Sipho they would sound like small names.  
20 
So because he went to this Minister and that Minister so it would be, oh 
why would this guy do that.   
 
Chair I – your wisdom will perhaps help here because in this 
same Commission many fanciful things were said also being Chairman 
of this, Chairman of that I did not seek to contest that when I thought 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 159 of 168 
 
the issues were canvassed and just to answer the question that the 
wonderful counsel may have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:   Chair coming here is not the cheapest thing you 
guys are paid for by the State it’s not the cheapest thing…[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Hlongwane they get paid quite – not the Chair. 
MR HLONGWANE:   I’ll accept that so I’ve written affidavits to you 
making all manner of applications but on following the Commission, 
some of the issues I wanted to canvass were canvassed.  I opted, one 
not my battle to fight, two, it’s above my pay grade, three, financial 
10 
constraints. In this case because the good lady decided to subpoena 
me I had no choice the attorney also negotiated with the guys, I 
volunteered because I really am peripheral to this thing.   
 
So I will not create a big issue out of the fact that, for my 
purpose is that, all manner of fanciful stories were told about me but 
it’s for you to establish why that would be the case. Somebody can say, 
but why didn’t you want to come and cross -examine a particular person, 
the point is made, because I think those issue s were canvassed.  I 
equally did not come to cross-examine Mr Jonas because it’s not my 
battle to fight, it’s bigger issues – I’m peripheral to this thing. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:   And then there’s really financial constraints.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR HLONGWANE:   And thank you for understanding my earlier 
personal circumstance I could not come to the Commission but I’m 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 160 of 168 
 
happy to be here now. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   No, we sympathise with that. 
MR HLONGWANE:   Excuse me? 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   I am saying the Commission is 
sympathising for the circumstances that you went through.  
MR HLONGWANE:   Thank you very much, I am indebted.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Rangata I don’t know how much else you 
need but my feeling is that a lot has been covered here. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA :   I think the Chair has actually covered all 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  From my side I don’t remember any particular issue I 
still have that I want him to clarify.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA :   Yes, yes, I don’t want to ask Mr 
Hlongwane a question, I just want to – you don’t have to comment but 
from what you have engaged, and I really – I sympathise because this 
is as the Chair has already alluded, what really puzzles me you know 
you’re feeling pity for us you know putting the puzzle together, what 
puzzles me still is after the meeting on the 23 r d of October 2015 almost 
two months after what was spoken about or what was alleged to have 
20 
been it actually happened on the 9 t h of December 2015 and one ask 
oneself whether it was a coincidence or not, you might not be able to 
comment to that but it is just an observation you know trying to 
understand what actually happened.  
MR HLONGWANE:   Please counsel, the point through you Chair.   
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 161 of 168 
 
Read me the point. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   I am saying you might not be able to 
comment to it but it is just an observation of what transpired almost two 
months after the meeting of what has been alleged to have taken place 
indeed took place about two months ago, you might not be able to 
answer that question unless you think you want to answer to it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think what counsel is saying is one of the 
things that Mr Jonas said he was told by the Gupta family member at 
that meeting that he says you attended was that Mr Nene was g oing to 
go as Minister of Finance, I can’t remember the actual words used but 
10 
in effect that he was going to go or he was going to be dismissed or 
fired and she is simply saying you might not be able to say anything but 
what is interesting she is saying is  that indeed on the 9 t h of December 
2015 Mr Nene was dismissed. 
MR HLONGWANE:   Chair I understand the point that you don’t expect 
me to comment as it would be speculation indeed, what also puzzles 
me counsel is that when that event of December 9 t h happened Mr Jonas 
was not removed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but remember he had not been told that he would 
be removed according to his version.  
20 
MR HLONGWANE:   But according to the same version he had been 
told that he would be promoted, I am just deliberately with ho lding on 
saying he was not promoted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think the – but I think on his evidence he would 
be promoted if he accepted the offer that was given to him on his 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 162 of 168 
 
evidence and he says he didn’t accept the offer from the Gupta family 
member. 
MR HLONGWANE:   Well for me there is a number of puzzles here but 
if there was intensity in all these things that were supposed to have 
happened surely he could not have remained in that position, but that 
is for you wiser people to determine.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HLONGWANE:   Because it is one thing to say something that was 
spoken about happened, I don’t want to talk about the prediction of rain 
but if I see it is going to rain it rains then must call it a big puzzle, the 
10 
bigger puzzle for me is even did that w hich is claimed to have 
happened happened because of that I think I have heard here Mr Zuma 
Senior indicating that he did not ...[indistinct] the one that made the 
appointments, that was his evidence under oath.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:   So I speculate on why certain things happened at a 
particular time, the best position to say that,  but for me as an ordinary 
person if that is indeed the case how does this one remain in position.  
I think it is a puzzle too, because there is supposed to  have been this 
facility. 
20 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Thank you. 
MR HLONGWANE:   He has to have gone too Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, well I have told you what I think about that, you 
are entitled to have it remain as a question in your mind.   The one part 
which I want to clarify is did you say earlier on that since that meeting 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 163 of 168 
 
your friendship or relationship with Mr Jonas is no longer the same or 
did you say it has continued in the same way?  
MR HLONGWANE:   Chair I have not had any meetings with Mr Jonas 
since that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry just repeat sir. 
MR HLONGWANE:   I have not had any meetings with Jonas since that 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:   I did see him at that – in ...[indistinct]  hotel, he 
said hi, I responded back. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:   Sometime this year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HLONGWANE:   I still operate on the basis of these things will 
unravel themselves there, they are above my pay grade, I still insist.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it would seem that it would be fair comment 
therefore to say since that if you haven’t met him since then other than 
maybe on the occasion where you say he just said hi and you said hi, it 
would seem that things in terms of your friendship and your relationship 
are certainly no longer the same becaus e you said that prior to this 
20 
meeting you were interacting with him very frequently, is that right?  
MR HLONGWANE:   That would be correct sir, maybe I am less 
required because at the time he was not established.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no that’s fine. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Thank you Chair, that will be the end of 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 164 of 168 
 
my questioning for this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  I have no further questions, I am ready to 
excuse – you have no questions, ja. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Thank you very much Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you very much Mr Hlongwane for coming 
and you are excused, it is unlikely that we will ask you to come back 
but if a need arises we will ask you.   Thank you very much.  
MR HLONGWANE:   Yebo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are going to take the lunch ad journment now, it is 
twenty five to two, we are going to resume at twenty five to three for 
10 
the next witness.   
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Rangata. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Good afternoon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes good afternoon everybody. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you Chair.  Chair we have planned 
20 
for the second witness who is Ms Moroadi Cholota.  The legal team is – 
was ready to – to lead her evidence.  Unfortunately we do not have her 
statement.  At this stage Ms Makhapela would like to address the Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us do that then the – she can also place on 
record that they represent the witness.  
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 165 of 168 
 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja thank you. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Yes thank you. 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:  Good afternoon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good afternoon. 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:    My name is Luisa Makapela. I am a member 
of the Johannesburg Society of Advocates and the P an African Bar 
Association of South Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:  I am the legal representative for Ms 
10 
Nomalanga Moroadi Cholota and our instructing attorneys is Victor 
Nkhwashu Attorneys Incorporated.  Chair we just have an issue with th e 
statement and the reasoning why it was not – or the reason behind – I 
beg yours – the reason behind why it was not filed and it is due to the 
fact that Ms Cholota received the summons with the 3.3 Notice attached 
but it appeared that the 3.3 Notice was d ated 1 August 2019 and she 
had not received that 3.3 Notice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:  And so we seek the Chair’s indulgence to file 
the written statement to accord with her version of events and present 
20 
the witness with the witness statement rather that the sworn affidavit at 
that – at a time that will be determined by the Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm.  Yes I am aware that there is no statement 
from her and I was concerned about that as well.  But I had been 
informed that there were challenges  of her – on regard to her 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 166 of 168 
 
availability because she was not within the country for a certain period 
of time.  So it would be convenient if before she gives her evidence we 
could have her statement that deals with all the matters and issues that 
she should deal with. 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I think that it would be fine. I understand that 
there is no problem from the commission’s legal team as well that we 
adjourn the hearing to enable you to complete her statement that I 
understand has already been started.  But have it finalised and have it 
typed and give it to the commission’s legal team. I think it will help if 
10 
before you finalise it you have a discussion with Ms Rangata to make 
sure that you are on the same page with regard to what iss ues the 
statement should cover.  So that when you give it to them there is no 
complaint that maybe it does not cover certain issues that they regard 
as important.  So – so the – from my side we could adjourn to 
tomorrow.  We could adjourn to Friday.  I und erstand that tomorrow 
might be a – might be difficult for Ms Cholota.  
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:  Yes that is correct Chair.  Mr Cholota is not 
available for tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:  However she has indicated availability for 
Friday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For Friday. 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:  And we are also available for Friday.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Then no thanks let me hear what Ms 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 167 of 168 
 
Rangata has to say but otherwise it seems to me that we can 
accommodate you on that – in that regard.   
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you Chair.  We are indebted and we 
are in agreement that there is a need for the witness to pen down the 
statement and I think I – also it is proper for the legal team to register 
that efforts have been made and actually there have been some 
consultations from the investigative team with the witness and where 
attempts have been made for draft statements that have been – have 
10 
been submitted for her to consider.  And those efforts have  not been 
successful and that is the reason why we find ourselves here today 
having to sit here without her statement.  But that being said we – 
because we would want to deal with the evidence of this witness so we 
are agreeable to reconvene again on Frida y.  Obviously on the 
admission of the direction from the Chair.  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  Ms Cholota you will follow the 
discussion? 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS CHOLOTA:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. Okay we will  therefore adjourn the 
hearing of your evidence to Friday at I think let us make it half past 
nine to Friday at half past nine. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you Chair. 
04 DECEMBER 2019 – DAY 196 
 
Page 168 of 168 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Friday this week at half past nine.  
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By which time then I will hear Ms Cholota’s evidence.  
But the preparation of the statement as I understand will continue 
immediately after this adjournment and – and I would like to receive a 
copy as soon as the legal team has got one and has looked at it to see 
if it is – covers all the areas. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so – but the two teams can be in contact and in 
discussion to make sure that as soon as it is ready it can be given to 
10 
the commission’s legal team. 
ADV BAITSENG RANGATA:   Thank you Chair. 
ADV LUISA MAKAPELA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we adjourn the proceedings then until Friday this 
week at half past nine.  We adjourn.  
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO DECEMBER 2019
