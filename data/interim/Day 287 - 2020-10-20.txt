PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 20 OCTOBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON: 
  
Good 
morning 
Mr 
Myburgh, 
good 
morning everybody. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Mr Chairperson with your leave we 
would like now to switch to the evidence of – or dealing 
with the Manganese Expansion Project and Hatch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  My colleague Ms Segeels-Ncube will 
10 
deal with the first witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no that is fine. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  Thank you.  Why is the air 
conditioner making such a lot of noise today?  Thank you.  
Mr Myburgh you do not have to stand up where you are I 
just mention this for record.  You know yesterday at some 
stage in the afternoon when we looked at the minutes of 
the meeting of the 11 t h April 2011 I do not think it was the 
board I think it was one of the committees I mentioned that 
there was something I wanted to raise later but I forgot 
20 
about it.  I am just mentioning it so that one can pick it up 
next time.  The minutes that we were looking at reflects 
that Mr Gama was acting Group CEO at the time.  It means 
within two weeks of him going back to Transnet he – he 
came acting Group CEO but I think it was temporary 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 4 of 222 
 
because it appears that Mr Brian Molefe was outside the 
country.  But there may be some significance in that fact.  
So I just mention that.  Okay alright. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Chair as Mr Myburgh indicated 
today we will be dealing with the evidence of Transnet’s 
Manganese Expansion Project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  And events that occurred during 
10 
2013 and 2014 during the procurement process of service 
providers at the time for the project.  Now just for the 
benefit of the public Chair the Transnet 
Manganese 
Expansion Project was a project to increase Transnet’s 
capacity on the ex-manganese line – rail line from what it 
was 5.5 million tons per annum to what would effectively at 
the end of the project be 16 million tons per annum. 
 
In 2008 Transnet and the Manganese Ore Mining 
Industry identified the need to increase the capacity 
because there was anticipated increase in demand for 
20 
manganese at the time. 
 
The plan was to upgrade the rail network between 
the Northern Cape and the Eastern Cape at the time and 
this would include a new bulk terminal in the Eastern Cape. 
 
The project was to include the rail and the port 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 5 of 222 
 
component with a projected cost of R25 billion at the time.  
Mr Henk Bester which is the first witness that we calling 
today was at the time the Project Director of Hatch Goba 
which was one of the service providers that was awarded 
one of the contracts – actually two contracts in phase 1 
and phase 2. 
 
Now the evidence that we will be leading will centre 
around what happened with the – during the procurement 
process and the pressure that was placed on Hatch at the 
time 
to 
incorporate 
some 
of 
the 
services 
providers 
10 
identified by Transnet to be its service – preferred service 
providers. 
 
If – with the leave of the Chair may I then call Mr 
Henk Bester to take the affirmation or oath Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you.  Please administer the 
oath or affirmation.  Please stand up and 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Ja remove your mask. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Put on your microphone – put on your 
microphone.  If you are going to be audible with the mask 
on that is fine but if you are not audible we will tell you.  
20 
Okay alright. 
MR BESTER:  Ja I will take it off ja. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR BESTER:  Thank you. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 6 of 222 
 
REGISTRAR:  Please place your full names on record. 
MR BESTER:  Hendrik Jacobus Bester. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR BESTER:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR BESTER:  No I do not. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
10 
MR BESTER:  Yes I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help 
me God. 
MR BESTER:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Bester you may be seated. 
Yes you may proceed. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Chair we will be going through 
Bundle – working through Bundle 4[a] and 4[b] today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Bundle 4[a] contains Mr Bester ’s 
statement and that can be found Chair in the second folder 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 7 of 222 
 
marked BB19. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Commencing on page 24 of the 
white – the black numbers Mr Bester.  And can you go to 
page 24? 
MR BESTER:  Ja. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  And may I ask you to also go to 
page – if you could also go to page 130.  You can keep 
page – yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have – have you advised Mr Bester 
10 
that you will be looking at the black numbers. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Yes I have Chair I have just told 
him now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because [inaudible] page okay. 
MR BESTER:  Did you say page 130? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Yes so page – we will start on 
page 24 and page 130.  I just want you to identify that the 
statement is in fact your statement.  It is the black 
numbers.  So you will see that the numbers say Transnet 
04, 025. 
20 
MR BESTER:  04, 025 ja. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  We are just looking at the last 
number which says 25 – so page 24.  Do you have that? 
MR BESTER:  Ja. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  And page 130 of the black 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 8 of 222 
 
numbers.  The last page of your statement is page 130. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On mine that the last page of his 
statement seems to be page 52.  Have I got something 
wrong? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  It seems so Chair.  We – I am 
looking at – yes page 52 is the end of the – of the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The bundle that I have is Transnet 
Bundle 04[a]. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a bundle that starts with Mr 
10 
Mkwanazi’s affidavit. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Bester ’s affidavit or statement 
seems – starts at page 24. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But on mine it seems to go only up to 
page 52. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Correct Chair.  I am referring to 
inclusive of the annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
20 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  I just want to orientate Mr Bester 
as to what we will be dealing with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Hm. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Mr Bester do you have 130?  Do 
you have page 130? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 9 of 222 
 
MR BESTER:  130. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Yes.  It will still be under the 
same folder.  So if you going to a new blue folder then you 
have gone too far.  Go on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  130 is blank on mine. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  It is a blank yes – it is a blank 
page. 
MR BESTER:  Blank? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Yes correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the last page is 129. 
10 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Page 129. 
MR BESTER:  Ja. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Do you confirm that this is your 
statement that you provided to the commission? 
MR BESTER:  Yes I confirm it is my statement yes. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  And then on page 52 do you 
confirm that that is your signature?  Page 52. 
MR BESTER:  Yes I confirm that is my signature. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Chair with your leave may Mr 
Bester ’s statement with annexures be admitted as Exhibit 
20 
BB19. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Just for the sake of completeness.  
You confirm that the contents of the statement are true and 
correct? 
MR BESTER:  Yes. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 10 of 222 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the best of your knowledge and 
belief? 
MR BESTER:  That I confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do okay.  You would like to admit – 
you would like me to admit this statement as Exhibit? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  BB19 Chair – BB19. 
CHAIRPERSON:  BB19? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  I do not want to  
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Delay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not want to not pronounce your 
surname correctly – incorrectly. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it pronounced Segeels-Ncube? 
ADV 
SEGEELS-NCUBE: 
 
It 
is 
Segeels-Ncube 
Chair.  
Segeels. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Segeels. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Segeels-Ncube. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  I think the Ncube part is the easy 
20 
part. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
I 
am 
very 
sensitive 
about 
not 
pronouncing people’s names correctly because I do not like 
mine not to be pronounced.  So – but if I were to try and 
write it as I would pronounce it I would say S? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 11 of 222 
 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  S-e-e 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  G 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  E-e- 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  L-s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in terms of – are the e’s pronounced 
as like a are 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  See – so it – the first ee’s would 
10 
be see as in see – so Segeels.  So you could say it is 
Segeels. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Segeels. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  So after the G you could spell it 
as a girl and you would get it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I mispronounce it please forgive me we 
will – by the time we finish I hope I will be able to 
pronounce it correctly. 
20 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Ncube is also just fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The statement by Mr Henk Bester which 
starts at page 24 is admitted and will marked as Exhibit – 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 12 of 222 
 
is it BB18? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  BB18 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  BB19.  Okay. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Chair at some point I will also be 
referring Mr Bester to the statements of Ms Deirdre 
Strydom who is a Transnet employee as well as Mr Gerhard 
Bierman who is a former Transnet employee and the former 
CFO of Transnet Capital Projects.   
10 
 
I am not sure if Chair would want me to identify 
those statements now for the record but not have them 
admitted as yet since the witnesses have not yet given 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us see when you need to refer to 
refer to them. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay.  Mr Bester can we start on 
page 24 of the bundle which is the start of your statement 
20 
and I would like to begin with how you came to be the 
Project Director of Hatch Goba and what it is that Hatch 
Goba does as you deal with in paragraph – from paragraph 
5 of your statement to page 25? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know whether your voice is on 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 13 of 222 
 
the soft side. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might wish to raise it just a little bit. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Project it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Thank you Chair.  If you could 
just take us through how it came to be that you became the 
Project Director of Hatch Goba and what it is that Hatch 
10 
Goba does 
MR BESTER:  Ja.  Okay so I started my career Chair in 
1990 with Transnet as I had a bursary with them.  I worked 
there for about eight years and then I joined a private 
consulting firm called RMH Ryberg [?] Consultants where I 
became the Managing Director.  And over that next ten 
years you know we worked a lot for Transnet projects that 
we tendered for and were successful for a lot of studies 
that we have done. 
 
And it was also during that time that we got 
20 
involved as they call it the Manganese Line is basically the 
line from the Northern Cape to the Port of Port Elizabeth. 
 
We did a lot of studies for Transnet but also for the 
private sector looking at options to expand the line, 
increase the capacity both for the infrastructure and the 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 14 of 222 
 
rolling stock as we call it wagons and locomotives.  
 
And in 2008 I joined a global company called Hatch 
and South Africa name as Hatch Goba at the time where I 
became the Global Lead for Rail.  Not only looking after 
South Africa but also countries like Australia and South 
America. 
 
And it was during this time that we became very 
much involved with the manganese line as I call it.  We did 
earlier studies to look – looking at options of expanding 
the capacity of the Port of Port Elizabeth where we looked 
10 
at different Ports like Saldanha, Durban, Richards Bay and 
also other Ports on the West Coast of South Africa. 
 
And it was during that time that Transnet announced 
that they are going to expand the manganese line to 16 
million tons and they will doing a project called the 16 
Million Tons Expansion Study – Manganese Expansion 
Project and that is where I became the Project Director for 
the Manganese Expansion Project. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay now at paragraph 14 of your 
statement on page 
27 
you 
deal with the 
how TFR 
20 
approached Hatch.  Can you just explain to us what exactly 
was the Manganese Expansion Project and why was it 
necessary to expand the rail line? 
MR BESTER:  Ja.  Just in a bigger context if you 
understand the manganese industry in the world South 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 15 of 222 
 
Africa probably sits with about 80% of the world’s reserves.  
But we only exporting at that time about 6 to 8 million tons 
of manganese which was less than 20% of the world 
demand. 
 
So also understanding that South Africa has got 
some of the best grade manganese in the world so it was 
well sought after.   
 
So there was a big need for Transnet to expand the 
capacity of the railway lines because if you understand the 
manganese exporting system most of the mines are located 
10 
in the Northern Cape which is about a 1000 kilometres from 
the coast.   
 
So these manganese are transported by Transnet 
over the railway line from the mines in the Northern Cape 
to the Port of Port Elizabeth.   
 
It was also at that time that Transnet announced 
that they will relocate from the Port of Port Elizabeth to the 
Port of Coega because they wanted to make Port Elizabeth 
a clean Port and Coega was earmarked for bulk minerals 
like manganese. 
20 
 
So at that time we were busy with another study for 
Transnet looking at the immediate options to expand the 
manganese line and specifically at the time if I can recall 
there was a study called the 5.5 Million Tons Manganese 
Export Study which I was the Project Director for where we 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 16 of 222 
 
looked at the as we call it the immediate bottlenecks. 
 
It was bottlenecks that we could identify in the very 
short term that could be expanded to sort of open up the 
industry for the manganese.  And that culminated in a 
project called the 5.5 Million Tons Manganese Export Study 
and project later years.   
And then after that Transnet announced that they 
want to go for the big export expansion project called the 
16 Million Tons Manganese Study or Project and that is 
where this whole study came about to do a feasibility about 
10 
doing this project, understanding what the tariffs would be, 
understanding in Transnet’s case if the business case 
made sense in terms of the hurdle rates that they have 
identified at the time.  And then actually going for the 
execution of that study. 
 
So that is where we became involved with the 
bigger 16 Million Tons Manganese Expansion Project. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay and then in also still on 
page 27 at paragraph 15 you deal with the fact that phase 
1 and phase 2 – there was a phase 1 and phase 2 for the 
20 
Manganese Expansion Project and that phase 1 was a 
confinement.  Can you explain what that means? 
MR BESTER:  Yes.  So getting the feasibility of the 
Manganese Expansion Study part of the study is to identify 
and do a detailed cost estimate of what such a project 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 17 of 222 
 
would cost for Transnet.   
 
So if I recall at the time we estimated the project to 
be in the region of about R27 billion and understanding 
Transnet cash flow and balance sheet at the time and the 
ability to fund the project Transnet decided at the time to 
split the project into a phase 1 and phase 2 for cash flow 
reasons and also budget constraints reasons.   
But of course another reason was to see what they 
do as a short-term immediate spending to open up the – 
the corridor for the Expansion of the manganese.  And for 
10 
that reason they decided to split the project into a phase 1 
which could be considered as short-term project and the 
phase 2 which was a much longer term project happen 
after phase 1. 
ADV 
SEGEELS-NCUBE: 
 
And 
why 
was 
phase 
1 
a 
confinement as opposed to an open tender? 
MR BESTER:  So considering the fact that Hatch was doing 
the feasibility study at the time Transnet also identified 
that to go out onto the open market for a tendering process 
will consume a lot of time.   
20 
And also considering the time value of money they 
decided to – it made sense at the time considering also the 
knowledge that we had as consultants about the project to 
confine the project to Hatch and then phase 2 would be an 
open – public tendering process that they will advertise. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 18 of 222 
 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay and you then say in your 
statement at paragraph 16 that one of the requirements in 
the confinement request for quotation was a supplier 
development requirement.  Can you just explain to us what 
is supplier development and what was the requirement from 
Transnet’s side? 
MR BESTER:  Yes.  So supplier development I think now is 
a well-defined term.  At the time when it happened during 
those years it was quite a new concept and I can also 
recall our President at the time Mr Jacob Zuma at the State 
10 
of the Nation Address basically the first time used the word 
supplier development and that was introduced where state 
owned enterprises like Transnet will have a requirement for 
– that they need to use at least 30% of the contract values 
need to go towards supplier development. 
 
Now supplier development as I understand it and I 
understand it now is to capacitate smaller suppliers and 
consultants in South Africa to capacitate them in terms of 
capacity and also capability and by using the bigger 
consultants and the bigger suppliers to do that. 
20 
 
So it is a requirement that you use these small 
companies in your bigger contracts for Transnet projects. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay and what was Transnet’s 
requirement in terms of supplier development? 
MR BESTER:  So Transnet’s requirement at the time was 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 19 of 222 
 
supposed to be 30% but we were surprised to see that 
there was a requirement for 50% in our confinement. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Why did that come as a surprise 
to you? 
MR BESTER:  Well we – as I said at the time supplier 
development was quite a new concept for all of us and we 
were 
at 
the 
time 
well 
aware 
that 
there 
was 
an 
announcement by the President that there was a 30% 
supplier development requirement.   
So the first time we heard about the 50% is when 
10 
we got the confinement or the request for a quotation with 
the 50% supplier development requirement in it.  So it was 
quite a surprise to us.  You must also understand in terms 
of supplier development is that the main supplier which 
was 
in 
this 
case 
Hatch 
Goba 
would 
take 
all 
the 
responsibility and liability and professional indemnity for 
the project.   
So that means basically doing 50% of the work but 
taking 100% of the liability and responsibility for the 
project which was not acceptable to us at the time. 
20 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay.  Now on page 28 of your 
statement at paragraph 18 you speak of a call that you 
received on the 19 July 2013 can you tell us about this call 
and what transpired thereafter? 
MR BESTER:  Yes.  So it was during this time of 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 20 of 222 
 
confinement and working on this project that I received a 
call from Mr Nailan Padayachee that indicated he would 
like to come and see me.  You know at the time he just 
indicated that he would like to come and see me about the 
manganese project and the details were not discussed on 
the phone. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Did you know Mr Padayachee? 
MR BESTER:  I did not know him at all. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay.  What transpired after 
that? 
10 
MR BESTER:  So I agreed that you know Mr Padayachee 
come and see him at the Hatch offices in Woodmead.  So 
Mr Nailan Padayachee brought with him another gentleman 
Mr Dave Reddy and they came and see me in my office 
where they told me that we need to include them as part of 
our supplier development into our confinement for phase 1 
Manganese Expansion Project. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Did you know Mr Reddy? 
MR BESTER:  I did not know Mr Reddy at all. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Do you know the names of – 
20 
sorry yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which year are we talking about? Is it 
2012 when these activities happened? 
MR BESTER:  2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2013. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 21 of 222 
 
MR BESTER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  And at that meeting did Mr 
Padayachee say which – from which company he was 
coming? 
MR BESTER:  Mr Padayachee was from a company called 
PM Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you know the company or … 
MR BESTER:  Oh not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  You may proceed. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Thank you Chair.  And Mr Reddy 
10 
what company was he from? 
MR BESTER:  He was from a company called DEC 
Consultants if I can recall. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay.  And when they told you 
that you had to include them in Hatch’s submission for the 
confinement did they say how this request came about? 
MR BESTER:  Yes.  So they came to see me if I can say it 
like this almost as if they were sent to me.  So they 
indicated that there was a wish from Transnet and they 
were sent by Number 1.  That they need to be part of our 
20 
supplier development component and that is it.  You know 
we at the meeting we discussed their skills and what is 
required and that is it. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  And did they say who Number 1 
was? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 22 of 222 
 
MR BESTER:  They did not say to me who Number 1 was.  
You know I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ask them?  Did you ask them 
who is Number 1? 
MR BESTER:  Yes I did ask Mr Dave Reddy who was 
Number1 and he said you can figure out who is Number 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he did not want to tell you who 
Number 1 was but he said you could figure it out yourself? 
MR BESTER:  Ja.  I mean at the time I recall he – he said 
to me you know who is Number 1. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  And that part of the 
discussion was left at that?  The question of who Number 1 
was was left at that? 
MR BESTER:  It was left at that yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  Continue. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Thank you Chair.  And did you 
have any idea of who Number 1 could be? 
MR BESTER:  Well I mean obviously at the time in the 
media how everybody referred to Mr Zuma as Number 1 but 
in my world for Transnet it was either Mr Anoj Singh or Mr 
20 
Brian Molefe that was Number 1.  So it was between those 
three that I figure out must be Number 1. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay and how did the meeting 
conclude? 
MR BESTER:  Well we had quite a discussion at the 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 23 of 222 
 
meeting because as I said at the time supplier development 
was quite – quite a new concept for us.  You know we 
treaded very carefully about how we went about our 
business because as I said it was an issue about liability 
and 
responsibility 
and 
professional 
indemnity 
for 
us 
because it was quite a big – a large project to execute.   
I clearly recall I asked them about the skills sets 
that they have and Mr Reddy indicated to me he has got a 
lot of engineers in India that can help and I recall telling 
him that you know supplier development is not about 
10 
growing skills in India it is a South African initiative. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay and was there anything 
about them approaching you that concerned you because 
this was a confinement would they know about this 
confinement, would it – was it public knowledge? 
MR BESTER:  At the time it was very concerning because 
they gave me a lot of facts about the project which I 
thought at the time was confidential to Transnet.  So they 
had an intimate knowledge about the project.   
Even the confinement was not public knowledge.  The 
20 
confinement and I have to say the confinement at that time 
was 
not 
confirmed 
because 
if 
you 
understand 
the 
confinement process it is not concluded until you have 
signed the contract.  It is a very closed process within 
Transnet of the confinement.   
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 24 of 222 
 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  Now on page 30 of your 
statement at paragraph 21, you say that upon the conclusion 
of the meeting it was agreed that Padayachee would send a 
Memorandum of Understanding which had to be considered 
and give an indication of its willingness to PM African and 
DC as potential partners for FD in the future.  How did the 
topic about a memorandum of understanding come about? 
MR BESTER:   Well, if you understand our Hatch operates.  
It is a global company.  So everything needs to be formal 
and in writing.  So I insisted that the discussion that we had 
10 
must be formalised in writing and they need to send me a 
letter.   
 
And the best of way of doing that at the time was 
considered.  Send met a memorandum of understanding of 
how you see we can work together and your expectations 
and then I will take it to the management within Hatch and 
we will consider it.   
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay I will take you to the 
memorandum in a minute.  I just want to continue with 
paragraph 21.  In your statement you also say that you have 
20 
discussed it with Mr Alan Grey who was the Managing 
Director at Hatch at the time.  Why did you feel the need to 
discuss the matter with him? 
MR BESTER:   Ja, he was the Managing Director for 
Infrastructure and not the Managing Director for Hatch at the 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 25 of 222 
 
time.   
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Ja. 
MR BESTER:   Well, I mean, we had a very transparent 
system within Hatch where we have to share information 
about clients and projects on a continuous basis, you know. 
 
Because we would, as I said, we are dealing with very 
large projects.  We are dealing with clients, sensitive clients 
like Transnet.   
 
And being a global company, you know, there is a 
platform that we have created where we share, between 
10 
managers, information and that is put to us.   
 
And for that reason, you know, it was best for us to 
share within Hatch these types of meetings and discussions 
that we had.   
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay so then did Mr Padayachee 
sent the Memorandum of Understanding? 
MR BESTER:   Yes, he emailed me a MOU. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  Can we go to page 71 of 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, before that ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say you had a discussion with Mr Alan 
Grey.  Tell me about that discussion.  What was Mr Alan 
Grey’s reaction to the meeting that you have had with 
Mr Reddy and Mr Padayachee? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 26 of 222 
 
MR BESTER:   Chair, I did not hear that question? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say in paragraph 21 you discussed 
with Mr Alan Grey who was Managing Director of Industrial 
Infrastructure at what transpired at the meeting.  And you 
informed him that PM Africa and DEC would send an MOU or 
Hatch to consider.   
 
I take it that that discussion that you are talking about 
and until you telling what had transpired at your meeting with 
Mr Padayachee and Mr Reddy.  Is that correct? 
MR BESTER:   Yes.  So ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was his reaction to you telling him 
what they have come to say to you? 
MR BESTER:   I discussed with him exactly what transpired 
at the meeting about the sensitive information that was 
communicated to me about the project.  And he was very 
uncomfortable about the discussion.  Yes.  He indicated that 
to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But at that stage, no decision was taken 
between the two of you as to what to do before the 
Memorandum of Understanding would arrive? 
20 
MR BESTER:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR BESTER:   It was agreed that we will wait for the MOU 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 27 of 222 
 
MR BESTER:   ...to understand and see what they 
communicate to us before we take any actions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  Okay you may proceed. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you, Chair.  I was going to 
take you to page 71 which is an annexure to your statement, 
the black numbers.  And at the foot of the page, there is an 
email.  Is that the email that Mr Padayachee sent to you with 
the MOU? 
MR BESTER:   Ja.  This is a... you will see at the bottom of 
the page, it says from Nailan Padayachee to Henk Bester 
10 
and he copied Mr Dave Reddy.  It was sent on the 
25t h of July, five to two in the afternoon. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   And what does it say? 
MR BESTER:   It says: 
“Hi, Henk.  Thank you for the meeting on Monday, 
the 22 nd of July 2013, 07:25.  We attached for your 
attention and comment the promised MOU.  Please 
advice on your comments and/or input so we can 
finalise asap.  Regards Nailan Padayachee.” 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay. 
20 
MR BESTER:   For and on behalf of PM Africa Project 
Management. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  Then on page 74 to page 
76.  Can you identify what that document is? 
MR BESTER:   Yes.  So on page 74 is the actual 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 28 of 222 
 
Memorandum of Understanding that was sent to me. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  And what was it... what was 
your reaction to the memorandum?  And if you can just take 
us through your understanding of its contents at the time. 
MR BESTER:   Well... [microphone not switched on] 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Your mic is off. 
MR BESTER:   Apologies.  I received the MOU.  I have read 
through it and then I sent onto Mr Alan Grey.  So this is the 
MOU that we received from PM Africa, the gentleman that 
came and see me.  Obviously, at the time when we read 
10 
through it, we were both uncomfortable with it.   
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Why were you uncomfortable with 
its terms? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe before that.  
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You might wish to ask him to identify the 
main features of the memorandum. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   That attracted his attention at the time.  
He read it and how he felt about that. 
20 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Yes.  If you can just take us 
through the main features of the MOU that drew your 
attention and what your reaction was of that and your 
understanding? 
MR BESTER:   Ja.  So the MOU states that? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 29 of 222 
 
“The 
overview, 
which 
is 
basically 
the 
two 
companies, 
Development 
and 
Engineering 
Consultants referred to as DEC and PM Africa 
referred to as PMA forms an unincorporated JV in 
short referred to as DC PMI JV between the two 
companies and then Hatch on the other side.  Hatch 
Goba herein referred to as Hatch.   
It is a project management and engineering services 
company with the address.: 
 
And then they go further into the scope.   
10 
“This is to facilitate a close working relationship 
based on an enterprise development and/or supply 
development initiative between both entities whilst 
delivering multi-disciplinary engineering design and 
project management solutions for a South African 
market within the Rail Engineering Transportation 
and Infrastructure and Engineering Sectors on an 
EPCM basis.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR BESTER:   And then it goes further into a non-compete 
20 
which is a standard clause and an MOU liabilities.  Dispute 
resolution law and then the signature requirements. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  If you can just go to page 
76 and just identify the parties to the MOU. 
MR BESTER:   So the parties at the bottom on the 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 30 of 222 
 
signatures.  Hatch Goba Africa.  It is myself, Henk Bester.  
Designation and Global Director Rail.  And on the other side, 
Development and Engineering Consultants.  The name is 
Davelin Richmond Reddy.  Designation CEO.   
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   And PM Africa? 
MR BESTER:   And PM Africa.  At the bottom, name 
Mr Nailan Padayachee, designation CEO.   
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  Now the MOU does not 
specifically mention Transnet or the Manganese Expansion 
Project.  So what was it about the MOU?  Because on the 
10 
face of it, it seems quite innocuous.  What was it about it 
that made you uncomfortable, you and Mr Grey? 
MR BESTER:   I think exactly as you said.  It would made us 
uncomfortable.  It was a very lose arrangement.  At the time 
we felt it is too lose.  It needs to be specific because it can 
create an impression... all sorts of impressions that we do 
not want.  We need to firm up on it and make it very specific. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   If you were going to make it 
specific, what would you as Hatch have expected to include 
in it? 
20 
MR BESTER:   As a minimum, it would have included the 
scope of works and the roles and the responsibility, 
exclusivity or not, duration, liabilities and you know, this is 
not a Hatch standard MOU that was in front of me.  It came 
from Mr Padayachee and Mr Reddy.  So it was too loose for 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 31 of 222 
 
us. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Oka on page 31 of your statement.  
MR BESTER:   On page? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   31.  Three, one.  At paragraph 23.  
After receiving the MOU, you then referred to a meeting at 
paragraph 23 on page 31.  Do you have it? 
MR BESTER:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Do you have it Mr Bester? 
MR BESTER:   Ja, I have it. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   You refer there to a meeting that 
10 
you had with Mr Rudi Basson of Transnet Capital Projects.  
Why did you have a meeting with him? 
MR BESTER:   So if you understand how the projects are 
executed ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Just to make sure it connects 
properly.  After you received the memorandum, you noted 
certain features, you had certain concerns but then you 
shared it with Mr Grey.  Is that right? 
MR BESTER:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And Mr Grey shared your concerns 
20 
about it? 
MR BESTER:   Yes.  I can remember ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The same concerns? 
MR BESTER:   I sent him the email with the MOU.  At the 
time, I think, he was in Cape Town.  I was in Johannesburg.  
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 32 of 222 
 
And he said he will peruse the document, make some 
comments and send it back to me.  And then we need to 
discuss it.  But we did have a phone discussion where we 
both agreed we cannot sign this document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Before the next meeting, was there 
another opportunity for the two of you to discuss further the 
MOU?  You and Mr Grey. 
MR BESTER:   Yes, we did discuss it.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have another discussion. 
MR BESTER:   Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And confirming the same concerns?  
This... the meeting that... the second discussion, did he 
basically confirm the same concerns and did it deal with the 
question of how you were going to respond? 
MR BESTER:   Yes.  So Mr Grey and myself had a 
discussion.  We have agreed how we are going to respond.  
And it was agreed that I will send an email back to the two 
gentlemen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR BESTER:   And put our concerns in writing. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Take it from there. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you, Chair.  So prior to you 
sending your email to Mr Padayachee and Mr Reddy.  You 
then have a meeting with Mr Rudi Basson on the 26t h of July.  
Why did you have that meeting with him? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 33 of 222 
 
MR BESTER:   Well, Mr Rudi Basson was the Project 
Director on the Capital Project side for Transnet.  So it would 
have come out in the discussion between myself and 
Mr Grey that we decided we are going to share with Mr Rudi 
Basson the meeting that we had. 
 
And that we felt uncomfortable about the information 
that was shared with us about the project and from Transnet 
and we were looking towards him for his advice. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  And at that meeting, 
Ms Deirdre Strydom was present as well? 
10 
MR BESTER:   That is correct.   
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  What did Mr Basson say in 
that meeting? 
MR BESTER:   Mr Basson was surprised that we had a visit 
because he knew about the two gentlemen.  He indicated 
that Mr Anoj Singh spoke to him and Mr Bierman about these 
two gentlemen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I am sorry.  Let us tackle the 
meetings differently.  I want to hear the arrangements for the 
meeting, who was at the meeting, when was the meeting, 
20 
what was the issue to be discussed, what was discussed, 
who said what?  I would like it that way. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So was this meeting with Mr Basson the 
one on the 26t h of July?  Is it 26 July? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 34 of 222 
 
MR BESTER:   The 26t h of July 2013.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR BESTER:   It was a meeting with Mr Rudi Basson, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I think you have covered this but go 
back to how that meeting came about and then tell me who 
was present, what was discussed and what was concluded, 
what was the conclusion? 
MR BESTER:   Chair, I was not... the meeting could have 
come about where I either discussed with Ms Deirdre 
Strydom at the time who was the Project Director for 
10 
Transnet Freight Rail for the project.  And she suggested I 
need to see Mr Rudi Basson.   
 
Or I would have phoned Mr Rudi Basson myself and said 
to him I need to see him urgently about a discussion I have 
had 
with 
these 
two 
gentlemen 
that 
had 
confidential 
information about Transnet and the project.  So I set that 
meeting up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And when you set the meeting up, would 
this have been before you could respond to Mr Padayachee 
or would it have been before you could respond? 
20 
MR 
BESTER: 
 
 
That 
was 
before 
we 
responded 
to 
Mr Padayachee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR BESTER:   Because we were also looking to Mr Basson 
for advice.   
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 35 of 222 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay.  So you did not respond to 
Mr Padayachee until after that meeting? 
MR BESTER:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Take it from there. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you, Chair.  So at the 
meeting, it is yourself, Mr Basson and Ms Strydom? 
MR BESTER:   That is correct. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   And as the Chair indicated, what 
was discussed at the meeting? 
MR BESTER:   So at the meeting, I gave Mr Basson a full 
10 
briefing of what transpired at the meeting, my meeting with 
Mr Padayachee and Mr Dave Reddy.  I told him about the 
information that was shared to us.  I told him about what 
their requirement was to work with us.   
 
Obviously, I also told him about Number 1.  And 
Mr Basson indicated to me that he knew about these two 
gentlemen because he was informed about these two 
gentlemen by Mr Anoj Singh.  Him and Mr Gerhard Bierman.  
And he was surprised that they came and see us.  That were 
his words. 
20 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Now when you say they were 
informed by Mr Anoj Singh.  What exactly did Mr Singh say 
to Mr Basson and Mr Bierman according to what Mr Basson 
told you? 
MR BESTER:   If I can recall what was said at the meeting 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 36 of 222 
 
by Mr Basson at the time is that Mr Anoj Singh indicated that 
he wants a specific company to be included as our supply 
development company for the Manganese Expansion Project 
and he mentioned the names of these two gentlemen.   
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  And what was Mr Basson’s 
and Mr Bierman’s reaction to that, according to what Mr 
Basson told you? 
MR BESTER:   At the time, at that specific meeting, I told 
him that, you know, what is happening within Hatch that we 
are not going to sign the MOU.   
10 
 
Obviously, as a global company this is not the way we 
do business.  And at the time, I can recall Mr Basson said to 
me:  Leave it to me.   
 
And I think at the time, my understanding was he will 
speak to either Mr Anoj Singh or Mr Gerhard Bierman to 
come back to me on advice.   
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Well, I just want to go a step back.  
You were answering a different question.  My question was, 
what did Mr Basson tell you Mr Anoj Singh had said to them 
about DC and PM Africa, which you answered.   
20 
 
Then as a follow-up, I asked.  What was Mr Basson’s 
and Mr Bierman’s responses to Mr Singh in that meeting that 
they had with Mr Sing according to what Mr Basson told you? 
MR BESTER:   Yes.  So Mr Basson indicated to me that he, 
both him and Mr Bierman, advised Mr Anoj Singh, it is not 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 37 of 222 
 
advisable to do that, to include or to indicate to us which 
companies to include as our supply development companies. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  In your experience, has 
Transnet ever required Hatch on a formal basis to include a 
specific contractor in its contract? 
MR BESTER:   No. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What is... what Mr Basson told you, was it 
that Mr Singh had shared with him and with somebody else 
that he would like your company to include Mr Padayachee’s 
10 
company and Mr Reddy’s company as supplier development 
companies in the project?  Is that what you were told? 
MR BESTER:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And Mr Basson said they told Mr 
Singh that that is not a good idea. 
MR BESTER:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MR BESTER:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you, Chair.  Now what then 
20 
transpired further at the meeting after Mr Basson said to you 
that he is aware of this and he is quite surprised that they 
would approach you directly? 
MR BESTER:   Well, I can remember that we concluded the 
meeting and it must have been later that same day where 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 38 of 222 
 
Mr Basson...  
 
Remember, I said at the meeting that he will speak to Mr 
Anoj Singh or Mr Gerhard Bierman and come back to me on 
advice.   
 
It must have been later that day that he came back and 
said to me something to the effect of:  Just sign the damn 
thing.   
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   And sign the damn thing meaning 
sign the MOU? 
MR BESTER:   That is correct. 
10 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Now what was... just to go back to 
the meeting.  What, prior to you getting the call, what was 
Ms Strydom’s advice to you as to what to do with the MOU? 
MR BESTER:   Ms Strydom said to me at the time:  Please, 
do not sign this thing.  Please do not sign the MOU. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  And Mr Basson in the 
meeting, what did he say you should do? 
MR BESTER:   Not at a meeting on the phone call to me 
later the day.  He said to me:  Just sign the damn thing. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Ja, I understand that that is what 
20 
he said out of the call but at the meeting when Ms Strydom 
is present, what did he say to you, you should do? 
MR BESTER:   He indicated that, he said to us, to me:  Do 
not sign it.  Because he advised, him and Mr Bierman 
advised Mr Anoj Singh not to do it like that.  And in his 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 39 of 222 
 
words, not to nominate a supply development company to 
Hatch.  So he said why she was not sign it. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  And so later that day, he 
then says, sign the damn thing. 
MR BESTER:   Later that day and phoned us and said:  Just 
sign the damn thing. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   And did you sign? 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what was ...[intervenes]  
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...your reaction to this new development 
10 
...[intervenes]  
MR BESTER:   My reaction was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...on the phone? 
MR BESTER:   Okay we as Hatch, we had no intention of 
signing that.  So I was just confused about the messages 
that I got from Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you, Chair.  Did you sign 
the MOU as directed by Mr Basson? 
MR BESTER:   No, we did not. 
20 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Sorry? 
MR BESTER:   We did not sign the MOU. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay what did you do with the 
MOU? 
MR BESTER:   So as I indicated, I emailed the MOU to 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 40 of 222 
 
Mr Alan Grey who at the time, as I said, was in Cape Town, I 
think.  He made some changes and he emailed it back to me 
as a suggested re-wording of the MOU that was sent to us. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   So he amended the MOU? 
MR BESTER:   That is correct. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Can we just go to page 32 of your 
statement at paragraph 25?  That is where you deal with Mr 
Grey having amended the MOU. 
MR BESTER:   Ja. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you. 
10 
MR BESTER:   Yes. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   If we can then just go to the 
amended MOU which is BMHB-4.  My apologies.  And that is 
on page 78 which is the annexures.  We first deal with the 
email and then the amended MOU.  If you can go to page 
78? 
MR BESTER:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   At the foot of page.  So that is 
also on the 26t h.   
MR BESTER:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   When Mr Alan Grey sends you an 
email at the foot of the page.  Can you see that? 
MR BESTER:   I can see, ja. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Can you just read?  And it follows 
on the next page.  Can you just read what it says? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 41 of 222 
 
MR BESTER:   So this email is from Mr Alan Grey to Eric 
Cook which was his secretary and he copied me, Henk 
Bester.  Subject:  MOU Agreement.   
“Hi.  Been on this for the past hour or so, please 
print this... 
 
Remember, this is a message to his secretary. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   H’m. 
MR BESTER:   And he copied me. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Ja. 
MR BESTER:   Yes. 
10 
“Please print this with changes shown and then go 
through and check and accept any changes and 
accept my changes in the updated MOU. 
Henk.  Henk needs to check through and make sure 
he is happy with it.” 
 
And then he... the last paragraph it is addressed to me. 
“Henk.  Henk, they need to get the message 
somehow that they are not the only SD contractor, 
not do they have first choice/shot at any project that 
we are pursuing. 
20 
Hope this wording is not so vague that they are now 
not happy.  Alan Grey, Managing Director Industria 
Infrastructure.” 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay and then on page 81 to page 
83.  Can you identify what this document is? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 42 of 222 
 
MR BESTER:   Yes, this is the revised MOU> 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   That you received from Mr Alan 
Grey? 
MR BESTER:   That is correct. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  Now can you, as the Chair 
asked earlier on, with the first MOU identify any key-features 
that you wanted to highlight to Mr Padayachee and Mr Reddy 
about how you wanted to operate with them going forward? 
MR BESTER:   Yes, I can. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry. 
10 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In doing so, please also tell me what 
changes Mr Grey made on the email which you had sent him 
which had come from Mr Padayachee, important changes or 
amendments that he made. 
MR BESTER:   Yes, Chair.  I think the important changes 
were.  If you look on this.  The company details remained the 
same.  And the changes would come into... if I can read this? 
“DC PMA JV and Hatch have agreed to enter into 
this Memorandum of Understanding for the express 
20 
purpose of cooperating where applicable on the 
enterprise development basis and for specified 
supplied 
development 
initiatives 
relating 
to 
engineering and project management services. 
This will be on a specifically agreed project-by-
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 43 of 222 
 
project basis and on a non-exclusive basis. 
The parties will engage of their own free will for the 
mutual benefit of both parties and hereby agree to 
honour and be bound by the following terms and 
conditions.” 
 
So that sentence is the big difference:  It will be on a 
non-exclusive basis and the parties shall agree by their own 
free will, participate on the project. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   And?  Continue. 
MR BESTER:   [No audible reply]  
10 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Also in respect of the period that it 
would be operational ...[intervenes]  
MR BESTER:   Ja.  So it will be on a yearly basis, renewable 
on a yearly basis, renewed on a yearly basis. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  Were there any other 
changes that were made? 
MR BESTER:   No other changes were made. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  And is that your signature 
on the ...[intervenes]  
MR BESTER:   Oh, excuse me. 
20 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Ja. 
MR BESTER:   Excuse.  Apologies. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   No, that is fine. 
MR BESTER:   So the other change that was made.  
Should...  If I can refer you to page 82 on the top? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 44 of 222 
 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Ja. 
MR BESTER:   It says: 
“Should a project materialise, it shall be executed 
on a basis whereby DCA PMV JV... 
 
Which is the companies from Mr Padayachee and 
Mr Reddy. 
“...shall act as sub-consultants to Hatch Goba on 
agreed scope, price and terms and conditions.  We 
shall be finalised prior to either bidding for or 
commencement of the project.” 
10 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay can you explain the 
significance of that change? 
MR BESTER:   Yes.  So the significance of that change is 
that it is on a sub-consultant basis which means, it is no 
expectations that it will be a joint venture or a 50/50 
partnership or any other type of contract. 
 
And then of course, it will be on an agreed scope, price 
and terms and conditions. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  And did you send this 
amended Memorandum of Understanding to Mr Padayachee 
20 
and Mr Reddy? 
MR BESTER:   Yes, I did. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Oaky.  If we can just go to the 
email that you addressed to them.  It is on the page 85 of 
the bundle at the foot of the page which is still the same day.   
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 45 of 222 
 
MR BESTER:   Ja.   
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  Can you just read the email 
for us. 
MR BESTER:   So the email is from Henk Bester, sent 
26 July 2013, 11:35 in the morning to Mr Nailan Padayachee 
and I copied Mr Dave Reddy.  Subject:  RED CP MA JV MOU. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay you can continue. 
MR BESTER:   And then I said: 
“Guys, please find the attached signed MOU which I 
signed on behalf of Hatch Goba.  Please note, we 
10 
have made some changes in...” 
 
And then I numbered there three changes. 
“1. 
MOU for one year renewable.  Obviously, as 
per project.   
2. 
Non-exclusive in that we will also use other 
companies as see fit to satisfy SD requirements. 
3. 
It will be in a form of a sub-consultant 
agreement with scope, SD targets, et cetera, et 
cetera. 
Please advise you are happy as our intent is to 
20 
commitment to SD.  Regards, Henk Bester.” 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  And what was their reaction 
to the amended MOU? 
MR BESTER:   I can recall that they were not happy. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  On page 33 of your 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 46 of 222 
 
statement at paragraph 29. 
MR BESTER:   Paragraph? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   29. 
MR BESTER:   Ja? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   At the foot of the page.  You speak 
of a call that you received from Mr Padayachee on the 1s t of 
August 2013 where he requested for you to meet up with him 
again and you agreed on the 5 t h of August 2015.   
 
Can you take us through what happened at that meeting 
on the 5t h of August 2015?   
10 
 
And as the Chair indicated, if you can tell us who was 
present at the meeting and what each person contributed to 
the meeting and what was discussed. 
MR BESTER:   So, yes I received a call.  They would like to 
meet me again.  It was agreed on the 5t h of August 2015.  At 
the meeting, they advised me that the confinement process 
was eminent.   
 
But they need... they will send me an addendum to the 
MOU that we have sent to them.  They indicated that the 
MOU as in its current form is not acceptable. 
20 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Now what did you understand by 
them having mentioned that the confinement is eminent? 
MR BESTER:   Well, at the time, as I understood it, was that 
they indicated to me that the confinement is eminent subject 
to.  There is another matter that we need to conclude.   
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 47 of 222 
 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   The other matter being? 
MR BESTER:   They need to change the MOU to us and we 
need to agree on a revised MOU. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   So your understanding is that the 
confinement, that was the only thing that was holding up the 
aware of the confinement by Transnet to Hatch?  Is that 
correct? 
MR BESTER:   That is correct.  I... in my own work, I 
understood it that we are being hold ransom.  Transnet is not 
going to approve the confinement unless we agree to the 
10 
revised MOU. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay and so when you refer to the 
advised MOU, you are referring to the addendum that 
Mr Padayachee and Mr Reddy gave to you at this meeting? 
MR BESTER:   I cannot recall that they actually gave it to 
me at the meeting or they emailed it to me after the meeting. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  But you are referring to the 
addendum that needs to be revised? 
MR BESTER:   That is correct. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Because we have the initial MOU.  
20 
Then we have the Hatch revised MOU.  And then we have 
the addendum. 
MR BESTER:   That is correct, Chairman. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay and you then received the 
addendum from them? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 48 of 222 
 
MR BESTER:   I did receive... by email I received the 
addendum, yes. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  Can we go to the 
addendum?  That is to be found on page 89 of the bundle, 
eight, nine.   
MR BESTER:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Do you confirm that that is the 
addendum that you received from Mr Padayachee and Mr 
Reddy? 
MR BESTER:   I confirm this is the addendum, yes. 
10 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  Can you read the 
addendum for us, please? 
MR 
BESTER: 
 
 
The 
addendum 
is 
dated 
the 
2n d of August 2013.  Addendum 1 as a heading.  It says: 
Projects. 
“This addendum refers to the above MOU between 
Hatch Goba and DEC PMA JV.” 
 
And then paragraph. 
“The first project identified that the parties will 
engage on within the purposes and scope of the 
20 
MOU is recorded as the Transnet EPCM FER 3-4 for 
the Manganese line upgrade. 
Hatch Goba will engage DEC PMA JV as the primary 
SD partner in the project.” 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay so here for the first time we 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 49 of 222 
 
now 
see 
that 
the 
Manganese 
Project 
is 
specifically 
mentioned by them. 
MR BESTER:   That is correct. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   What was your reaction when you 
received this addendum and what did you do with the 
addendum? 
MR BESTER:   Well, what my hair stand ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Bester.  Maybe before that. 
Did this addendum come alone or did it come with the MOU 
that you had sent to them?  And if so, was the MOU that you 
10 
had sent to them un-amended by them ...[intervenes]  
MR BESTER:   Chair, I understood that this ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct]  
MR BESTER:   ...addendum came on its own without the 
addendum that we proposed to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  At that stage, had they indicated 
what their attitude was, that is now Mr Padayachee and 
Mr Reddy to the revised memorandum that you sent to them?   
 
Had they indicated to you prior to you receiving this 
addendum what their attitude was to the amendments that 
20 
you had made? 
MR BESTER:   yes, I can recall that they indicated that they 
were not happy because they needed to be part of the 
Manganese Phase 1 Project.  And it needs to be clearly 
articulated in the MOU. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 50 of 222 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now, the... is the position that the 
MOU that you sent to them did not articulate that?  It was 
general? 
MR BESTER:   That is correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   And they wanted specific reference to this 
particular project? 
MR BESTER:   That is correct.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Did that appear to be their only issue? 
MR BESTER:   No, the other issue was also the non-
exclusive basis. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes, they wanted to be exclusive? 
MR BESTER:   They wanted to be included on an exclusive 
basis.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  At that stage, your stance 
remained the same, namely that you did not want reach on 
an exclusive basis? 
MR BESTER:   No.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR BESTER:   Our stance stayed the same.  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So when you received this 
20 
addendum, what was your reaction to the content of the 
addendum?  Did you think it seemed to be fine or there was 
a problem? 
MR BESTER:   Well, I had two reactions.  I was very upset 
because it was clearly stated in this addendum by them that 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 51 of 222 
 
they wanted to be included as a primary SD partner which 
was absolutely the priority point that we highlighted to them, 
we will not sign for.   
 
And then, also they indicated the FER 3-4 Manganese 
Project which was a very lose description of the Manganese 
Expansion Project of Transnet in general.  It does not refer 
to the specific project that we were talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR BESTER:   In this case, the 16 million tons Manganese 
Expansion Project.  This was a very lose term that they 
10 
used. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it seemed to be much wider. 
MR BESTER:   Much wider, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Bester, at 
this stage, you have already had the meeting with Mr Basson 
where he told you what him and Mr Bierman had told 
Mr Singh about the fact that they cannot do it.  Transnet 
cannot dictate.   
 
At any stage after that meeting and when you met with 
20 
Mr Padayachee and Mr Reddy, did you say to them:  I had a 
meeting with Transnet and they say that this matter is 
closed.  They told Singh that this cannot happen. 
MR BESTER:   To be honest, I cannot recall sharing that 
type of detail with them.  I cannot recall it was actually 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 52 of 222 
 
necessary to share that information with them. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  So you never told them 
what you were told by Transnet via Mr Basson? 
MR BESTER:   No, I... at the time, I would not have thought 
necessary to share that type of detail with them. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay thank you.  Chair, I see that 
it is quarter past eleven.  Is this a convenient time? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let us take the tea-adjournment.  We 
will resume at half-past eleven. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you, Chair.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS: 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Bester, 
just before the adjournment we dealt with the addendum 1 
that you received from Mr Padayachee and Mr Reddy.  We 
were at the point where we were dealing what your reaction 
was to it and what you did with the addendum. 
MR BESTER:   So yes, we were not -, myself and Mr Gray, 
20 
I immediately discussed it with Mr Gray at Hatch and very 
unhappy about the situation that was now unfolding and 
later that evening I also phoned Mrs Deidre Strydom from 
Transnet Freight Rail who was the project manager for the 
manganese expansion project.  I told her about how the 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 53 of 222 
 
events unfolded and we were now looking towards Transnet 
of what we need to do. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Can I just ask why did you not 
ask Mr Basson who told you to sign the initial MOU what 
had transpired, why Ms Strydom and not Mr Basson? 
MR BESTER:   Can you just repeat that question? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Why did you feel it appropriate 
to approach Mrs Strydom to tell her what had transpired 
with the first  - with the addendum and not Mr Basson who 
was the person that told you to sign the initial MOU? 
10 
MR BESTER:   It was a purely a matter of the reporting 
system within the project that was set up so I had more an 
easier access to the project director and project manager 
from Transnet Freight Rail than from Transnet Capital 
Projects so for that reason I escalated the matter to her as 
my sort of direct client interface. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   And what was her response? 
MR BESTER:   She indicated to me that she will come back 
to me on what to do next and she will also look for some 
advice within people that she knows within Transnet of 
20 
what we need to do next. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay, at paragraph 31 of your 
statement on page 34 – are you there? 
MR BESTER:   Yes. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   You say that at this stage you 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 54 of 222 
 
were very fearful that physical harm would come to you and 
to other executives at Hatch.  What gave you that 
impression? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Uhm... 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
  
It 
is 
better 
to 
ask 
the 
question 
differently, it is an important question.  How did you feel 
about this whole thing that was happening at that stage? 
MR BESTER:   I can clearly remember at that stage it was 
a very uncomfortable situation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you have any fears? 
MR BESTER:   Yes, I had …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What fears did you have? 
MR BESTER:   You know, I had fear of physical harm that 
was going to be imposed on myself because of just of the 
tone of the meetings that took place and our conversations 
by phone and for me it was an indication that I should be 
very careful. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright.  So, just there 
because it is important part, be careful about leading. 
20 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Leading him, ja, let him just tell the 
story. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Now on page 35 of your 
statement which is a continuation of paragraph 31.  You 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 55 of 222 
 
deal Mr Reddy again referring to number 1.  What was the 
context of that? 
MR BESTER:   Oh sorry, can you just repeat that? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Page 31. 
MR BESTER:   Yes? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   And page 35 and continuation of 
paragraph 31 of your statement.  You again reference Mr 
Reddy referring to number 1 who was not happy.  How did 
that come about that that he said to you that number 1 was 
not happy? 
10 
MR BESTER:   Well, I phoned Mr Reddy and I indicated to 
him that we will not sign the MOU, at least the revised 
MOU that they sent to us and then he indicated to me that 
number 1 will not be happy with this development. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what did you say in response to 
that?  What did you say to him in response to this? 
MR BESTER:   I indicated – I said to him – I cannot clearly 
remember exactly what my words would have been but 
something in the direction of that is our final decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR BESTER:   And, you know, we cannot care if number 1 
is happy or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, please continue. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you, Chair.  And at 
paragraph 33 you again referred to a call that Mr Reddy 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 56 of 222 
 
made to you and an email that you and Mr Gray prepared 
to respond to Mr Padayachee and Mr Reddy.  Can you just 
take us through how that came about and what the email 
contained? 
MR BESTER:   Yes.  So remember I phoned Mr Reddy in 
the morning and I indicated to him that we will not sign the 
MOU and I indicated – and it was during this conversation 
that he said to me that number 1 would not be happy which 
I indicated to him that is our final decision.   
But I did indicate to him that obviously it is very 
10 
important for us to make this formal and that we will be 
sending him an email to reflect exactly our decision, which 
we did. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay, if we can go to page 92 of 
the bundle? 
MR BESTER:   Ja. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Can you identify this document? 
MR BESTER:   Yes, that is the email I sent to Mr 
Padayachee. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   And can you read to us what you 
20 
say in the email? 
MR BESTER:   Yes, it is an email from myself, Henk 
Bester, sent Wednesday 7 August quarter past six in the 
evening to both Mr Nailan Padayachee and Mr Dave Reddy, 
the subject is Addendum 1 to MOU: 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 57 of 222 
 
“Dear Nailan and Dave, further to my telephone 
conversation yesterday evening (with Dave) I wish 
to confirm that we are not comfortable signing the 
addendum 1 to our MOU which you gave us to us 
for consideration on Monday the 5 t h which would 
confirm the DEC PMA JV as a primary SD partner 
for the Transnet FER 3/4 phases of the manganese 
upgrade project.  As you seem to be aware, the 
EPC in appointment for the project had at this stage 
not been awarded to us and may yet go out to 
10 
tender should the confinement not be approved.  
Our SD plan…” 
Supply development plan. 
“…still needs to be finalised around the specific 
requirements set for the project and needs to 
embody all of the various aspects of SD in the 
broader definition.  We have other organisations 
who will also need to be considered in a transparent 
manner as appropriate in the rollout of the SD plan 
which will require client alignment, Transnet, and 
20 
endorsement prior to implementation.  The MOU 
recently signed per yourself does not cater for 
exclusivity.  As I have explained to you in our first 
meeting Hatch, as a global company, has fully 
embraced the principles of SD and will ensure 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 58 of 222 
 
through the project that should we be successful in 
any other project we maximise opportunities for 
skills development, localisation, technology transfer 
and other targets set to support Transnet in its SD 
targets as a state owned company.  We are 
therefore 
not 
in 
a 
position 
to 
agree 
to 
your 
appointment as the primary SD supplier for this 
project.  Thank you for your understanding in this 
matter.  Regards, Henk Bester.” 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Did you receive a response to 
10 
this email? 
MR BESTER:   I had several calls from Mr Dave Reddy 
which I did not answer. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   But no written correspondence 
from him after that. 
MR BESTER:   No. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay, now on page 36 of your 
statement at paragraph 34 you speak about a meeting on 
the morning of the 7 August.  This would have been before 
you sent the email that we have just looked at.   
20 
You had a meeting with Mr Gray and with Ms 
Strydom.  Can you explain to us who that meeting came 
about and what transpired at that meeting? 
MR BESTER:   Yes.  So when we received the addendum 1 
to the MOU from Mr Reddy and Padayachee obviously 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 59 of 222 
 
there was discussion within Hatch and it was decided that 
we will have a meeting with Mrs Deidre Strydom and inform 
her about how unhappy we are, the situation that we found 
ourselves in, and we looking towards her for some advice 
on what we need to do next and to whom we should 
escalate this matter within Transnet. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  And what did Ms Strydom do?  
MR BESTER:   At the time I understood from her that she 
has spoken to Mr Johan Bouwer, which was also a senior 
person within Transnet at the time.   
10 
I cannot hundred percent recall his designation, 
also to look towards advice from his side but then I also 
understand that she said she will speak to Ms Cleopatra 
Shiceka which was the counsel within Transnet working in 
– as a General Manager working in the office of Mr 
Siyabonga Gama. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay and are you aware of 
whether she did speak to Ms Shiceka? 
MR BESTER:   Yes, in fact she did and she advised us that 
Ms Shiceka would like to see us for a meeting which was 
20 
set up, if I can recall, in the Wimpy in the Carlton Centre. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  And can you explain to us 
what transpired at that meeting and who was present at the 
meeting? 
MR BESTER:   Yes, so myself, Mr Allan Gray, Mrs Deidre 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287

Strydom, we met – I am not sure if was Mrs or Ms, 
Cleopatra Shiceka at the Wimpy in the Carlton Centre.  We 
told her everything, what transpired to date with the 
gentlemen Mr Dave Reddy and Nailan Padayachee. 
We explain all the MOUs, the revisions and at the 
time also why we did not feel comfortable signing it and 
now we are looking for some advice from herself and 
people within Transnet of what we should do and to whom 
within Transnet we should escalate this matter. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   And what did Ms Shiceka say? 
10 
MR BESTER:   If I can recall what happened at the 
meeting, she took – we would have taken hard copies of 
documentation like the MOU to the meeting.  She had her 
iPad there with her and she took pictures of all the MOUs 
and she requested that we send her an email to her private 
email, 
there 
was 
a 
Gmail 
account, 
of 
exactly 
what 
transpired with all the details of the individuals involved 
and then we should not do anything further, we should 
leave it with her. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   And did you do as she requested 
20 
you to do, to send a statement to her private email? 
MR BESTER:   Yes, we did send an email to her private 
email. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  Do you know what came 
of this matter? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 61 of 222 
 
MR BESTER:    I do not know, I did not have direct access 
to Ms Cleopatra Shiceka so I was enquiring through Mrs 
Deidre Strydom about feedback and the feedback I got at 
the time was Ms Cleopatra Shiceka indicated to Mrs 
Strydom that told Hatch everything is resolved, they should 
not do anything further.  
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Sorry, she said that tell Hatch 
that the matter is resolved and you should not do anything 
further? 
MR BESTER:   We should not do anything further. 
10 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  And after that were there 
any 
further 
discussions 
with 
Mr 
Reddy 
and 
Mr 
Padayachee? 
MR BESTER:   No. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  Now we know that in 
August 
2013 
the 
confinement 
was 
approved, 
is 
that 
correct? 
MR BESTER:   Yes.  So ultimately the confinement was 
approved, yes. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  So I would like to take 
20 
you to your statement where you deal with the tender sub 
where you deal with the tender submission that then took 
place following the confinement award.  Can you just tell 
us why there was a need for the submission of a tender? 
MR BESTER:   Yes.  So the confinement process is we do 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 62 of 222 
 
need to submit a formal let us call it a tender.  So Transnet 
would issue to us what they call a request for quotation 
with the detailed scope of work which we need to price as 
if it is a formal tender complete with the conditions of 
tender attached to that, all the Transnet conditions within 
and then there was a deadline set for that as per the 
formal tendering process and we would have submitted a 
tender before the deadline stated by Transnet. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  At page 38 of your 
statement, 
paragraph 
41, 
you 
speak 
about 
a 
tender 
10 
declaration form that was part of the tender document.  
Can you just tell us what the tender declaration form was? 
MR BESTER:    Yes.  So it is standard practice for 
Transnet to include in their tender documentation a tender 
declaration form basically indicating that, you know, we 
were not approached by Transnet personnel, then the 
tendering process or we were not influenced by Transnet 
people at the time for awarding this contract.  So obviously 
for us it was a serious matter at the time, we needed to 
understand the legal implications for us to sign it or not 
20 
and that was a matter that was referred within Hatch to our 
legal counsel to understand the legality of that specific 
document. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   And what was Hatch’s approach 
in response to the questions contained in the tender 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 63 of 222 
 
declaration form and specifically related to what had 
transpired with Padayachee and Reddy? 
MR BESTER:   If I can recall, at this stage our legal 
counsel 
at 
Hatch 
in 
South 
Africa 
was 
Mrs 
Xandra 
Blacklaws.  So we handed that matter over to her.  She 
looked at it from a perspective of what is required to be 
signed and what transpired to that date.  We also had a 
meeting with our managing director of Hatch in South 
Africa at the time, Mr Rory Kirk, where this whole matter 
was discussed and it was found that we can actually sign a 
10 
declaration because we were not in conflict of interest as 
stated in that specific declaration. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay, so if we can go to 
paragraph 42.  Here you say, it is on page 39: 
“To the best of my recollection Hatch’s position was 
the following...” 
And, as I understand it, this was Hatch’s position vis-à-vis 
the tender declaration form, is that correct? 
MR BESTER:   That is correct. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  So you set out at the first 
20 
subparagraphs there that: 
“Hatch had acted correctly during the process and 
that Padayachee and Reddy’s behaviour is a cause 
for concern and warranted the elevation of the 
matter to Transnet.” 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 64 of 222 
 
What I would like to ask you about is on the next page on 
page 40 at paragraph 42.7 where you state in your 
statement: 
“Any influence Padayachee and Reddy claimed to 
have had with Transnet regarding the award of the 
contract appears to have had no basis especially in 
view of the fact that the confinement had been 
approved without Hatch having to conclude the 
MOU on Padayachee and Reddy’s terms.” 
My question, Mr Bester, is how could you think that there 
10 
had been no basis when Basson had told you that Singh 
specifically told him and Gerhard Bierman that he wanted 
DEC to be a preferred SD partner on this project? 
MR BESTER:   Ja, you must remember that all the 
discussions and the feedback we had from the Transnet 
employees 
was 
not 
in 
writing, 
it 
was 
verbally 
communicated to us and even in our insistence to give us 
something in writing to nominate a subcontractor, nobody 
was prepared to do so.  So on that basis considering the 
fact that we actually then did receive the confinement 
20 
request for quotation, we came to the conclusion, you 
know, they probably did not have the standing within 
Transnet as they indicated. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   So was it your basis that as long 
as it was not on paper they did not really have any 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 65 of 222 
 
influence because it is quite evident that Mr Basson told 
you that Mr Singh had given a direction as to what he 
wanted to happen.  When Mr Reddy and Padayachee meet 
with you, they basically tell you the same thing, that they 
have been sent by people high up and you must make them 
the SD partner on this project.  So it is just from my side a 
bit peculiar that Hatch would take the approach that there 
was no – that they did not have any influence.  I am just 
trying to understand what specifically are you referring to 
as being the influence?  How do you understand influence 
10 
to be? 
MR BESTER:   Yes, so what was important for us at a 
stage from that perspective is that none of the individuals 
at the prices actually had an influence in how we actually 
determined the price for our submission.  So how we 
determined the price and eventually came to the conclusion 
of the supply and development percentages was a pure 
Hatch and calculation, we were not influenced by anybody 
outside Hatch to change or amend the percentages or 
make other amounts.  So based on that, you know, we were 
20 
happy that we were not influenced and impacted by 
somebody else outside Transnet. 
ADV 
SEGEELS-NCUBE: 
 
 
Okay, 
so 
that 
was 
your 
understanding of what…[intervenes] 
MR BESTER:   That is correct. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 66 of 222 
 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   ...the requirement was from the 
tender document. 
MR BESTER:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did it not require you to disclose if 
somebody within Transnet had done something or seemed 
to be doing something wrong in connection with this project 
and your getting it or not getting it? 
MR BESTER:   Chair, if I understand you correctly, there 
was no doubt in our mind that there was a lot of – I do not 
know what the correct word is for that but …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   If what you had been told was true about 
Mr Singh then he was doing something. 
MR BESTER:   Yes, I mean, there was a lot of – no doubt 
in our minds that there was a lot of things happening 
behind the scene that we could not put our finger on but 
from the actions that we choose from a Hatch perspective 
was purely our decisions and, you know, I – if you ask me 
now the question, remember we also had a meeting with Mr 
Gary Pita. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR BESTER:   Where we insisted that they put whatever 
they wanted to in writing and he was procurement lead of 
Transnet at the time. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you, Chair.  Okay, Mr 
Bester, at paragraph 46 of your statement on page 41 you 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 67 of 222 
 
speak about various meetings between Hatch and Reddy 
even after the confinement was awarded and you say that 
it culminated in a meeting with the Chief Procurement 
Officer at Transnet Mr Gary Pita.  Can you explain to us 
what Mr Pita’s involvement was in this matter, how the 
meeting came about and what transpired at that meeting? 
MR BESTER:   Yes, so subsequent to our formal regret, 
email letter that we sent to Mr Reddy about not signing the 
MOU there was various attempts by Mr Reddy to contact us 
and, you know, there were various discussions with him 
10 
where he tried to influence us to sign the agreement with 
them. 
 
So the decision within Hatch – and that culminated 
in a meeting with Mr Gary Pita.  In fact we were invited to 
a meeting with Mr Anoj Singh, not Gary Pita.  It happened 
that we have seen Mr Gary Pita but the meeting was 
actually set up by Mr Anoj Singh in the Carlton Centre. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  And what transpired at 
that meeting and who was present at the meeting? 
MR BESTER:   So we were invited to a meeting with Mr 
20 
Anoj Singh in the Carlton Centre – I can clearly remember 
that.  Myself and Mr Allan Gray from Hatch went to this 
meeting, I cannot recall the time of day, it was somewhere 
in the afternoon. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Sorry, Mr Bester, can I just 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 68 of 222 
 
interrupt you to maybe give you some direction on the 
timing?  If you go to page 121 of the bundle you have 
provided us with a meeting invite. 
MR BESTER:   Ja. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Is this in respect of that 
meeting? 
MR BESTER:   That is correct. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay, can you just say what the 
meeting is about, subject and location. 
MR BESTER:   It says subject …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I am sorry, the date, the intended 
date of the meeting was to be what date? 
MR BESTER:   22 October 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Ja, when it comes to 
meetings I want to know when, who was there, what was 
discussed, who said what, what was the conclusion. 
MR BESTER:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.   
MR BESTER:   So this meeting, in what came from Mr Gary 
Pita, to Gary Pita, Melodi Batoya, I never know that 
20 
person, Mr Anoj Singh, Carol Perie and the subject was: 
“Discussion with Allan Gray from Hatch”: 
The date of the meeting was the 22 October 2013, quarter 
past one in the afternoon to – quarter to two, it was 
scheduled in the afternoon.  Where?  Anoj’s office.  That 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 69 of 222 
 
would have been in the Carlton Centre. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay, continue with what the 
Chair asked you.  Who was at the meeting, what was the 
meeting, what transpired? 
MR BESTER:   Myself and Mr Allan Gray from Hatch went 
to this meeting.  As I said, I can clearly recall this meeting, 
it was on the top floor of the Carlton Centre.  We were told 
to wait at reception for Mr Singh as he was busy so Mr 
Gray and myself were sitting at reception waiting for Mr 
Singh.  His office was open and we could see him sitting 
10 
inside the office very casually.   People were coming and 
going out of his office.  You know, we had now been 
waiting for an hour or so for the meeting to start so we 
were already an hour overdue.  We were very annoyed.  
We were seeing him walking in and out of his office talking 
casually to people, going to bathroom, passed us without 
acknowledging us so we found it very strange, the situation 
that we were in, myself and Mr Gray, sitting in front of his 
office waiting for him at a meeting that he scheduled and 
treating us like that. 
20 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay and what transpired at the 
actual meeting? 
MR BESTER:   So eventually, I think it was after an hour or 
so, Mr Gary Pita came to us and said sorry, Mr Anoj Singh 
is not available to see us, Mr Anoj Singh asked that he, Mr 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 70 of 222 
 
Gary Pita himself see us.  So at the meeting was Mr Gary 
Pita, myself and Mr Allan Gray from Hatch. 
 
So what transpired at the meeting is that we told Mr 
Pita 
everything 
what 
transpired 
to 
date 
about 
the 
gentlemen, Mr Reddy and Padayachee, their requirement 
that they had that we must include them and it was a very 
heated discussion that we had with Mr Pita at the time.   
I can remember, you know, we were insistent that if 
it 
is 
indeed 
Transnet 
wanting 
us 
to 
include 
these 
gentlemen or these companies in our submission they need 
10 
to 
do 
it 
in 
writing 
and 
we 
will 
not 
act 
in 
verbal 
communication or indirect communication. 
 
I can remember Mr Pita was very aggressive at one 
stage and he was even leaning over the table towards me 
at some stage in a very aggressive nature. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   What was Mr Pita saying, what 
were his exact words, if you can remember? 
MR BESTER:   It was something to the effect of I must do 
as he tells me and he will not put it in writing and I will act 
what he is telling me. 
20 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   And what was he telling you to 
do? 
MR BESTER:   He was telling me to include the gentlemen 
in our submission. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   By the gentlemen you mean? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 71 of 222 
 
MR BESTER:   Mr Dave Reddy and Nailan Padayachee, the 
two companies. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just for the transcribers, the reference 
to Mr Pita is the reference to Mr Gary Pita, I think, is that 
right? 
MR BESTER:   Mr Gary Pita. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes 
and 
Pita 
is 
P-i-t-a 
for 
the 
transcribers. 
MR BESTER:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Continue? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Yes.  And what – how did you 
conclude the meeting with Mr Pita? 
MR BESTER:   Well, for us it was a very unfortunate 
situation because, you know, the relationship that we had 
with Transnet at the time was a very formal relationship of 
respect, I would say.   
Also, it was strange for us that Mr Gary Pita himself 
20 
will get involved in matters like this because Mr Pita at the 
time was the procurement lead of Transnet and the 
projects that we were doing were dealt with by the 
procurement leads of Transnet Capital Projects and not 
Transnet themselves so, you know, it was very bizarre for 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 72 of 222 
 
us to talk to the procurement lead of Transnet and not 
understanding why this project will receive such high 
attention. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  And ultimately did Hatch 
sign an agreement with either Mr Dave Reddy or Mr 
Padayachee for them to be part of the project? 
MR BESTER:   No, we did not. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Were any of those companies 
part of the project for phase one? 
MR BESTER:   No. 
10 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  I would like to take you to 
the approval of the confinement award which is at HB15 
and that is on page 123, for us to conclude this aspect of 
the SD partners.    
MR BESTER:   Ja. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:    Now you will see that this is a 
memorandum to Mr Brian Molefe who at the time was the 
Group Chief Executive of Transnet and it is from Mr Charl 
Möller who was the Group Executive of Transnet Capital 
Projects dated the 12 t h of November 2013 regarding the 
20 
PFEL for EBCM Services for Phase 1 of the Manganese 
16million tons per annum TFR project to Hatch Goba 
Confinement and award status update for noting. 
 
On page – the following page, page 124, I would 
just like us to deal with what is set out in paragraph 7 at 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 73 of 222 
 
the top of the page, if you can read that into the record, 
and then also explain to us what this table is that we see 
here. 
MR BESTER:   Must I read that for you? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Yes, paragraph 7. 
MR BESTER:   Paragraph 7 states: 
“Further negotiations led by Mr Gary Pita, Mr G 
Pita, Group Chief Supply Chain Officer followed, 
wherein Transnet requirement that Hatch Goba 
subcontract 
30% 
of 
their 
EPCM 
bid 
price 
to 
10 
emerging black owned companies was met by  
Hatch Goba on the 31 s t of October 2013 as follows.” 
And then it has got a table with all the requirements and all 
the names of the companies. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   And what were the names of the 
companies that Hatch had as their FD partners? 
MR BESTER:   So there were five companies that were 
identified in our submission, the first company was Assen, 
which is a multi-discipline engineering, consulting and 
project management company, 100% black-owned and then 
20 
the second company was EDS ...[intervenes]  
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Sorry Mr Bester, sorry to 
interrupt you, the transcribers have asked if you could just 
move a bit away from the mic, it is affecting their 
transcribing.   My apologies, continue. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 74 of 222 
 
MR BESTER:   Apologies. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Continue.  
MR BESTER:   The second company was EDS, EDS Office 
Unique 
Combination 
of 
service 
designed 
to 
provide 
customised solutions to the renewable energy, mining, and 
corporate sectors.  The third company was MMQS, which is 
a Quantity Surveying and Contract Admin company, and let 
me just also say the second company, EDS, was 100% 
black owned and 80% black women owned, the third 
company as I said was MMQS which is a quantity surveying 
10 
and contract admin company, 100% black-owned, the 4 t h 
company was ZD Projects, Engineering & Project Services, 
100% black-owned and also 100% black women owned, and 
the 5 t h company was Aspire, which was also an engineering 
and project services company 100% black-owned and 100% 
black women owned company. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay and just to confirm those 
were the companies that Hatch had selected to be its SD 
partners. 
MR BESTER:   That’s correct. 
20 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay now if we can go back to 
your statement at page 41, still continuing with the SD 
partners that were part of the hatch submission, at 
paragraph 44 at the end of the paragraph we talk about the 
companies that were already included were Assenge, 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 75 of 222 
 
Aspire, EDS and MMQS for Phase 1 and I would like us to 
go to the correspondence which is 8B 13 to be found on 
page 111 of the bundle, and at the foot of the page if you 
can just tell us what this document is from Mr Gray. 
MR BESTER:   It is an email from Mr Greg Tue from Hatch 
to – I might not get this word right, ja, so this is an email 
to Thobolka Thoko from Transnet Corporate, Komolengo 
Mashange, Ms Zonjane Sidaan-Yana, and also Mr Vic Best 
and I was copied in, Mr Craig Simmer, Mr Gary Pita, Khola 
Sithola, Allan Gray and Craig Sampson. 
10 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay now the subject says Hatch 
Goba response to 6  November FD clarification request.  If 
we can go to the next page, it would appear that what was 
being requested was for Hatch to be specific as to who the 
FD partners would be and what their role would be.   I want 
to focus on what the response was from Mr Tue of Hatch in 
respect of each one, you will see he says, 
 
“Name and address of proposed sub-consultant, the 
nature and extent of the work or service, the previous 
experience with sub-consultant, the BBBEE level and 
20 
percentage black ownership”. 
 
The first entity that he refers to is Assenge and if 
you look at the last line dealing with Assenge before you 
see the number 2, he says, 
“Yes, we have worked with Assenge on two projects, 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 76 of 222 
 
Massaroni 
and 
Transnet 
Energy 
Management 
Project”, 
 
You see that? 
MR BESTER:   That’s correct yes. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   And then at the foot of the page 
he deals with EDS and he says the same on the next page, 
 
“Yes, we have worked with EDS on four projects”, 
 
When we get to number 3 MMQS he doesn’t mention 
whether Hatch had, previously worked with MMQS and the 
ZD Projects, he says, 
10 
“Yes, we have worked with ZDP on various public 
infrastructure projects and Aspire, he says, yes we 
have 
worked 
with 
ZDP 
on 
various 
public 
infrastructure projects”. 
MR BESTER:   That’s correct, I see it yes. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   My question is, how did MMQS 
become a SD partner of Hatch Consulting on this project? 
MR BESTER:   I cannot recall 100% the details but if I can 
recall, to the best of my ability, MMQS was a quantity 
surveying company and that was one of the requirements 
20 
of the project that quantity surveying skills be used and it 
was a requirement for quantity surveyors to be used in the 
– to estimate as we go with the capital of the project to 
certain accuracies.  That was a skill that Hatch didn’t have 
at the time, in South Africa.  So, I would – I can only 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 77 of 222 
 
speculate, at this stage, that at the time MMQS would have 
come to us as one of the recommendations from one of the 
other SD partners but I can clearly recall, we did do a 
check and a background check on MMQS at the time.  At 
the time they did work a lot for Anglo American, the Kumba 
Iron Ore Mine at Sishen and we did some background 
checks because we were also involved in some projects for 
Kumba at that time and the quality of work and the 
references that we got back at the time was to our 
satisfaction and for that reason, I think, they were also 
10 
included in the project. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Did you know anybody from 
MMQS? 
MR BESTER:   I didn’t personally know him but the owner 
of the company was a person called Mandla, if I can recall, 
I can’t recall his surname now but over time, obviously 
working on the project, I became familiar with this person, 
Mandla, which was the owner of MMQS yes. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   And you personally didn’t have 
any involvement in his appointment as a SD partner for 
20 
Hatch? 
MR BESTER:   No. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Did you have any involvement in 
the other SD partner ’s appointment? 
MR BESTER:   No, I mean the SD partners at the time, as I 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 78 of 222 
 
recall, obviously as I said earlier in my statement, SD for 
us at Hatch and obviously for Transnet and South Africa, to 
be fair, was a new concept.  So, obviously in our Monday 
meetings at Hatch this is a topic that we discussed about 
projects that other Directors within Hatch would have done, 
like energy, mining etcetera and there would have been a 
sharing of information about companies which we could 
consider for, for instance, Manganese Phase One, and I 
would assume at that meetings it was decided most of 
these companies where the names came out from other 
10 
projects that we were doing with them, as can be seen from 
this email from Mr Greg Tue. 
ADV 
SEGEELS-NCUBE: 
 
 
Okay, 
Chair, 
you 
would 
remember that at the beginning I indicated that I would be 
referring to other statements.  I beg leave to refer to one 
of those statements now which is in Bundle 4B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Mr Bester could you please go to 
Bundle 
4B, 
Chair 
this 
statement 
was 
supplemented 
yesterday, if I understand, into the Bundle.

CHAIRPERSON:   Whose statement is it? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   It is for Mr Gerhard Bierman, it 
is BD21, it is the last builder in 4B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tell him the page number. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   The page number, Chair, is page 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 79 of 222 
 
921. 
MR BESTER:   Excuse me? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Page 921, do you have it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is – is this the statement of a 
witness who is going to give evidence in due course, or 
not? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Chair it is a witness but has 
submitted a statement, he is available to give evidence, 
but he is currently located in…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just raise your voice. 
10 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Sorry Chair, he’s currently 
located in Australia, so we do not foresee that he will give 
evidence anytime soon, but he is available 
to give 
evidence and has submitted the statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay let’s admit the statement for 
now, provisionally. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   I’m indebted to you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then in due course we can see 
whether it should be admitted, finally but there should be 
no problem. 
20 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you Chair, with your leave 
Chair, 
may 
it 
be 
admitted, 
page 
921 
to 
page 
926…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think your voice is competing with the 
aircon. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 80 of 222 
 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   I’ll raise my voice Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I don’t want everybody to – if it’s 
hot, I don’t want everybody not to have the – maybe if you 
raise the – raise your voice, maybe it’s fine, if it’s possible 
for the aircon not to make as much noise as it does, while 
it’s still on, that would be helpful. Okay you’d like me to 
provisionally admit this affidavit by – statement by Mr 
Gerhard Bierman as Exhibit? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   BD21, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The statement by Mr Gerhard Bierman is 
10 
provisionally admitted as an Exhibit and will be marked 
Exhibit BD21. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Yes, indeed Chair, BD21. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, it starts at page 923. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Bester, this 
is a statement that was prepared by Mr Gerhard Bierman 
who’s the former Chief Financial Officer of Transnet 
Capital Projects and you will remember you had given 
20 
evidence 
about 
what 
Mr 
Basson 
told 
you 
about 
a 
discussion he had with Mr Bierman and Mr Singh. 
MR BESTER:   That’s correct. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay, at paragraph 15, I think 
we should start at paragraph 14 of the statement, on page 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 81 of 222 
 
926 I want to read to you what Mr Bierman says about the 
meeting he had with Mr Basson and Singh, he says at 
paragraph 14, 
“On or about 15 July 2013 during the period leading 
up to the final approval, in one of many internal 
review sessions where I was present, Singh and 
he’s referring to Mr Anoj Singh, requested that a 
company known as DEC Engineering be profiled for 
capacity and skills.  He also made a request for 
DEC to be a designated sub-contractor on Phase 
10 
One.  I considered this request highly inappropriate 
for various reasons.  14.1  I had never heard of 
DEC.  14.2  It was inappropriate for Transnet to 
impose a sub-contractor on the principal contractor 
which would have been Hatch in this instance.  14.3  
If Transnet could impose a sub-contractor it should 
be done by way of a competitive and fair process 
where other potential sub-contractors would also be 
considered and 14.4  In order for a sub-contractor 
to be considered for a project of this magnitude, I 
20 
would have to have – it would have to have a 
proven track record within the rail industry and in 
particular in respect of railway tracks. The fact that 
I had never heard of DEC was a clear indication to 
me that they were not experienced in railway tracks 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 82 of 222 
 
and certainly didn’t have a proven record”. 
 
Now at paragraph 16, we’ll skip 15, at paragraph 16 
he says, 
“Singh also asked Basson to consider MMQS as a 
designated sub-contractor.  Singh told Basson to 
obtain a copy of an introduction presentation from 
MMQS which Basson subsequently obtained.  This 
presentation outlined the skills and capacities of 
MMQS”. 
 
And then if we go to paragraph 19 on page 928, he 
10 
speaks about his response that he gave…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you should – by the time you ask 
him to comment he might have forgotten some of the 
things, you should ask him in manageable proportions, take 
one at a time.  
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Chair, my question really relates 
to – just to identify to him that MMQS was one of the 
entities that Singh also asked to be part of the SD 
programme, which Mr Bester wouldn’t know about but I just 
want to show him the link between MMQS on their final SD 
20 
list and the request that was made by Mr Singh in that 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what are you going to ask him to do 
about it? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Yes, just for him to acknowledge 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 83 of 222 
 
that this is what Mr Bierman says about MMQS insofar as 
there was a request by Mr Singh for MMQS to also be 
included. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did Mr Bierman talk to him about this? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  No Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   It’s in relation to – Chair would 
remember that MMQS now ends up as an SD partner of 
Hatch.  Mr Bester says he doesn’t know how they were 
appointed even though they had never done work with 
10 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you going to ask him to comment on 
it? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well just tell him what Mr Bierman says, 
the gist and then ask him whether he’s able to comment on 
that. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you don’t have to read the whole 
thing. 
20 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you Chair.   Insofar as 
paragraph 14 is concerned on page 926 that I had read 
into the record, were you aware that – and paragraph 16, 
that Mr Singh had also asked Mr Basson and Mr Bierman to 
have MMQS profiled for purposes of being an SD partner 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 84 of 222 
 
on the project? 
MR BESTER:   No, I was not aware. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay, and you indicated that you 
didn’t know how MMQS came to be a SD partner for Hatch? 
MR BESTER:   Yes, I can only speculate that, being the 
specific skill that they had, of quantity surveying, that 
might have come through one of the other SD partners that 
we had, that’s only my speculation. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Well, insofar as there was a 
prior request by Mr Singh and MMQS then ends up being 
10 
an SD partner of Hatch, do you find it to be coincidental or 
since you were not involved in the appointment of MMQS 
that there are people within Hatch who would know how 
MMQS, an entity they had never worked with before, 
became a partner? 
MR BESTER:   I’m not sure what you want me to answer 
but I would say it’s very coincidental yes and I don’t know 
the details. 
ADV 
SEGEELS-NCUBE: 
 
 And 
had 
you 
ever 
been 
approached by anybody about MMQS being a SD partner in 
20 
the same way you were approached by Padayachee and 
Singh before the confinement award? 
MR BESTER:   No, I have not been approached, no. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   And now that you know that 
there was this prior request from Mr Singh, what is your 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 85 of 222 
 
comment insofar as MMQS is concerned being an SD 
partner of Hatch on Phase One? 
MR BESTER:   Well, now that I have seen the details and 
heard the details, and unfortunately it’s a long time ago but 
I remember that there were discussions with MMQS 
afterwards about other projects in Transnet where the 
gentleman of and the owner of MMQS at the time, did have 
a lot of information about Transnet and their projects yes. 
ADV 
SEGEELS-NCUBE: 
 
 And, 
when 
you 
say 
had 
discussions about the projects, what do you mean by that? 
10 
MR BESTER:   As I said, unfortunately I can’t remember 
the detail as it was a very long time ago but I remember 
subsequent to the Manganese project there would have 
been other projects, obviously now, having concluded the 
Phase One project and being part of the project these 
companies like MMQS obviously would have been now in 
contact with us at Hatch for future work at Transnet or 
other State owned companies and I can recall there was 
some discussions with the owner of MMQS where he 
indicated future projects coming up from Transnet and the 
20 
budgets and the detail which was discussed with us, yes, 
so that is a coincidence. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   That is a? 
MR BESTER:   Coincidence. 
ADV 
SEGEELS-NCUBE: 
 
Okay, 
now 
what 
was 
your 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 86 of 222 
 
experience of MMQS on the Phase One?  
MR BESTER:   Well, I can tell you, MMQS as with all the 
other SD companies, if you know Hatch, they were 
controlled.  Companies were appointed in a very controlled 
manner where we, as Hatch, would have had full control of 
the type of work that they do, the quality of work and of 
course the invoicing.  If you understand the systems within 
Hatch it’s a project management company with systems 
set-up to measure progress, actual progress and time 
spent on project.  So, there is no deviation from, let’s say, 
10 
the truth. So, my experience with all the companies that we 
actually then used on Phase One, was that it was a good 
performance and in line with the Hatch expectations. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay, can we then, now move on 
to Phase Two which starts on page 43 of your statement. 
MR BESTER:   Page? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   43 and that is in 4A, my 
apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said 43? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Page 43 Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Paragraph 52.  
CHAIRPERSON:   We are now back in the Bundle 4? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Bundle 4A, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 87 of 222 
 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Mr Bester can you tell us what 
transpired and how Phase Two came about and then what 
transpired during the Phase Two procurement process? 
MR BESTER:   Yes, so if you can recall where I started off 
my statement is that we always knew that there was going 
to be a Phase Two, a much bigger project than Phase One 
and then Phase Two was a competitive bidding process, 
International that was advertised in the newspapers by 
Transnet meaning that any International company that 
complied with requirements as set out in the tenders could, 
10 
basically, tender.  So, we always knew there was an 
opportunity for us then to tender on Phase Two. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay, and so you did tender on 
Phase Two and at page 44 of your statement at paragraph 
54 you speak of you making contact with Mr Reddy prior to 
Transnet advertising the tender for Phase Two. Can you 
tell us why you made contact with Mr Reddy and what 
transpired? 
MR BESTER:   Ja, so it was during that time and the 
timeframe would have been a few months, if I can recall, 
20 
but on every Monday we would have had, within Hatch, a 
weekly meeting where we discussed the clients and the 
progress on projects and we had a review of each and 
every project and one of the things that was discussed at 
this specific meeting, I recall, was that we were also 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 88 of 222 
 
involved with other Transnet projects and the one of our 
other projects was the National Multi Product Pipeline 
project of Transnet where Transnet did not pay our 
invoices.  It was a big problem for Hatch because – I can’t 
remember the detail of the quantum of the invoices, but it 
was a lot of million rands that would have been outstanding 
for months which was, obviously unacceptable.  So, I recall 
at the meeting there were comments made by our Chief 
Financial Officer and our management team that, you know, 
we need to try to get to Mr Anoj Singh and have a meeting 
10 
with him to discuss our options because contractually one 
of the options that we had was just to stop work, something 
that we don’t like doing because it can cause a lot of 
damage and harm to clients and the projects. Other options 
would have been just to charge interest on outstanding 
invoices which is just another invoice that will collect 
outstanding days or we need to have a meeting with him 
and understand exactly what is the problem with Transnet 
why they do not pay our invoices.  So we were talking and 
debating options of getting access to Mr Singh as it was 
20 
mentioned in the meeting that various emails had been 
sent to colleagues within Transnet requesting to have a 
meeting with Mr Singh or there would have been emails 
directly sent to Mr Singh, asking for a meeting to talk 
about the outstanding invoices. So, it was at one of these 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 89 of 222 
 
meetings that I made a suggestion, I think at the time, why 
don’t we speak to Mr Dave Reddy because he seemed to 
have access to Mr Singh and ask him to arrange a meeting 
with Mr Singh so we can have discussion about our 
outstanding invoices. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The outstanding invoices, did they relate 
to Phase One or was it related to Phase Two? 
MR BESTER:   No, that relates to other projects that we 
were doing for Transnet at the time as I indicated that 
specific project was called the NNBP which was a major 
10 
project of Transnet where Hatch also had a role and did 
invoices every month. 
CHAIRPERSON:   By this time, what had been finalised 
was it the award of Phase One – of the Phase One project 
to you 
or 
was the actual work finalised for Phase 
One…[intervenes]? 
MR BESTER:   By that time Phase One was already 
awarded and we were already busy with the project in the 
execution. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
20 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you Chair.  I’m just trying 
to understand, what gave you the impression that Mr Reddy 
would have access to Mr Singh in order for him to arrange 
this meeting? 
MR BESTER:   Well, from the various meetings I had with 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 90 of 222 
 
Mr Reddy at the time, you know, where he loosely 
mentioned number one and he also spoke about Mr Singh, 
it did give us the impression that he somehow knows Mr 
Singh and that he has access to him. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay, and what was Mr Reddy’s 
response to your request for him to set up the meeting?  
MR BESTER:   I recall he said to me, no problem I will 
arrange a meeting for you and I think it was almost – I 
can’t remember the timeframe but let’s say it was almost – 
within the next day he said to me, Mr Singh said he will 
10 
see you. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   And did that meeting happen? 
MR BESTER:   Yes, that meeting happened yes it was 
arranged for – I didn’t have, or we didn’t have access to Mr 
Singh directly, so Mr Reddy indicated Mr Singh said he will 
see us in a restaurant in Melrose Arch. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Do you remember how long after 
he said to you the meeting is good to go that the actual 
meeting actually took place? 
MR BESTER:   It was very quick, I can’t remember the 
20 
details but let’s say it was one or two days. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay, so again, you go to the 
meeting, who was present, what transpired, what was 
discussed, what was the conclusion of the meeting?  
MR BESTER:   Yes, so now you must remember this wasn’t 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 91 of 222 
 
actually my meeting, this was a meeting that came about 
from a management of Hatch and most specifically from the 
Chief 
Financial 
Officer 
of 
Hatch 
to 
talk 
about 
the 
outstanding invoice and why Transnet is not paying us.  
So, I went to the meeting at the time we decided that from 
Hatch it would be myself, being just a representative for 
rail, it would be our Chief Financial Officer Mr Craig 
Sampson 
and 
it 
would 
be 
one 
of 
Engineers for an 
infrastructure Mr Craig Simmer and so we decided we all 
three would go to the meeting.  I remember I went on my own 
10 
and it was agreed that we – I will meet the other gentlemen 
there in front of the restaurant at a certain time as agreed to 
meet Mr Singh. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay and what transpired? 
MR BESTER:  So on this specific day of the meeting I 
remember I arrived a little bit early at the restaurant purely 
because I was not sure where the restaurant was and I need 
to just make sure I have got enough time to find it. 
 
And as I walked towards the restaurant I was – I was 
met by a gentleman who stopped there and start talking to 
20 
me.  And so the gentleman introduced himself as Mr Salim 
Essa.  You know I – I can recall it because I was – I did not 
know who he was.  I remember the discussion. 
 
I ask him who are you?  He said I am just somebody I 
am here to talk to you.  I said no we have a meeting with Mr 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 92 of 222 
 
Anoj Singh.  He said yes he will call Mr Singh when he is 
ready and when we are ready.  He just want to make sure 
everything is okay. 
 
So it was a very strange – I ask him so what is your 
business?  What are you doing?  He said I must not worry 
about that he has got lots of odd businesses but he is here 
to attend the meeting. 
 
I must also say the other thing that striked me at the 
time was you know his dress code.  He was – he was 
wearing an old jean and looked like he was sleeping in the 
10 
street somewhere.  So I was not impressed. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay.  And did he explain why he 
was at a meeting that was essentially a Transnet meeting? 
MR BESTER:  At the time he did not explain but it sort of 
unfolded in front of me because it was clear that he was in 
control of the situation or in control of this meeting.  He said 
to me, wait here outside the restaurant.  He walked in – I 
was standing outside looking inside and he was walking in as 
if he wants to make sure everything is okay inside the 
restaurant.  You know he was walking around it was strange.  
20 
It was almost as if he wants to make sure everything is safe 
for us to go inside – everything is set up and arranged. 
 
He came outside and I said I am waiting for Anoj.  He 
said I will now call Anoj and he was talking on his phone and 
it was literally a few seconds later and Anoj arrived. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 93 of 222 
 
 
So very strange. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay now you say in your 
statement if you look at paragraph 58 page is as guidance if 
you can take us through what was discussed at the meeting 
itself? 
MR BESTER:  So by that time my other two colleagues also 
arrived.  We walked inside.  It was a very strange meeting 
you know because we were now not – we were now not sure 
what is happening because we actually had the meeting with 
Mr Anoj Singh.  He was dressed as usual to the teeth with 
10 
his suit and tie. 
 
And this gentleman Mr Salim Essa sitting there doing 
most of the talking.  And we listening.  So it was a very 
superficial meeting.  Nothing was said really.  It was talking 
about nothing and you know I can remember my feeling was I 
just want to get this meeting over and leave.  Because we 
are not achieving anything. 
 
Anoj – I remember said a few words.  It would not 
have been any comfort to us.  No commitments were given of 
invoices and you know I think we all left the meeting not 
20 
knowing exactly what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did – did you ultimately get a chance to 
tell Mr Singh what your complaint was namely your invoices 
were not being paid. 
MR BESTER:  Yes. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 94 of 222 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it was – the delays were too long 
contrary to the agreement did you get a chance to actually 
say this is why we wanted a meeting with Mr – with you Mr 
Singh? 
MR BESTER:  Yes Chair I have to tell you that this was a 
very strange meeting as I said because Mr Singh was sitting 
there as if he was on a ledge so to say.  Ja we started off 
the meeting by saying to him exactly why we asked for this 
meeting because of the amount of money that was owed to 
us and what it cost us, what our options are.  And you know I 
10 
clearly remember the answer that he gave us was it – it did 
not give us any comfort that he was actually addressing our 
concerns. 
 
And all three of us from the – from Hatch side clearly 
wanted to leave this meeting because you know we were – I 
think we – we saw that we are not going to achieve 
something.  Plus the presence of Mr Salim Essa was for us 
something that we could not understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And at that stage or at any stage did you 
any stage during the meeting come to understand what Mr 
20 
Salim Essa’s role was in relation to Transnet matters? 
MR BESTER:  Not at all.  It was – in fact a very quick 
meeting.  We were sitting at a dinner table – a lunch table in 
the restaurant.  Our plan was actually to have lunch with Mr 
Singh but as it unfolded unknowingly we decided not to have 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 95 of 222 
 
lunch.  Mr Singh did not – as I say Mr Singh did not give us 
any comfort.  I could not even remember what Mr Essa was 
talking to us about.  But it was a very short meeting and then 
we said thank you and we left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was there somebody who was like chairing 
this meeting? 
MR BESTER:  Just come again Mr Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was there somebody who seemed like 
chairing this meeting? 
MR BESTER:  Mr Salim Essa was in charge of this meeting it 
10 
seemed to us yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright.  What was the name of 
the restaurant in which you were?  Can you remember or is it 
mentioned in your statement? 
MR BESTER:  I cannot remember if you – if I can see the 
name? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Chair it is not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it JB or J&B? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  No it is – Chair it is not mentioned 
at this meeting.  There is a subsequent meeting. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh there is another meeting. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  That was at J&B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright. 
MR BESTER:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you cannot remember the name? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 96 of 222 
 
MR BESTER:  I – I know the location in my head but I cannot 
recall the name.  I apologise for that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  Okay continue. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Thank you Chair.  Now what was 
your impression of Mr Essa and Mr Singh’s relationship at 
this meeting? 
MR BESTER:  It was the most bizarre introduction I would 
say.  You must also recall that this is the first time that I 
actually had the – the privilege to be with Mr Singh in a 
meeting 
situation 
because 
he 
was 
just 
a 
name 
that 
10 
mentioned to us and it was just a name thrown around.  
Previously we were supposed to have a meeting with him 
which Mr Pita chaired and he did not even pitch.  So – you 
know so I – for me in my head it was anti-climax because Mr 
Singh was sitting there as I said very well dressed in a suit 
and tie and Mr Essa was controlling him.  And you know he 
was sitting there as if he can – almost as if he can only talk 
to us when he is allowed to talk.  It was very strange. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did it – did you get the impression that 
there was some subtle message that was being sent to Hatch 
20 
in one or another  
1. By the delay in paying the invoices and  
2. By the way this meeting was being handled and if so 
what was the impression or your impression of what 
message was being sent?  Or is that something that 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 97 of 222 
 
you did not get an answer [speaking over one another]. 
MR BESTER:  Chair I can only speculate but – so afterwards 
we had a meeting within Hatch to now debrief ourselves 
about this meeting.  And I think the conclusion was that we 
were very confused about the presence of this gentleman Mr 
Salim Essa which I also met for the first time and did not 
from a bar of soap. 
 
What also confused us a lot was his dress code 
which was very funny.  As I said previously and he sort of – 
he did not have the sort of – you know it does not – it did not 
10 
look like he sort of fitted in – into that discussion.  And we 
were confused about what message it actually was now 
going to – to be conveyed to us as Hatch people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in terms of what Mr Singh said are you 
able to remember whatever it is he said to say well during 
the meeting this is what he said?  Is there anything that you 
remember quite well that he said? 
MR BESTER:  Yes I can recall some information.  It was 
about Hatch embarking – ag Hatch apologies – Transnet 
embarking on this major projects.  The importance of supply 
20 
development and – you know there was a perception at 
Transnet at the time that we did not agree with supply 
development.   That they – Hatch had the resistance to 
supply development which was not the case.  It was hard 
supply 
development 
was 
introduced 
to 
us 
by 
other 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 98 of 222 
 
individuals.  So it was what we thought it was to – to tell us 
that we need to accept the supply development and this is 
going to be a major thing going forward for Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Bester on 
page 46 of your statement at paragraph 59 you then speak of 
a call that you received from Mr Reddy after – soon after this 
meeting.  Can you tell us about this call and what transpired 
thereafter? 
MR BESTER:  Yes.  So not long after this meeting that we 
10 
had with Mr Singh and Mr Essa in Melrose Arch I got a call 
from Mr Reddy informing me that Mr Essa would like to see 
me again as a follow up meeting to the meeting that we had 
if he can call it a meeting.  Which I discuss with Mr Allan 
Gray and Mr Sumption, Craig Sumption of Hatch at the time.  
And it was agreed that I would like – that I can attend the 
meeting just to listen what this gentleman was going to tell 
me because as I said at the time we had absolutely zero 
knowledge about this individual, his role.  All we knew is that 
it was a strange relationship with Transnet but it was agreed 
20 
that no harm in just going to listen to what he was going to 
say. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  And do you remember when this 
meeting was? 
MR BESTER:  I cannot remember exactly the exact date but 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 99 of 222 
 
I can remember exactly where the meeting was set up.  It 
was also in Melrose Arch at the restaurant.  If I can recall 
the restaurant’s name was JB’s corner I think. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay.  I just want to focus on 
trying to pin down an approximate date of this meeting.  If 
you go – you say that soon after this meeting which was the 
initial meeting and the initial meeting you said happened 
before Transnet advertised the phase 2 tender.  And if you 
look at page 43 at paragraph 53 we see that Transnet 
advertised the tender on the 24 April 2014.  Now would this 
10 
meeting have been after the advertisement? 
MR BESTER:  From what I recall definitely this meeting was 
after the tender was advertised yes. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay so it would have been after 
April 2015? 
MR BESTER:  Yes. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay continue. 
MR BESTER:  So this meeting was set up at – and by the 
way I got notice of this meeting or request for this meeting 
through Mr Dave Reddy who phoned me and said that Mr 
20 
Salim Essa would like to see me as a follow up.  And it was 
at a certain time and date was set and I went to this meeting 
at – at this location in Melrose Arch where I meet – I was 
met by Mr Dave Reddy and Mr Salim Essa. 
ADV 
SEGEELS-NCUBE: 
 
Was 
there 
anybody 
else 
in 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 100 of 222 
 
attendance? 
MR BESTER:  No.  Again it was just a little bit of a funny 
setup.  It is – I went into the restaurant and everybody knew 
Mr Salim Essa.  You know he was like a celebrity.  
Everybody greeting him.  There was a table set out for us on 
the stage if I can recall.  So it was only the three of us. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay and what transpired at that 
meeting?  What was being discussed? 
MR BESTER:  It – it was again a very irritating meeting for 
me personally because Mr Essa had a lot of cell phones with 
10 
him that was ringing the whole time and he was talking and 
standing up and walking around and I was sitting there very 
irritated I remember.  But when he was sitting down he told 
me that I – that we need to include him in our phase 2 tender 
for the manganese and he was talking about I recall asking 
him and what are you going to do?  And he – I remember 
recalling he told me I must not worry about that I must just 
include his company he will give me the name.  And if I – 
from what I can recall he also told me that I need to include 
him for R80 million to which I laughed or told him something 
20 
to – that he is – it is ridiculous.  I told him about – it is a 
competitive process.  I know exactly what the budgets and 
affordability of the project is you know how tight the budgets 
are – the business case that we have done and you know 
there is no error – room for errors to be made in the money.  
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 101 of 222 
 
And he just laughed at me he said, do not worry you include 
me for R80 million and I will grow that to something 
ridiculous I can recall over R300 million.  And he was loosely 
talking to me about money.  I – also when I spoke to him 
about the budget for the project he said to me I do not know 
what I am talking about.  He knows what – he know what the 
budget is and he will decide what the budget is going to be 
and where the project will end up.  And I basically know 
nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This was Mr Essa saying this? 
10 
MR BESTER:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now when he talked about you including 
his company was he talking about his company separate 
from Mr Reddy’s company and Mr… 
MR BESTER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Padayachee’s company? 
MR BESTER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it a different entity? 
MR BESTER:  Yes it was – he made it clear to me that it is 
his company.  He will give me the name. There is various 
20 
companies to choose from and I must not worry about what 
they are going to do.  I must just invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  And Mr Reddy was there? 
MR BESTER:  Mr Reddy was there he did not say a word he 
was just listening. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 102 of 222 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Now if we can just go to your 
statement because this is a very important meeting and I just 
want you to set out the full contents of what transpired.  At 
paragraph 63 you say that – which is on page 46 of your 
statement.  You say that – and this is now Mr Essa. 
“He insisted that we should include his 
company and said that they have a lot of 
power.” 
 
When did he say this during the meeting? 
10 
MR BESTER:  It would have been at the time when I told him 
he does not know what he is talking about and he was now 
trying to tell me that I do not know what I am talking about. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  And did he say who this “they” was 
that he was referring to? 
MR BESTER:  He did not go into the detail.  But he said to 
me I must not worry about the detail or about budgets.  I 
recall for instance he told me that they had already decided 
who is going to be the next CEO of Eskom.  And I will clearly 
see it when it happens that – what the power is that they 
20 
have and how they make decisions if I do not believe him. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  And who did he say that person 
would be? 
MR BESTER:  He said it is going to – they decided Mr Brian 
Molefe will be the CEO of Eskom. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 103 of 222 
 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  And this was all during that 
meeting? 
MR BESTER:  That is correct. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay now this … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We – we – this would have been after April 
2014 you said?   Did you say this meeting would have taken 
place after April 2014?  Mr Bester. 
MR BESTER:  That is correct, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was Mr Brian Molefe not already Group 
CEO of Transnet at that time? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  He said Eskom Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  He said Eskom.  That Mr Brian… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Eskom. 
MR BESTER:  Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he said they already knew who was 
going to be… 
MR BESTER:  Yes so at that time if I can recall Mr Brian 
20 
Molefe was the CEO of Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the time of the meeting? 
MR BESTER:  At the time of the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but what was the remark that Mr Salim 
Essa said about Group CEO or something? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 104 of 222 
 
MR BESTER:  He was convincing me that I do not know what 
I am talking about and he was trying to indicate the power 
that they have.  If I can recall at the time I could not recall 
the situation at Eskom.  But said to me, “you will see we 
have already decided that Mr Brian Molefe will be the next 
CEO of Eskom and when it gets announced you will see the 
power that we have.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  Yes thank you. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Thank you Chair.  Now the R80 
million that he initially spoke about was that part of the SD 
10 
component or would it be over and above the SD component 
according to your understanding? 
MR BESTER:  Well so his indicated was that we need to 
include the R80 million as part of the SD but what I – when I 
ask him what he is going to do for the R80 million 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  My apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I have been sitting here listening to 
evidence from different work streams so I am just thinking 
about this evidence that you are giving. 
20 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  No problem Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because Mr Brian Molefe ended up being 
seconded to Eskom was it 2015 – 2014?  Well I was hearing 
this evidence two weeks ago and so on.  So I am just 
wondering Mr Essa knows sometime while Mr Brian Molefe is 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 105 of 222 
 
at Transnet that Mr Brian Molefe is going to end up being 
CEO of Eskom and he is mentioning this to you kind of in 
passing and just to show you that he and whoever he was 
talking about had a lot of power. 
MR BESTER:  That is correct.  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had a lot of power. And we all know that 
ultimately Mr Molefe did end up being Group CEO of Eskom. 
MR BESTER:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BESTER:  He also mentioned to me if I can say? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BESTER:  At the meeting that with the power that they 
have they can do anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BESTER:  Because I told him that we are going to tender 
for this project.  It is a competitive bidding process so you 
know each and every cent counts.  And he said to me, no it 
is not the case.  If I – or Hatch at that stage include him in 
our submission they can change all the prices, they will 
make sure we get the job, they will grow the budgets and 
20 
they are in control. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what he said? 
MR BESTER:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes continue. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Thank you Chair.  On the R80 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 106 of 222 
 
million that you were referring to you say he then said it was 
going to increase to R350 million and then eventually to R2 
billion.  Was this in relation to phase 2 or the entire project – 
the entire MEP? 
MR BESTER:  So let me explain this to you.  So this 
specifically relates to phase 2.  So his R80 million that he 
referred to was what he wanted or his company.  And if I 
recall at the meeting he said over time he will make sure that 
they grow the R80 million to something like R350 million 
which was part of the SD let us say services.  But the overall 
10 
budget of the project at the time for let us call it the 
Engineering Procurement Construction Management as we 
call – refer to it EPCN was something like just over R1 billion 
and he mentioned to me they have already decided that they 
are going to grow that amount to over R2 billion. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  So you – so they would double it? 
MR BESTER:  Yes. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  For the entire project? 
MR BESTER:  That is correct. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  The entire. 
20 
MR BESTER:  So obviously they had other plans as well 
outside the R80 million that he was talking about. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  And what was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  At that stage what was your 
reaction to what this man was saying to you which if true 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 107 of 222 
 
would show you to have – would show him to have quite 
some very strong power? 
MR BESTER:  Chair I was disappointed and shocked so I 
told him – listen I did not say he is an idiot but I said to him 
he does not know what he is talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR BESTER:  And I have – I know what is going on in the 
project he does not know what he is talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  And just to put the R2 billion in 
10 
context.  At that stage what was Hatch’s proposal on phase 
2? 
MR BESTER:  Our phase 2 overall submission I think was 
just over R800 million. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay.  And do you know what it 
would have been in respect of – is that for rail and port on 
phase 2? 
MR BESTER:  Just the rail. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Just for rail? 
MR BESTER:  Just… 
20 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  And on port? 
MR BESTER:  If I can recall the budget for the port was 
something in the region of R750 million if I can recall. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay.  Now what did you do after 
that meeting this [00:25:12] meeting that you had attended? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 108 of 222 
 
MR BESTER:  Well I left the meeting obviously shocked.  
Went back to Hatch and I informed the management of Hatch 
of the meeting that transpired that would have been my 
immediate supervisor Mr Allan Gray at the time.  Mr Craig 
Sumption which was our Financial Officer in infrastructure.  
And then we also went to see out Managing Director Mr Rory 
Kirk. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Okay and what was decided would 
Hatch – what would Hatch approach be to this matter? 
MR BESTER:  Well it was important obviously that we share 
10 
this information with whoever in Hatch – our biggest – our 
management in Canada CEO as well.  So that information 
was also shared with our legal counsel which suggested 
everything that happened and transpired must be in a form of 
an affidavit and filed with our auditors.  And then we also 
informed Transnet and that would have been Ms Deirdre 
Strydom at the time. 
ADV 
SEGEELS-NCUBE:  
Okay and 
did 
you 
get any 
responses from them?  What were their reactions to you 
reporting this to them? 
20 
MR BESTER:  At the time I cannot recall the detail for our 
reporting to Transnet it was thank you for the reporting and I 
remember the feedback from Ms Strydom at the time was 
they will continue to look for avenues for us to share this 
information in the bigger Transnet but we should be careful 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 109 of 222 
 
to whom we share this information with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you follow that advice of Hatch’s 
counsel of deposing to an affidavit? 
MR BESTER:  Yes.  So Chair I did a complete affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Yes 
which 
detailed 
what 
had 
been 
[Speaking over one another]. 
MR BESTER:  If I recall the details it would have been filed 
with Ernst and Young. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BESTER:  Our auditors at the time. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But it recorded what had transpired 
at that meeting, is that right? 
MR BESTER:  So what – I went to the office.  I did a 
complete affidavit which I shared with our legal counsel and 
everybody had their input that that information and from the 
previous meeting with Mr Anoj Singh, Salim Essa.  And we 
were looking at our legal counsel to ensure that you know 
the 
information 
everything 
is 
above 
board 
for 
future 
purposes if it might be required in future.  So that was the 
advice that we got. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes but what I am interested in is 
whether if one were to find that affidavit and I do not know if 
it is here. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If one were to find that affidavit it would 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 110 of 222 
 
corroborate hat you have told me in terms of what was 
discussed or what was said by Mr Essa at that meeting. 
MR BESTER:  Chair if I can recall and my understanding is 
that there was a request put to Hatch to get that copy of that 
affidavit and the information.  I am not sure if a copy could 
have been obtained. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Do you what the position is? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Yes Chair the affidavit was not 
finalised and was never filed with Ernst and Young.  That is 
what 
we 
– 
the 
information 
that 
the 
commission’s 
10 
investigators received from Hatch when they enquired about 
the affidavit.  It was in draft form and never finalised and 
filed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. Is that your recollection Mr Bester that 
you never signed the affidavit or could that be a mistake? 
MR BESTER:  I would not have insight into that type of 
information for me I would have submitted that information to 
our legal counsel and then they would take care of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no but an affidavit ultimately you have 
to sign. 
20 
MR BESTER:  I have signed my affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did sign it. 
MR BESTER:  I did sign.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So I think that somebody needs to 
follow up maybe there is some misunderstanding. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 111 of 222 
 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  We will Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  We will get the investigators to 
follow up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it would be important.  That was 
an affidavit that was signed while everything was fresh I 
guess in your mind, is that correct? 
MR BESTER:  That is right.  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Do you have recollection of how long 
after this meeting you may have signed this affidavit or you 
10 
might not be able to say?  A few days, a few weeks, a few … 
MR BESTER:  Chair I think it was a very urgent matter for 
us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR BESTER:  So it would have been in that week at most. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That few days ja. 
MR BESTER:  After the event that we have… this affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  If there is in – there is a way 
in which you can assist and facilitate obtaining that affidavit 
that would be appreciated Mr Bester.  Okay alright. 
20 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Thank you Chair.  Chair I see that 
it is one o’clock.  It is an opportune time to take the lunch 
adjournment? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us take the lunch break we will 
resume at two o’clock. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 112 of 222 
 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  You may be seated Mr Bester.  Let 
us proceed.   
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Bester, just 
one more thing on the meeting that you had with Mr Essa 
where he had mentioned that Mr Molefe would in due course 
10 
be appointed the new CEO of Eskom.   
 
I know we were trying to pin down a date for that 
meeting but I think there is some more significance to it now.  
So if we could just try and get a better date other than...  
 
Because we know that the tender goes out on the 
27t h of April 2014 for Phase 2.  You say at that stage Hatch 
had already decided on its submissions.  Correct? 
MR BESTER:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   And it would have been before the 
award was made in November 2014.  But you know whether 
20 
it was more or less closer to April or November or 
somewhere in between? 
MR BESTER:   Chair, from what I can recall.  I think it was 
closer to the later date or the later date because Mr Essa 
mentioned that from the submitted tenders they can change 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 113 of 222 
 
the amount.   
 
And I cannot recall exactly the detail but it was an 
indication of it was near the date that we either already had 
submitted or it was close to the date that the tenders were 
supposed to close.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So would that mean it was closer towards 
the end of 2014 or closer? 
MR BESTER:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Closer to the end of 2014? 
MR BESTER:   That is correct, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  Is there a possibility that 
after that meeting with Mr Essa you might have sent emails 
to somebody within Hatch in which you talked about what 
had transpired. 
MR BESTER:   Yes, we can do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can find that or find those? 
MR BESTER:   That is right.  We can. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, we would appreciate that.  So apart 
from the affidavit if there are emails that you might be able 
to find which you sent to somebody within Hatch to say this 
20 
is what happened in my meeting with Mr Essa.  This is what 
he said.  That would be very helpful.   
MR BESTER:   Chair, we will try and do that, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Well, the remark by Mr Essa 
that Mr Molefe would be made Group CEO or CEO of Eskom 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 114 of 222 
 
is interesting because the CEO of Eskom would have left or 
his contract would have ended sometime during 2014 and 
with effect from 1 October 2014.   
 
There was a new Group CEO, Mr Matona who prior to 
that had been Director General of the Department of Public 
Enterprises.  But he did not stay long because in March, he 
and other executives of Eskom were suspended under 
circumstances that raise a lot of questions, to say the least.   
 
And he sought to go to court to challenge his suspension 
and wanted to come back.  But according to his evidence, he 
10 
was told by a board member of Eskom who was delegated 
together with two others to negotiate with him.   
 
That the question of him going back to his job at Eskom 
was out of the question.  So they could talk about money but 
not him going back.  That was March 2015.   
 
And he in a part been offered money and he left.  And 
two other executives, ultimately, also left and were offered 
some money.   
 
And Mr Brian Molefe was seconded to Eskom around 
April 2017.  April 17, 2015 from Eskom to ... from Transnet to 
20 
Eskom to be acting Group CEO.   
 
A few months later he was permanently appointed.  
Okay.  I was just mentioning that.  So it is interesting that in 
2014, towards the end of the year, Mr Essa said to you 
Mr Molefe would be the next group... CEO for Eskom.  Okay. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 115 of 222 
 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you, Chair.  Now Mr Bester, 
what ultimately happened with Hatch two tenders that they 
had submitted for Rail and Port for Phase 2? 
MR BESTER:   So specifically relating to Phase 2.  At the 
time, Hatch decided to not tender on their own but form a 
joint venture with two other major companies, called Arecon 
and Mott Macdonald.   
 
And strategically that was a decision made purely 
because looking at the size of the project, the number of 
people that would have been required to execute the project, 
10 
the skills that were available in South Africa at the time, 
specially relating to the Rail and Port, and understanding, 
you know, the amount of work that needs to be done of the 
two projects.  
 
It was best to just... for us and the strategy taken to go 
into a joint venture with two other companies which was a 
massive joint venture as you can imagine. 
 
And we tendered for both, for the rail and the port which 
was separately advertised.  But we were only informed that 
we were the preferred bidder for the rail. 
20 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Were you informed as to why you 
were not awarded the port contract? 
MR BESTER:   At the time, we have been told by some of the 
Transnet employees that although we were also the cheapest 
on the port project, Mr Anoj Singh decided that he is not 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 116 of 222 
 
going to award both projects to us. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   And do you know who was 
awarded the port contract? 
MR BESTER:   Yes.  The port project was awarded to a 
consortium called FLAG which also a three-way joint venture 
between Fluor, AECOM and GIBB. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay and insofar as Mr Reddy’s 
company is concerned.  What ultimately happened to his 
company? 
MR BESTER:   So for the Phase 2 what was decided 
10 
because Hatch now had this experience of the supply and 
development and we were now busy with Phase 1 executing 
and understanding how a supply and development works a 
little bit better.   
 
So the first thing, obviously, that Hatch did was to inform 
the other partners, the other two partners about what 
transpired during Phase 1 in terms of specific supply 
development partners.   
 
And it was decided that we will supply development 
slightly different in Phase 2 with the other companies 
20 
involved in that we are going to appoint what we called the 
LEAD Supply Development company and request that this 
company also form a joint venture of supply development 
companies.   
 
And they must manage themselves within our bigger 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 117 of 222 
 
contract as a supply development companies.  So Mr Dave 
Reddy and his company, DEC, was included in that joint 
venture.   
 
That joint venture was led by Mr Silo... I cannot recall 
his surname now.  But it was also an SD company that we 
asked that they have a similar contract.   
 
Obviously, a contract with themselves as a joint venture 
and then also a contract with us in terms of the scope of the 
work, the skills, the personnel and exactly how we are going 
to execute the works.   
10 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Well, what I am trying to 
understand is how a company, Mr Reddy’s company that you 
were forced by Transnet to include in Phase 1 and you 
successfully resisted that would end up on Phase 2.   
 
Was it at the behest of Hatch or how did it come about 
that his company ended up there, knowing the history of the 
introduction and him being told and him telling you under 
Phase 1 that he will participate in the project? 
MR BESTER:   No.  So what has happened.  So obviously as 
Hatch, we were hesitant to contract with this company.  But 
20 
what we did and as promised during Phase to Mr Dave 
Reddy, we will consider him for future work on our terms for 
a specific scope, et cetera.   
 
So one of our directors at Hatch at the time did a 
complete due diligence on this company, DEC which meant 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 118 of 222 
 
that 
they 
went 
to 
visit 
their 
office, 
understand 
their 
personnel, look at their skills, resources, et cetera.   
 
So that information was conveyed to the other partners 
in our joint venture.  Everything was above board and 
transparent and how we communicated that.   
 
So it was obviously within a controlled environment that 
we said that under the terms under the guidance of this 
LEAD supply development company, they could include 
Mr Dave Reddy but it was under their control. 
 
And it was for a specific scope and conforming to the 
10 
fees as per the percentages agreed with Transnet.  So we 
were comfortable with that arrangement.   
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   So when the due diligence on 
Mr Reddy’s company was done, what was it found was the 
skills that his company would be able to contribute on this 
project insofar as the rail phase is concerned? 
MR BESTER:   Well, the due diligence was basically such 
that firstly establish that he has got an office.  Secondly that 
he has got some personnel in the office.  And then looking at 
the type of projects that they were doing at the time and the 
20 
type of personnel.   
 
And then, obviously, because our projects was so big.  
You must understand that our total tendered amount for 
Phase 2 was in the order of, let us say, R 800 million.   
 
Now 30% percent of R 800 million is between R 200 and 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 119 of 222 
 
R 300 million rand.  To find companies at that time to do that 
amount of work was quite a big task.   
 
So for that reason it was decided that we collect all the 
names that we have available, aware of at the time that is in 
the market and the skills that the companies had.   
 
And that, if I can recall for Mr Reddy’s company at the 
time, the specific skills that his company had was for pure 
civil engineering.   
 
So we decided that we can include him and his 
personnel under that SD umbrella to execute that scope. 
10 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  So in the period of less 
than a year, his company went from not having the required 
skill set to participate in Phase 1 to now Hatch being 
comfortable under Phase 2 that he had the skill set or was 
there other factors taking into consideration? 
MR BESTER:   No.  No, remember, it was never because of 
his skill sets that we not included him in Phase 1.  It was the 
manner in which they arrived at our offices and perceived 
intel information that they have form Transnet.   
 
And on the exclusive basis that they wanted us to use 
20 
them on the Phase 1 Project.  So it was never about the 
actual skill sets that they had that we did not include them. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   So insofar as he had indicated 
under Phase 1 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 120 of 222 
 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  You were uncomfortable 
previously with them partly because they appeared to have 
information that you considered they should not be having? 
MR BESTER:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And they appeared to have a relationship 
with Mr Singh.  Is that correct?  That did not sit comfortable 
with you.  Is that right? 
MR BESTER:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why had that discomfort gone away now? 
10 
MR BESTER:   No, Chair I think the discomfort was always 
there.  We have shared now that information to our two other 
partners which was Mott Macdonald and Arecon.   
 
And they indicated that they would be comfortable if he 
was included under a controlled environment because there 
was nothing untoward at that stage, you know, that was not 
above board for him to be included.   
 
So we still had as Hatch, obviously, we still had that 
history and nothing has gone away in terms of the feeling 
that we had and the perception that we had about the intel 
20 
and the events that played off before that time.   
 
Everything was shared with the other partners but it was 
decided because of the quantum of the work, the amount of 
people that we need we will probably needed all those 
smaller companies to participate and it will be in a very 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 121 of 222 
 
controlled environment.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, you would have been aware, 
would you not, that anyone who knew that you had not 
included them before because of this discomfort but now you 
had included them even though the discomfort may still have 
been 
there, 
might 
have 
had 
the 
perception 
that 
...[intervenes]  
MR BESTER:   Ja, Chair I have to tell you.  In tendering for 
Phase 2 and that was quite a lengthy process in which we 
would have sat every day with our partners in a boardroom 
10 
environment, calculating what our fees would be, the number 
of people that we are going to use, what we can pay them in 
terms of an hourly rate, et cetera.   
 
So when it came to the final amount, exact amount, 
which I do not have the moment but it was in the order of 
R 800 million.   
 
And when you calculate that supply and development 
component of that.  That is a fixed amount.  There is no 
room for manoeuvre to do anything other than execute work 
for that and add the value to that percentage.   
20 
 
So we felt comfortable that we got that under control, at 
least from the Hatch perspective.  That information was 
shared and everybody felt with the contract and the people 
that we have got for management, that everything was above 
board. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 122 of 222 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the meantime, your outstanding 
invoices had they been paid? 
MR BESTER:   Chair, I think it was a continuous struggle to 
get money out of Transnet.  I cannot say, sitting in the 
meetings with Hatch that invoices were paid then promptly 
as per contract.  I remember it was a continuous struggle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I was saying that somebody who got 
to know what your attitude had been before towards them, 
towards including them and so that subsequently that you 
included them in this one, may have thought or may have the 
10 
perception that you might have decided to say:  Let us work 
with them because maybe...   
MR BESTER:   Ja, Chair I do not, honestly, our think process 
would not have been in that range. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR BESTER:   For us it was about the project, the value add 
and the manner to which we had control over these people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR BESTER:   And it was very ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You remember I asked you before lunch at 
20 
some stage whether you had any impression of what 
message Mr Salim Essa and Mr Singh may have been...  
 
Well, Mr Singh may have been trying to convey with the 
delays in paying your invoices and with the manner in which 
the meeting, which involved Mr Essa, was handled.   
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 123 of 222 
 
 
It may be that it was not this but it may have been a way 
of saying:  Well, if you do not accommodate us, we will make 
things difficult for you.  Getting payment from us, from 
Transnet might be difficult.   
 
Did you think about that or anybody within Hatch? 
MR BESTER:   Chair, I am pretty much within Hatch, no.  It 
might have been from the other companies.  And at the time, 
you know, Transnet was quite a major client and provider of 
work.  So it might have been.  I do not know.  It is difficult 
...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because even, from what you have 
described to me in terms of the meeting with Mr Singh and 
Mr Essa.  You have used the word in your statement.  It was 
a bizarre meeting.   
 
It does look quite strange.  It does look like there is a 
subtle message that was being sent to you.  What it is might 
be something else but you ask for a meeting with Mr Singh.   
 
You come to this meeting.  Somebody else that you have 
never met and you have never spoken to take charge of the 
meeting.  And Mr Singh has very little to say. 
20 
MR BESTER:   Yes, I agree with you.  There was 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You get the impression that this person 
that you do not know is in charge. 
MR BESTER:   For sure. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 124 of 222 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then that person follows up after that 
with a request to have a follow-up meeting with you.  Now 
Mr Singh is no longer there but he, he comes, I think with 
Mr Reddy.   
 
He comes with Mr Reddy.  So you have kind of seen 
what relationship he seems to have with Mr Singh at that 
meeting.   
 
Now he comes with somebody else and he makes certain 
demands to you.  Payment of your invoices continues to be a 
struggle.   
10 
 
It may be that there was no message but when one 
analyses the whole behaviour, it may well have been there 
was a message.   
 
So when you begin to bring Mr Reddy in or to bring them 
in, somebody might think that they were succeeding in 
getting you to get in, even if deep down in your heart, it 
actually would prefer to do without them, you know.  So.  But 
it might be an unfair suspicion. 
MR BESTER:   Chair, I can understand what you are saying.  
I agree.  For us, clearly in hindsight, there was a message 
20 
from Mr Singh as to why he felt comfortable that a person 
from outside Transnet would sit in a meeting with us which 
was totally not acceptable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR BESTER:   And then also some of the events that 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 125 of 222 
 
followed, if I can mention that, when we were successful with 
Phase 2 on the rail, we had a small function that we 
arranged where we invited some of the senior people at 
Transnet just to celebrate this big award to us.   
 
And Mr Singh was also invited and he was very 
aggressive with us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that so? 
MR BESTER:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja.  Yes, you may continue. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Bester, at 
10 
the time when Hatch had now satisfied itself that Mr Reddy’s 
company could be included in Phase 2 as an SD partner.  
What projects were you aware of at the time that his 
company had been involved and then successfully executed? 
MR BESTER:   I cannot recall that detail.  All I can recall is 
that one of our colleagues at Hatch would have been looked 
at his offices and the skill sets and the type of projects that 
they were involved with at the time.   
 
Because remember, many of these, if not all these 
supply development companies did not necessarily have the 
20 
skills at the time or none of them would have had the skills.  
All the people, neither the people at the time.   
 
So it was up to us, the bigger consultants and 
contractors and suppliers as the objective of supply and 
development to grow the skills and resources of these 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 126 of 222 
 
companies and transfer a mentor that those people of those 
companies.   
 
So it was merely to understand if the companies exist.  
If there were offices.  And in fact, if they either have or had 
access to people to do some work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hold on one second.  Please continue. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Now if I remember correctly when 
we were dealing with Phase 1, you said that in your 
discussion with Mr Reddy he said:  Do not worry.  We have 
got engineers.  We can get them from India.   
10 
 
And your response to him was, supply development is 
not about empowering companies in India.  It is about a 
South African initiative.   
 
So at that stage had you under Phase 2, had you 
satisfied yourself that he now had the necessary skill set 
that was going to be within South Africa?  Because we are 
talking about less than a year between the two. 
MR BESTER:   That is correct.  So I must just remind you 
also that for Phase 2 and the supply development companies 
that we had.  I would doubt it that Mr Reddy’s company had 
20 
to supply more than one or two resources.  I would think and 
thinking back, I think most of the resources came from the 
other companies that I can recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did that arrangement mean that Reddy’s 
company could be getting paid for doing very little?  Maybe 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 127 of 222 
 
being paid more than what it was doing in terms of being 
able to supply resources or not necessarily? 
MR BESTER:   Mr Chair, no that would have been impossible 
because people were paid to the resources that were in the 
office and the actual worked performed and how the project 
was set up and recorded and the work that they did.  The 
output was related to the value add.  So it... there was no 
inflated values managed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR BESTER:   It was not possible at all. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   If anybody did little work, they would be 
paid little, effectively. 
MR BESTER:   Yes, they would. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you, Chair.  Just following 
on the Chair’s question.  Out of the amount that was 
allocated to the SD partners.  Do you know what proportion 
went to Mr Reddy’s company? 
MR BESTER:   I do not know. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  Would it be fair to say that 
20 
it is difficult Mr Bester to reconcile your reluctance under 
Phase 1 to work with Mr Reddy’s company and him ultimately 
ending up in your Phase 2 tender submissions?  Would it be 
fair to say that it is difficult to put the two together? 
MR BESTER:   I cannot agree with that statement because, 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 128 of 222 
 
you know, from our perspective we would have made 
hundred percent sure that how we do business and who we 
contracting with, was totally above board.   
 
So yes.  What happened in Phase 1, as I said again, 
how the individuals arrived at our offices and the perception 
that was created was not acceptable to us purely form how 
we do business.   
 
And then recovering from that position onto Phase 2 
where we had a better understanding of supply development, 
having done our own due diligence and how we can control 
10 
the payments to these supply development companies.   
 
I mean, we were comfortable that everything was above 
board. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  Now when one goes back 
to the 15 July 2013 meeting between Mr Basson, Mr Bierman 
and Mr Singh, where Mr Singh makes the request to Mr 
Basson and Mr Bierman to profile MMQS and DEC to 
participate in this project.   
 
At the end of the day, what we then have is that MMQS 
does participate via Hatch on Phase 1 and DEC does 
20 
participate via Hatch on Phase 2.   
 
So when one looks at it, Mr Singh actually got what he 
had asked Mr Basson and Mr Bierman to investigate right at 
the outset.  Would you agree with that? 
MR BESTER:   No, I... purely from your statement, I would 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 129 of 222 
 
agree from what you are saying on face value.  But I think 
having... or you have to understand what the original intend 
was from Mr Singh to profile his companies or create the 
impression that they have been profiled.   
 
And what his reason would have been to include them 
and 
having 
had 
the 
meeting 
with 
Mr 
Salim 
Essa, 
understanding how he wanted to inflate the contract value.  I 
think that would have been, you know, are not...  
 
That would have been the wrong decision to include 
them on that basis but we did not include them on that basis.   
10 
 
I mean, we include them purely for the resources and 
the work that needed to be done.  There was a total different 
agenda behind it in the first place to include these 
companies which was different towards the end why we 
included them. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   But you will also accept that they 
were both companies that you had never previously worked 
with.  And in fact, when you were dealing with Phase 1, I 
took you through all the FD companies that participated on 
behalf of Hatch as SD partners.  And MM was the one 
20 
company that Hatch had never worked with before. 
MR BESTER:   That is correct. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Do you agree with that?  And 
similarly, under phase 2, DEC was not a company that you 
had previously worked with. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 130 of 222 
 
MR BESTER:   Not as Hatch but one of our other partners 
have worked with DEC before. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay, so between what period?  
After phase one?  After July 2013 when Padayachee and 
Reddy approach you and between the award of phase two 
did one of the companies work in that period that year? 
MR BESTER:   Not necessarily in that period.  It might 
have been before that period because when the issue was 
raised with the other companies there was a comment 
made by one of the directors of Mott MacDonald that they 
10 
know this individual and they had worked with them before.  
So before might mean a long time before or recently. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Oh, okay, so when you say one 
of the companies you mean one of the JV parties? 
MR BESTER:   That is right. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay, which would have been 
Mott MacDonald. 
MR BESTER:  That is correct.  
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  So Mott MacDonald has 
worked with DEC. 
20 
MR BESTER:   That is correct. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  And do you know what 
that project was? 
MR BESTER:   No, I cannot recall.  You have to do some 
research on that but if I can recall a discussion that took 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 131 of 222 
 
place at the time and if you understand the history of Mott 
MacDonald in South Africa, it was - Mott MacDonald is an 
international company that had actually acquired a local 
company called PD Naidoo and Associates at the time and 
from what I understood from one of the directors from Mott 
MacDonald at the time is that Mr Dave Reddy was actually 
in fact part of PD Naidoo and Associates at that time prior 
to the acquisition from Mott MacDonald of PD Naidoo and 
Associates. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay but Mr Reddy’s company 
10 
was not introduced as an SD partner on phase two via Mott 
MacDonald, it was via Hatch. 
MR BESTER:   No.  So what happened, is the JV came 
together, three companies, and they would have shared 
between 
the 
three 
companies 
all 
the 
names 
of 
SD 
companies that they were aware of, so obviously Hatch 
was aware of DEC with the interactions that they had 
during phase one and that name would have been shared 
with the other companies and in one of those meetings the 
decision would have been mainly to find we can work with 
20 
this company or his company because we know those 
individual and we have worked with him before. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Yes, that is what I am trying to 
drive at.  Who put his name on that list?  Was it on the 
Hatch list or the Mott MacDonald list as one of the 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 132 of 222 
 
companies that would be considered? 
MR BESTER:   Unfortunately I cannot recall exactly if it 
was because of Hatch or because of Mott MacDonald, it 
was one of the two companies, I cannot recall, sorry. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay and what happened to 
MMQS on phase two? 
MR BESTER:   I do not think at the end they were part of 
the SD companies that was considered.  It might have been 
that one of the supply development companies, maybe this 
specifically this company Sello, which was the lead person 
10 
for this prior development which was put forward by Mott 
MacDonald.  I might have been that they are in fact a 
quantity surveying company and felt that they do not need 
another quantity surveying company to help. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   But do you know if MMQS was 
suggested by any one of the JV partners as being on the 
list to be considered? 
MR BESTER:    I speak under correction but that would 
have been one of the names that obviously that Hatch has 
put forward because at the time it was one of the 
20 
companies that worked with us on phase one. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  Now when we get to the 
contract negotiations on phase two at page 50 of your 
statement from paragraph 72, can you just tell us about 
what transpired during the contract negotiations and in 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 133 of 222 
 
your statement you specifically deal with McKinsey’s 
involvement. 
MR BESTER:   Yes.  So we were informed by Transnet 
officially that we are the preferred bidder on the rail 
portion of the 60 million tons expansion project and we 
were invited to attend tender or contract finalisation 
negotiations at a site away from the Transnet offices.  
 
So the purpose of these negotiations was to clarify 
some of the assumptions made in the tender or the 
uncertainties that was there for either us or Transnet 
10 
because we would have had a cover letter where certain 
assumptions were made and that needed some clarification 
prior to the contract signature. 
 
And every day - the contract negotiations properly 
went on for one month where every day we would go to this 
venue and then there would be a representative at least of 
each of the JV companies from Hatch, Mott MacDonald and 
Orecon plus support people like planners, cost estimators 
and other commercial people with us.  Myself, I was the 
project director designate and then there was the project 
20 
directors from the Transnet side, the project managers 
from Transnet Freight Rail side, the supply development 
leads from Transnet, their commercial people and every 
day we had a full agenda of discussions about items that 
needed to be clarified.  
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 134 of 222 
 
 
So yes, it was during one of these meetings that 
myself noticed that there were some cables running from 
microphones like this on the carpet to underneath the door 
outside to another boardroom.   
 
So I enquired about this, I think it was during the 
one of the lunch sessions that I asked a commercial lead 
from Transnet Capital Projects, Mrs Corli Janse van 
Rensburg, what are these cables?  Where are they going?  
I am going to go and check what is going on in the other 
boardroom and then she said to us I am not allowed to go 
10 
in there because there is McKinsey people in the room. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She said there is McKinsey, doing what? 
MR BESTER:   Yes, so we enquired, I mean, we were upset 
because that was not – we were not informed about this.  
Firstly, we were not informed that all negotiations were 
taped or recorded which we had no problem with but we 
were not informed that that is in fact happening and 
secondly, we were not informed that there is a room full of 
McKinsey people sitting next door.  So we asked what is 
the purpose of McKinsey people?   So if I can recall, at the 
20 
time we were told that McKinsey was appointed separately 
from us to oversee independently the contract, that was an 
appointment made directly by Mr Anoj Singh, they did not 
have full insight into exactly what their scope of work was 
and exactly what they do and how they do it but every day 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 135 of 222 
 
there was apparently a debrief of themselves to McKinsey 
and McKinsey to them about what happening during the 
day, the negotiations and then discussion about the next 
day, what should be asked and how it should be asked.  So 
that was told to us. 
ADV 
SEGEELS-NCUBE: 
 
 
And 
had 
that 
previously 
happened 
to 
you 
in 
any 
negotiations 
with 
Transnet 
previously? 
MR BESTER:   Well, previously not during negotiations.  In 
fact, that was the first time that we had this intense 
10 
negotiations with Transnet because of the pure size of the 
contract and the value that was involved but McKinsey was 
always 
involved 
in 
projects 
that 
we 
were 
doing 
for 
Transnet, yes. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  And at some point in your 
statement at paragraph 73 you talk about Mr Edward 
Thomas.  Who was Mr Edward Thomas and can you just tell 
us what transpired with him? 
MR BESTER:   So Mr Edward Thomas, I could not exactly 
understood his role but we understood that he reported to 
20 
Mr 
Gary 
Pita 
and 
that 
he 
had 
to 
do 
with 
supply 
development and I recall during one of the meetings he 
was very aggressive with us about our percentages and the 
partners 
that 
we 
use 
or 
do 
not 
use 
and 
it 
was 
…[intervenes] 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 136 of 222 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who was that who was aggressive? 
MR BESTER:   Mr Edward Thomas. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR BESTER:   And in fact it was during this meeting that I 
decided that we should pack our bags and leave the 
negotiations. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay, why did you decide that? 
MR BESTER:   Because the attitude of Mr Thomas was 
very negative and he was very aggressive.  You know in 
fact I think he stood up and shouted at us and I said to the 
10 
other members of my team and the directors or the other 
companies that, you know, we should not listen to this 
unprofessional behaviour, let us go and we packed our 
bags and we left. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   And you also speak in your 
statement during the contract negotiations of an encounter 
with Mr Vilele Sikusane(?).  Can you tell us about that? 
MR BESTER:   That is correct, yes.  So, as I understood it 
at the time he was newly appointed to Transnet specifically 
for this project and he was also one of the individuals that 
20 
was very aggressive and vocal during negotiations and he 
also at one of the negotiations made a very funny remark.  
I cannot recall the exact details, it was something to the 
effect of give us 25% discount and then we will consider 
your contract and, you know – so at the time we thought it 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 137 of 222 
 
was an insult because we spent literally millions preparing 
this document and tender for Transnet.  We know each and 
every cent how it is going to be spent and then requesting 
that type of discount from us had no respect for the input 
that we made.  
 
So I recall he actually phoned me that evening and 
he was very aggressive, he used very bad words, told me I 
had better do as they say.  Ja. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:     And what was Mr Pita’s 
demeanour in these negotiations? 
10 
MR BESTER:   Mr Pita was actually not involved in 
negotiations, 
Mr 
Pita 
only 
became 
involved 
in 
the 
negotiations after we actually left the negotiations.  We got 
a phone call from a procurement lead from Transnet 
Capital Projects at the time, Mrs Corli Janse van Rensburg, 
I think that is after we had – I cannot recall the exactly 
details but let us say we were not present there for a few 
days.  She called me and said can we please come back 
and then when we arrived there Mr Pita was there. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  And did you have any 
20 
interactions with him? 
MR BESTER:   The interactions there was – he asked us 
just to calm down because we told him that, you know, we 
are quite prepared to walk away from this contract the way 
it is going, the demands that is being made, the phone 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 138 of 222 
 
calls that we get, the unprofessional behaviour and we 
were quite prepared to walk away.   
And the discussion at the time from us would have 
been in the vein of, you know, we also then knew at that 
stage that our tender amount for the rail alone was 
something R150 million cheaper or less than the second 
bidder so we knew that it is going to be - you know, there 
is going to be some big explanations in Transnet if we walk 
away for some or other reason that they cannot explain 
and why they need to then go and award the contract to 
10 
the second highest bidder.  So he was trying to calm us 
down. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay, you also speak about Mr 
Singh’s attitude towards the JV.  Can you just give us more 
detail on that? 
MR BESTER:    Yes, as I explained to you – so eventually 
we got to a point where we agreed on most of the terms 
and Transnet decided to award the contract to us.   They 
gave us a letter that – I cannot remember the detail of the 
wording of the letter but it would have been something that 
20 
the contract is now concluded and it is the intention to 
award the contract to our joint venture.   
It was during that time that we had two interactions 
with him.  The one was where we arranged a small function 
to celebrate the success and I can clearly remember that 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 139 of 222 
 
also during that time we had a new managing director for 
Hatch in Africa which would have attended the meeting 
with myself or the function and Mr Singh came and he 
made a short speech and it was very aggressive and 
negative towards our consortium.   
It was a very short speech and strange and then he 
walked out and, you know, even our newly appointed MD 
asked me what is this about because we came here for 
celebration and then we go this very negative words from 
the CFO from Transnet. 
10 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   What did you think his attitude 
towards you was about? 
MR BESTER:   At the time I think it was a mixed bag of 
feelings from his side because obviously what happened 
during phase one was not to his liking and the fact that we 
met with him and Mr Essa in Melrose Arch where has sort 
of, in my words, reporting to Mr Essa.  You know, I think in 
his own head he was trying to think what I think or what we 
think of the situation and he was just very aggressive I 
think if things did not go his way and he did not like it. 
20 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay.  Now …[intervenes] 
MR BESTER:   Oh sorry and then of course there was a -  
then a second interaction with him is where he invited 
myself and the two other directors from the other two 
companies to the Carlton Centre where we actually signed 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 140 of 222 
 
the contract and again he – I cannot remember the exact 
words but it was foul language that he used, you know, it – 
the language and the moment did not add up.  It was a 
time to say congratulations, we are looking forward to work 
with you, type of thing, and it was definitely not like that. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay and then during the 
execution 
of 
the 
phase 
two 
project 
what 
was 
your 
impression of McKinsey and your interactions with them? 
MR BESTER:   You see, ja, I mean prior to the manganese 
and even in the studies leading up to the manganese 
10 
project there was a lot of interactions with McKinsey.  As I 
indicated to you, all the projects that we did McKinsey was 
present and always we would ask the Transnet people what 
they were doing and nobody could answer us indicating 
that McKinsey was not appointed by them but – or a 
competitive tendering process, McKinsey was appointed 
directly by Anoj Singh.  I remember one stage I was even 
told that the CEO of Transnet Freight Rail does not even 
know about some of the appointments of McKinsey and at 
the time it was Siyabonga Gama and I was told that Mr 
20 
Gama does not agree on some of these appointments with 
Mr Singh. 
 
So the interactions was always a very strange 
interaction because we had no direct interaction with them 
but it was strange because we would have been the 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 141 of 222 
 
technical people on the project requiring some feedback to 
Transnet and we were never invited to give feedback to 
Transnet it was always McKinsey that had to go and give 
feedback to Transnet on our behalf, we did not even know 
what the feedback is that they were given. 
ADV 
SEGEELS-NCUBE: 
 
 
Did 
you 
know 
what 
role 
McKinsey was to play on the project? 
MR BESTER:   I was told that – well, first of all I was told 
that their appointment on this specific project was in 
excess of R300 million.  I was told that they have an 
10 
oversight role and the exact scope of that detail and what 
they need to do for that money, the Transnet people could 
not tell us.  In fact the Transnet people told us they were 
also not part of what McKinsey doing, they were only told 
that McKinsey is going to be on the project. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Now would you have expected 
from a company that is playing an oversight role on this 
project? 
MR BESTER:   Well, for us an oversight role would have 
been to understand, you know, the work that we do, to 
20 
understand our processes and procedures and to match the 
effort that we have in executing the project to the output, 
to have some involvement in our invoices and how that 
relates to the deliverables that we put on the table, the 
scope of work, the tracking of the project and the progress 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 142 of 222 
 
with where we are in terms of the invoicing.  And I can 
remember at some stage we did a value engineering 
exercise to see how we can further cut cost on the 
manganese in terms of the actual spending of the capital 
spending and we were assessing with McKinsey and I can 
clearly recall we were asked the most embarrassing simple 
questions about the project which we thought is of 
technical people that does not understand what the project 
was 
about. 
 
For 
us 
it 
was 
also 
a 
very 
– 
a 
big 
disappointment at the time. 
10 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   So, in other words, what you 
would have expected a company that is playing an 
oversight role to know? 
MR BESTER:   Yes. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Okay. 
MR BESTER:   So at least expect exactly to know the 
detail of the project and what needed to be done but, you 
know, it is – if you understand well engineering and the 
type of work that we did at the time, the [indistinct] 20.51 
simulations and how that relates to the rolling stock which 
20 
is the power and the amount that needs to be bought and 
how everything comes together and, you know, for us, 
McKinsey could not put those elements together. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Had you done similar projects before?  
Had you been involved in the same type of work before, 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 143 of 222 
 
Hatch? 
MR BESTER:   We have done a lot of these projects. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR BESTER:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it normal for there to be somebody 
appointed to perform an oversight role while you were 
doing a job like this? 
MR BESTER:   No.  It was the first time for us that we 
had… 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
to 
somebody 
supervising 
10 
…[intervenes] 
MR BESTER:   Other side consultants looking after us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Do you know whether they had – 
McKinsey had the qualifications and experience to play 
that role in regard to this type of work or is that something 
you did not know? 
MR BESTER:   Chair, to be honest with you, the 
interactions that I personally had with the McKinsey people 
at the time during the execution of the manganese project 
and what they told me their qualifications were was not 
20 
technical, it was more financial and commercial.  I recall at 
some stage they told us that they are going to use a rail 
expert, I could not recall from which company, but it was 
also not applicable to the South Africa rail conditions and 
the type of rail that we use. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 144 of 222 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you, Chair.  That is the 
evidence of Mr Bester unless Chair has any further 
questions for him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much, Mr Bester, you do 
recall you have some homework to do for the Commission 
in terms of emails and the affidavit. 
MR BESTER:   Yes, I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the legal team and the investigators 
would also be following up but do have a look and see 
10 
what you can find.  There may have been some emails that 
you sent to colleagues soon after that meeting with Mr 
Essa and Mr Reddy and also, there may have been some 
emails that you may have sent to colleagues when you 
heard the announcement of Mr Brian Molefe as Group CEO 
of Eskom.  You might have seen somebody messaged to 
say oh, so Mr Essa was right, or something like that.  So 
do look for such emails and if they exist, they might assist.  
Thank you very much, you are now excused. 
MR BESTER:   Thank you, Chair.  Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Thank you, Chair.  Chair, the 
next witness is Ms Deidre Strydom and Mr Myburgh will be 
leading her evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you.  Do you need five 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 145 of 222 
 
minutes to move things around or not really? 
ADV SEGEELS-NCUBE:   Yes please, Chair.  I am

MS STRYDOM:   So help me God. 
DEIDRE STRYDOM:   [duly sworn, states] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You might wish to sit on the other chair 
Ms Diedericks for the convenience because that’s the mic 
that works I think.  Yes you may proceed.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:      Thank you Mr Chairman.   Ms 
Strydom you have open in front of you Exhibit 20, could I 
ask you please to turn to page 133, do you confirm that 
that is the beginning of your affidavit? 
10 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And could you then please turn 
forward to the end of that affidavit which you find at page 
157, is that your signature? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And did you depose to this affidavit 
under oath on the 9 t h of October this year, 2020? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Attached to this affidavit are eight 
annexures, commencing with Annexure DS1 at page 159 
20 
and ending with Annexure DS ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Myburgh, I didn’t hear Ms 
Strydom respond, I think her voice is very soft, did you 
confirm that it is your the first signature on page 157 is 
your signature?      
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 147 of 222 
 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright try and raise your voice. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So Ms Strydom what you need to do, 
one is to raise your voice and secondly when you answer 
the questions don’t look at me, look at the Chairperson, 
you are addressing him, I am just a bystander, alright.   
 
So Annexure DS1 you find at 159 and Annexure DS8 
you find the conclusion of your annexures at page 217, 
would you confirm that? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright let us go back to the 
beginning of your affidavit, I just want you to confirm that 
you testified here this afternoon under subpoena issued by 
the Commission? 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now if I could take you please to 
paragraph 5, what is your current position at Transnet? 
MS STRYDOM:   I am currently an Executive Manager in 
Strategy 
and 
Planning, 
Group 
Strategy 
and 
Planning 
Department within the Capital Development function 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And it seems from paragraph 6 that 
you have been employed by Transnet for a long time, 
commencing in 1991, is that so? 
MS STRYDOM:   Absolutely. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
You 
set 
out 
in 
paragraph 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 148 of 222 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It probably was your first job? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You set out in paragraph 7 all 14 
different 
positions 
that 
you 
have 
held 
at 
Transnet 
commencing as a researcher, if you look at page 136 
paragraph 7.1 rising up as we see at paragraph 7.1 to the 
Executive Manager position that you have described. 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Paragraph 7.3 and 7.4 there you 
10 
held 
the 
position 
of 
Programme 
Director 
Manganese 
Expansion and then Executive Manager Strategy and Long 
Term Planning Capital Expansion Project  Are those the 
two positions that you held during the time that is relevant 
to 
your 
evidence, 
when 
you 
were 
involved 
in 
the 
Manganese Expansion Project. 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there an error in that heading that 
refers to Expansation, Manganese Expansation Project. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes I see. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It should be Expansion, is that correct 
Ms Strydom, just above paragraph 9? 
MS STRYDOM:   Above paragraph? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just above paragraph 9 of your affidavit. 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes, that is an error, it has to be. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 149 of 222 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, so let us deal – thank you 
Chairperson, let us deal with the Manganese Expansion 
Project which we know goes by the acronym MEP, and you 
start off by dealing with your role.  Now you have already 
told the Chairperson that you were appointed as Executive 
Manager in TRF Strategy and Long Term Planning, that is a 
role that you held during the MEP is that so? 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And in a nutshell what did you 
10 
responsibilities include, what did the role involve, what did 
position entail, things that you deal with in paragraph 9, 10 
and 11? 
MS STRYDOM:   The position entailed scoping and 
development of various capital expansion initiatives for 
Transnet including the MEP or Manganese Expansion 
Programme, Waterberg Expansion Programme and Eskom 
Programme.  In this role I was a Transnet Freight Rail 
owners representative as projects of this nature typically 
was handled by Transnet Capital Projects, especially 
20 
where there were multi-divisional project, so therefore Rail 
and Port projects involved.    
 
I had no commercial delegation in this role as the 
commercial authority resided with TCP. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then at paragraph 13 you deal with 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 150 of 222 
 
the make-up of the MEP Steering Committee, who sat on 
that committee Ms Strydom? 
MS STRYDOM:   The Steering Committee comprised of Mr 
Anoj Singh, Mr Siyabonga Gama, who was the Chief 
Executive of TFR amongst others and then also the other 
operating division Chief Executives. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you mention in that paragraph 
that the steering committee endorsed the creation of the 
position that you then came to hold, that of programme 
director.  Is that correct? 
10 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You mention over the page that you 
were then appointed into that position and we know from 
your CV set out at paragraph 7 that that was during 
November 2014, do you confirm that? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes I confirm that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And in that position of programme 
director to whom did you initially report? 
MS STRYDOM:   I initially reported to Anoj Singh and was 
subsequently reassigned to report Mr Mohamed Mohamedy 
20 
who 
was 
heading 
up 
Group 
Capital 
Information 
and 
Assurance at that stage, which was a department that Anoj 
Singh created roundabout end of 2011. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And essentially what was your role 
in this position of programme director, was it different to 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 151 of 222 
 
the one that you had occupied before? 
MS STRYDOM:   It was similar in that I had to finalise the 
preparation of the integrated business case, and then also 
prepare the business case for approvals through the 
necessary 
approving 
committees, 
through 
to 
the 
Department of Public Enterprises which was the approving 
authority 
according 
to 
the 
delegation 
of 
authority 
framework 
that 
Transnet 
had 
from 
a 
...[indistinct] 
perspective at that point. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And that we know goes by the 
10 
acronym of DPE. 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   At paragraph 15 you deal with 
McKinsey, could you describe please to the Chairperson 
your involvement and experience with McKinsey and it is a 
topic that we return to later in your affidavit. 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes McKinsey right throughout my 
involvement in the Manganese Expansions was heavily 
involved in the project, in all elements of scrubbing the 
project, so looking at the costs of the project, they also 
20 
were involved in describing the role of the programme 
director, which was a new role in Transnet and then they 
were also involved in assisting with the development of the 
business case.   Ja, so all aspects of the project, 
commercial execution, they were involved in. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 152 of 222 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And who was McKinsey appointed 
by, to whom did they report? 
MS STRYDOM:   They were appointed by Anoj Singh, they 
reported into the Group Capital, the GCIA Structure at that 
stage, and it was very clear to us that the reporting lines 
through GCIA was directly to Mr Singh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you feel at liberty at this time to 
question the work of McKinsey? 
MS STRYDOM:   No, not at all. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Why do you say that? 
10 
MS STRYDOM:   They were basically in charge of the 
development 
of 
the 
business 
case, 
they 
vetoed 
or 
approved anything that we did, any assessment was vetoed 
by them.  They put their reports for Mr Singh on a weekly 
basis, we had to prepare our won reports and then I used 
to call it truth and reconciliation on a Friday because what 
they contained in their reports was always contradictory to 
ours, so we had no authority to work outside, almost no 
authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, did you say whatever they did was 
20 
not  - was contrary to what you did or what? 
MS STRYDOM:   Ja, they would – yes, it happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They would go a different direction, if 
you were going that way they would go that way or 
something like that, on whatever document or issues you 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 153 of 222 
 
were dealing with? 
MS STRYDOM:   Often on reports in terms of project 
progress we would prepare a report, based on evidence 
and they would put a different view on the table, that to 
some degree discredit the work that the team did. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Oh 
they 
were 
critical 
of 
your 
...[intervenes]  
MS STRYDOM:   Very critical of ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...work. 
MS STRYDOM:... and distrust of the team 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you Chairperson.  Then you 
go on to say at paragraph 16 that in May of 2014 the then 
Minister of Public Enterprises, Mr Malusi Gigaba approved 
the business case, is that the business case that you had 
been working on together with McKinsey? 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you make a comment that with 
hindsight you felt this strange.  Why do you say that? 
MS STRYDOM:   The business case was approved within 
20 
two months, compared a similar major expansion where the 
approval was in excess of two years. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you refer to that not as strange 
as I said but as suspicious, why did you consider that 
suspicious? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 154 of 222 
 
MS STRYDOM:   Approval of – for an approval of this value 
to receive that in such a short time first of all was 
suspicious, ja it begged the question in terms of was – did 
everybody apply their minds to the information in such a 
short period.  I was also informed by the General Manager 
: Head of Commercial, Mr Divesh Collin at that stage, 
whom I worked with in terms of pricing and a commercial 
strategy for the business case that the business case will 
be approved, we shouldn’t worry as the project team 
because it was close to elections, elections that year was 
10 
May 2014, I think scheduled for that and there was a risk 
that if this business case is not approved there might be a 
change of Minister or Cabinet or personnel, so his view 
was that it will definitely be approved. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You then at paragraph 18 talk about 
the recommendation to centralise all delegations for capital 
execution within the programme structure, could you deal 
with that please and the significance of it. 
MS STRYDOM:   Ja, McKinsey developed a standard for 
capital 
execution 
for 
Transnet 
called 
the 
Platinum 
20 
Standard, which recommended for a programme of this 
nature and size that all the expenditures, the capital 
expenditure for rail and port should be centralised so there 
should be from a Group perspective a central authority who 
is the responsible for the management of the capital 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 155 of 222 
 
oversight of the capital expenditure reporting etcetera.   
 
This was in contradiction to the practice at Transnet 
at that stage where all of the operating divisions were 
respectively 
and 
individually 
accountable 
for 
the 
management of the capital expenditure associated with 
projects. 
 
The 
operating 
divisions 
resisted 
this 
change 
because effectively it would have meant that they would 
have lost control of the capital expenditure from an 
operating division perspective if that would have been 
10 
centralised, so therefore although the Platinum standards 
recommended that as Programme Director I should have 
control over capital expenditure that did not happen, 
therefore in the Programme Director role I eventually did 
not have any financial delegation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You go on to mention then at 
paragraph 19 that there was a change in your reporting 
lines, so you have explained how you reported first to Mr 
Singh, then to Mr Mahomedy, who did you land up reporting 
to? 
20 
MS STRYDOM:   I finally ended up reporting into Group 
Planning, directly to Mr Krish Reddy who was the General 
Manager 
of 
Group 
Planning 
at 
that 
stage. 
 
They 
established similar roles to the Programme Director roles 
for multi-divisional programmes especially for the concept 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 156 of 222 
 
and feasibility phases of those programmes so it was a 
natural thing. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ms Strydom you then deal with the 
motivation for the MEP and you do that over pages 140 and 
141.  Could you just give the Chairperson a thumbnail 
sketch of the motivation of the MEP? 
MS STRYDOM:   We concluded an investment in expanding 
manganese export capacity to the Port of PE, Baltimore in 
PE, to 5.5million tons in 2009, and despite that capacity 
that we offered there was just an increase, an exponential 
10 
need for export capacity from industry.  South Africa at that 
stage had developed China as a very lucrative market 
because our manganese, the quality of our manganese was 
very 
suited 
to 
their 
smelters 
and 
furnaces, 
so 
we 
immediately started with a project, we validated demand 
with customers, with industry and then commenced with a 
project to understand where are we going to create 
additional export capacity in South Africa. 
 
At that stage the PE bulk terminal reached, the 
footprint so the site of the terminal could not be expanded 
20 
further, so we knew that we reached a capacity cap there.   
It was also a very old terminal, I think it was built in the 
sixties and there were many environmental issues with the 
terminal and commitments to vacate the terminal, at some 
point close the terminal, and therefore we commenced with 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 157 of 222 
 
feasibility studies to look at where do we create the next 
export  channel for manganese in South Africa. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what decision was made, where 
was that expansion to take place? 
MS STRYDOM:   On conclusion of the feasibility studies a 
decision was made to proceed with an expansion through 
the port of Coega, comparisons were – there were studies 
done looking at Saldanha as an option, a heavy ore line 
through to Saldanha.   From a timing perspective, so from 
a completion date perspective Coega was the better 
10 
option, we could lead or provide capacity to industry ahead 
of demand, much earlier than what Saldanha would have 
offered at that stage, and on that basis and Saldanha also 
had many environmental issues that they were facing, we 
recommended with feasibility studies for the Port of Coega. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And how many million tons per 
annum were you looking then to expand to? 
MS STRYDOM:   260million tons based on the validated 
demand from industry. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   From how many in Port Elizabeth? 
20 
MS STRYDOM:   From 5.5million tons in a bulk terminal to 
a total of 16. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If we have a look at paragraph 23  
you talk there about the Transnet market demand strategy, 
known by the acronym MDS, could you address that 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 158 of 222 
 
please? 
MS STRYDOM:   Transnet Market Demand Strategy was in 
response to economic growth plans, and it was aimed at 
expanding, modernising rail and port infrastructure in 
South Africa in order to meet the requirements to support 
economic growth. 
 
The main pillar of the MDS, the market demand 
strategy, 
was 
a 
R300billion 
investment 
programme 
associated with the delivery of assets. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And was then the MEP was it part of 
10 
that programme? 
MS STRYDOM:   The Manganese expansion was the anchor 
programme in MDS, it was the biggest expansion that 
Transnet was going to undertake in the MDS yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You go on to say that in May of 2014 
Transnet received approval in accordance with the PFMA to 
proceed with the investment.  From whom did you receive 
that approval? 
MS STRYDOM:   We received the approval from the 
Minister of Public Enterprises, so the Department of Public 
20 
Enterprises, our shareholder, in accordance 
with the 
PFMA, the delegation of authority framework. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you attach that approval as 
Annexure DS2? 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct yes. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 159 of 222 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could we then please go to the 
various project phases, and again if I could just ask you to 
outline this and perhaps to focus on those phases that are 
relevant to the balance of your evidence. 
MS STRYDOM:   Transnet adopted given the quantum of 
investment 
that 
we 
were 
envisaging 
a 
process 
to 
standardise the execution of capital projects and to create 
a consistent approach to that execution was developed.  
This process is called the Project Life Cycle Process, 
known as the PLP in Transnet.   
10 
 
The notion of the PLP is the more work you can do 
in the early phases of the project, and we call that front-
end loading.  The more work you can do to develop a 
solution, refine the cost estimate etcetera, and reduce risk 
therefore, the higher the likelihood is that you will deliver a 
successful project at the end of it, so on that basis the PLP 
has five phases, FEL 1 or frontend loading 1 is where you 
have a business need that you have to address and you 
identify all the options, that could solve it. 
 
Once that are then ...[indistinct] then put aside.   
20 
FL2 is a pre-feasibility where you do further work on the 
potential options, so you start doing early engineering work 
around it, and based on the outcomes of the FL2 you 
recommend a go forward option. 
 
In FL3 which is your feasibility phase you then do 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 160 of 222 
 
detailed engineering after that, so you do your detail 
costing, you do your environmental authorisations, so all 
the necessary work that needs to go into informs your 
business case so that the estimates in your business case 
are accurate, and then in FL4 any element that has a 
design component, a remaining design component so you 
finalise there.  So you finalise your designs early in FL4 
and then you execute the project, which is then the capital 
execution construction aspect of the project. 
 
FL5 is when you close it down.  So once the asset 
10 
has been delivered you close it down.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, and then you deal with 
something that, as I understand you have already touched 
on the Platinum for capital execution, is there anything 
there you want to reiterate or expand upon? 
MS STRYDOM:   No I think only to mention that in 
supporting the capital expansion programme attempted 
also to make sure that the capital portfolio and the delivery 
of projects meet the business needs as they were set out. 
 
It was to manage the risks associated with the 
20 
execution of the capital portfolio appropriately so the 
finding or the standards and frameworks required. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now Ms Strydom you mentioned at 
the beginning of your affidavit that MEP was split into two 
different phases, is that right? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 161 of 222 
 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you then, that’s phase one and 
phase two, you at page 12 commence dealing with Phase 
one, and you have described already what your role was in 
that, is that correct? 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now can you then pick up at 
paragraph 32 and deal with Hatch Goba, their appointment 
and what they did, and how they came ultimately to be 
appointed. 
10 
MS STRYDOM:   In 2011 Transnet Capital Projects 
appointed Hatch Goba, it was under the Hatch Mott 
McDonald Goba contract at that stage, which was a 
Transnet contract, to proceed with the pre-feasibility 
studies for the manganese expansion to the Port of Coega, 
so Hatch was involved in finalising those studies and they 
were concluded towards the end of 2012. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, please carry on. 
MS STRYDOM:   The full 60million tons expansion was a 
material expansion, it – the value in excess of R27billion 
20 
and much higher so given the quantum of the investment it 
was recommended that we need to subject the full 
expansion 
to 
further 
scrubbing 
to 
see 
if 
we 
could 
potentially bring some of the costs down, and on that basis 
the Transnet Capital Investment Committee then in 2012 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 162 of 222 
 
supported the ring-fencing of aspects of the full expansion, 
specifically on the rail side, there were projects that would 
have been executed that had safety and operational 
capacity implications that couldn’t stand over for the 
duration of this scrubbing period, especially from a safety 
perspective 
and 
we 
also 
had 
the 
environmental 
authorisations in place for those projects. 
 
That was approved, or they supported that – the 
splitting of the scope and the project then was renamed 
Rail Phase one. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So that is how Phase One came 
about? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you mention at the end of 
paragraph 33 the project was named Rail Phase One of 
MEP Phase One. 
MS STRYDOM:   That’s correct yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then you go on to mention that 
there was a confinement of the engineering, procurement 
and construction management scope, known as EPCM, 
20 
please address that. 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct, a risk review was 
conducted by TCP and based on the risk review a 
motivation was prepared to confine the EPCM scope of 
work to Hatch and the request to confine was then 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 163 of 222 
 
submitted for approval.  A confinement is done under 
certain circumstances and the confinement – the motivation 
dealt with those circumstances. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Can you recall why the decision was 
made to opt for consignment in relation to Hatch? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes, the main decision being that Hatch 
had completed all the pre-feasibility studies so they were 
familiar with the detailed designs and engineering designs 
required for the rail scope of work at that stage.   It was 
extension of loops mainly, or rail passing loops mainly and 
10 
it would not make sense to bring another company on 
board at that stage who has to basically start from scratch, 
so 
from 
a 
timing 
perspective 
given 
the 
safety 
and 
operational criticality of the specific projects in Phase One 
a motivation to confine ...[indistinct – audio cut off] 
ADV MYBURGH:  What was the value of that transaction – 
the Hatch confinement? 
MS STRYDOM:  The value of the transaction was below 
R250 million. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And in those circumstances who – who had 
20 
approval authority? 
MS STRYDOM:  When a confinement according to the 
delegation of authority was below R250 million the Group 
Chief Executive at that stage Mr Brian Molefe had full 
authority to approve the confinement. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 164 of 222 
 
ADV MYBURGH:  And was anything in that regard reported 
to you by or mentioned to you by any of your colleagues? 
MS STRYDOM:  Yes.  Mr Rudi Basson was General Manager 
TCP overseeing the manganese expansion at that stage told 
me that they had to reduce the estimated costs or the 
estimated 
cost 
or 
value 
of 
the 
confinement 
of 
the 
confinement to fit in with the delegated authority limit of the 
GCE at that stage. So therefore it meant that he had the full 
delegated authority to approve it.  It did not have to go to the 
board’s Acquisition and Disposal Committee for approval 
10 
which would be the next authority. 
ADV MYBURGH:  You go on to say at the end of that 
paragraph 
“I annex hereto marked DS3 the approval of the confinement 
to phase 1 to Hatch with an approved contract value of R220 
million as well as the delegation of authority” 
 
Can I take you to those documents please?  Could 
you turn to page 179 – 179? 
MS STRYDOM:  179. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And that is a memorandum from Mr Charl 
20 
Moller who was he? 
MS STRYDOM:  Mr Charl Moller was the head of or Group 
Executive Head of Transnet Capital Projects at that stage. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And he is writing to Mr Molefe. 
MS STRYDOM:  Yes. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 165 of 222 
 
ADV MYBURGH:  And the subject is confinement and award 
of the FEL Fluor EM EPCM service to Hatch Goba for phase 
1 of the manganese 16 MTPA TFR Project, is that right? 
MS STRYDOM:  That is correct yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And the purpose is stated as being to 
obtain approval from the Group Chief Executive Transnet 
SOC Limited for confinement and award of the EPCM 
services for FEL for phase 1 and then the project is 
described.  So this is a memorandum where the approval of 
Mr Molefe was sought? 
10 
MS STRYDOM:  That is correct yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  If we then go to the end of this 
memorandum at page 185 we will see that it is recommended 
by a series of persons Mr Gerhard Bierman we will come to 
him in some time.  Mr Moller you have mentioned and Mr 
Gama, Mr Mohamedy, Mr Garry Pita, Mr Anoj Singh and then 
finally Mr Brian Molefe, is that correct? 
MS STRYDOM:  That is correct yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And he appears to have signed on the 19 
August 2013? 
20 
MS STRYDOM:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And then if we go to the next annexure 
which you mentioned that being Annexure DS4 at page 187 
you want to point out to the Chairperson the TCE’s approval 
authority in terms of this matrix? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 166 of 222 
 
MS STRYDOM:  If you follow the matrix where you see and 
the heading being the approval to approach market for 
confinement if you look at – under the GCE’s delegation it 
will be for up to but not exceeding R250 million and the 
limits are per transaction. 
ADV MYBURGH:  I am sorry I should have pointed out if you 
go back to page 185 under the heading Recommendation. 
There is a series of bullet points.  The first is: 
“Value of the contract not to exceed R220 
million.” 
10 
MS STRYDOM:  That is correct yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Could we then please go back to your 
affidavit page 14 paragraph 36.  And this is the first time Ms 
Strydom that you mention and begin and to deal with the 
concept of supplier development targets which… 
MS STRYDOM:  That – that is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH:  I refer to by the acronym SD.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Myburgh you said we go 
back to what page? 
ADV MYBURGH:  Page 146 paragraph 36 Mr Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of her statement? 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Here you deal with the concept of supplier 
development SD targets.  Could you please just explain in 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 167 of 222 
 
the first instance to the Chairperson what they involve before 
we get to the detail of the target set in this instance? 
MS 
STRYDOM: 
 
Transnet 
had 
adopted 
the 
supplier 
development program which was part of the competitive 
supplier development program of DPE.  And I think to create 
capacity capability and grow their – the supplier base. And 
also to a very large degree transform the supplier base to 
Transnet and other SOC’s.  They do – do this through their 
procurement programs or procurement initiatives and for a 
specific type of project – so for instance this in engineering 
10 
EPCM 
Professional 
Services 
there 
would 
be 
a 
– 
an 
acceptable target depending on the size of the market 
etcetera.  So market research done.  So the introduction of 
SD targets in this project was therefore based on the EPCM 
project and what the supplier development initiatives are that 
Transnet wanted the EPCM to focus on. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So what was the SD target for phase 12? 
MS STRYDOM:  The initial target the – so the first document 
that I took through for approval as per my role to Siyabonga 
Gama was 40% which is the first document that he signed.  
20 
In such a [00:07:00] document so the final document that 
was submitted for approval to the Group Chief Executive the 
SD value was increased to 50% which was very high. 
ADV MYBURGH:  We will come to those documents.  But 
practically speaking what did it mean a 50% SD target? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 168 of 222 
 
MS STRYDOM:  50% of the contract value had to be 
earmarked for supplier development which is a – can be a 
combination of contracting specific earmarked companies. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Right.  Now you say at the end of 
paragraph 36 that you refer to Annexure DS5 and then back 
to Annexure DS3.  Can we turn please to Annexure DS5 at 
page 189.  Now this is a memorandum dated the 31 July and 
if I could take you please to page 185 at the end.  You see 
that it is signed by Mr Gama.  Is this the document that you 
say you took to Mr Gama to sign? 
10 
MS STRYDOM:  That is correct yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And could I please direct your attention to 
paragraph 29 at page 194 it says: 
“SD will be implemented in the form of a pre-
qualification criteria as well as a threshold 
and 30 – the minimum pre-qualifying criteria 
of 40% of contract value will be allocated to 
SD related initiatives.” 
MS STRYDOM:  That is correct yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  That you say bears out your evidence that 
20 
initially the target was 40%? 
MS STRYDOM:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH:   And then if we go back to DS3 that you 
find at page 184 – 184.   There you will see in the 
subsequent memorandum that was approved by Brian Molefe 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 169 of 222 
 
at paragraph 30 the minimum pre-qualifying criteria of 50% 
of the contract value will be allocated to SD related 
initiatives.  So between these two memorandum it was 
increased  by 10%. 
MS STRYDOM:  That is correct yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And then perhaps if I could ask you also to 
look at page 185 under the heading Recommendation at 
paragraph 35 the second bullet point under the contract 
value is SD pre-qualification of 50% be met. 
MS STRYDOM:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH:  Confirm that? 
MS STRYDOM:   I confirm that that was in the final 
recommendation yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And incidentally Ms Strydom what is this 
pre-qualification that term what does it mean? 
MS STRYDOM:  The contractor or the EPCM contractor had 
to have evidence of projects, partners or contracted work to 
the value of 50% of the value of the total contract to be 
considered.  So the SD pre-qualification that is the primary 
qualification before you go forward and then consider 
20 
technical – the technical aspects of any bid.  So they had to 
have – be able to provide evidence of initiatives, contracts 
etcetera to the value of 50% of the – of the total contract 
value of R220 million at that stage. 
ADV MYBURGH:  At page 37 of your affidavit you then talk 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 170 of 222 
 
of a meeting that you held. Do you recall that meeting? 
MS STRYDOM:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  In late July. 
MS STRYDOM:  Yes.  I can recall the meeting ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  In late July were the contract negotiations 
underway? 
MS STRYDOM:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  In respect of phase 1? 
MS STRYDOM:  Yes.  So it was in the – the contract 
negotiations were underway and it was in the process of 
10 
concluding the final price for the EPCM work that had to be 
done. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And that is with Hatch? 
MS STRYDOM:  That is with Hatch yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Now who attended this meeting that you 
speak of? 
MS STRYDOM:  At the meeting it was myself, Mr Henk 
Bester from Hatch, the Hatch Project Director for Rail at that 
stage and as well as Rudi Basson. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Just remind us of Mr Basson’s position 
20 
please? 
MS STRYDOM:  Mr Basson at that stage was General 
Manager 
in 
Transnet 
Capital 
Projects 
and 
he 
was 
responsible for the manganese execution.  It was – it was his 
responsibility. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 171 of 222 
 
ADV MYBURGH:  How did this meeting come about – how 
did you come to participate in this meeting? 
MS STRYDOM:  I cannot recall specifically we would have 
either been invited by Mr Bester to attend the session. We 
were working fairly closely with Hatch at that stage with – on 
completing the feasibility studies.  So it would have either 
been a phone call to attend a meeting or we would have 
been together with Rudi we would have been in – in 
Woodmead for other meetings. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Alright well just as I understand it.  Where 
10 
were your offices at the time? 
MS STRYDOM:  In Woodmead. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And where were Hatch’s offices? 
MS STRYDOM:  In Woodmead as well. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Alright.  So you attend this meeting 
together with Mr Basson and Mr Henk Bester? 
MS STRYDOM:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And what transpired during the course of 
that meeting? 
MS STRYDOM:  At the meeting Mr Bester indicated to us 
20 
that he was approached by persons one of them being Mr 
Dave Reddy and Mr Reddy indicated or was quite adamant 
that Mr Bester had to appoint his company as the SD partner 
for phase 1.  I did not know Mr Reddy.  It was news to me. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And when did you first meet Mr Reddy? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 172 of 222 
 
MS STRYDOM:  I met him the following year in June 2014 at 
a client function that Hatch Goba arranged. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Now you have said in your evidence that 
Mr Bester explained that he had been approached by 
persons one of whom was Mr Reddy.  Can you remember the 
names of any other persons that he mentioned? 
MS STRYDOM:  No unfortunately not.  I can – I can recall Mr 
Reddy’s name because I met him the following year.  
Unfortunately not the other – the other persons. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And can you recall insofar as it may have 
10 
been mentioned the name of Mr Reddy’s company who was 
put forward as a SD partner? 
MS STRYDOM:  Unfortunately not.  I cannot recall the detail.  
I can recall the name of the person but not the details of the 
company. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Did you come – we will come further to 
that in your affidavit but did you come to learn of the name 
of that company later on? 
MS STRYDOM:  Mr Reddy’s the name [inaudible]. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Did you subsequently come to learn of the 
20 
name of his company? 
MS STRYDOM:  Yes later on. 
ADV MYBURGH:  But you did not know about it at this time? 
MS STRYDOM:  Not at this time.  I did not know who he was 
and I did not know which company he represented.  It was 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 173 of 222 
 
[inaudible]. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So you say that Mr Bester explains to you 
that he had been approached by persons including Mr Reddy 
and he was adamant that he should be appointed as a SD 
partner?  What else if anything did Mr Bester tell you? 
MS STRYDOM:  Mr Bester indicated to us that Mr Reddy 
claimed to know very important people.  He spoke about 
Number 1 and whoever Number 1 was.  People very high up 
in Transnet.  And of concern was that he knew everything 
about the project at that stage.   
10 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes. 
MS STRYDOM:  He all – and given that it was a confinement 
that was quite strange that information would be available 
externally.  He then also said to us that following this 
meeting with Mr Reddy well Hatch’s meeting with Mr Reddy 
they were sent an MOU which they were then asked to sign 
to the effect that you know they should be the SD partner on 
phase 1. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Was Mr Bester at all concerned about 
this? 
20 
MS STRYDOM:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  What gave rise to the meeting?  Why did 
he want to meet? 
MS STRYDOM:  He was very concerned about it because 
first of all as said it is a confinement so the information 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 174 of 222 
 
about the project should not be available in the public 
domain.  And secondly the assertions that – that Mr Reddy 
made that he knew important people in Transnet and that he 
was acting with the authority basically.  So acting with the 
authority of – of Anoj Singh in executing this. So it was 
highly concerning. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Now what did – perhaps I can start off by 
asking you did Mr Basson then respond to this once he – he 
heard this report? 
MS STRYDOM:  Yes.  He was very surprised.  He said that 
10 
he… 
ADV MYBURGH:  Ms Strydom please speak up a little I am 
struggling to hear you. 
MS STRYDOM:  Mr Basson was surprised he said that 
Gerhard Bierman and himself had a meeting with Anoj Singh 
the Chief Financial Officer at that stage and Anoj basically 
wanted them to include this company or Dave Reddy’s 
company in the confinement documents as SD partners so to 
prescribed it.  And they basically said to Anoj that cannot be 
done, you cannot prescribe who the SD partners must be. 
20 
And because of that advice to Anoj they thought that the 
matter was dealt with.  So he was very surprised that despite 
this Dave Reddy then approached Hatch directly. 
ADV MYBURGH:  You have now mentioned the name of 
Gerhard Bierman who was he? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 175 of 222 
 
MS STRYDOM:  Gerhard Bierman was the Chief Financial 
Officer of TCP – apologies of TCP at that stage.  Thank you.  
Of Capital Projects ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So perhaps I – you could just assist and 
paint the picture for us.  Here we have a – you have got 
yourself, you have got Mr Basson, you have got Mr Bierman.  
How did those three positions fit in – how were they 
connected?  So you the Project Director. 
ADV MYBURGH:  I am the Transnet – because it is a rail 
project. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes. 
MS STRYDOM:  I am the Transnet Freight Rail I am the 
owners 
representative 
from 
the 
operating 
division 
perspective so Transnet Freight Rail.  Rudi Basson is 
appointed as General Manager Capital – Transnet Capital 
Project to execute the project for and on behalf of the 
operating division.  So the capital execution… 
ADV MYBURGH:  As you have explained that is where the 
Capital comes from? 
MS STRYDOM:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH:  Alright yes. 
MS STRYDOM:  And Gerhard Bierman was the Chief 
Financial Officer of TCP.  And if I can recall… 
ADV MYBURGH:  So the Chief Financial Officer of Capital 
Projects? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 176 of 222 
 
MS STRYDOM:  Of Capital Projects. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So did Mr Basson report to him? 
MS STRYDOM:  No. 
ADV MYBURGH:  They performed different roles? 
MS STRYDOM:  They performed different roles. Gerhard 
looking after the – obviously the finances of TCP and I think 
to a large degree also oversight of procurement. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And as I understand your evidence Mr 
Basson mentioned to you that he and Mr Bierman had held 
this discussion with Mr Singh that you have described. 
10 
MS STRYDOM:  Yes.  That is correct they were called by Mr 
Singh to discuss this and they indicated to him that you 
cannot do this. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And on what basis then was this meeting 
concluded? 
MS 
STRYDOM: 
 
We 
concluded 
and 
I 
know 
my 
recommendation – our recommendation was that Hatch 
should not sign that MOU that was my specific advice to 
them.  I suspected that something was going on. 
ADV MYBURGH:  What do you mean? 
20 
MS STRYDOM:  Twofold the fact that there was this 
approach 
from 
– 
from 
Dave 
Reddy 
requesting 
to 
be 
appointed as SD partner outside a process and then the fact 
that the SD targets were manipulated in my view prior to the 
– 
the 
completion 
or 
the 
order 
signing 
of 
the 
final 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 177 of 222 
 
memorandum from 40 to 50% which is a very, very high SD 
target for a project of this nature. 
ADV MYBURGH:  You say now that you thought that 
something was going on in your affidavit you talk about 
having suspected that corruption was at play? 
MS STRYDOM:  Correct yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Now I had asked you how the meeting 
concluded and you say that your advice was that Hatch 
should not sign the MOU? 
MS 
STRYDOM: 
 
Yes. 
 
As 
the 
Freight 
Rail 
owners 
10 
representative and it being Rail Capital my recommendation 
was do not sign the memorandum or the MOU. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes.  It was driving at another point and 
that is what if anything was Mr Basson’s recommendation? 
MS STRYDOM:  I cannot recall.  I know given that he was 
surprised that Dave Reddy approached them despite the 
discussion with – with Anoj.  I think based on my view as 
being the owner’s representative Rudi agreed with us that 
Hatch should not sign that MOU. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Alright.  So that is a meeting that you say 
20 
you participated in late July of 2013.  You go on at 
paragraph 38 to speak of a telephone call that you received 
on the evening of the 6 August 2013. 
MS STRYDOM:  That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Can you recall that telephone call? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 178 of 222 
 
MS STRYDOM:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Who phoned you? 
MS STRYDOM:  Mr Henk Bester called me that evening and 
he advised me that after the meeting we had where we 
concluded that they should not sign Mr Basson called him 
and requested Hatch to sign the MOU.  Hatch then signed a 
version that they amended which was a more general broad 
MOU despite that they were then requested to sign an 
addendum to that MOU.  So the – there was a back and 
forward of documents and I – the response from Dave Reddy 
10 
continuously was to reintroduce. 
ADV MYBURGH:  But what gave right to Mr Bester phoning 
you on the evening of the 6 August?  Was he concerned at 
all? 
MS STRYDOM:  He was concerned.  In my opinion the fact 
that we concluded that he should not sign and then received 
a call from Mr Basson who was from TCP responsible for 
execution instructing him to sign the MOU. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes.  So he signed an amended version 
and now they were being required to sign an addendum? 
20 
MS STRYDOM:  To sign an addendum. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Was he concerned about that? 
MS STRYDOM:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Why was he concerned? 
MS STRYDOM:  Because the addendum again instructed 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 179 of 222 
 
them to include Dave Reddy’s company or this company as 
SD partner on phase 1.  So the – the – whereas they wanted 
to keep the MOU as a broad MOU the addendums continued 
to be brought back to SD. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And what would the consequences be of 
not signing the addendum?  Was that something that he 
raised with you? 
MS STRYDOM:  He indicated to me that the tone of this 
discussion the toing and froing of the addendums got to a 
point where it was being – it was fairly aggressive and – that 
10 
they were being threatened to – to tow the line effectively 
and sign the revised addendum. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Could you please look at the last two or 
three lines of your affidavit? 
MS STRYDOM:  Ja.  Yes.  And I think the specifically the fact 
that they did – the amendments to the addendum to include 
the SD partner was linked to the fact that the confinement 
will not be approved if they did not sign that.  So the 
confinement documents that were with Anoj Singh at that 
stage because he was one of the main signatories would not 
20 
be approved if they did not sign the amendment to include 
Dave Reddy’s company into the project as a SD partner. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And who would have been or we have seen 
the signatures but who was the ultimate approval authority 
for the confinement? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 180 of 222 
 
MS STRYDOM:  It would be Mr Brian Molefe in line with 
delegation of authority at that stage. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So that he reported to you that Hatch was 
now being required to sign an addendum to it against as you 
put the thinly veiled threat by Reddy of the confinement 
otherwise not being approved by Transnet? 
MS STRYDOM:  That is correct.  An approval being Anoj 
Singh and Mr Brian Molefe at that stage. 
ADV MYBURGH:  What impression Ms Strydom did you form 
when you were told that despite the events of the July 
10 
meeting that you had held with Mr Basson Mr Bester was 
now reporting to you that Mr Basson had in fact requested 
Hatch to sign the MOU.   
MS STRYDOM:  Hm.  I understood that Hatch initially signed 
a MOU or Hatch was approached by – by Dave Reddy and a 
MOU was put forward and in that MOU it indicated that they 
have already have – they have established a JV – a JV to 
work with Hatch.  Hatch then prepared… 
ADV MYBURGH:  You say – I am not driving at that.  We 
know the facts. 
20 
MS STRYDOM:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  But what impression did you form of Mr 
Basson? 
MS STRYDOM:  I – what concerned me was the facts that he 
agreed to jointly with us that Hatch should not sign that 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 181 of 222 
 
MOU. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes. 
MS STRYDOM:  And then later that evening that same – or 
after that meeting instructed Mr Bester to sign the MOU. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes. 
MS STRYDOM:  Which could in my opinion mean that there 
was undue pressure put on him to sign the MOU from 
someone.  Now I do not have that detail about who that 
someone could be. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So that is a telephone call on the 6 
10 
August. 
MS STRYDOM:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  What happened the next day the 7 August? 
MS STRYDOM:  So after what transpired the telephone call I 
met – the next day I met with Henk Bester and Allan Gray 
who was his boss at that stage to discuss the matter. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Why did you have this meeting? 
MS STRYDOM:  Because of the concerns raised by Hatch 
with the pressure being put on them to sign a MOU which 
they were no comfortable with and I think because of the fact 
20 
that clearly with the instruction to Rudi to sign a document 
someone could have been compromised. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So that is why you had the meeting? 
MS STRYDOM:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Did you come then and perhaps you can 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 182 of 222 
 
have a look at paragraph 39 of your affidavit to learn of 
further information at this meeting? 
MS STRYDOM:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Would you explain that please? 
MS STRYDOM:  Ja.  At the meeting Hatch indicated to me 
that they were now requested to sign this revised MOU.  So 
they – they prepared a broad one – there was a revised one 
they were requested to sign a revised MOU.  Hatch then – 
Hatch… 
ADV MYBURGH:  Sorry I thought they were being required 
10 
to sign an addendum? 
MS STRYDOM:  Ja.   
ADV MYBURGH:  Please get the terms right. 
MS STRYDOM:  Hatch – correct Hatch… 
ADV MYBURGH:  There was a MOU. 
MS STRYDOM:  Which Hatch prepared which was a broad 
MOU. 
ADV MYBURGH:  There was a MOU there was then a 
revised MOU. 
MS STRYDOM:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH:  Which they signed. 
MS STRYDOM:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  They were now being as I understand your 
evidence being required to sign an addendum? 
MS STRYDOM:  Addendum to the revised MOU yes that is 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 183 of 222 
 
correct. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So you say in the second sentence: 
“During the course of the meeting they 
mentioned to me that they had signed the 
revised MOU and were now being required to 
sign an addendum.” 
 
Correct? 
MS STRYDOM:  That is correct yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Carry on what else did you come to learn? 
MS STRYDOM:  They were being asked to sign the 
10 
addendum and in the addendum the JV had to be appointed 
by Hatch as their SD partner in Phase 1. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  What did you then do after 
then come to learn of this? 
MS STRYDOM:   I was very concerned about what was going 
on and what transpired.  Specifically, as indicated, Rudi 
Basson’s response and instruction to sign the MOU.  I 
discussed the matter with one my colleagues at TFR, Johan 
Bouwer  He was the Executive Manager in the Finance 
Division in TF ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry.  Can you please speak up. 
MS STRYDOM:   Sorry.  So I discussed the matter with 
Johan Bouwer.  He was Executive Manager at TFR in the 
Finance 
Division 
at 
that 
stage 
and 
responsible 
for 
governance related to Capital management. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 184 of 222 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  And what caused you to 
approach Mr Bouwer? 
MS STRYDOM:   That fact that Hatch was asked or there 
was... 
almost 
being 
forced 
to 
sign 
a 
document 
that 
prescribed who they must appoint and the FD partner. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry.  Ms Strydom ...[intervenes]  
MS STRYDOM:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What I am driving at.  We know of the 
concern.  But why in particular did you approach Mr Bouwer? 
MS STRYDOM:   Ja.  I trust his judgment and I trust him as a 
10 
colleague 
and 
especially 
in 
role 
in 
terms 
of 
Capital 
governance. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So did you raise the issue with him? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes, I discussed the matter with him.  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what, if anything, was his advice 
to you? 
MS STRYDOM:   Ja. His advice to me was that I have to 
escalate it to my line manager at that stage. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And who was your line manager? 
MS STRYDOM:   My line manager Ms Cleopatra Shiceka.  
20 
She was General Manager for Planning and she was General 
Counsel for DVR at that stage.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So as General Counsel, do you... 
would I be correct in my understanding that she was also a 
lawyer? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 185 of 222 
 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct, yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And she was your line manager? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you then raise the issue with her? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes.  Henk Bester, Alan Grey and myself 
met with Cleo in the Carlton Centre on the 7 t h of August. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Is that the same day? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
MS STRYDOM:   She indicated we need to meet immediately 
10 
and we met with her in the Carlton. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You travelled from Woodmead to the 
Carlton Centre? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes, that is correct.  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And can you remember where in the 
Carlton Centre you held this meeting? 
MS STRYDOM:   We met her in a Wimpy downstairs. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just remind us of who was present at 
this meeting? 
MS STRYDOM:   So at the meeting it was myself, Allan Grey 
20 
and Henk Bester together with Cleo.  Just ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Miss? 
MS STRYDOM:   Miss, ja.  Yes.  Ms Shiceka. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What transpired during the course of 
this meeting? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 186 of 222 
 
MS STRYDOM:   We shared what... we gave her a full 
briefing of what had happened to date.  Of what transpired to 
date.  She was very concerned.  She took a photograph of 
the addendum which Hatch had with them, the addendum 
that they were not requested to sign.   
 
And then she assured them that she would take the 
matter further and investigate it.  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Did you later inform Mr Bester 
of anything further to this meeting? 
MS STRYDOM:   At a later point, and I cannot recall if it was 
10 
feedback from Ms Shiceka or from Johan Bouwer that said, 
indicated the matter was dealt with.  I informed Mr Bester 
that the master was escalated to a Mr Singh and it was now 
considered closed and that no action would be taken on that 
basis. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You told him that the matter had been, 
as you put it, escalated to Mr Singh.  That it was considered 
closed and no further action would be taken. 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you say that you told them that 
20 
based on... 
MS STRYDOM:   Either discussion or feedback from Johan 
Bouwer or feedback form or a lack of feedback, potentially, 
from Ms Shiceka. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You cannot remember which of the 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 187 of 222 
 
two? 
MS STRYDOM:   I cannot remember which of the two it was 
but it was the... it was clear that the matter was considered 
closed and should be left. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, but just to make it clear.  Were 
you told that by one or other of these two people? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It was not an inference that you drew? 
MS STRYDOM:   No.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
10 
MS STRYDOM:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then at paragraph 32.  Oh, sorry 42.  
I beg your pardon.  You deal with the involvement of Mr Gary 
Pita.  Who was he? 
MS STRYDOM:   Gary Pita, at that stage was the Group 
Chief Supply Chain Officer of Transnet.  He personally, and 
it was strange, managed the negotiation for Rail Phase 1 
which was unusual because Transnet Capital Project had a 
procurement 
division 
and 
was 
equipped 
to 
handle 
negotiations of this sort.   
20 
 
And 
especially, 
it 
is 
a 
very 
specialised 
type 
of 
negotiation, EPCM.  It is not your normal business contract 
that you sign.  So it was strange that he would lead that 
himself where TCP could have done that.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you ever receive any report from 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 188 of 222 
 
Mr Bester about Mr Pita? 
MS STRYDOM:   I think following the negotiation, Mr Bester 
indicated to me that during the negotiations, Mr Pita was 
very, very aggressive with them and aggressive towards 
them, right throughout.  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then at paragraph 43, you deal 
with MMPS.  Could you address that topic, please? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes.  In terms of the SD companies in 
Phase 1, I am not sure who the final companies were but 
Mr Basson had at some point mentioned to me that MMQS 
10 
was one of the preferred companies, in passing.   
 
And I know that during the procurement process of 
Phase 2, the subsequent phase, Mr Basson indicated to me 
that Mr Herbert, Mr Masagala(?) was that stage appointed as 
the new Chief Executive of TCP.   
 
Also told him to instruct the Rail JV H to NS.  Or H to N.  
To appoint MMQS as an SD partner.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So that was on phase 2. 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So ...[intervenes]  
20 
MS STRYDOM:   So they... I recall the name in both phases 
as being discussed. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So Mr Masagala had instructed him? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Who told him to instruct to J to NJ.   
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 189 of 222 
 
MS STRYDOM:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And we will come to that in a moment.  
To appoint MMQS as one of the SD partners. 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know Ms Strydom whether it is 
pronounced as Msagala(?) or Mesagala(?)?  Do you know 
what the correct pronunciation is? 
MS STRYDOM:   I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Msagala or Mesagala? 
MS 
STRYDOM: 
 
 
I 
assume 
it 
will 
be 
Msagala. 
 
I 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know? 
MS STRYDOM:   I assume it will be Msagala. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, ja.  I thought you might not. 
MS STRYDOM:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
MS STRYDOM:   Ja.  I was not present in those discussions 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did mister ...[intervenes]  
MS STRYDOM:   Ja. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did Mr Basson tell you what he had 
told Mr Msagala, if that is the correct pronunciation, in 
response? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes, he advised him that it was not 
appropriate.  Transnet could not prescribe. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 190 of 222 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  And then to end off on Phase 
1.  You say to complete the chronology of events, on 
21 November 2013, 
Molefe 
approved 
the 
award 
of 
the 
confinement of Phase 1 to Hatch.  And you have attached 
the relevant memorandum as Annexure SD6. 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Perhaps I could just take you there for 
the sake of completeness.  That you will find at page at page 
197.  Is that correct? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes, that is correct. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Memorandum to mister ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  It is one hundred and...? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So, 190... 
CHAIRPERSON:   190 ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   One 196 is the blank page.  It is 197, 
Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is a memorandum to Brian Molefe 
from Charl Muller, dated the 12t h of November.  Is that right? 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct, yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And let us go to the recommendation 
at page 200, paragraph 16. 
“The GC note the status of the confinement and 
award of the Engineering and Procurement and 
Construction Management, EPCM.  Services for deal 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 191 of 222 
 
for Phase 1 of Manganese 16 MTPA TRF Expansion 
Project to Hatch Goba.” 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Signed.  Recommended by a series of 
people 
including 
Mr 
Bierman, 
Gary 
Pita, 
you 
have 
mentioned.  Anoj Singh you have mentioned.  And finally 
approved by Mr Molefe. 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If we then go back please to your 
affidavit.  You now deal with Phase 2.  And Phase 2 is dealt 
10 
with under a number of cross-headings.  The first of which is 
the Period up to award a Phase 2.  That is January to 
November 2014.  Is that correct? 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct, yes.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Can you explain how Phase 2 of what 
happened during that period of time? 
MS STRYDOM:   I find the completion of the feasibility 
studies.  If you can recall, Phase 1 was now in execution.   
 
I lead the Development of the Integrated Business Case 
for the remaining work.  In the Integrated Business Case, the 
20 
Phase 1 costs were included.   
 
There were concerns with calculations related to the 
escalations in the estimate supporting the Business Case.  
So escalations and contingencies.   
 
And a decision was taken to submit the Phase 2 to 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 192 of 222 
 
mega-project or mega-programme scrubbing by the Group 
GCIA headed by Mr Mohammed Mahomedy.  So it was the 
first of its kind.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So what does this term scrubbing 
mean? 
MS STRYDOM:   It means that every aspect of the Business 
Case and every aspect of the investment element of the 
Business Case, costs, expenditure, scope, et cetera will be 
reviewed and subject to questioning and validation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So a thorough interrogation and 
10 
review. 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes, very, very thorough. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And is this then what you deal with at 
paragraph 46? 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Who was appointed to undertake that 
scrubbing exercise? 
MS STRYDOM:   McKinsey and Regiments were appointed by 
GCIA to undertake the scrubbing and on the basis of the 
Platinum Standard that they recommended to Transnet.   
20 
 
In terms of the actual work done, the scrubbing work 
was predominantly done by McKinsey.   
 
There was limited involvement from the Transnet, the 
GCIA Team at that stage. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Who headed up the McKinsey Team? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 193 of 222 
 
MS STRYDOM:   The McKinsey Team was headed up by 
Mr Prakash Kapoor at that stage.  He was heavily involved in 
the completion of the Business Case.   
 
So not only the scrubbing but then also the subsequent 
completion of the Business Case which was outside the 
scope of what the scrubbing should be.   
 
And we questioned that, the continuous and prolonged 
involvement following the scrubbing.   
 
And Mr Singh explained it in the context of the Platinum 
Standard to us that their involvement is to improve the 
10 
quality of the Business Case as it goes through.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what other impression did you 
form about McKinsey? 
MS STRYDOM:   For us, McKinsey was in charge of this 
Business Case.  The business, the scrubbing process, the 
Business Case development process and they were acting 
with the mandate of Mr Singh, the Group Chief Financial 
Officer at that stage.   
 
They were fully in charge in every aspect of the 
Business Case.  And maybe to elaborate on that and why 
20 
this Business Case was important.   
 
In the Business Case, it was not only about the 
numbers.  We also had to detail the execution strategy.  How 
are we going to execute this project.   
 
We 
had 
to 
detail 
the 
sourcing 
strategies, 
your 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 194 of 222 
 
procurement strategies, as well as, contract negotiations 
strategies.   
 
So all of this was detailed in the Business Case and they 
were fully in charge of what had to... what went into the final 
Business Case. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then at paragraph 48.  It explains that 
TCP approach the market for the execution Phase 2 Rail and 
Port, EPCM.  So was that then split, Phase 2 between Rail 
and Port? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes, we split because of the fibre nature of 
10 
specialisation.  We split the Phase 2 in a rail and port 
element.  The EPCM was also split in an FL-3-B which was a 
design completion element and FL-4 which was then the 
actual execution element.   
 
We approached the market with those offers, expecting 
that it was going to take a bit longer to get approval and we 
received approval within two months.   
 
So it was at the negotiation that we approached the or 
structured the tenders in that way.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Did this with hindsight raised 
20 
any concerns in your mind? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes.  If you look at the timing, the fact that 
we submitted the Business Case in March.  It was approved 
in May which was literally two months.  It is unheard of to 
receive approval so quickly.   
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 195 of 222 
 
 
And in hindsight, given the public information available, 
it was at the same time that the letting(?) 64 locomotives 
served and was approved and payments made.   
 
It was all in that period, leading up to May 2014.  
Between March and May 2014.  So it begs the question.  If 
DP had an role in accelerating the approval of the Business 
Case. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What was the contract, the estimated 
value of Rail and Port contracts? 
MS STRYDOM:   The value... the rail contract was about a 
10 
billion rand as per the Business Case and the port contract 
was roundabout R 700 million.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Here you referred to R 700 million to 
one billion. 
MS STRYDOM:   To one billion.  So the range was between 
seven and... R 700 million and one billion. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Was that for each of them? 
MS STRYDOM:   For each, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Were there SD targets applicable, to 
Phase 2 and the Rail and Port Contract? 
20 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes.  The SD targets for both were set at 
45%.  So of the total contract value.  And an additional 30% 
of the value had to be sub-contracted to small businesses.  
EME is your qualifying small enterprises, black owned 
businesses, black woman owned businesses.   
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 196 of 222 
 
 
So you had an SD target of 45% of which 30% of that 
value were... had to be earmarked for specific businesses. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So it is 30% of the 45%? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It was not 45 plus 30? 
MS STRYDOM:   No, no. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay, yes.  And this 45% target, if I 
understand correctly, was then down from the 50% in Phase 
1? 
MS STRYDOM:   This was separate to Phase 1. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MS STRYDOM:   However, the SD targets initially who is set 
as high as 50% for the project.  And then the link to the SD 
targets, there were significant performance bonds.   
 
So there were two-fold construction performance bond, 
as well as SD performance bond.   
 
And they were very owner risk and the targets were high 
and bidders, potential bidders complaint to DPE that it was 
impossible 
to 
perform 
against 
these, 
some 
of 
these 
requirements.  So the bonds were reduced and the SD was 
20 
then settled at 45%. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And that you deal with in paragraphs 
50 and 51? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then at paragraph ...[intervenes]  
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 197 of 222 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Did you say with regard to 
those percentages, 30% is 30% of the 45%? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so it is not correct to say 30% of the 
contract value? 
MS STRYDOM:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So where you say ...[intervenes]  
MS STRYDOM:   No, I will have to... I must check the 
information to make sure that the facts are correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m?  Can you see in paragraph 
10 
...[intervenes]  
MS STRYDOM:   Yes, I see that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It says 30% of the contract value.  That is 
not correct. 
MS STRYDOM:   45% of the contract value to be assigned 
towards to ST... 30% sub... it would then be over and above 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would be...? 
MS STRYDOM:   It would then be over and above the 45%.  
An additional 30%.  I have the actual RFP ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So there would be ...[intervenes]  
MS STRYDOM:   ...and annexure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There would be ...[intervenes]  
MS STRYDOM:   Ja, 30% ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...an SD component? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 198 of 222 
 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  There is a value, a total value 
relating to the SD component. 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then the 45% is the 45% of the total 
ST component value? 
MS STRYDOM:   The 45% of... is the total ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, the entire contract? 
MS STRYDOM:   So if the contract is a billion rand, 45% of 
that value, so R 450 million will be earmarked for SD on top 
10 
of that, 30% of the total value.  So another R 300 million will 
then have to be sub-contracted to small businesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So all together it would be 45% plus 30? 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which would bring it to how much?  Eight, 
seven, five? 
MS STRYDOM:   Almost, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is 75. 
MS STRYDOM:   Ja, 75%. 
CHAIRPERSON:   75%.  Are you sure? 
20 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It sounds ...[intervenes]  
MS STRYDOM:   The information as I recorded it here is as 
per the tender documentation which is annexed in this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Myburgh. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 199 of 222 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If we can go to that ...[intervenes]  
MS STRYDOM:   [Indistinct] annexure. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ms Strydom, before we do that.  Just 
bear with me, please. 
MS STRYDOM:   Okay. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   At paragraph 50.   
“Due to the owner’s SD... 
 
And you talk about 45%. 
“An additional 30% of the contract value had to be 
sub-contracted to small businesses.” 
10 
 
Alright? 
MS STRYDOM:   Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then in the middle of the 
paragraph, you say: 
“Bidders were required to commit that in respect of 
the SD component, 45% of the contract value to be 
assigned towards SD.  In addition, 30% of the 
contract 
value 
to 
be 
sub-contracted 
to 
small 
businesses.” 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
“i.e. exempted micro enterprises and qualifying 
small enterprises.  Start-ups and/or large significant 
black owned enterprises.” 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 200 of 222 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now you then talk about or you make 
reference to Annexure DS7.  That you will find at page 202.  
And could I take you please... let me start... this Annexure 
202, what is this document? 
MS STRYDOM:   I just... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Annexure DS7 at page 202.   
MS STRYDOM:   This... the document is the request for 
proposal so that then the information was provided to the 
bidders. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Which is known as an RFP? 
10 
MS STRYDOM:   An RFP, yes.  Request for Proposal, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Can I take you then to a portion of the 
RFP at page 206? 
MS STRYDOM:   H’m. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   There is a heading at the top:  
Prequalifying Supply Development.  Do you see that? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could you go to the 1, 2, 3... the 
fourth paragraph under that? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Read that, please. 
MS STRYDOM:   Okay. 
“45% of the contract value needs to be assigned 
towards ST and evident within the template provided 
in Annexure B. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 201 of 222 
 
In addition, 30% of the contract value shall be sub-
contracted to small businesses.” 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
“TME, GFE and start-ups, preferable black owned, 
black woman owned and people with disability.” 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And it is effectively that provision, that 
paragraph that is the source then of paragraph 50 of your 
affidavit? 
MS STRYDOM:   Correct. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could you please go back to your 
affidavit at page 151? 
MS STRYDOM:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You have already told the Chairperson 
that there were various complaints. 
“The 
bond 
requirements 
were 
reduced 
notwithstanding the reduction, larger EPCM’s had to 
form JV’s and include smaller EPCM companies in 
their structures.” 
 
Is that correct? 
20 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to make sure I understand this.  
Going to back to para 50.  Does that mean that the main 
contractor would end up with about twenty – what – 25%?  
My mathematics... 25% of the work? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 202 of 222 
 
MS STRYDOM:   Mr Chair, if I may?  I understand now where 
the confusion comes in.  If I can explain it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS STRYDOM:   Supply Development Initiatives which is 
45%.  There are specific criteria for areas that we identified 
for supply development.  That is a separate matter to 
subcontracting to small businesses.   
 
So of that 45% earmarked for supply development, its 
skill transfer, technology transfer, et cetera.  So of that 45% 
- so of the total value of the contract, 45% of that had to be 
10 
focussed on the Supply Development Initiatives.   
 
The total contract value, 30% of the work in the total 
contract value also had to be subcontracted to small 
businesses.  So it is not a percentage of a percentage.   
 
You have your SD targets that you want to achieve and 
then there was a specific target to also subcontract 30% of 
the total contract value to small businesses.  An SD partner 
could be a larger business as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I am just trying to check.  If I get a 
contract, as you have said for one billion rand.  And I am 
20 
required to make sure that 45% goes to supply development.  
Is that right? 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is R 450 000,00? 
MS STRYDOM:   Ja. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 203 of 222 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now that means I am left with about, what, 
55.  And then I must still take 30% and give to another 
sector, small business.   
MS STRYDOM:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then what do... then what I am remaining 
with to do? 
MS STRYDOM:   The way supply development is structured 
and I am not an expert in this, for EPCM – so for the 
professional services because it is professional services, 
Transnet identified specific areas, SD areas that they – 
10 
because they wanted to develop a supply base.   
 
So for instance, technology transfer.  You look at skills 
transfer.  So the main contractors had to be able to indicate 
how they spend this money.   
 
So it is in the project still.  So let us say, they do design 
work to design a bus or a terminal ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I understand that. 
MS STRYDOM:   Ja, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean, I am in business.  I want to make 
money.  I do not mind, you know, sharing the work with 
20 
others and let them have part of the cake.  But on this, it just 
looks to me like I am going to be left with 25% of the work.  I 
am just wondering, is that viable in terms of business? 
MS STRYDOM:   It will not necessarily be 25% of the work.  
As I have indicated, the SD targets and that the... what 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 204 of 222 
 
would... the percentage that had to be contracted to small 
businesses, have to be separated.   
 
But it is a fact that the JV’s, where in the past they 
would have had the full scope of the project, they enjoyed 
much less in terms of the actual scope of work.   
 
So they had to bring in more partners and other 
businesses to assist them in completing the work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe at some stage, maybe 
another witness or some other document will explain it 
better. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Chairman, I was going to suggest.  
Perhaps, like you did with the previous witness.  We could 
ask Ms Strydom to provide a supplementary affidavit where 
she perhaps ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...explains this practically. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It seems that the technical jargon we 
have and we know where it comes from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Perhaps to answer your questioning 
particular.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think so. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That how does this actually leave the 
...[intervenes]  
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 205 of 222 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, at a practical level.  Ja, if she can do 
a supplementary affidavit, I think that would be helpful. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  So Ms Strydom, let us go 
then to paragraph 52.  You talk about the fact that: 
“In September/October 2014, TCP established an 
Integrated Tender Evaluation Team.” 
 
Is that right? 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you explain that, please? 
MS STRYDOM:   The Integrated Tender Evaluation Team had 
10 
representation from TCP, from the Operating Divisions, from 
main disciplines such as Commercial Procurement, et cetera.  
So 
it 
was 
a 
representative 
Transnet 
team 
that 
was 
established. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now if we go over the page, you 
have spoken about contractors forming JVs and here you 
deal with two of them.  Which are they?  Did Hatch form a 
JV? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes, sorry, that would be on the next 
page.  Apologies.  Yes, so the - in terms of the size of the 
20 
scope as well as the SD requirements, etcetera, most 
companies formed JVs.  Hatch, Mott MacDonald and Oricon 
formed a JV for the [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well actually there were four parties 
that formed that JV.  Just have a look please at paragraph 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 206 of 222 
 
53.   It was Hatch... 
MS STRYDOM:   Oricon, Mott MacDonald and Theatuta(?) 
JV. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And in this affidavit you refer to that 
as H2N. 
MS STRYDOM:   H2N, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then was another JV formed? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes, the other JV, main JV, FLAG, Fluor 
Aecom and Gibb.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And that is known by the acronym 
10 
FLAG. 
MS STRYDOM:   FLAG, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you go on to say that they were 
identified as the preferred bidders for both rail phase two 
and Port phase two. 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct, both parties were 
informed that they were preferred bidders for rail and port 
and 
that 
the 
negotiations 
would 
consider 
both, 
the 
submissions then for both. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, let us then deal with those 
20 
negotiations and you deal with them at paragraph 54. 
MS STRYDOM:   The negotiation process was led by Ms 
Corli Janse van Rensburg from TCP, she was in the 
procurement department supported by the TCP project 
director for manganese at that stage, Velelisi Skosana and 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 207 of 222 
 
Mr Edward Thomas who was in the Group Supply Chain 
office at that stage.  McKinsey was heavily involved.  The 
venue was set up in such a way that McKinsey had a back 
office right throughout the negotiation period where they 
could follow the proceedings.  The intention with having 
them there, given that they were heavily involved in 
developing 
the 
negotiation 
on 
contracting 
strategies 
initially was to then debrief with a steering committee after 
the proceedings or closing the proceedings every day and 
then agreed on a new negotiation strategy for the following 
10 
day. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And who did that negotiation 
steering committee comprise of? 
MS STRYDOM:   Anoj Singh, Gary Pita, Herbert Nsigala 
and Mohamed Mohamedy. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Can you remember when these 
negotiations commenced? 
MS 
STRYDOM: 
 
 
It 
commenced 
during 
late 
October/November. 
 
That 
was 
towards 
the 
end 
of 
November, the end of 2014. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   During the course of those 
negotiations can you recall having been contacted by Mr 
Bester? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes, I can recall.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And was that a telephonic discussion 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 208 of 222 
 
or did you meet with him in person? 
MS STRYDOM:   Telephonic discussion. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What did he convey to you during 
the course of this telephonic discussion? 
MS STRYDOM:   He indicated to me that he was asked by 
Mr Reddy, the same Mr Reddy, to attend a meeting with Mr 
Salim Essa on Mr Reddy’s instance at a local restaurant. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry, please can you speak up? 
MS STRYDOM:   Ja.  He was requested by – my apologies, 
he was requested by Mr Dave Reddy to attend a meeting 
10 
with Mr Salim Essa at a local restaurant which would have 
been in Sandton area, thereabouts. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So he told you that he attends this 
meeting? 
MS STRYDOM:   yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright, with Reddy and Mr Essa? 
MS STRYDOM:   Mr Essa, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did he explain to you what happened 
during the course of this meeting?  Did he report to you?   
What happened? 
20 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes, he indicated to me that Mr Essa 
spoke about his relationship with Mr Singh that they had a 
lot of power, a lot of influence, that they had access to any 
and all tenders.  Ja, so he was very open about his 
relationship with Anoj and, you know, the power that they 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 209 of 222 
 
wielded. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes and did he report anything else 
to you? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes, he also indicated to me that Mr Essa 
then insisted on H2N, the JV, including his company.  So, 
as a designated SD partner in the phase two project, the 
phase two rail project.  So he also – it is my interpretation 
of what was said, he then proposed to H2N  that they can 
pay what is tantamount to a bribe of about R80 million and 
for that 80 million he can secure the contract for them.  He 
10 
has the ability to ensure that they will then get the 
contract. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I just want to take you to paragraph 
55 because there seemed to have been some corruption 
with track changes.  Three lines from the bottom: 
“According to Mr Bester, at the meeting Essa spoke 
of him and Singh having a lot of power.” 
That you have dealt with. 
“Mentioned that they had access to all tenders.  
Insisted on H2N including designated phase 2 
20 
tender submission.” 
There seems to be some words missing there, would you 
confirm that? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   How ought it to read? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 210 of 222 
 
MS STRYDOM:   It should read: 
“Insisted on H2N including his company…” 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That being Essa’s company? 
MS STRYDOM:   That being Essa’s company. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes? 
MS STRYDOM:   “…designated ST partner in the phase 2  
submission.” 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But you recall Mr Bester saying that 
to you? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then you go on to say: 
“And propose that H2N pay a bribe of 80 million to 
secure the contract.” 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes, I can recall the value specifically, 
yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And did Mr Bester go into any detail 
about that? 
MS STRYDOM:   No, no, he did not indicate how that would 
be paid. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could I ask you then please to deal 
20 
with paragraph 56? 
MS STRYDOM:   On the matter of a bribe it is possible to 
create a surplus in a project of this nature and, you know, 
with the quantums of money that we are working with, 
either by increasing the contract value during negotiations 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 211 of 222 
 
or post negotiations, after award.  So you have to have 
access to the contract value in order to manipulate those 
values and that would have to be done internally in 
Transnet.  That difference can then be paid out to an SD 
partner.  By then in terms of this project and in terms of 
the dedicated authority for the management of contract 
value, that resided with Gary Pita and Anoj Singh. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you say in this paragraph: 
“On the issue of a bribe as experience has shown it 
is possible to create a surplus of 80 million.” 
10 
You are addressing that because you say he told you of a 
bribe of 80 million on a project of this nature either by 
increasing 
the 
contract 
value 
during 
negotiations 
or 
afterwards or by increasing the delegated contract value 
internally. 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Those are terms of articles. 
MS STRYDOM:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The increase could then be paid out 
to SD partner, and as you mentioned you say significantly 
20 
Pita and Singh were in control of the approval of the 
contract value. 
MS STRYDOM:   That’s correct yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you go on to say I annex hereto 
marked ES8 depicting the increase in value of the port 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 212 of 222 
 
scope, now H2N you know were ultimately awarded the rail 
part. 
MS STRYDOM:   That’s right yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So this Annexures deals not with rail 
but with port? 
MS STRYDOM:   It deals with port. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And it reflects the increase in value, 
and then you say there was no increase in respect of the 
rail scope. 
MS STRYDOM:   That’s correct yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So let’s go there and please to the 
table at VS8 which is at page 217.  So what you are trying 
to show to the Chairperson is that on the basis of an 
analysis of this table and figures it would have been 
possible, on your view, to increase the rail component by 
R80million? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes, that’s correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Please explain then the table. 
MS STRYDOM:   The – in terms of the approved budget 
initial that is the value as per the cost estimate in a 
20 
business case, for the respective packages, contract 
approval before negotiation that is based on the value of 
the bid received from that bidder, so the table is an 
example of the actual numbers received, so 810 would be 
the rail – the value received from the Rail JV and 519 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 213 of 222 
 
value received from the Port JV at that stage.   DCV before 
negotiations is your delegated consent or contract value 
before negotiations, that is normally a percentage of your 
original budget estimate which is a value within which the 
negotiating team can negotiate, it gives them those 
parameters.    
 
You then – you have a risk allowance so based on 
your original estimate plus your delegated value before 
negotiations you have some money left, based – which is 
then a surplus of the risk allowance.  You then negotiate.

Following the negotiations the DCD after negotiations is 
then the final value as negotiated with this specific party 
and the value within which the project team can then 
manage that specific package.   In this case the DCD after 
negotiation for rail went down and from 1063 to 776 and for 
port it went up from 519 to 751.  So effectively the final 
surplus after risk allowance if you add the numbers back, 
effectively if you have your 751 and plus the 80 it should 
give you the original 832, so that’s what you have left in 
the project. 
20 
 
So the total saving on the port project, because that 
surplus after risk allowance is funds that have to be 
available in a project, with zero, and on the rail side there 
was a saving of – a significant saving made, so effectively 
all I am trying to illustrate is with these processes you are 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 214 of 222 
 
able to manipulate, I am not saying this is what was done, 
you can change values for some or other means. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   If we just go back to paragraph 57 
because the lawyers and I amongst them are better with 
words than in figures, would you explain that in words at 
56, you say you can create a surplus of 80 on a project of 
this nature, either by increasing the contract value during 
negotiations or afterwards or by increasing the delegated 
contract value.  Is that right? 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I assume the delegated contract 
value is DCV. 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And where do we find the contract 
value figure. 
MS STRYDOM:   So the contract value will be the final 
value. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
MS STRYDOM:   And the way that you can play with the 
risk allowance is in both. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   When you say final value which 
value is that? 
MS STRYDOM:   That will be the value at the bottom of the 
table, 
so 
that 
was 
the 
final 
value 
agreed 
to 
after 
negotiations. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 215 of 222 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Those are the figures that are 
highlighted in red? 
MS STRYDOM:   Correct.  And it clearly indicates that for 
rail the DCV went down and for port the DCV went up after 
negotiations. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   The point is though that on those 
figures in rail there was enough fat for want of a better 
description, to have paid out in some other way R80million 
and still one could balance the book so to speak. 
MS STRYDOM:   Correct yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Because ultimately there was a 
surplus of 177. 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  At paragraph 57 of your 
affidavit at page 153 you say there are other aspects of 
your interaction with Mr Bester that warrant mention, what 
are they? 
MS STRYDOM:   He also mentioned to me that following 
the first meeting with Mr Essa there was a subsequent 
meeting with Mr Essa where Anoj Singh was present as 
20 
well, I don’t know the details of what was discussed during 
that session.   He also informed me at some point that the 
PCP Project Director, Mr Sikosana, was fairly aggressive 
with him and used very foul language with him, at some 
point during the negotiation process. 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 216 of 222 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You say Mr Bester told you about a 
subsequent meeting, are you sure it was a subsequent one 
with Essa and Singh if you have regard to the text at 
paragraph 57. 
MS STRYDOM:   It was a meeting, it could have been prior 
to the first one, I can recall that there was a meeting where 
Mr Singh was ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But you don’t know which side of the 
meeting with Essa that he reported to you ...[intervenes]  
MS STRYDOM:   Correct yes, I don[‘t know the details of 
10 
when these thinkings took place. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   When you draw a conclusion in 
paragraph 58 what is That? 
MS STRYDOM:   Based on what was happening in the 
project it was very, very clear to me that there was a large 
network involved, inside and outside Transnet, and I 
mention McKinsey specifically as well who secured tenders 
to the benefit of a few, it was – apologies. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Please talk to the judge. 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes it was my view given the discussions 
20 
that we had with ...[indistinct], the experiences with Mr 
McKinsey in the product that there was a network involved 
in properly securing tenders. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright anything else you want to 
mention under that heading? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 217 of 222 
 
MS STRYDOM:   No, I think we have covered most of it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes then let’s deal with the next 
period, the period beyond the award, December 2014 to 
cancellation. 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now you deal in paragraph 60 with 
the fact that H2N was identified as the successful bidder 
for the rail scope and FLAG as the successful bidder for 
the port scope. 
MS STRYDOM:   That’s correct. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then you go on to deal with the 
award to flag, could you address that please? 
MS STRYDOM:   What was quite concerning about the 
award to FLAG was that the award was at an amount that 
was more than R200million higher than the H2N bid for the 
same work, if you can recall both parties – we indicated to 
both parties that we will negotiate for rail and port with 
both.  This was in conflict, to award to another company 
when you have an offer on the table that is R200million 
lower was totally against the Platinum standards where 
20 
ideally you would want to do the opposite, you would want 
to reduce costs as best you can and use every opportunity 
in your project to keep costs as low as possible, so it was 
very, very strange. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Were you opposed to that? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 218 of 222 
 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you voice that opposition at any 
time? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes, we were invited to a meeting, Corli 
van Rensburg and I, to discuss this matter prior to 
submitting the final recommendations for the scopes.  The 
meeting was attended by Garry Pita, Mohamed Mohamedy 
and Prakash Kapoor from McKinsey where they put a case 
forward based on business risk to award the phase to – the 
port scope to FLAG at a higher price, so there was a risk 
10 
mitigation discussion and reasons given why the project 
had to be awarded at R200million in excess of H2N’s offer 
to FLAG. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what stance did you adopt? 
MS STRYDOM:   We were against this because it wasn’t 
consistent with the procurement processes which after you 
have done your ST and technical qualification then price 
becomes the next qualifier. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And when you say you are referring 
to you and who else? 
20 
MS STRYDOM:   Corli van Rensburg. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   During this period beyond the award 
did McKinsey remain involved? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could you deal with that please? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 219 of 222 
 
MS STRYDOM:   So despite the contract negotiation with 
the 
EPCM 
companies 
they 
remained 
involved 
in 
amendments to the contract documentation and it was a 
continuous process, it was as if Anoj Singh continuously 
tried to seek opportunities for McKinsey to improve and 
amend the contracts.  Obviously this was very difficult for 
the EPCM’s, the last change that McKinsey introduced to 
the contracts resulted in the EPCM’s never signing the 
contract, both EPCM’s never signed the contract, and this 
exposed Transnet to future litigation, so the fact that they 
10 
continuously made changes unilaterally at the end of the – 
of concluding the negotiations unilaterally made changes 
resulted in contracts that were unsigned effectively. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You then go on to deal with the 
cancellation of the contract when did that happen, and how 
did it come about? 
MS STRYDOM:   We cancelled the contract in March 2017, 
the prevailing market conditions, both for Transnet from a 
financial perspective as well as for the manganese industry 
at that stage led to us questioning the or the industry 
20 
questioning the affordability of this expansion and we then 
put forward a recommendation to the Transnet Exco, 
Capital 
Investment 
Committee, 
that 
the 
contract 
be 
terminated, put on hold and with the view that we need to 
terminate.  So it was for reasons stated in the contract, the 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 220 of 222 
 
contract made provision for situations such as these from a 
business environment perspective.   
 
So that was effectively two and a half years after, 
not even, three years after the work started on the 
contract. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You say at paragraph 67 that you 
personally managed the cancellation of the contract? 
MS STRYDOM:   That is correct.  I took over if you can 
recall I was with Group Planning, Programme Director 
there, and PCP was executing the project, at that stage I 
10 
took over the manganese expansion programme in full, 
PCP was restructured to form a new unit called Transnet 
Group Capital and Mr Kris Reddy was heading it up then 
appointed me to take care of the manganese expansion 
and Mr Sikosana was moved to other projects, so I 
personally led the cancellation of the contract together 
with Ms Andra du Toit who was from the legal team. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then finally you deal with the 
reporting of irregularities did you at a point in time report 
your suspicions and concerns? 
20 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   When was that? 
MS STRYDOM:   Towards the end of 2014, so specifically 
on Phase 2 I reported what transpired on Phase 1 and 
Phase 2 to Mr Brandy May, he was head of forensics, the 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 221 of 222 
 
forensics at Transnet Freight Rail at that stage.  I met with 
him at TFR’s lawyers’ offices, lawyers that they use in 
Oxford Road, and following it was a more than five hour 
conversation, following that meeting I had no feedback 
from him until such time as the – in 2018 the forensics 
department in PGC approached him to request copies of 
the recording of the meeting from him, he indicated to them 
that he destroyed it as he felt the matter wasn’t relevant to 
TFR at that stage. 
 
So I reported it because it was the right thing to do. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You had also previously just remind 
us you had reported it to your line manager? 
MS STRYDOM:   Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   When you were dealing with Phase 
1? 
MS STRYDOM:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then you say that you raised 
that with Mr Reddy? 
MS STRYDOM:   That’s correct, I reported to Mr Reddy in 
Group Planning, he was appointed as the new Head of 
20 
Transnet Group Capital, this matter was raised with Mr 
Reddy and he immediately referred it to the SIU for 
investigation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And are you aware of what the 
status of that investigation is? 
20 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 287 
 
Page 222 of 222 
 
MS STRYDOM:   Not at all. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Chairman subject to the witness 
providing the Commission with the affidavit that we spoke 
about, and I suppose for the sake of completeness perhaps 
Ms Strydom in that affidavit you can also just make the 
correction to paragraph 55 that you have dealt with. 
 
Apart from that those are our questions.  Thank 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Right thank you.  Thank you very much 
Ms Strydom for coming to give evidence you are excused, 
10 
you have homework to do, you will let us have the 
supplementary affidavits within the time that Mr Myburgh 
will tell you about. 
 
Thank you very much, you are excused. 
MS STRYDOM:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is all for today Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then tomorrow it is Mr ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Laher. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.   We are going to 
20 
adjourn, and tomorrow we start at ten.   
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 21 OCTOBER 2020
