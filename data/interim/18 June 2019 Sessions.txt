PROCEEDINGS ON 18 JUNE 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Hofmeyr, good morning everybody. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Are you ready? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  During the course of today 
the intention is the receive evidence from two witnesses, Ms Nhantsi 
and Mr Mahlangu they are both present.  They are also legally 
represented so I would like to take a moment if I may to allow their 
10 
legal representatives to place themselves on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Let them do so. 
ADV SANDANATHI GWINA:  Thank you Mr Commissioner my name 
Sandanathi Gwina from Gwina Attorneys I act for Mr Mahlangu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Mr Gwina. 
ADV NOSANDISO SOVITI ZWEDALA:  Thank you Mr Commissioner my 
name is Advocate Nosandiso Soviti Zwedala I act on behalf of Phumeza 
Nhantsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.   
ADV NOSANDISO SOVITI ZWEDALA:  Thank you very much. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair there are a few procedural aspects just to 
deal with in advance of the witness being sworn in if I may. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 3 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The first of those just relate to the time frames 
within which we have received the statements of the witnesses you will 
hear from today.  Ms Nhantsi’s statement was received in enough time 
to follow the Rule 3.3 processes and so those have been followed in 
relation to her statement.  Insofar as Mr Mahlangu is concerned his 
statement was received on Friday afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is just before the long weekend.  The 
consequence of that is that it has not yet been possible. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To follow a Rule 3.3 process in relation to Mr 
Mahlangu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But we have a proposal in that regard Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The first point to note is that almost all of the 
persons who are implicated at all on the basis of the statement of Mr 
Mahlangu have been previously implicated in the evidence of Ms 
Stimpel and Ms Nhantsi so they have received notification. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In relation to the facts of this evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And in many respects overlap with the respects 
in which they are referenced in Mr Mahlangu’s statement.  Chair the 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 4 of 266 
 
second point we wish to make in relation to that procedural aspect is 
that it would be our proposal in relation to Mr Mahlangu’s evidence that 
it be received today and that if in due course it becomes necessary to 
issue 3.10 or Regulation 10.6 Directives arising from his evidence that 
will then be a process that can be followed by the commission if there 
are particular aspects of his evidence which require the commission to 
know what the version is of other persons in relation to that evidence.  
What I can state on record though is that those persons who have 
already received 3.3 Notices in relation to Ms Nhantsi and Ms Stimpel’s 
evidence have not applied to cross-examine bar the two applications 
10 
that you have already been alerted to Chair that is the application from 
Mr Zwane to cross-examine Ms Stimpel as well as Ms Nhatsi to cross-
examine Ms Stimpel but we have already dealt with the process in 
relation to that aspect.  So Chair that is our proposal for the way 
forward today but of course we seek your direction in that regard.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well obviously from what you have said there is no 
problem arising from Ms Nhantsi’s one but there are concerns in regard 
to Mr Mahlangu.  When I read Mr Mahlangu’s statement – well I did not 
have information as to whether the Rule 3.3 Notices had been sent out 
or not and when they had been sent out but I had a concern as to 
20 
whether some of the issues that appear to be in dispute between 
himself and Ms Stimpel whether they might not have been resolved if 
there had been time for Ms Stimpel to look at Ms Mahlangu’s statement 
and apply her mind to certain issues because of them may be – might 
be based on some misunderstanding just so that we know what is really 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 5 of 266 
 
seriously contested between the two of them.  I had that concern so 
one there is that concern and two while there may be – it might be an 
important factor in terms of what is to be done that the persons that he 
may be implicating are persons who have been implicated by other 
witnesses and they have not applied for leave to cross-examine.  We 
have to con – we have to always keep our eyes on consistency. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Last week when Mr Nxasana was testifying counsel 
for Ms Jiba approached the court and expressed Ms Jiba’s concern that 
she had not been served with a 3.3.Notice.  And the result was that I 
10 
decided that the evidence that would implicate Ms Jiba and others in 
matters that were not already in the public domain in the sense of 
being in affidavits in matters that are pending in court or that have 
already been decided in court or in judgments should not be covered 
until at a later stage.  Now in doing so a very important factor in my 
mind was the fact that Ms Jiba has apparently not been notified at all of 
not notified in time even of the fact that there was a witness who was 
going to be giving evidence and implicating her.  And that thinking was 
in this context that  
1. The Rule 3.3. process contemplates that if a person is going  to 
20 
be implicated or is implicated in a statement or in evidence to be 
given by a witness that person must be given a Rule 3.3 Notice 
that tell him or her of that fact or possibility and it gives that 
person – it also tells that person that he or she may attend the 
proceedings on the date when that witness give evidence or have 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 6 of 266 
 
counsel and that he or she may apply for leave to cross-examine 
the witness or to lead evidence himself or herself or to call 
witnesses. 
Now there is a provision in the – in that Rule 3.3 Notice which says:  If 
an implicated person or a person who has been served with a Rule 3.3 
Notice believes that the time that has been afforded him or her before 
the witness comes before the commission to give evidence is 
inadequate then they may apply to the commission for such relief as 
may be necessary to ensure that they are not seriously prejudiced.  
Now the way that things have happened since August has been such 
10 
that no witness has been cross-examined on the same day that they 
give evidence so arrangements have to be made all the time and 
persons who need to apply for leave to cross-examine have had ample 
time – have been given ample time to make that application and so on.  
But what has happened is that sometimes the Rule 3.3 Notices have 
been served on implicated persons in circumstances where those 
persons will not get 14 days within which to apply and – but where 
nevertheless they received the Rule 3.3 Notices and therefore they 
know that they will be implicated by somebody they know when that 
person will be giving evidence.  One of the factors that has weighed 
20 
with me is that at least they were aware that somebody is going to give 
evidence and implicating them.  They were aware in advance. They 
could come and sit and hear and listen.  They could brief counsel, 
instructing attorney to come and sit and listen.  At least they will not be 
– they will not have a situation where they may be driving and find that 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 7 of 266 
 
on the new, on radio they hear somebody is implicating them of 
something and they had no idea whatsoever.  So part of the concern 
last week with regard to the matter relating to Ms Jiba was that as I 
understood the position she had not even been alerted that somebody 
will be giving evidence.  Now coming then to Mr Mahlangu’s situation it 
seems that except for one issue his situation may be in the same 
position as that of Ms Jiba.  The one issue which might distinguish the 
two is that as you say the persons that Mr Mahlangu implicates are 
persons who have been implicated by other witnesses and therefore 
have been – or are aware of allegations against them having been 
10 
made.  So that is that.  But I still remain concerned if they are not 
aware even by way of a phone call that somebody will be giving 
evidence and maybe somebody different may be giving evidence.  So I 
am concerned about that and the other – the other matter that I raised 
namely to what extent we should have a situation where the other 
persons who have given evidence or is it one – oh it is two I think, who 
have given evidence if they get to see Mr Mahlangu’s statement and 
maybe somebody in the legal team takes them through to see in regard 
to which issues maybe there could be common ground.  You know 
sometimes you say one thing and then somebody brings in a different 
20 
perspective and you  see it from a different angle you say okay now I 
understand that and then – so that we can remain with only those that 
are seriously contested.  So those are my concerns.  I do not know 
what you might have to say? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair if I may address each of the issues that 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 8 of 266 
 
you have raised?  If we can start with the question of the witnesses 
who have already testified who may be referenced in the Mr Mahlangu’s 
statements.  Chair it is unfortunate that the statement was only 
received last Friday.  There had been detailed engagements with Mr 
Mahlangu in advance of that and this point in particular was put to Mr 
Mahlangu because the disadvantage if we got it later than the evidence 
of Ms Stimpel and Mr Van Der Merwe was precisely that we would not 
be able to put contrary version to him. So that – that certainly was 
made known.  Insofar as how to manage it however Chair it is our 
submission that certainly in relation to Ms Stimpel I will check again 
10 
before Mr Mahlangu’s evidence but I do not regard anything that he 
says about the processes in SAA requiring her response.  Mr … 
CHAIRPERSON:  At least I see she is here I think. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed she is so that – she can also indicate to 
us in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja at least she is attending. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  She is attending. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Van Der Merwe is different.  There is a – 
there is a contrary version in relation to some aspects of what Mr Van 
Der 
Merwe 
said 
and 
there 
are 
also 
one 
or 
two 
pieces 
of 
correspondence.  You will recall in the course of Mr Van Der Merwe’s 
testimony we asked him if he could go back and check his records for 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 9 of 266 
 
correspondence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  He undertook to do so but we have now found 
another source. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of some of that correspondence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is certainly our suggestion in that regard that 
after Mr Mahlangu’s evidence we engage again with Mr Van Der Merwe.  
We put those documents to him and we ask him for an account.  At that 
10 
stage on affidavit so we can assess it and if necessary there can be a 
recall of witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But certainly that aspect  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The fact that Mr Mahlangu’s evidence is coming 
later than those two witnesses it is our submission that there is a 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  By which that can be dealt with. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair if I may then go to the question of Mr 
Maglangu’s evidence today? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let me – let me just make sure I understand 
with regard to Mr Van Der Merwe? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 10 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mahlangu’s statement you say does implicate him? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or may implicate him? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It gives a version 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  At least in relation to certain interactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Between Grissag AG and BNP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Which were not able to be put to Mr Van Der 
Merwe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So his account of whether indeed certain 
meetings that are referred to in the correspondence did or did not take 
place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That has – that has not been put to Mr Van Der 
Merwe because that information came to us on Friday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So he would – it is not so much implication. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it is a response. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As response and getting to the truth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the facts 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 11 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  About what happened at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We would need his account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For what Mr Mahlangu traverses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So it is a response to what… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To what Mr Van Der Merwe may have said. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed, indeed. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Mahlangu received Mr Van Der Merwe’s 
statement in advance  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of him providing his statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So he was able to respond to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Provide further insight. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And documents which were not previously in 
the commission’s possession. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But that came in literally  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 12 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  While Mr Van Der Merwe was giving the 
evidence on Friday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So our suggestion there is that we will need to 
ask for Mr Van Der Merwe’s response 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To the extent that that applies to Ms Stimpel 
similarly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then we can make an assessment about 
10 
whether further oral testimony is required at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what is your submission on whether in regard to 
that Mr Mahlangu – Mr Maglangu should cover that today or should 
leave it for later? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  He may leave it for later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What – because he would come back – he may have 
to come back anyway. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  That is certainly something that we 
can do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In relation to that aspect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We could carve out – it is a fairly small respect 
in which he references Mr Van Der Merwe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have – you have a better idea of how serious an 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 13 of 266 
 
implication it is. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No it is a point of discrepancy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: In relation to certain facts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But in the scheme of Mr Mahlangu’s evidence 
they are fairly minoe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes.  Okay.  Well in relation to Mr Mahlangu 
– Mr Van Der Merwe  
1. You say Mr Mahlangu’s statement is a response to… 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Mr Van Der Merwe’s statement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  That is 1. 
2.  You say it is really a minor kind of discrepancy in their versions. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As I read his statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you understand it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. And – and is it but one issue? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  One or two issues?  One or two issues? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is – only one or two and it is principally 
about engagements between Grissag 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And BNP Capital. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 14 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ys. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Who those engagements were with.  You will 
recall part of Mr Van Der Merwe’s evidence was he could not recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Who he was speaking to any point in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What Mr Mahlangu has provided us with is 
some correspondence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Between Mr Mgadi. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Mr Van Der Merwe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Mgadi is somebody who will feature in the 
evidence today both of Ms Nhantsi and Mr Mahlangu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it is of that order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then it is a few details about meetings that 
were going to be arranged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  After the date of the 8 t h June. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 15 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Van Der Merwe’s evidence really stopped on 
the 8 t h June.  That is when he attended at SAA and that term sheet was 
signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But Mr Mahlangu’s evidence tends to indicate 
that there may have been later interactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And so that would need to be probed with Mr 
Van Der Merwe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But… 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is the gist of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – but the implication might be nothing more than 
there is a different version. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That Mr Van Der Merwe’s evidence might not have 
been true. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes or accurate in some respects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not – or accurate. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nothing more than that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not as I read the statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If Mr Mahlangu thinks that there is more 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In the implication he can tell us. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 16 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But certainly as I have read it those are the 
issues of discrepancy in versions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And well with regard to Mr Stimpel I think that can be 
sorted out. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because she is here. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes it can.  The principle issue there again as I 
10 
read the statement relates to the question of the success fee that was 
going to be made paid to be BNP had they successfully sourced the 
funds.  That is an issue that was extensively dealt with by Mr Stimpel 
because Ms Nhantsi has a contrary version on that.  And so that issue 
has been debated but again Ms Stimpel is here and if there is need for 
response we can – we can certainly pursue that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now this regard to Mr Mahlangu’s evidence in relation 
to Ms Stimpel I think I can allow that because obviously Ms Stimpel is 
aware that Mr Mahlangu is giving evidence today. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  She is here.  So that concern which I talked about is 
taken care of.  And with regard to Mr Van Der Merwe you say this is a 
response to his own statement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that – and that is also a factor.  But let us see 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 17 of 266 
 
how we deal with it.  Maybe that on your feet you might just have to 
exercise your mind about cover it or not covering it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Until he comes back but there is something to be said 
if it is a response.  It is just a different version. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja so – so let us proceed and you can exercise 
your discretion as to whether to – you want to ask if I – if in the 
process … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes indeed. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we should exclude it I will let you know. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the fact that it is a response to Mr Van Der 
Merwe’s statement and it is a minor issue at least as you see it is an 
important factor. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am indebted to you Chair for that direction I 
will bear it mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I can then deal with the question of Mr 
Mahlangu’s evidence and implicated persons potential and the 
20 
approach there.  Chair as I have it there are really three reasons why 
Rule 3.3 Notices are given.  They are given to alert witnesses that they 
are to be implicated – at least persons that they are to be implicated in 
evidence.  It is to give them an opportunity to attend and to make 
application to cross-examine.  Those are really as I see it the three 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 18 of 266 
 
principle reasons.  I would like to address each of them and submit to 
you Chair that those are not compromised if we were to proceed with 
Mr Mahlangu’s evidence today.  The reason for that is the following: 
The People who are principally implicated in Mr Mahlangu’s evidence 
have previously received Rule 3.3 Notices.   The consequence of that is 
that they knew evidence relating to these matters commenced on 
Thursday last week through the evidence of Ms Stimpel and then Mr 
Van Der Merwe.  In the course of that hearing last week Chair there 
was mention made on a number of occasions that Mr Mahlangu would 
be testifying today that was specifically reference I think in the course 
10 
of Friday’s hearing.  So anyone who had been alerted to Ms Stimpel’s 
evidence would be aware and were watching Ms Stimpel’s evidence 
would be aware that Mr Mahlangu was testifying today.  Of course at 
the point that that statement was made it was because Mr Mahlangu 
had been summonsed.  We still were not in receipt of the statement.  
But that fact has been publicly made known.  Chair the second aspect 
is in the world of technological advance the right to be present in this 
room is not as critical as it might otherwise be.  Chair as you well know 
these proceedings are video-taped, they are available on line. The 
transcript goes up the next day and so the ability to understand the 
20 
evidence that is given is not as critically needed to be complied with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  By presence in the room. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And Chair insofar as….And Chair insofar as… 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 19 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think – I think the – the – once the person is aware 
that somebody will be giving evidence on a certain date implicating 
them I think that is the most critical. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because even if you might not be able to attend – if 
you are aware you might be able to have access to the proceedings in 
other ways. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course as one says that one has to bear in 
mind that there are still lots of people who might not have access to … 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To a lot of things that others have. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Agreed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – but in all probability the people we are talking 
about here do not fall into that category.  But… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly… 
CHAIRPERSON:  We just have to keep that you know in the back of our 
minds.  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair if I may make a proposal in that regard?  
Because you reference particularly the possibility of at least a 
20 
telephone call to alert persons.  Mr Mahlangu is not due to testify first 
today.  Ms Nhantsi will and she will take some portion of the day.  In 
that regard my suggestion is that we take steps during the course of 
this morning to notify the persons.  There are persons for whom the 
commission has got contact details because they have been previous 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 20 of 266 
 
recipients of earlier Rule 3.3 Notices and with your leave I suggest we 
make those attempts and I can report back to you at an appropriate 
time as to the success of that notification.  But my principle submission 
is that those recipients of previous 3.3 Notices know that this evidence 
was starting last week.  Know that Mr Mahlangu was coming.  The only 
question would be well they even know that he was coming today so 
that – they would be aware of that fact as well Chair.  But to the extent 
that you deem it necessary we can make endeavours to make that 
contact in the course of the morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that – that is fine.  I think for what it is worth let 
10 
those endeavours be made but from what you say it does appear that it 
is a matter where we can proceed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am not cutting you short. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair thank you.  Chair then just in relation to 
one or two other procedural matters.  There are a few documents that 
have been handed up this morning to me by Ms Nhantsi in relation to 
her testimony and one additional document in relation to Mr 
Mahlangu’s. I beg leave at the appropriate point to hand those up to 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 21 of 266 
 
you Chair.  There is also a question in relation to documents that Mr 
Mahlangu received over the weekend from the commission which were 
relevant after we had received the statement.  There is an aspect there 
I have dealt with his legal representative and him about that this 
morning and I will place that on record but I propose to do that just in 
advance of Mr Mahlangu’s evidence and not at the outset now if that is 
convenient Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  No that is fine.  There is a person that Mr 
Mahlangu mentions frequently in his statement that appears to have 
played quite an important role in his company. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to BNP and SAA. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether that one is aware that Mr 
Mahlangu will be giving evidence?  They were working on the same 
side. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.   
CHAIRPERSON:  During those… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair he received notice of Ms Nhantsi’s 
evidence. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Has received the full statement and annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of Ms Nhantsi’s evidence 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 22 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  He features prominently in her evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  He would also had he been – he was also 
implicated in Ms Stimpel’s evidence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And so – no I – I stand corrected there.  He 
was not implicated in Ms Stimpel’s evidence but he did receive … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But he did received notification of Ms Nhantsi’s 
evidence … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And so to the extent that he was taking note of 
the proceedings last week.  He would have been alerted to 
Mr Mahlangu’s appearance … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But insofar as those calls will be made … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  My suggestion is that we start with them … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  This morning. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Of course Mr Mahlangu’s statement 
suggests that he was the one who wrote letters and … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did – played a certain role. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 23 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  There maybe – there may be room for interpretation 
that Mr Mahlangu is not necessarily saying he was involved … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In anything … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Wrong … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he is saying to the extent that he may have been 
involved in anything wrong Mr Mahlangu was unaware … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I think maybe he must be one of those who must 
be notified. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair we will take those steps and I will report 
back in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If I may just take a moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Chair if I may then ask for 
Ms Nhantsi to be sworn in. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 24 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Please administer the oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full name for the record. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Phumeza Nhantsi. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed 
oath? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I do not have any objections. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that all the evidence that you will 
10 
give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth if so 
please raise your right hand and say so help me God. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  So help me God. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  (duly sworn, states) 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You may proceed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR: 
 
Ms Nhantsi 
just 
in 
relation 
to 
some 
housekeeping matters you have before you a file which contains your 
20 
statement, annexures and additional documents which you have 
previously been provided with.  Chair for the purposes of the record 
may I request that this be marked EXHIBIT DD2 as is referenced on the 
spine of the file? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The lever arch file containing Ms Nhantsi’s statement 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 25 of 266 
 
will be marked EXHIBIT DD2. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair there will also be cause in the course of 
Ms Nhantsi’s evidence to refer to one or two aspects of the statement 
of Mr Mahlangu and so for record purposes if we could just enter that in 
as EXHIBIT DD4 as is referenced on the spine. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
The 
lever 
arch 
file 
containing 
Mr Pholisani Daniel Mahlangu is to be marked EXHIBIT DD4. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair and Ms Nhantsi just to 
orientate you – you have a box of files next to you.  Those contain the 
bundles of witness statements and evidence other than your own.  At 
10 
appropriate points I will ask you to – to take them out and I may refer 
you to aspects of them. 
Just to orientate you.  Ms Stimpel’s statement is represented 
over three files.  They are called DD1A, B and C.  So I will make that 
reference to you to know which file to look at – at any point and then 
you have just been alerted to the fact that Mr Mahlangu’s exhibit will be 
DD4.  If you have any concerns let us know in the course of the 
evidence. 
Ms Nhantsi if we could then go to your statement which is in 
EXHIBIT DD2 and if you turn to page 1 of that statement – at least that 
20 
bundle.  That is the first page of the statement as I have it and then if 
you turn on page 23 that is the last page as I have it.  Can you confirm 
that that is your signature appearing on that page? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair I can confirm that it is my 
signature. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 26 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi I know that you want to make one 
correction in relation to your statement which I will allow you an 
opportunity now to do.  I then will ask you after that correction is made 
whether you confirm the correctness of the facts as they are set out in 
the statement. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  so if we could begin with the correction. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair.  Thank you Chair.  The correction 
which I will apologise is the spelling of Ms Stimpel.  It is supposed to 
be M-P-E-L instead of Stipel.  I apologise for that.  I do have a second 
10 
correction Chair but I am trying to orientate myself with your version of 
– of the statement especially with the pagination.  Just give me one 
second.  There is a – there is a correction that I want to make. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Certainly. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Thank you Chair.  On my statement it is 
PN014.  It is in paragraph 49 Chair.  The sentence starts with: 
“I 
had 
discussed 
my 
concerns 
about 
the 
cancellation fee with other …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am – I am sorry.  Did you say paragraph 49? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Paragraph 49 Chair yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is not on my page 4. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  14 Chair, 1-4. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It is page 1-4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1-4? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Sorry, 1-4 yes. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 27 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes.  The sentence starts with: 
“I 
had 
discussed 
my 
concerns 
about 
the 
cancellation fee with other two Board Members: 
Ms Yakhe Kwinana and Dr Tambi.  In return they 
voted against the cancellation.” 
I would like to make a correction there.  They abstained.  They did not 
vote against.  Thank you Chair.  Those are the corrections that I 
10 
wanted to make. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Ms Nhantsi.  One other point I – I 
should just make clear.  The paragraph numbers on your statement 
were in fact - other than paragraph 1 and two - were added by the 
Commission after receipt of your statement because we had to have a 
way to navigate within it particularly for the purpose of Rule 3.3 
Notices.  I – I take it you do not take issue with that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No.  I do not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I see that at the end of your statement at page 
20 
23 after signing you said yours faithfully. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Because I am not legally acute I am not – 
was - I supposed to say yours sincerely. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 28 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No not – not really.  It is just that it is a statement 
and not a letter. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I was wondering. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Apologise Chair.  I am an accountant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are an accountant? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  No, no I mean there is no issue.  It just 
10 
caught my – my eye. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Nhantsi I would like to 
just begin with for record purposes noting that you have made an 
application to cross-examine Ms Stimpel.  That will be dealt with in due 
course by the Chair.  Did you have an opportunity to watch or otherwise 
follow the evidence of Ms Stimpel and Ms – Mr van der Merwe last 
week? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes.  Through you Chair yes I did have an 
opportunity to watch both Ms Stimpel and Mr van der Merwe. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  That is just helpful for me to know 
because I can make reference then to some of the aspects of what was 
covered in that testimony.  I would like to begin Ms Nhantsi with really 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 29 of 266 
 
your start at SAA and for that purpose if we could turn to page 2 of 
your statement and pick it up at the start of that page.  It is the second 
part of paragraph 4 which begins on the previous page because there I 
have it that you commenced at SAA on 27 November 2015.  Is that 
correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes it is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can you tell us about how you came to be 
appointed at SAA on that date? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair.  I was – I am Phumeza Nhantsi.  A 
qualified chartered accountant.  I was working at Sizwe Ntsaluba 
10 
Gobodo.  It is the accounting firm.  I had an audit that I was doing – the 
joint audit – in fact it was subcontracting with Kwinana & Associates 
Denel.  So Sizwe Ntsaluba Gobodo was the – the main auditors. 
That is how I knew Ms Kwinana.  One of the days she asked 
me that if I would be interested in aviation because I do have 
experience in aviation as I was auditing Denel.  I said it would be a 
nice experience to explore the corporate world and – but she told me 
that they need to follow the – the process as the Board because my 
predecessor – Mr Wolf – left the company.  They are looking for 
secondment at the time. 
20 
She then engaged with the CEO of SNG.  His name is 
Victor Sekese.  One of the days later in the year – I think early -
November I was called by Mr Sekese my CEO to ask if I would be 
interested.  There is an opportunity for secondment.  I said yes.  Whilst 
I was happy with working at SNG I also wanted – I was curious in 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 30 of 266 
 
wanting to explore the corporate world.  So I said yes. 
My understanding and based on the bundle that I saw there 
were three CVs that were sent to SAA and my – my CV was selected 
and I was then called by CEO Victor - Mr Sekese – to come and sign 
the Secondment Agreement which made me to then start at SAA on 
27 November 2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you occupied an Interim CFO position.  Is 
that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  At the time yes.  I was the Interim CFO but I 
was a secondee because I was still paid by SNG.  There was an 
10 
agreement between SNG and SAA on the payment arrangements. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when did your status change from Interim 
CFO? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  My status changed effective 1 May 2017.  
There was a recruitment process that was done by the – the company 
and the Board at the time.  If my memory serves me right the – the 
headhunter agents that they used were Mindcor.  I applied like any 
other candidate and I then qualified.  I was told that I am the one who – 
who was suitable and who won the position.  So I then became 
permanent CFO effective the 1 s t - 1 May 2017. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So would it be correct that until that point you 
were in the secondment position and your title was Interim CFO? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Nhantsi you referenced the fact 
that you are a qualified chartered accountant.  That is also apparent 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 31 of 266 
 
from your statement on page 2.  Ms Nhantsi I take it then that you 
would have a good understanding of the fiduciary duties of Directors to 
companies on which they serve.  Is that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes it is correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What do you understand those fiduciary duties 
to comprise? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I do not know them off by head Chair but one 
of them is I am responsible for the company to safeguard the assets of 
the company and to act in the best interest of the company.  The others 
I would have to refer Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  For present purposes the ones I would 
like to focus on are: 
“Acting in the best interest of the company.” 
So can I understand it that you would have understood at the time and 
do now that that is a key requirement of a Director? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The other one taken from Section 76.3 of the 
Companies Act is: 
“To act in good faith and for a proper purpose.” 
Would you accept that those are duties and you would have been aware 
20 
of those at the time that you took up the CFO position? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes I was aware Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Nhantsi your statement also 
indicates that you – you understood the processes of procurement by 
State Owned Enterprises.  Is that correct?  Is that a fair statement for 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 32 of 266 
 
me to make? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It is.  I fairly understood them. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And was it part of your understanding that the 
general position for state owned companies when they procure services 
is that they must do so pursuant to an open and competitive tender 
process? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair.  When it is practicable to do so 
yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed and so I take it to also have been part 
of your understanding that there might be exceptional circumstances 
10 
where that is not possible.  Is that right? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes, yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But those would have to be justified.  Correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And they would have to be justified within the 
system that has developed within that company for departures from the 
default position.  Correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Fully agree Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would then like to move 
Ms Nhantsi to Mr Masotsha Mngadi. 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because he is a person who features 
prominently in your statement and I would like to just get some 
understanding of your interactions with him, when they commenced, 
how you came to interact with him.  If we can start with when they 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 33 of 266 
 
commenced.  You indicate in your statement and we can go to page 12 
for this at paragraph 40. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You say in the course of that paragraph right at 
the bottom of the page.  You say there: 
“Immediately when I joined SAA the Chairperson of 
the Board gave me Mr Mngadi’s numbers and told 
me that he is an advisor and also if I have any 
questions in the submissions that I was busy with 
for the swap deal I should contact him.  He was 
10 
also given my number by the Chairperson of the 
Board because he contacted me.” 
So can we take it that that occurred shortly after 27 November 2015? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair.  I can confirm.  If I am not 
mistaken I am sure it happened two days after I had joined.  The Chair 
of the Board – Ms Myeni – gave me the number of Mr Mngadi.  At the 
time that I joined SAA the – the Board and Executives were busy with 
the correspondence between the Minister at the time about the swap 
deal. 
So I did not even have a clue of the swap deal but there was 
20 
a letter that was needed to be prepared as a response to the – to the 
Minister of Finance.  So in preparation for that together with the Acting 
CEO Ms Myeni gave me the numbers of Mr Mngadi saying Mr Mngadi is 
his advisor.  He is fully aware of the transaction. 
If I have any questions or after I have drafted the letter I can 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 34 of 266 
 
touch base with him.  He knows the – the transaction.  So before I 
could contact him he contacted me.  Hence I am saying Ms Myeni gave 
him my number. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed and can I take it that you saved those 
details into your phone at the time shortly after you arrived at SAA? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes.  I saved them Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did Mr Mngadi contact you on your cellphone as 
opposed to the work landline? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  He contacted me on my cellphone Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So that is why you say it would have been 
10 
Ms Myeni who would have given him your cell number? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that would be the phone that you saved his 
details into.  Is that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  So that is – perhaps to conclude that is the 
first time that … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I started engaging with him.  I did not know 
him before. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you – you referenced that he was an 
advisor.  Had he been appointed through a procurement process into 
that role? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 35 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I did not ask that question to – to Ms Myeni 
at the time.  I took it the process was done before my time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you ever make inquiries about that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I made inquiries through you Chair and I then 
realised or concluded that he is – Mr Mngadi is his personal advisor 
because when I made inquiries to Ms - Ms Kwinana she told me that it 
is – it is Ms Myeni’s person and because I was making inquiries 
because there was also another person who was the advisor who was 
Mr (indistinct) Nel and I understood that he was appointed through a 
process. 
10 
So I was curious to understand how Mr Mngadi was then 
appointed.  So Ms Kwinana told me that it is – it is Ms Myeni’s person. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can I just clarify?  Does that suggest that there 
was not then a formal process to appoint Mr Mngadi? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  That … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That he was there simply as an advisor that 
Ms Myeni utilised? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  That was my understanding Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And when about did you make that inquiry? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Beginning of January. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of 2016? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Sorry, sorry.  I started 27 November.  I made 
that mid of December. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you say that you were told that Mr Mngadi is 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 36 of 266 
 
his personal advisor.  You mean Ms Myeni’s personal advisor? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  That is what … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what – what you were told? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair.  That is what … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Ms Kwinana told me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So as distinct from being an advisor to the 
company? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  To the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the Board? 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Would you know whether the – what you were 
being told was that Mr Mngadi was Ms Myeni’s advisor in her capacity 
as Chairman of the Board as opposed to maybe to being advisor to the 
Board or that he was Ms Myeni’s personal advisor in whatever matters 
that the two of them decided he would advise her? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or is that something you did not understand? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  How I understood it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Is because with the engagements that I had 
with Mr Mngadi he knew a lot about SAA … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  But I would not say he was – perhaps he was 
his personal because he was not paid via a payroll of SAA. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 37 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  So hence I am saying … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I think Mr Mngadi was his … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was her personal advisor? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Was her personal – yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright and that – and that he was not paid 
through SAA – that is Mr Mngadi – is something you would know of 
course because you were the Interim CFO? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As I understood your evidence a moment ago 
Ms Nhantsi you were - you were told by Ms Myeni to engage him 
immediately after you arrived at SAA because there was a letter that 
needed to be prepared in response to National Treasury on the swap 
deal.  Is that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did he assist you in crafting that letter? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes he did.  He gave me the input to include 
in the letter and then when I finalised the letter together with the Acting 
20 
CEO we then sent it to the Board.  They reviewed it and the letter went 
to National Treasury. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did that not strike you as strange at the time 
that some third party to SAA who was not been remunerated by SAA at 
all was going to be advising you on what letters to write and their 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 38 of 266 
 
contents back to National Treasury? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It did raise a bell but Ms Myeni said 
Mr Mngadi is my person for any issue that I need to get clarity on.  If 
Mr Zwane is not aware of any Mngadi knows very well about SAA.  He 
has been working with him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But he is not an employee of SAA? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No.  To be honest I never asked Ms Myeni 
how Mr Mngadi is paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you later established that – apologies 
10 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we have the same question in mind.  You could 
proceed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you established later he was not paid by 
SAA? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would like … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is quite – sorry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is – that is quite strange that – you know – I 
20 
asked you earlier on whether you understand that when it was said that 
Mr Mngadi was Ms Myeni’s personal advisor whether what was meant 
that he was Ms Myeni’s advisor in her capacity as a Member or a 
Chairperson of the Board and you said no. 
You understood that he was just her own personal advisor 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 39 of 266 
 
and in support of that you said he was not being paid by the Board and 
– and it is – it is quite a strange situation and – and I said I mean you 
obviously checked as the Interim CFO you would know who – who is 
paid who is not paid by the – by SAA. 
So somebody who is an advisor to somebody who happens to 
be Chairperson of the Board or a Member of the Board but is a personal 
advisor is asked to advice you. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair perhaps I should have attempted to 
answer in two – in two ways. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  By saying one, he was not paid via SAA 
payroll and two he was – he was advising Ms Myeni.  I am not sure 
about other things but he was advising Ms Myeni on SAA matters 
because Ms Myeni said if there are any queries or any questions that I 
have Mr Mngadi had a deep understanding of SAA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no, no I understand the qualification that you 
– you are making and it is a legitimate qualification but what does 
remain is why would she – and this is something you might not have an 
answer for.  Why would she want somebody to do work that assists the 
Interim CFO of SAA or that assists SAA but that person – but SAA does 
20 
not pay that person? 
That is – that is strange because if SAA needs advisors – 
advisors must be secured or procured in a certain manner and they get 
paid by SAA. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 40 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair.  Hence I inquired with Ms Kwinana 
and Ms Kwinana said to me Mr Mngadi is – is a – she put it roughly to 
say Mr Mngadi is Dudu’s person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  (IsiZulu). 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  (IsiZulu). 
CHAIRPERSON:  (IsiZulu).  Well I – I just used isiZulu because I could 
understand exactly when she was speaking in English what must have 
been said … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Said in Zulu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In isiZulu and she has confirmed.  So … 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi I would like to just probe a little bit 
further pursuant to the debate – the discussion that you have been 
having with the Chair.  It sounds to me from your description as though 
there was a third Member of the Executive Management Team of SAA 
because as I had your evidence earlier you were told if there were 
matters in relation to SAA affairs that Mr Zwane – who was the Acting 
CEO at the time – would not assist on. 
Then you were told to go Mr Mngadi which puts him as one of 
20 
the three people who were in the Executive position at SAA.  Is that a 
fair summary of how you interacted with him? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Not really but you are right and I do not want 
to say you are right and wrong but halfway there.  The only issues that 
I would get clarity perhaps from Mr Mngadi would be the ones relating 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 41 of 266 
 
to the Board.  So I would not say he was the third Executive because 
on other matters relating to the day to day running of the business I 
was not engaging Mr Mngadi. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So when SAA was writing letters to National 
Treasury in what capacity were you preparing those letters? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I was preparing the letters in terms of the 
protocol.  Those letters need to go – they need to be signed by the 
Chairperson of the Board and go to National Treasury.  So he was then 
assisting in giving input and I and Mr Zwane would write the letters, 
give the letters to the Board for the Board to review and for the 
10 
Chairperson of the Board to sign the letter and send to National 
Treasury. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The Board and the Chair would rely on their 
Executive Team? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For the input into that … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Those letters. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is in accordance with proper corporate 
governance? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes, yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you agree that it is strange that a third 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 42 of 266 
 
party who is not a Member of the Executive of SAA is making input into 
that which the Executive places before the Board? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes it is strange Chair and also we need to 
be mindful or perhaps I need to highlight that those days I was week or 
two weeks old at SAA.  So I was not really accustomed to how SAA 
worked. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  Thank you Ms Nhantsi.  We will come 
back to the question of at what point in time you may have become 
more concerned about the role of Mr Mngadi.  I would like to go – you 
mentioned the swap transaction.  For those uninitiated in relation to the 
10 
swap transaction could you please assist us with what that related to. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair I came at a very late stage on the 
swap deal transaction.  I do not have much memory on it because I was 
not involved from the beginning of the transaction but my recollection.  
I came at the time when there were letters between the Minister and the 
Board.  I recall a letter where it was saying the Chair – the Minister of 
Finance was giving an instruction to the Board to stop the swap deal. 
My understanding was there – many years ago SAA ordered 
aircrafts that were white body aircrafts.  My understanding there were 
10 or 20 then.  Now they wanted to swap those aircraft.  So the – the 
20 
debate or the – the discussions were along those lines.  So I came at a 
stage where there were those letters were then an instruction from the 
Finance Minister saying stop the transaction and all that.  So that is the 
background that I have. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Ms Nhantsi.  Chair this is an aspect 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 43 of 266 
 
that will come up in all likelihood in the second evidence session for 
aviation but just for the assistance of understanding Mr Mngadi’s role.  
He was particularly involved on that Airbus swap transaction.  Is that 
correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair he was involved because he knew 
he was the one who was giving me the background - myself and 
Mr Zwane – background on – on that swap deal. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Could I ask you to go to page 200 
in the bundle in front of you?  That is DD2.  It contains your statement 
and it is an additional document. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page again? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  200 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes I am there Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you just go – apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    If you turn to the last page of that letter that 
appears at page 202 can you tell us who signs that letter? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Yes Chair it’s signed Masotsham Mngadi 
Executive Client Coverage. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Is that the same Mr Mngadi we have been 
speaking about? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    This relates, this is a letter that relates to the 
airbus swap transaction, is this a letter that you were aware of at the 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 44 of 266 
 
time?   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     No Chair, I was not aware of the letter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Perhaps to substantiate it’s dated 30 t h 
October 2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Indeed what I was interested in was whether, 
in your engagements with Mr Mngadi after your arrival which is of 
course later than this date, whether this letter was ever presented to 
you or you considered it, you’ll see that it deals with t the role for the 
assistance of the South African Airways in it’s procurement of new 
10 
aircraft and it sets out a great deal of detail about what the advantages 
would be for SAA if it were to conclude a lease transaction in relation 
to these aircraft.  So when you were working on this matter and 
engaging with Mr Mngadi was this letter brought to your attention at 
all? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     No Chair it was not and my understanding, 
I think this letter is still, perhaps substantiating or motivating the 
advantages so I came at the time when the Minister was saying stop 
the swap deal. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you, insofar as your engagements with 
20 
Mr Mngadi in relation to BnP is concerned, when did those occur? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair I’m trying to go back because 
this is four years ago and I would like to be as accurate as I can, there 
were engagement, as I said I started in engaging Mr Mngadi in 2015, 
the NP came in the picture after the transactional advisor, I think at the 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 45 of 266 
 
time I was also engaging with him on the BnP transaction. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Well let me maybe just assist with the 
chronology, BnP the bid for the transaction advisor services was in the 
middle of March 2016, my question would be, do you recall whether you 
engaged with Mr Mngadi in advance of that or only after that in relation 
to that transaction advisor service? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Are you saying in terms of the bid to 
appoint the transactional advisor? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     No the bid was done – I didn’t engage Mr 
10 
Mngadi on that, the bid was done by the bid adjudication, the bid 
evaluation and the bid selection committees, which I don’t sit in any. So 
the only time that the recommendation came to me was after all those 
committees have concluded the work that needed to be done and BnP 
was motivated as the preferred bidder for transactional advisor. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And then engagements with Mr Mngadi about 
those transaction advisor services did that occur only after their 
appointment? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes it did, I would also like to highlight and 
say according to my recollection – because the reason why I’m saying 
20 
so is, there was interaction in a way, sometimes regarding BnP there 
would be Mr Mahlangu writing to me and there would be Mr Mngadi 
calling me.  So if you ask me, I see Mr Mngadi also as a team player in 
the BnP Capital company. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you, there is a reference to a meeting 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 46 of 266 
 
that was held with SAA in Mr Mahlangu’s statement, I can take you 
there in a moment but let me just tell you what it is.  There were 
meetings held on the 25 t h of April and the 26 t h of April which Mr 
Mahlangu said, Mr Mngadi attended on behalf of BnP, would you be 
able to confirm whether you were present at those meetings? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     25 t h and 26 t h? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Of April yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Chair I would like to go there, the reason 
for that is there was a meeting that I attended and Mngadi was there 
but it was with Mr van der Merwe. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    That would have been on the 8 t h of June, so 
what I’m interested in was, prior to that – let me take you to Mr 
Mahlangu’s statement so we can place it in context, that is Exhibit DD4. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    You’ll find it at page 18 in that statement. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So at paragraph 5.18 on page 18, the 
following is recorded, 
 
“During the process of doing a financial analysis of SAA’s 
 
balance sheet and meetings, Mr Mngadi held with SAA on the 
20 
 
25 t h and the 26 t h of April 2016 we became aware of the fact 
 
that SAA could no longer wait for the financial advisory 
 
services to be completed as SAA was in dire need of funding 
 
because of, amongst other things”, 
 
And then three reasons for that position of urgency are 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 47 of 266 
 
traversed, if you go over the page though to page – paragraph 5.19 it 
records, 
 
“As a result of the above findings Mr Mngadi advised that the 
 
consortium, that is a reference to the consortium between BnP 
 
Capital and In-Line Trading, had been asked to submit a 
 
proposal in this regard”.  
 
Ms Nhantsi if we just step back what I understand these two 
paragraphs to be saying is there was a meeting at SAA on the 25 t h and 
26 t h of April which Mr Mngadi attended and at which the dire situation 
of SAA was discussed and at which he was asked to submit a proposal 
10 
for the sourcing of funds.  Do you recall having been at those meetings 
on those two days? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     No Chair, I was not in these meetings. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Who would he then have been meeting with? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     The content of – on these maturity dates 
and the amounts of the loans that were maturing I’m aware of but I 
never had a meeting at SAA with Mr Mngadi and discussed this. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Would those not have been the obvious things 
that you were responsible for in your portfolio? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes, hence I’m saying I’m familiar with the 
20 
content. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So would it strike you as odd that there would 
be a meeting arranged between SAA and Mr Mngadi to discuss matters 
directly in your portfolio that you did not attend. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes I would say it’s odd Chair. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 48 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And are you quite sure of the fact that you 
weren’t at those two meetings? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     I’m a hundred percent sure Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would there have been anyone under you who may 
have attended without your knowledge?   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Chair I’m not aware I never got any 
feedback.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Of he meeting that happened for two days 
10 
discussing these points.   
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes and are you in a position to say it’s unlikely that 
somebody under you would have attended a meting of that nature 
without mentioning it to you in one ay or another without you becoming 
aware. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair, I’m certain that if they attended 
a meeting, especially a meeting that takes two days I would have been 
aware that they are attending a two-day meeting and I would have been 
briefed when they’re back from the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Unless maybe if they didn’t want you to know that 
20 
they attended? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Maybe Chair, that’s a possibility but ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Ms Nhantsi I’d like to then ask you to go back 
in your file which is Exhibit DD2 to page 285.   
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 49 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     I’m there – sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Is that back to the…(intervention). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Back to DD2 and it’s at page 285. 
CHAIRPERSON:     285 thank you. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes I’m there Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Ms Nhantsi can you help us with the mail at 
the top of that page, can you tell us who it’s from and who it’s to? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     It’s from Masotsha Mngadi to Phumeza – to 
myself. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you and the content, would you just 
10 
read that into the record please? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  “Good afternoon madam, please find 
 
attached undercover hereof of a letter for your king attention, 
 
looking forward to engaging with you on this issue, thanks, 
 
kindest regard Masotsha Mngadi”. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And then if you turn over two pages, just to get 
the attached letter, you’ll see that, that is a letter from BnP Capital 
dated the 29 t h of April 2016, can you tell us who that is from?    
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     It is from Daniel Mahlangu the CEO of BnP 
Capital. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And it’s addressed to who? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     It’s addressed to the Chief Financial 
Officer of SAA. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Is that yourself at the time? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     It should have been the interim, yes. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 50 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And if you’ll just read the first sentence 
there? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     “Further to our meetings of 25 and 26 April 
 
regarding SAA’s financial state of affairs and our  interrogation 
 
of the SAS financial information including it’s balance sheet 
 
and  income statement it is our considered view that a 
 
transactional advisor mandate has been augmented for the 
 
following reasons”. 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you there’s no need to go on for 
now…(intervention). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:     Has to be augmented hey? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Indeed.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Nhantsi do you recall receiving this email? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes I do, even though it was a long time 
ago, yes I do Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And do you recall that attached letter? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes but I still don’t recall the meeting, the 
two-day meeting that I had.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Did you then go back to him and say I don’t 
20 
know what meetings you’re referring to? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     No I don’t recall going back Chair but all I 
can say that I know, that I did was to send the information – the debt 
profile of the company because already at this time they were 
appointed.  BnP Capital was already appointed as a transactional 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 51 of 266 
 
advisor, so the information of the debt profile of the company was given 
to them but a two-day meeting I don’t recall. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    But this is a letter related to expanding the 
scope of the transactional advisor services, isn’t it? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It’s looks like Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Yes and it seems to...(intervention). 
CHAIRPESON:     Sorry Ms Hofmeyr has she had a chance to read he 
whole letter? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Apologies let’s give her that opportunity. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Have you had a chance to read the whole letter? 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     It was a long time ago Chair, if I can be 
given a chance…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    No I mean recently to refresh your memory. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No Chair.    
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay it might be necessary that – if you feel that 
you need to get the context, just indicate, I wonder Ms Hofmeyr 
whether there aren’t particular letters or documents that you might want 
to have a little bit of time to look at properly because it’s been a long 
time and she might just refresh her memory. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Chair we have no difficulty with that, just in 
20 
terms of the procedure, all of these documents were sent to Ms Nhantsi 
about…(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:     Oh they were sent? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Indeed about a week or so ago, so she has 
been in receipt of them for that period. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 52 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:     Oh okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    It was on the basis of that engagement that I 
had assumed that we could work with it but Ms Nhantsi, at any point 
that you’d like to go over a document to refresh your memory, of course 
you should indicate that. 
CHAIRPERSON:     No I thought she might not have had that chance so 
it’s fine if she has had that chance, but if, in order to respond you just 
want to have a look again at any document, just let us know. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Yes Chair, if I can be given two minutes just 
to read this one specifically.  
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     I’m done Chair thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay just before we proceed, you did receive these 
documents about a week ago or so. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERON:     Did you get a change to read them? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Yes Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay I’m just wanting to alert you that I’ve allowed 
you with this one but I won’t allow you to go through every one in 
circumstances where you did have a chance.  
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    When I say I won’t allow you to go through everyone 
that is to read from beginning to end but obviously if you want to just 
have a look at a particular part then that’s fine, I was getting the 
impression earlier on that you might have had a chance to look at the 
letter recently, so…(intervention). 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 53 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Thank you Chair, for your indulgence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the change – the idea is to try and be fair to you 
but at the same time we want to use our time properly.  
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Okay Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you Chair.  Ms Nhantsi can I just 
confirm, your evidence indicates that you did not attend a meeting on 
the 25 t h and 26 t h of April with Mr Mngadi, is that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Did you attend a meeting on those days with 
10 
Mr Mahlangu?  
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     No I never attended a meeting with Mr 
Mahlangu I’ve never seen him, I’ve been sending information to him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you for that.  In relation to this letter 
thought, I would like to probe it a bit further because it comes to you on 
the 29 t h of April and it refers to meetings on the 25 t h and the 26 t h of 
April, regarding SAA’s financial state of affairs, that’s your portfolio is 
it not? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Were you not surprised to learn of meetings 
20 
happening within your portfolio three days and four days prior to 
receiving this letter which you did not attend? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Chair chances are I would have been 
surprised but this letter dated 29 t h of April 2016 comes at a time where 
we – allow me to go back, we received an update on news from FDC 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 54 of 266 
 
that we will no longer be funding to the tune of 15billion because of the 
directive that they received from National Treasury that they should 
stop giving SAA funding.  So we had then, a meeting with – a telecom 
with the Board updating the about this so the Board then asked us on 
the 21 s t of April that we need to explore expanding the scope of BnP to 
include the sourcing of funds.  So this is now 29 t h of April, this is after 
that date, so this is the date where we received – we already received 
a resolution from the Board to expand the scope of BnP to include the 
sourcing of funds.  So the content of – that are on the letter is what we 
discussed also with the Board and raising concerns on the urgency of 
10 
the loans that are maturing at the end of June to the tune of 7.3billion.  
Some of the content of the letter talks about what was there on the 
scope of the transactional advisory services. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Indeed Nhantsi that Board resolution of the 
21 s t of April, you will find in Ms Stimpel’s bundle, bundle B at page 441, 
it’s not particularly necessary that you go there, I just want you to be 
assured that there was a Board resolution by round-robin on the 21 s t of 
April resolving to approve the extension of scope of a transaction 
advisor to include sourcing of funding of 15billion for South African 
Airways, is that the one you’re referring to? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    My question still remains though Ms Nhantsi, 
how could it be that Mr Mahlangu or Mr Mngadi and BnP Capital were 
having meetings pursuant to that Board directive on the 25 t h and 26 t h of 
April at which the financial state of affairs of SAA were being discussed 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 55 of 266 
 
and you, as the CFO of SAA had no knowledge that those meetings 
were taking place? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     I don’t know Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And you have no insight for us as to who they 
would have been meeting with if it wasn’t you or your department? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Now I would have to speculate, I don’t 
know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So did you respond to this letter which suggested 
that you were part of meetings of 25 and 26 April 2016, did you respond 
to it and point out that you don’t know what they were talking about.  
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     No Chair I did not respond hence I’m 
saying the letter dated 29, came at the time where we were busy then 
trying to do the procurement process based on the – and check the 
confinements, based on the fact that there are loans that are urgently 
coming to mature.  So chances I would have received the letter maybe I 
wouldn’t have even given the attention on the detail of the letter 
because we were urgently trying to the confinement – working with 
procurement to confine and source the funds because the loans were 
about to mature. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Well do you know whether you read the letter at that 
20 
time, after receiving it? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     I don’t recall it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Do you know whether you did receive the letter at 
that time? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     It was on my mailbox Chair, so yes I did 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 56 of 266 
 
receive the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So you did receive it but you…(intervention). 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  But I don’t recall it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    You don’t know whether you read it at all? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But of course…(intervention). 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     But Chair let me also continue, as I’m 
saying some of the content of the letter is what is the mandate of the 
transactional advisor which BnP Capital was appointed to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:    No I understand what you’re saying, I’m concerned 
10 
that you don’t remember whether you read the letter, am I correct in 
understanding your evidence in that way that you don’t remember 
whether you read it or not? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     No I don’t remember Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes because I would have expected that when you 
read it now, you would remember if it’s a letter that you had read before 
but you do remember that you did receive it, that you have no problem 
with? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes is it possible that you would have ignored it and 
20 
not read it? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Chair it’s possible that I might not have 
deliberately ignored it but – because we were too busy, I would have, 
perhaps forgot to read it at the time.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes Ms Hofmeyr? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 57 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Ms Nhantsi I’ll come back to that point in due 
course if I may when we deal with your motivation for the extension of 
the scope because certainly some of the motivation that is contained in 
this letter is what ultimately finds it’s way into your motivation which I’ll 
suggest to you in due course, is at least an indicator that you were 
familiar with the contents of the letter but I’m happy to go to that in due 
course.  Before we leave the topic of interactions with Mr Mngadi, I’d 
like to just take you to some of the WhatsApp communications that 
you’ve provided to the Commission of your interactions between 
yourself and Mr Mngadi and for that purpose if we can maybe just go to 
10 
– in that same bundle page 101. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     I am there Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    What is that Ms Nhantsi? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     It’s a WhatsApp message from Masotsha 
Mngadi. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And is this from the phone that you saved his 
details into as you described earlier in your testimony? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And as is reflected at the top there, is that 
how you saved his details? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes Chair.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Masotsha Mngadi SAA/Nedbank. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So in late November, two days after you 
arrived and you got his details you were aware that Mr Mngadi was 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 58 of 266 
 
associated with Nedbank, is that correct. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair he told me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    He told you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you.  Can I then ask you to go next – 
well what I’d like to do Ms Nhantsi is just for the purposes of navigating 
your evidence, indicate that there are five decisions that were taken in 
relation to the B – at least the 15billion capital raising which are of 
particular importance as we try to unravel what happened in relation to 
this fund raising at SAA.  I’d like to take you, initially through those five 
10 
decisions and have your evidence in relation to whether you, today, 
stand by those decisions that were taken and I do Ms Nhantsi because 
– and you’ll correct me if this is not a fair reading of your statement but 
as I read your statement you may well have supported decisions at the 
time, knowing what you knew but you raise serious concerns about 
them now, is that a fair reading of your statement? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So for introductory purposes I’d like to just go 
through the five I’d like to get on record what your position is in 
relation to those five in broad terms and then my proposal for the rest 
20 
of your evidence is to delve into some of them in a bit more detail 
where it becomes relevant to do so.  If we can start with the decision to 
appoint the Free State Development Corporation to source the 
15billion, Ms Nhantsi you will recall that, that occurred in a December 
2015 meeting of the Board, is that correct? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 59 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    We’ve looked at that resolution in some detail 
in Ms Stimpel’s evidence but I’d like you to have it before you for this 
purpose, you’ll find it in A of her Exhibit which is DD1 and you’ll find it 
at page 289 of that bundle. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes I’m there Chair.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Is that an excerpt of the minutes of the 
meeting held on 3 December 2015 of which you are familiar? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair I’m familiar. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And you’ll see in C on that page is where the 
10 
decision in relation to the Free State Development Corporation is 
contained and what I read it as, mandating you and the acting CEO to 
do, I to urgently take the necessary steps to negotiate, conclude, 
execute and sign and/or dispatch all documents and notices related to 
the 14billion loan offer received from a potential funder, Free State 
Development Corporation as per the letter circulated at the Board 
meeting, you see that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Do you stand by the decision that was taken 
by the Board on that day to mandate you to conclude that transaction 
20 
with Free State Development Corporation? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Please guide me, you want me to perhaps 
first substantiate why I stand by It then and why now I’ve changed my 
mind …(intervention). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    I’m interested in your current position and 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 60 of 266 
 
we’ll go into great detail in the course of your evidence about what was 
happening at the time, what you were aware of, but your current view.  
What I’m interested in the moment, because it will assist me in the 
evidence, if you stand by certain decisions even now, then it may be 
necessary to probe them in more detail, if now you regard them as 
being irregular or the product – to use some of the words in your 
statement a bigger scheme or a scandalous transaction, that will assist 
me in navigating where to focus in the evidence.  So insofar as this 
decision to mandate you to conclude this transaction with Free State 
Development Corporation, do you regard – do you stand by it today? 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     The answer would be yes and no, when I’m 
saying yes, if the company continued with the transaction at the time, 
the company was going to save on interest because at the time the 
company was paying an interest of 1.2billion per year just to service 
the debt and not to pay the capital portion.  So if you look at the term 
sheet that was submitted by Grissag, looking at that I would say it 
would have saved the company but looking in detail now after the 
inquiry at the letter that I received from FDC and analysing it in detail, 
it looked like there were previous discussions that were done by FDC to 
the extent that, already they had a potential investor, foreign investor 
20 
which at the time I did not read in detail because you would also 
understand that I was three days or four days in the office.  Today I 
would say – the reason why I am saying there was a bigger scheme it 
looks like there were discussions before the discussion.  By saying that 
it means, already there were discussions to form with FDC, a joint 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 61 of 266 
 
venture, there was a discussion already with a potential funder of that 
so – which happens to be the same funder of SeaCrest.  So today then 
I’m not standing next to it I’m saying there were bigger schemes and 
perhaps there were people who stood to benefit from the transaction 
using me to conclude the transaction.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Well maybe let’s get this clarified.  I think what Ms 
Hofmeyr is – what her question is aimed at is two things, the first is 
whether knowing what you know today about that decision that was 
made by the Board do you support it, the decision and in answering 
that question you may have regard to a number of things but part of it 
10 
includes processes that may have been followed on or not followed or 
should have been followed.  So if you look at that decision, how it was 
taken and everything that you know today, do you support that – do you 
say it was the correct decision that was taken? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     No Chair it was not the correct decision, it 
was not in the best interest of the company. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you.    If we then go to the decision to 
appoint BnP Capital as a transaction advisor, as I have it from your 
statement, you do support that decision I take that from – at page 7 
paragraph 23. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:     Did you say page 7? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Page 7 indeed Chair paragraph 23. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes I’m there Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    I would like to clarify though because what 
you say here in this part you are talking about the decision on the 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 62 of 266 
 
transaction advisor and you’re talking about the fact that there was a 
decision 
to 
appoint 
a 
transaction 
advisor 
and 
then 
a 
later 
implementation of that decision and you say in the third line at 
paragraph 23, 
 
“I did not foresee anything untoward when I implemented the 
 
Board’s instruction because based on the historical information 
 
my predecessor used to take instructions from the Board and 
 
submit a motivation afterwards’,  
 
I’m going to explore that further with you in your evidence but 
in the part that we’re at, at the moment where I’m simply asking you as 
10 
the Chair has indicated to you to tell us whether today, knowing all you 
know, you still support that decision, what is your answer? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes I still support the decision Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you, the next one is the decision to 
extend the scope of BnP Capital from that of transaction advisor to 
sourcer of funds, knowing what you know now, do you support that 
decision? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     No Chair, I don’t support it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Then there is the request for the approval of a 
cancellation fee to be paid to BnP Capital pursuant to that extended 
20 
scope do you today, support that decision? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     I never supported it Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    We will have to go to your…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     I guess that means, therefore you still don’t support 
it? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 63 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI: 
Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    We will pick that up Ms Nhantsi in relation to 
the recommendation that you wrote to the Board to support the payment 
of that cancellation fee.  Chair that gives me a good background for the 
purposes of the remainder of the evidence. I see we’re just before the 
tea break but if it’s appropriate possibly we take it now and then we 
can return. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes let’s take it now and – we’ll take the tea break 
and resume at half past eleven.   
10 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Both this morning and just now I have struggled to 
make it on time.  We – because of meetings but we will try and 
improve.  Let us proceed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi as I indicated before the break I 
would like to now go into some detail in relation to these various 
decisions that I have got your evidence in relation to your current 
20 
position on them  I would like to start with the decision in relation to 
the Free State Development Corporation that was taken at the 3 
December board meeting and we looked a moment ago at the actual 
resolution which you found in Ms Stimpel’s file A at page 289.  I would 
like us just to look at it for a moment if we may?  That is 289 of Exhibit 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 64 of 266 
 
DD1[a]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Stimpel – apologies Ms Nhantsi I would like 
to just understand whether you understood this resolution in the same 
way that in the course of the evidence last week it had been understood 
by Ms Stimpel.  At C what is recorded there is that you and the acting 
CEO must urgently take steps to negotiate, conclude, execute, sign and 
or dispatch all documents and notices related to the 14 billion loan 
offer received from a potential funder Free State Development 
Corporation as per the letter circulated.  What did you understand that 
10 
to require of you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Thank you Chair.  I understood that as a 
mandate that we were given by the board based on the letter that was 
circulated on that day allow me to give a bit of background as well.  
When I joined SAA on the 27 November 2015 on the 1 December 2015 
which is literally four days after I received a call from Mr Moyo – Mr 
Shepherd Moyo who is the CFO at FDC who first congratulated me on 
the move that I made to SAA and secondly asked me if SAA still needs 
the funding.  Firstly I would like to declare which I did on my statement 
that I did articles, I served articles at Sizwe Ntsaluba Gebodo with 
20 
Shepherd Moyo we were both audit managers, senior audit managers.  
By the time he left he was the senior audit manager, I was the audit 
partner.  So I saw nothing untoward him  
1. Congratulating me on the move  
2. Asking if SAA still needs funding because it was on the public 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 65 of 266 
 
domain that SAA at some point there was a tender out there that 
needed funding for SAA.   
So I responded to say yes SAA is still in need of funding.  He told me 
that they can assist.  So I asked, how can they assist?  He said they 
can … 
1.  I asked how can you assist because my understanding is you 
receive grant from government. 
2. Do you have a mandate for that? 
He responded by saying yes they are in talks with foreign investor and 
their FDC Act allows them to do the transaction so I requested him to 
10 
put it in writing and I then told him that because it was the 1 s t I said to 
him, put it in writing there is a board meeting on the 3 r d of December I 
will then discuss it with the board which he did on the 2 n d  of…- the 
following day I then received a letter from Mr Moyo.  I am not sure 
which page Chair it is on. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is a page back.  If you just go back in Ms 
Stimpel’s bundle you will find it there at page 287, is that the letter you 
are referring to? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair.  This is the letter that I am 
referring to.  Basically it – it says what we said on the call because I 
20 
asked him to put it in writing.  I am not sure if I should read it Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We have seen it before. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that is – Chair as long as you are happy 
with that? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 66 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no we have seen it.  We have read it ja. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  So I then on the – on the 2 n d – on the 1 s t 
after I received a call on the following day – morning I updated the 
acting CEO Mr Zwane and I received the letter.  I shared the letter.  I 
made a copy.  I shared it with him.  He also agreed that let us take it to 
the board the following day and the process to do that is to give the 
submission to the company secretary which we did.  She made copies 
and on the day the letter was circulated.  There were many items on the 
– on the agenda item but the letter was discussed after the 
deliberations – long deliberations that were done on the submission 
10 
that was made on the day.  There was a submission that was dated – 
signed 27 November.  I think it was written 20 – on the 26 November 
recommended a company called Seacrest by Ms Stimpel.  So the – after 
the long deliberations on the board on the recommendation that was 
made by Mr Stimpel recommending Seacrest to be appointed as a 
funder for R15 billion the company – the board raised concerns one 
was the rate they felt it is a bit high which was 5.8%.  The second one 
there was also one of the attachments on the due diligence where it 
was said that Seacrest refused to give information for the company to 
do the due diligence and also the proof of funds.  They refused with the 
20 
proof of funds.  So the board after deliberated on it felt that because – 
they felt that it looks like if they do not want this due diligence to be 
done it was a bit odd because they felt as if it looks like Seacrest 
wants to get the letter of award and go and source funding perhaps 
they believed that maybe Seacrest does not have the funds.  Therefore 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 67 of 266 
 
it was declined.  The second recommendation that was on that 
submission was the consortium of banks.  If my memory serves me 
correct I am not there Chair I am not sure which page but it was 
recommending the consortium of banks to the tune of 4.3 billion. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  The board felt it defeats the purpose.  The 
purpose of debt consolidation was to maximise and get – and pay the 
lowest interest because on average at the time the – in fact the 
accurate amount the company was paying an interest of 1.2 billion so 
they felt if they can put it one house they can pay a better rate.  So it 
10 
was then declined. The consortium of lenders and even the rates that 
the lenders were giving were the same rates that they were servicing – 
that were – they servicing the company at.  So the board felt that it 
defeats the purpose.  So they went through the letter.  One of the 
things that I noticed on the board which I did not at the time because I 
was still new specifically the Chair of the board it looks like she knew 
about the  - about the FDC and we were then told or mandated myself 
and acting CEO to urgently facilitate and run with the letter and do all 
the necessary documents because the company urgently needs the 
funds. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Ms Nhantsi.  So is it fair to say you 
understood that your mandate was to conclude the transaction with 
FDC? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  That was my understanding.  As much as that 
was the understanding when I joined the company I always wore the 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 68 of 266 
 
heads of ensuring that the processes are followed.  So subsequent to 
this after the board meeting I then called – I think it was Friday if I am 
not mistaken the 3 r d but I called the legal team – the procurement team 
which was comprised of Mr Lester Peter and Silas Matsaudza who was 
the commodity manager at the time.  I then told them that the board has 
declined basically the resolution as we have read and they – I asked 
them how can we go about ensuring that we implement the board 
resolution but that the same time we are in line with the supply chain 
management process.  We discussed it firstly Mr Peter’s response was 
more like this is a board resolution we should implement it because the 
10 
board has taken a decision.  But we discussed it because I wanted to 
make sure that at the end we act in the best interest of the company 
and Mr Matsaudza even went to his office to bring the Supply Chain 
Management Policy and there was a clause that they referred me to 
which is Clause on the SEM Policy.  I am not sure which – what page is 
the SEM Policy Chair? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I will get that for you now.   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it is somewhere in your own statement as well.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you referred to it in your statement. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Oh.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is on page 4 at paragraph 13. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes.  Paragraph?  Sorry page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Page 4 of your statement which is right at the 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 69 of 266 
 
beginning of your Exhibit DD2 bundle and you will find it at page – 
paragraph 13 on page 4. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Alright let me go there.  Thank you Chair.  
Yes the SCM Policy of 2011 had Chapter 14.4 on the alternative offers 
and the sub clause 14.4.1 stipulated as follows: 
“Regardless of whether the bidders submits an offer 
conforming strictly to the specification alternative 
offers may be considered and accepted provided that 
the other bidders are not prejudiced.” 
So this is the clause that we used to ensure that we are in line with the 
10 
SCM Policy because the other bidders are not prejudiced in this case 
because the board already declined Seacrest that was recommended. 
The board already declined the consortium of the banks.  So the SCM 
Policy of SAA allowed that we can use this paragraph – sorry this 
clause to ensure that we comply with the SCM Policy and also we do 
what is needed by the board, the implementation.  After that meeting 
following day I then called the legal team – the treasury team which is 
made up of Mr Stimpel and Mike – Mr Michael Klein.  I then explain 
what happened in the board that the board declined Seacrest and the 
consortium of the lenders and the board then mandated myself and the 
20 
acting CE to engage urgently and conclude with the FDC.  And then I 
told them that I engaged with the procurement team and they advised 
that it is allowed in terms of the SCM Policy.  I recall that Mr Klein even 
wanted a copy of the – of the specific clause of SCM and he made a 
copy.  In the discussion Ms Stimpel then was shouting if I am allowed 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 70 of 266 
 
to use that name, shouting, and saying this is not allowed. The FDC 
was not in the list of the bidders that bidded and this is against the 
policy and why did I go to procurement for funding, funding is excluded 
from the policy.  It is guided by I think he said by some – the financial 
risk framework. So we then discussed that and then I wanted to 
understand from her where is the exclusion on the SCM Policy?  Where 
is it excluded that the funding is not part of the SCM?  I had a reason 
to ask that question.  It is because when we attended the board 
meeting on the 3 December the board members told me that in the past 
they made in fact I also read it on the pack.  They made the treasury 
10 
department together with my predecessor to cancel the tender that was 
done based on the financial risk framework because it was not following 
the procurement process and it was not competitive.  It was not fair and 
it was not transparent.  So she could not answer me where the 
exclusion is but she kept on saying that the board was wrong in 
excluding – in declining specifically Seacrest because the company 
needs funding which I agreed that the company needs funding but the 
questions that I raised to her was the board had reasons.  She wanted 
the board resolution which I said she can get from company secretary 
and then I explained that the board had reasons why they declined at 
20 
the time because the company refused the due diligence.  The company 
did not want to show the proof of funds.  So I then explained to them 
and I gave them the copy and then they – the meeting was ended at the 
time.  But we – they then updated me because I said this is the 
resolution that we need to implement.  We then decided together with 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 71 of 266 
 
procurement and treasury team that the best way to do it is to send the 
term – are you stopping me? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No not at all sorry. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Oh sorry.  Is to send the template of the term 
sheet and also to send the RFP that was sent to the other bidders, to 
FDC.  They requested me for contact details which I gave Michael Klein 
– Mr Klein and Ms Stimpel the contact details, the cell number of Mr 
Shepherd Moyo and the – they were sent.  And we – Mr Shepherd Moyo 
were given – was given a deadline of 24 December to complete the 
term sheet which he did.  The term sheet was received back from FDC 
10 
on the 24 December 2015 and it was evaluated early in 2016. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Apologies please continue if there 
is more. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes.  One of the things that I highlighted – 
that I noticed on the term sheet what – was – it is coming from the 
same – the funder is the same Grissag that was – that was a proposal 
for Seacrest.  Seacrest as well when it was recommended the funder 
was Grissage AG PTY LTD.  Now with FDC as well it was Grissag AG 
PTY LTD.  So I remember one day when Ms Stimpel again came to my 
office still shouting that the board took a wrong decision because now 
20 
the company is going to be in default.  She does not understand how 
the board was meddling with the procurement processes they should 
have accepted and approved Seacrest.  So one question that I asked 
Ms Stimpel was, if you look at the rates that the same funder is giving 
when it was Seacrest it was 5.8% the interest rate fixed.  When it was 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 72 of 266 
 
FDC the interest rate was still fixed but at 4%.  So I asked Ms Stimpel 
did she consider the – I understand that it was not part of the – FDC 
was not part of the bidders that submitted and followed the process.  
As much as now it is accommodated on SCM but did he consider that 
should the company have taken Seacrest the company was going to pay 
1.8% more than if it takes FDC and 1.8% of 15 billion is about R270 
million.  So we – that is why I looked at  - because Chair I would like to 
say at the time that I was running the transaction I think the end results 
was what I had in mind was there are loans that are maturing and we 
had weekly meetings with the banks together with National Treasury 
10 
and on all those meetings that banks both local and international they 
expressed their anxiety.  They wanted their exposure to be reduced to 
the extent that they even wrote the DG of National Treasury wanting – 
because they said at the time they were raising two issues. They were 
raising the fact that the company – the company’s performance is 
deteriorating and to the extent that they feel that are funding the 
operations of the business – the day to day operations of the business 
and they were saying it is not supposed to be like that.  And they were 
true because if you go and loan money just to – to pay salaries it is not 
sustainable.  So they – they even said to the letter to National Treasury 
20 
in the meetings they are now feeling as if they are the shareholders of 
SAA.  They want shareholder to come to the party.  The second issue 
that they raised was around governance where they said there are so 
many people in acting positions basically they felt that there is no 
accountability because when you are acting you are acting – there is no 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 73 of 266 
 
really accountability.  The third concern that the banks consistently 
raised at the time was the – the – I used to say the three men board but 
the board members they were – there were only three board members 
so they felt if the board could be beefed up they believed that then in 
terms of governance that would be done.  So at the back of my mind I 
heard that and the banks at the time they were not – they told us that 
they will never – until all these are resolved including capitalisation 
from the shareholder to SAA they will not extend or roll over the loans 
beyond three months.  And in the three months that they were giving 
the company Chair every – every expiry of three months they were 
10 
including a margin meaning the interest rate was increasing.  So the 
interest rate was increasing, the interest rate was increasing now to be 
beyond the 1.2 so there would be point where the company would not 
even be in a position to service the debt.  So at the back of my mind 
being appointed as an interim CFO I had that in mind that one of my 
duties was to pay debts as and when they are due. So we had this 1.2 
billion that is servicing the debt.  So when I looked one thing that 
caught my eye on the two before I even asked who is Grissag one thing 
that caught my eye was the difference on the interest rates from the 
same funder.   
20 
1.  If we took 5.8% and the other one is 4% and the company would 
have been – would have paid R270 million.   
So at the time those were the things that I was looking at.  In fact I 
even did a calculation which I presented to the – to the board where 
high level I then looked at the rates that were – the company was 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 74 of 266 
 
currently paying and now if we pay 4% I think the interest on saving 
was R700 million so that was the ultimate goal to say if we do this also 
if we do it within the ambit of law together in line with the SCM Policy 
the company would pay 500 million on interest and save 700 million on 
interest Chair.  So the – we received the term sheet. The treasury 
team, the committee then evaluated between now the preferred bidder 
which is Seacrest and FDC.  FDC was then warned because of the rate.  
I recall I had a meeting with the FRS team where they told me now this 
is in January 2016… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi do you mind if we pause there just 
10 
for a moment. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because there is an extreme amount that you 
have covered. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In relation to just a crisp question initially and I 
would like to unpack it before we get to January 2016. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  Let us start with Procurement Policy 
needing to be followed. 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You gave us background as to the board’s view 
that it should be followed notwithstanding Ms Stimpel’s view that 
funding might have fell outside it.   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Hm. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 75 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So do I have it that you regard it as applying to 
this procurement process? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Sorry? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You regarded the Supply Chain Management 
Policy as applicable. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To the sourcing of funds. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just before you proceed Ms Hofmeyr.  You mentioned 
10 
that earlier on whatever happened in December 2015 you were still 
quite new at SAA and so on. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I just want to ask this question.  At that time how 
long had you been a chartered accountant? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  For – that 2015 – I qualified in 2007 Chair 
so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  So in 2015… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so it is from 2007 about what – seven to eight 
20 
years? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Eight years.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Seven – eight years. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And during most of those years you were at Sizwe 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 76 of 266 
 
Nthaluba Gebodo? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes, Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  I just wanted to get that context.  
Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  You indicated in your answer 
that you were advised by the commodity manager and Lester – 
Advocate Lester Peter that you could use Clause 14.4.1 of the Supply 
Chain Management Policy for the purposes of now implementing the 
instruction that you had received from the board on the 3 December to 
conclude the transaction with FDC, is that correct? 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would like to just debate that clause with you.  
I know that you are not a lawyer. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But I need to put to you that there is an entirely 
different interpretation of that clause. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That would not have supported the extension to 
FDC at that point.  You will find the full Supply Chain Management 
Policy in Ms Stimpel’s bundle but I am happy to work off the excerpt 
20 
that you have in your statement because there is nothing else in that 
clause. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well as I say that I realise actually locating it 
in the policy is quite important. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 77 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So let us go to it.  It is in Ms Stimpel’s bundle 
and it is C.  It is Exhibit DD1 but File C of that bundle.   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it in the lever arch file that has got Ms Stimpel’s 
statement? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is indeed Chair but in division C of that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Division C. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is the last of them.  So you will be looking for 
DD1[c].  And you will find it… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is Exhibit DD1[c]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just to orientate everyone the policy begins at 
868 but the relevant clause is at page 894.   
CHAIRPERSON:  894? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes I am there Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi just to orientate you this Supply 
20 
Chain Management Policy goes through – it traps in essence the 
various stages of the procurement process, are you aware of that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  Yes because as I had your evidence earlier 
you said your role at SAA was to ensure that proper processes were 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 78 of 266 
 
followed, is that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  So you would be familiar with this.  It 
goes through the various stages of the evaluation and – process for 
bids and then you get at page 894 to a heading called Evaluation 
Process, do you see that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So this is evaluation of bids that have been 
received and for which there are requirements in the preceding clauses 
of the SCM Policy, do you accept that? 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So when you get to 14.4 which talks about 
alternative offers and it reads as follows: 
“Regardless of whether a bidder submits an offer 
conforming strictly to the specification alternate 
offers may be considered and accepted provided that 
other bidders are not prejudiced.” 
Now FDC was not a bidder in the prior procurement process that was 
embarked upon by SAA was it? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No it was not. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That RFP had an opening date and a closing 
date by which bids had to be submitted? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 79 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So when I want to suggest to that when this 
clause of the SCM Policy is talking about alternative offers from 
bidders it is envisaging bidders who have complied with the 
procurement requirements which are that they bid within the time period 
and then it makes available the prospect that you could accept an 
alternative offer from such a bidder that did not comply with the 
specifications of the bid provided it did not prejudice others, do you 
see that as a possible reading of that clause? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  As you have rightfully said I am not a lawyer 
and procurement advised me that this is the alternative because how I 
10 
read it as I have declared that I am a chartered accountant for me it 
reads and say alternative offers may be considered and accepted 
provided that the other bidders are not prejudiced.  How it was 
interpreted to me and how I understand it is even if you did not form 
part – you did not submit but if it is an alternative offer it can be 
accepted by the board provided it does not prejudice others. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I understand that that is what you were 
informed of at the time but do you accept that in the scheme of proper 
procurement where there are opening dates and closing dates for bids 
and people have to get their bids in in that time which the preceding 
20 
parts of this policy refers to. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When it is now talking about bidders it is 
talking about bidders who participate in that process. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It is not clear Chair. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 80 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  Well that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do – do you accept that if the – if you interpret the 
clause to mean that you could accept a proposal from somebody who 
did not submit a bid within the time stipulated do you accept that that 
interpretation could defeat the purpose of having a date when it is open 
for bidders to put in their bids and a date when everybody is told is told 
it is now closed. 
If you come after you are too late.  Do you accept that - that 
interpretation could defeat that entire purpose? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I accept that Chair … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  But also how I – I interpreted it is now that 
process of bid opening and closing came and gone … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Because the recommendation came to the 
Board … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  And the Board then declined. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  So I then – when the Board said then engage 
20 
with FDC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  How I interpreted it is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It is within this ambit of this clause … 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 81 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  That it is in line.  We can go and engage the 
FDC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So your – your understanding of it was that it allows – 
it allowed SAA to take proposals or bids from even people who did not 
put in bids within the time? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  That is – that is my understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is how you understood? 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  That is how I understood it Chair and also … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  What I also checked as – as I was doing – I 
was reading this was to check what the mandate is or what the role is 
of the Board … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  On the SCM. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Which is catered on the same SCM Policy … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Section 6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  If you allow me to go there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  On page 881. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 82 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Page 881 under 6.2.2.  It talks about the 
Board – 6.2.2.3 it talks about: 
“The Board will approve all SCM transactions which 
are in line with their delegation of authority and on 
request any other transaction of lower value as it 
deemed fit.” 
So reading that the Board will – this transaction was within the – the 
purview of the Board and now it is the Board that is accepting an 
alternative offer and my interpretation was it is in line. 
10 
(Background noise) 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is me.  Okay, thank you.  You may proceed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi you will accept that what the Board 
decided on 3 December was not to follow any procurement process.  
Was it? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  They just wanted you to conclude the 
transaction with FDC? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes, yes Chair you are right but I decided 
20 
that for – for the benefit of the company and to act in the best interest 
of the company I would follow the processes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But the accounting authority of SAA was not 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 83 of 266 
 
concerned with proper process being followed? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – I am sorry.  You – you just accepted a 
proposition that the Board did not follow any process but that might be 
so but was your understanding that the policy allowed the Board to do 
exactly that?  Was that your understanding or that was not your 
understanding? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  At the time – 3 December – I was – I was not 
aware of what the policy caters and what the policy does not cater.  
10 
Hence Chair after the Board Meeting I could not tell the Board that do 
not give me this mandate and we need to go – follow the process first 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  But after the meeting I called the – the 
Procurement Team and said this is what the Board is saying we must do 
– we must implement.  Hence I said Mr – Mr Lester Peter said let us 
just implement because the Board has taken a decision … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  But I was adamant and I felt uncomfortable 
20 
Chair. I wanted to follow the – the procurement processes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I understand that throughout this transaction 
I did – I did things in reverse … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 84 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Because the transaction itself falls within the 
ambit of the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  They take a decision but I – I went back 
every time to follow the procurement process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  I would then like to just 
pause in relation to your evidence in – on Seacrest and its margin on 
the Grissag offer because I understood you to say in your evidence and 
you will correct me if I am wrong that you accept that at the time that 
10 
Ms Stimpel in November 2015 recommended as Head of Treasury at the 
time that Seacrest be approved she was not aware of the underlying 
Grissag percentage.  Is that right? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  When you are saying underlying percentage 
you mean she was not aware of the FDCs and the others? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No not FDC.  I am saying insofar as the 
Seacrest bid was concerned. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Seacrest was going to receive its funding from 
Grissag.  Correct? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But at the time – 27 November – all that had 
been presented to the – those evaluating the bids that had come 
through was a Seacrest bid at 5.8 percent.  Is that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Correct, yes. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 85 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So she did not know at the time what portion of 
the 5.8 percent was going to be paid to Grissag.  Correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes.  I agree. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So she could not be criticised for being 
comfortable with 1.8 percent at the time because she did not know at 
the time that the Seacrest margin was 1.8 percent.  Correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  You are correct by saying at that time, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe do not sit too far from the microphone or bring 
it closer if you want to sit back. 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that whatever you say will be recorded. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Apologies Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi just for the record … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Perhaps can I expand when I am saying you 
are right when you say at the time?  Ms Stimpel yes even myself in – in 
January because the reason why I said in January I raised the concern 
of the rate in January and in January it was after we received the – the 
FDC term sheet … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  And the FDC term sheet had 4 percent. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed but you did not actually know what the 
Grissag percentage was on the Seacrest deal.  Did you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I knew. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No because what you had seen at the time - as 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 86 of 266 
 
I have it – is the Grissag term sheet when they were to join forces with 
FDC. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI: 
 
With 
Seacrest. 
 
On 
the 
– 
on 
the 
memorandum itself the one that was submitted to the Board there was a 
table … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Huh-uh. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  That was showing the rates. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed that only referenced Seacrest … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And 5.8 percent. 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I agree with you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Would you like to go to it because the one point 
I would like to make in relation to it … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You said that one of the reasons that the Board 
was uncomfortable with Seacrest was the rate of 5.8 percent.  Do you 
recall saying that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is not recorded as one of their given 
reasons.  Do you accept that? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes.  It was in the discussion item.  In fact it 
was the – the point that was raised by the Chairperson of the Board. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you raise with her when she made that 
point that Seacrest was the cheapest at 5.8 percent of all the bids that 
had been received? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 87 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No I did not raise any issue at that time as I 
did not have the information at hand in terms of what is the average 
rates that the banks are changing at the time because I was on day four 
of my job. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well it was not the average at the time.  It was 
the submission from Group Treasury … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To which you made reference … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Dated 27 November that is served before the 
10 
Board at that meeting.  Do you recall that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it would have been part of the Board pack. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us go to it just so that we can look across 
at that table. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is in Ms Stimpel’s EXHIBIT DD1A and it – you 
will find it at page 2-5-6. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Sorry. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  2-5 …? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Six. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Six? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 88 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes I am there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you recall this table Ms Nhantsi? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes I do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you will see there at the pricing section 
towards the bottom the base rate of the various bidders is set out 
there.  When I said Seacrest was the cheapest I should have been 
slightly clearer.  It is the cheapest who were offering the 15 billion 
which seemed to have been a concern both for you and the Board.  Do 
you accept that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So of the bids they received Seacrest was the 
cheapest.  Do you accept that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes I do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And there was no confirmed interest rate that 
would be charged by FDC at the point in time that the Board decided to 
reject the Seacrest offer or the alternative offer.  Is that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  But it is the point that was raised by the 
Chairperson of the Board in the meeting. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Understood.  What I was trying to clarify was 
whether anyone interrogated it when it was raised. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No I did not interrogate it Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you and then I would like … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Are – are you saying the Chairperson of 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 89 of 266 
 
the Board informed the Board Meeting what the interest rate would be 
that FDC would charge? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is not what you are saying? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It is not what I am saying Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  What I am saying is she said she raised a 
concern that the 5.8 might be high but she did not say compared to 
what. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi but you will accept compared to the 
bids that were before them … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It was the cheapest? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It was the cheapest. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I agree. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I then would like to just deal with 
the – the first reason that the Board is recorded as having given for 
rejecting the Seacrest bid.  That had to do - as I understand your 
evidence and is reflected in the documents – with their unwillingness to 
provide their source of funds and concerns around the Due Diligence.  
20 
Is that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did anyone raise with the Board that Legal had 
looked into this and had created a series of protections for SAA in the 
conditions precedent that had been designed for the agreement that 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 90 of 266 
 
would be concluded with Seacrest? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It was discussed.  It was raised but the 
Board was not comfortable with the fact that you will enter into an 
agreement yet the company do not know the company they are refusing 
with the information.  Hence they felt that it looks like Seacrest does 
not have money. 
They want the letter of award so that they can go and source 
the funds.  So they were not happy with the condition precedent 
because it was there to say Seacrest must be accepted with the 
condition precedent that they submit the – the documentation.  So the 
10 
Board was not comfortable with approving yet the Due Diligence is not 
yet completed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Was there a representative of SAA Legal at that 
meeting? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I do not recall Chair whether he – the legal 
person was called or Acting CEO took this – discussed this but it was 
not me. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can we then understand that this determination 
by the Board of the inadequacy of the conditions precedent … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Ja. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That had been proposed by the legal review … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Was not canvassed with anyone from the Legal 
Department? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  When you are saying was not canvassed you 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 91 of 266 
 
mean nobody was – was called in? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes nobody was called in.  The Acting CEO 
took them through. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you have a view on whether those 
conditions precedent would have been adequate and just before you 
answer that if I may just give the background?  We went through them 
in some detail with Ms Stimpel but what they appear to do is to allow an 
agreement to be concluded with SAA subject to conditions precedent 
that would have required all of that information which was not 
10 
forthcoming prior to that point to then have to be provided before the 
agreement would take effect.  Did you consider that at all in the advice 
you gave to the Board on the day? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair first I did not give advice to the Board 
on the day but the Board as I am saying the Board was not comfortable 
specifically as it is written on the Board Resolution.  They were not 
comfortable because of those two instances and they did not call a 
Legal person to come in and explain.  They declined it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just one more clarification.  Did they raise at 
all the conditions precedent that had been proposed? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I do not recall.  I think what was – what was 
on debate on the day or what was discussed is the fact that Seacrest is 
refusing with the proof of funds and the – there – there is certain 
information for Legal to complete the Due Diligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you aware at that time yourself of those 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 92 of 266 
 
conditions precedent that had been suggested? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I was not aware Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm and do you – do you know whether the documents 
setting them out had been placed before the Board? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I do not recall the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not recall? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Draft Agreement Chair on the pack. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  That was submitted to the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh – oh, alright.  In terms of what the Board was told 
10 
about Seacrest do you know whether there was a memorandum or a 
document which was speaking to Seacrest bid in detail? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  There was a memorandum Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was it a memorandum that you had had a chance 
to read before you came to the meeting? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you – you say it did not have these conditions … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  A Draft Agreement. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Precedent? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No Chair.  If I recall the memorandum was 
explaining the process that has been followed from the RFP and was 
explaining the – the bidders that have submitted their bids … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 93 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  And the evaluation was done and based on 
this table the recommendation was – was Seacrest … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  And it was also - the same memorandum was 
then highlighting the urgency of the funds … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  That the company needs.  It was even 
highlighting the liquidity risks … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  That company together with the catastrophic 
10 
risks … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  That the company would face should the 
company not get the funding, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi I would like to assist – if I may – in 
this regard. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because our understanding from the evidence 
that has been presented thus far is that both 27 November submission 
from the Group Treasurer was before the Board but so too was the 
20 
memorandum that that recommendation had required be done by the 
Legal Risk and Compliance Section. 
I will take you to those documents now - to which an 
annexure is the draft agreement with the conditions precedent.  So 
maybe that will help refresh your memory as to whether that served 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 94 of 266 
 
before the Board. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you will find that in DD1 at page 2-4-4. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  DD1A? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  1A - apologies yes, A. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  2-4-4 – apologies I think I got that wrong as 
well - 2-4-4. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think that is the memorandum you are 
10 
recalling.  Is that right? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So this is the Group Treasurer memorandum of 
27 November.  It is written – well to get the chronology exactly right.  
There is one that precedes this which recommended a DD be done.  
There was a DD done and it is dated – you will see it at 2-7-4 – it is 
dated 26 November because Chair you will recall from the evidence 
there was concern … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to say there are so many of these 
20 
acronyms.  That is Due Diligence you are talking about. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is – it is.  DD for present purposes means 
Due Diligence not the exhibit number … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are currently dealing with. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 95 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So Ms Nhantsi … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will see at 2-7-4 that is the SAA Exco 
submission prepared by Legal Risk and Compliance. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you recall seeing that at the time? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  In the Board Meeting … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You see this is what covers all of the concerns 
… 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of the Legal Department about that Due 
Diligence.  It – it deal with … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes, yes I saw it.  It was part of 
27 November. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  Well then you will see at page 2-7-5 … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In the second line the sentence starts there: 
“A Draft Agreement has been prepared for the 
proposed transaction with Seacrest.  A copy is 
20 
attached marked Annexure 2.” 
That is the one that contains the conditions precedent. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you are satisfied that was also before the 
Board then? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 96 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  But I do not recall it, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would like to then just ask a few 
concluding questions on the FDC decision. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi as I – as I have your testimony 
earlier you even raised on that call with Mr Moyo on 1 December an 
issue around the mandate of the FDC.  Is that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes it is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as I understand your evidence he told you 
in no uncertain terms it was within their mandate to engage in this 
funding.  Is that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You were then informed and I did interrupt you 
earlier – apologies for that – but I wanted to move in sequence to … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  January 2016 because you were about to get 
there … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as we have Ms Stimpel’s evidence on 
6 January 2016 she relayed to you the outcome of a meeting that had 
been had between the Treasury Department of SAA and National 
Treasury at which National Treasury had indicated that this funding was 
beyond the mandate of the FDC.  Do you recall that? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 97 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes I recall. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You recall her making that known to you on 
6 January? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes and also I – I then said i will come back 
to her … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  On that, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  On that you seem to be agreed in your 
10 
evidence. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did that not worry you?  What did you do when 
you said you would come back to her? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes.  I did call the – the CFO of FDC.  As I 
said to Ms Stimpel that I will go and – and find out and then I even 
specifically asked Mr Moyo which section on the Act of FDC are they 
mandated to do.  He referred me to Section 4(A)(h) which is on the 
Posers of the Board on the FDC Act. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well let us look at that if we may. 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Sure. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair we do have it in the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In – in which bundle would it be? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I just have to remind myself.  Yes it is in DD1C. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got EXHIBIT DD1C. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 98 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you will find the Act begins at page 9-0-4. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Just hang on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  9-0-4. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Sorry what is the page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  9-0-4.  Ms Nhantsi can I just ask a little bit 
more about that conversation?  When he referenced that section of the 
Act did you go and look at it yourself at the time? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You – you said that he had indicated Section 
10 
4(F). 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  4(A)(h). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  4(A) … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  4(A)(h).  It starts by saying: 
“The Board of Directors shall have all the powers to 
achieve 
all 
the 
main 
objects 
for 
which 
the 
corporation is established and without detracting 
from the generality of the section the Powers of the 
Board shall include the following:  to enter into and 
finance joint ventures or act as an agent.” 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi I will probe that a bit further with 
you but can I just check. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did you run this past anyone in Legal at SAA? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I discussed it with the Head of Legal 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 99 of 266 
 
Ursula Fikelepi. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  When was that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Sometime in January after I discussed it with 
– with Mr Moyo. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did she agree with your interpretation? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes she did but it was not – I did not ask for 
a – a legal opinion.  We were just discussing. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will come back to why a legal Due Diligence 
was not done because that was actually requested in December by 
somebody from the Legal Department. 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi I accept that you are not a lawyer 
indeed. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  But can I explain why I accepted this and the 
discussion that I had with Ms Fikelepi? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Because the Board has got powers to enter 
into finance, joint ventures or act as an agent.  The discussion that I 
had with the CFO of FDC I asked how are they going to benefit or how 
are they acting.  He said the – in this transaction they are going to act 
20 
as an agent because they do not have the funds. 
The foreign investor in this case is Grissag AG will – will give 
the funds but they will charge a margin at SAA.  So basically they are 
acting as an agent. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So let me just get the sequence of events right. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 100 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You were told on 6 January that National 
Treasury … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Had taken the view that this was beyond the 
mandate of the FDC.  Correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You then went to engage FDC yourself.  
Correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You were told by FDC that it – that National 
Treasury was wrong. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That in fact it did fall within their mandate – 
4(A)(h). 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You had a conversation with somebody in the 
Legal Department but did not ask for any formal review to be done of 
20 
this question.  Correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  At the time Chair I did not ask for it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It did not worry you that the advice you were 
being given was directly contradicting what National Treasury had said? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Not – not really Chair at the time but now 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 101 of 266 
 
looking back and having heard what I have heard up to so far it would 
worry me but at the time it did not. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi I accept you are not a – a lawyer 
but I must put this to you in fairness.  The Powers of the Board of 
Directors of a company cannot be greater than the capacity of the 
company.  That is why a lawyer looking at this would first start at the 
capacity of the company which is Section 4. 
We did this the other day with Ms Stimpel in her evidence.  
You may have seen that.  The capacity of the corporation in Section 4 
is defined with reference to its main objects which is in three and none 
10 
of those Sections 3 include lending between State Owned Entities.  
They are all specifically concerned with the Province of the Free State.  
Do you see that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes I see that but as I have said – as I am 
saying she – he also referred me to this section … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Which I read and it – it made sense to me 
and I discussed it with Ursula Fikelepi but at the time I did not think of 
– of getting the – the legal opinion … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But … 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  But as you are rightfully saying it should not 
have exceeded the capacity.  I do not know and thanks for that.  I did 
not know. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  Let us … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Did it cross your mind that it was strange 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 102 of 266 
 
that an entity that is supposed to operate within a province – Free 
State – was seeking to involve itself outside of the province and with 
SAA? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it something that crossed your mind as … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Rather strange? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It did Chair.  I even asked and allow me to 
put in layman’s terms because he is also not a lawyer.  I asked one, I 
said to him it is – it is public knowledge that FDC gets grants from 
10 
Government.  Where are you going to get 15 billion from and then he 
told me about the – the foreign investor? 
I then said how is – how is FDC going to benefit.  He said no 
in terms of their FDC Act – that is why I am saying allow me to put it in 
layman’s terms because he then said the – the Act allows them to think 
outside the box and get money for – for Free State Development 
Corporation and how they are going to get money from this is there will 
be this intermediary and – I think he said 0.5 percent will be earned by 
FDC doing this transaction. 
Therefore FDC is going to benefit.  So it made sense to me 
20 
Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi how long after National Treasury 
raised this concern of the mandate of the FDC – FDC continued to be 
entertained as a possible source of funds becomes quite important in 
relation to the urgency with which funds eventually have to be sourced 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 103 of 266 
 
when FDC and that transaction fell through. 
I am giving you that background because I – I want to put to 
you that if Mr Lusenga’s query on 11 December that a Legal Due 
Diligence needed to be done on FDC had been done – do you recall 
that he made that request? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes I did. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Would you like to go to the email containing it? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I remember it but we can go if you … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  It is in DD1A at page 3-0-3. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes I am there Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  DD1A page 3-0-3. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes I am there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I’ve got it, thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you Chair, this is an email we looked at 
in last week’s evidence.  This is after the Board’s decision on the 3 r d of 
December to transact with FDC and then as I have it your efforts then 
to run a process for the procurement of FDC despite the fact that the 
Board had already taken its decision and in response to the sending out 
of the RFP to FDC Mr Lesenga, who I understand Lesenga, who I 
understand is from the Legal Department in SAA, is that correct? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes, correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    He sends an email on the 11 t h of December 
addressed to Michael Klein: 
“Dear Michael  
Are we going to conduct a legal and financial due diligence on FDC.” 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 104 of 266 
 
Do you see that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes I do Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Ms Nhantsi I can’t resist say that does come 
as something of an irony to me that question asked on the 11 t h of 
December because you will recall one of the principle reasons for the 
Board not being willing to go with Seacrest was that it was not satisfied 
that an adequate due diligence had been completed and yet it approved 
FDC without any due diligence of any sort being done, do you accept 
that those are the facts? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Yes that is a fact. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Because the first time this is asked is on the 
11 t h of December, so he asks for it to be done or whether it’s going to 
be done and your response at the top of that page as I have it is: 
“Yes we will perform the legal due diligence and I would suggest that 
we give that mandate to Ursula at the Legal Department.” 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    But that didn’t happen formally did it, 
according to your evidence? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   I don’t recall getting any legal due diligence 
report. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Indeed, all you had was that conversation 
with her, is that right?   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Not conversation, this is a mandate given 
Ursula. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    No apologies, your previous evidence was 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 105 of 266 
 
that you had a conversation with her in early January to check what 
you’ve been told by FDC, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Oh, no but that one was more relating to 
the mandate but it was not saying she must not do due diligence, I was 
just asking about the FDC mandate, so this one is mandated the legal 
department to do the due diligence. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Yes, maybe we are at cross-purposes, I 
assume one of the questions that the Legal Department would have 
looked at, had it done this due diligence is whether it fell within the 
FDC’s mandate to be engaging in this transaction at all? 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes, as I am saying I am not sure I didn’t 
get a report from legal department so I am not sure what was covered. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Right, but ...(intervention)  
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     But it was done at legal Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Indeed, but at least in January 2016 you were 
happy to proceed with FDC as I have it, based on what Mr Moyo had 
told you about the capacity of FDC and the conversation that you had 
with the head of the legal department at SAA, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes, I was happy to. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And those engagements with FDC as I have 
20 
the evidence continued right up until April of 2016, is that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Ms Nhantsi do you accept that if a proper 
legal due diligence had been done early in January, or indeed National 
Treasury’s position on this had been accepted there would have been 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 106 of 266 
 
an opportunity then and there to go out for another source of funds? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes I agree. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So when the FDC has continued to be 
entertained until April at least the months of February and March are 
lost for the purposes of sourcing funds. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair can I also elaborate on that is – 
it is not just about entertaining FDC, it was more about also calculating 
as I said the interest rate that we were going to get from FDC which 
was 4% so when we continued with FDC I think in my mind I saw – I 
was acting in the best interests of the company, looking at the interest 
10 
rate that we are going to get, legal department was doing their part but 
from the numbers perspective for me it made sense to continue with 
them. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Indeed Ms Nhantsi but whether the FDC had 
legal capacity to enter into this is a fundamental requirement for this to 
have been a successful source of funds for SAA, isn’t it? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So I just reiterate the point if the work had 
been done early on in January or if National Treasury’s view had been 
accepted that would have been the end to the engagement with FDC 
20 
would it not? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    I agree, agreed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you.  I would then like to go to the 
second decision which is the decision on the transaction advisor. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Perhaps before you leave that on my 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 107 of 266 
 
statement if you allow me Chair to conclude because my answer was 
no, no in what I know today, I would like to say why because I thought 
you would ask this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Why today I feel that decision was not 
supposed to be made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, deal with that please. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Yes, Chair in my discussion with Mr Moyo 
at the time he mentioned that the Chairperson of their Board, in the 
FDC Board was the brother of – was the sister of Mr Ace Magushule 
10 
and at the time I could not link anything because clearly I was coming 
the professional background where we’re doing the auditing and that so 
I was not really clued up with politics but now looking back and knowing 
what I know, having especially the testimony of Mr van der Merwe I see 
that in a way I was used a scapegoat or as a vehicle for people to 
enrich themselves, because knowing what I know now and also reading 
again and again the letter that – the one page letter that we received 
from FDC it does appear that there were discussions before the 
discussions.  It leaves me with no choice but to conclude that perhaps 
they used Mr Moyo to come to me because I would not question a letter 
20 
that is coming from Mr Moyo because if it was anybody else that I never 
knew before I was not going to entertain it, so I feel Chair that knowing 
what I know now with Mr van der Merwe I was used in this transaction 
and the following transaction but I will talk about the following 
transaction at the time as well but one I was acting in the best interests 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 108 of 266 
 
of the company, running like a headless chicken to save money for the 
company but not knowing that at the end there are certain people that 
will have rich pockets. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This decision of the SAA Board that you and the CEO, 
was it Acting CEO, you were interim CFO and there was an acting CEO. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Acting CEO yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you go ahead and take all the necessary steps 
and conclude an agreement with FDC.  I know that you don’t support it 
now as you sit there, you say it was not correct, but at that time, I just 
want to make sure I understand it, at that time did you feel that it was a 
10 
correct decision? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Yes Chair at the time I felt it was a correct 
decision, especially also backed up by the numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and when you look – and your reasons at the 
time for taking the view that it was the correct decision would be what? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    The reasons Chair at the time number one 
when you look at the letter that we received, sorry the term sheets that 
we received from FDC and you calculate how much savings would the 
company benefit number one the company was going to benefit 
700million.  Number two I was also comfortable with the fact that one 
20 
this is the Board transaction, but I was comfortable that it was 
accommodated on the SCM policy, we followed the process, so at the 
time I thought we’re doing a very good thing and in fact within the 
books of the company that we saved R700million in a year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you attended that meeting of the Board didn’t 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 109 of 266 
 
you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and as I understand your evidence you only found 
out about this clause of the policy after? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So at the time the decision was taken you didn’t 
know that there was a clause that seemed to, or that was going to be 
said to authorise that the Board makes a decision in the way it made it, 
but at that time did you think that the Board was correct in making the 
decision that it made namely go ahead and conclude an agreement with 
10 
FDC for the provision of this funding without any process. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that stage as you were sitting at the meeting. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   As I was sitting in the meeting Chair I knew 
that I am going to follow that process and ensure that it is in line with 
the supply chain management, supply chain policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So as you were sitting at the meeting you didn’t know 
whether it was in line or it was not in line? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   No I was not aware Chair, hence I called the 
procurement after the meeting to say this is the decision that has been 
20 
taken by the Board, the Board is saying you must implement this, is it 
catered, is it in line with the policy, because if it was not Chair I was 
going to take it back to the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So would it be correct that therefore you couldn’t 
have been in support of the decision as at the time you attended the 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 110 of 266 
 
meeting because you did not have enough information?   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     I did not have enough information Chair.  
And at the time I did not have also any reasons to doubt the Board that 
they are not taking the decision that is in the best interest of the 
company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but when you talk about any decision being in 
the best interest of a company there may be two components to that, 
there might be a decision that in principle maybe in the best interest of 
the company but there might be also the issue of processes, whether 
the right process is followed, so I guess that you would look at both 
10 
before you conclude whether you say this decision is in the best 
interests of the company because if the right processes are not 
followed that might not be in the best interests of the company. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but are you saying that as you were sitting at the 
meeting you did not know whether that decision was in accordance with 
the processes but you assumed that the Board would not take a 
decision that was not in accordance with processes or what is your 
evidence? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   I assumed number one, one thing that I 
20 
knew at the time Chair was in terms of the delegation of authority this 
transaction is the Board’s decision because I knew that any transaction 
that is above R50million the Board needs to take a decision, so when 
they took a decision in declining the Seacrest and the Consortium of 
the Banks and taking a decision of us engaging with FTC I thought at 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 111 of 266 
 
the time the Board, I didn’t have any reason to believe that there is 
anything untoward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So at what stage or when would you say you had 
reached a point where you said no this decision of the Board is 
correct?   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  After I engaged with the procurement team 
and they said there is clause that allows the accommodation of the FDC 
letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Aren’t the – shouldn’t there have been certain 
information before the Board about FDC that was critical for its 
10 
decision that wasn’t there, did the Board have all the information that it 
needed to have before it, before it could make a decision that we are 
choosing FDC to be the one to provide funding, because they were 
saying go ahead and conclude an agreement, isn’t it? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, did they have all the information that you in the 
position in which you occupied thought they needed to have? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    No they didn’t have all the information 
Chair, the only document that was in the possession of the Board was 
the letter that we circulated that morning, that was talking about FDC 
20 
and the letter the reason why I thought there’s nothing untoward 
because that’s unsolicited proposal, so the unsolicited proposals 
because there was no commitment on that letter they were saying if you 
are interested there’s nothing, there’s no firm commitment but we can 
engage it further hence after the Board, yes I agree with you maybe the 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 112 of 266 
 
Board took the decision with not enough information on their hands. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I take it that you not being a member of the Board 
but being interim CFO that you are being at the meeting of the Board 
on that occasion included that you could advise the Board or alert them 
to any dangers in making a decision one way or another on a matter 
such as this.  Would – did it – was that not part of your job at that 
meeting?  Maybe to be able to say to the Board before you make any 
decision on these matters it’s necessary to have the following 
information and I note that you don’t have that information.  My advice 
is that you don’t make a decision until you have that information, 
10 
wasn’t that part of what you were supposed to do? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     It was Chair but considering that I was new 
they took the decision but hence I am saying I went back to the team as 
far as getting the term sheet to understand what is FDC offering but 
you are right I didn’t raise a concern with the Board but in their 
fairness and in my fairness as well the fact that the company needed 
funding urgently I thought the decision was taken on an urgent basis 
that go and engage this process that the company had embarked on 
had failed now this is the unsolicited proposal go and engage and 
conclude if the information surface, that was how I interpreted it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that may be important because I noted when we 
looked at this extract from the minutes of the meeting of the Board that 
part 3 of the resolution, of the minutes that we looked at, at 289. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You don’t have to go there.  Didn’t say something 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 113 of 266 
 
along these lines the Interim CFO and the Acting CEO are are 
mandated to look into the following issues and if they are satisfied that 
those issues are in order go ahead and conclude.  It said you must go 
and conclude. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that struck me as strange in circumstances where 
it seemed all that they had on before them in regard to FDC was just 
that letter, but from what you said you agree that they didn’t have all 
the information that they needed to have in order to make that decision. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Agree Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:     And you should have advised them, do you agree? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Agreed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you didn’t advise them. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And why is that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Chair at that point in time one, and I don’t 
want it to be seen as if it is an excuse that one I was new, and it was 
the first board meeting that I attended, and I didn’t know how they 
operate, hence I did not just take it Chair and implement, I took it and 
discussed with the teams and find ways of working on it and if there 
20 
were any problems I would go back to the Board and say you are 
mandated as to run with this, but here are the challenges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What information was not before the Board that you 
believe was important to have been before the Board, before they made 
the decision to say conclude an agreement with FDC? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 114 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Specifically the information that was not in 
front of them was the quantum, was the amount that FDC because the 
letter is silent on how much FDC would bring on the table, so the first 
one is that and the second one is perhaps if they were more 
transparent on the funder and perhaps if they would also be more 
transparent of whether the FDC had mandates then to do this.  It would 
have also saved time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in terms of due diligence was that applicable or 
not applicable. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Not at that point Chair.  The due diligence 
10 
was going to be done after, because remember this is the day that we 
introducing 
FDC 
with 
the 
unsolicited 
proposal, 
so 
sitting 
in 
documentation would then come later, but at a minimum.  On that day 
the letter should have included the quantum, the letter should have 
been more open on their potential foreign investor and perhaps the 
tenure of or the intention how long would they give, how much is the 
longevity of this debt, the interest rates and all that, but due diligence 
at the time Chair was going to be done later on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I might not understand this, my understanding is 
that that paragraph 3 of the extract from the minutes my understanding 
20 
is that it – is that it includes that you and – it included that you and the 
Acting CFO, CEO, should conclude an agreement with FDC, is my 
understanding correct, is it the same as yours? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   It’s correct Chair, it is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I would have thought that due diligence is 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 115 of 266 
 
supposed to happen before you conclude an agreement? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   No sure I hear you Chair, I thought you 
asked me what information should have been before the Board on that 
day, for them to decide. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no, I asked you that question earlier. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Oh, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you told me what information you thought 
should have been before the Board, then I asked you the question 
whether due diligence should have been done before the Board could 
make that decision. 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I thought you were saying no not at that stage. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Oh sorry Chair, yes, due diligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was supposed to have been done? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Agreed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it wasn’t done at that stage? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It was not done at that stage Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And is that quite a critical thing to have due diligence 
done before a company such as SAA could say go ahead and conclude 
an agreement with a particular entity? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It is Chair, it is a critical thing because you 
need to know the company that is going to be bringing money to the 
company, it is critical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, otherwise you would be putting SAA at great 
risk? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 116 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair, hence as well to emphasize on 
that hence Seacrest on the previous, on the same extract was declined, 
it was declined based on the – one of the reasons was the due 
diligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And of course Ms Hofmeyr mentioned earlier to you 
that it was strange that one of the reasons why the Board rejected 
Seacrest was that due diligence had not been done, but when it came 
to FDC they approved FDC despite the fact that due diligence had not 
been done in regard to FDC either. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And would you have been alive to all of these things 
at the time of that meeting? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Not with due diligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  If, for me Chair in my capacity I would have 
advised the Board, I didn’t, but I should have advised the Board at 
least to know the quantum, to know the potential funder and the tender 
and all that.  I don’t think at the time that I was attending that meeting I 
would have been alive to say due diligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would it be correct to say that people who are 
20 
familiar with businesses and so on and certainly chartered accountants 
should when told the Board for SAA approved that an agreement be 
concluded with FDC involving billions of rand without due diligence 
being made would it be correct to say a chartered accountant would say 
how could they do that?  That that would be the reaction.  Would that 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 117 of 266 
 
be correct to say, that’s what one would expect from a chartered 
accountant? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Not really Chair no, that’s a ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Not really, it’s not as bad as that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No, no Chair ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s something that can be entertained? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Not entertained but if for example one would 
hear that perhaps the Board has approved and there was no quantum, 
there was no interest then you would say as a chartered accountant 
why, why is that, but a due diligence is more in the legal space so to 
10 
speak. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the entity with whom SAA, the SAA Board would 
be saying go ahead and conclude an agreement, could we be proved to 
be completely deficient in terms of that, it’s not the type of entity that 
can provide what you are looking for isn’t it? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Agreed Chair, hence ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  And you discover that if you do due diligence isn’t it? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair hence on my email on the 11 t h of 
December I was mandating the legal department to do the due 
diligence. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so your idea was that you were going to do it 
nevertheless, you were going to go for due diligence. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even though you accept that it is something that 
probably should have been done before and that you – the Board 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 118 of 266 
 
maybe should have been advised that wait until there is due diligence. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair, we are at one o’clock, I have 
one or two follow up questions on this aspect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, maybe just ask those two. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair, I have also been told that there 
has been a delay on the lunch and that is only available at one thirty, I 
don’t know if that should be taken into account in the decision about 
when we break but I was asked to make that known.  My sense is if we 
10 
take the hour and it’s only available midway that should still be fine, 
but ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if we take the hour and that still should be fine 
then let us take the hour, but I think you can ask the two questions.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  Thank you Chair.  Ms Nhantsi I would 
just like to get clear on your understanding of your responsibilities in 
that meeting on the 3 r d of December.  You were the interim albeit Chief 
Financial Officer of SAA, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you were there to look after the financial 
20 
best interests of SAA? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct.   You have indicated to the Chair a list 
of information that should have been before the Board, before it 
decided to mandate you and the Acting CEO to conclude this 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 119 of 266 
 
transaction, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Amongst them I recall you saying there should 
have been an actual indication of how much was going to be funded, 
correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That was not in the letter? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No it was not in the letter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that is all that served before the Board on 
that day, correct? 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There should have been a term to the loan 
financing, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There also Ms Nhantsi I want to suggest there 
should have been a clear indication of the rate, should there not? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because you cannot assess whether this is 
going to be in the financial interests of SAA unless you know what the 
rate is, correct? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So Ms Nhantsi I would like to ask you why you 
didn’t raise any of that with the Board on that day, given that it was 
your responsibility to look after the financial interests. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair as I have agreed that I did not raise 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 120 of 266 
 
this and I was supposed to have raised them, hence I followed the 
process of getting this information which we did get it on the 24 t h of 
December and if there was any challenge on this, for example if the 
term sheet came back with less than the 15billion, because on the day 
the Board assumed that SAA –FDC will give us either fourteen or fifteen 
billion.  I take the responsibility that I should have highlighted this and 
I did not Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Chair those are the questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, we will take the lunch adjournment and we will 
resume at two.   
10 
 
We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Hofmeyr I hope the time was enough. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Indeed.  It was, it was thank you Chair.  We 
have replenished ourselves and ready to go. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no that is fine.  In terms of what time we finish 
this afternoon we did speak about the possibility of going beyond four 
o’clock would the second witness be – I mean able he knows about the 
possibility? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  He does.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We did discuss that over the break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And that is in order I understand. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 121 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  That is fine.  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Chair in the interest of time 
and Ms Nhatsi my proposal is for the remainder of the evidence this 
afternoon on occasion to seek to summarise for you on occasion what 
is contained in documents just so that we can speed up the process but 
at any point if you want to have the document in front of you feel free 
to ask that that be the case.  With your leave Chair if that will be 
convenient just to speed up the pace? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no no that is fine.  So what Ms Hofmeyr is saying 
that in leading your evidence she might either summarise to you what a 
10 
particular document says or she might ask you to just articulate the 
points that are contained in the particular document as you remember 
them.  But should you feel that you would rather have a look at the 
document first before answering feel free to say so. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Ms Nhantsi I would like to move to 
the next decision which is the – sorry was there something you wanted 
to say? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair with your permission I will be very 
20 
quick? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I would like to – to highlight something in 
closing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 122 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  FDC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  So say Chair as I have stated that I take full 
responsibility of not highlighting to the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  The quantum and the interest rate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  But at operational level Chair as you have 
seen that I did not take the decision and run with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  We went at an operational level and ensure 
that processes are done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  And the contract Chair between SAA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  And FDC was not going to be concluded 
without the due diligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I just wanted to just… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So if any of the things that you still wanted to 
20 
look at were not what they were supposed to be you were going to raise 
that with the board? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  If we then go to the decision in 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 123 of 266 
 
relation to the transaction advisor.  Ms Nhantsi this actually begins on 
the 21 April 2016 because that is the board resolution to extend the 
scope of the transaction advisor.  You refer to that in your own 
statement.  If we go to that at page 6 paragraph 21. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is of her statement? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of her statement which is bundle DD2 I think.  
Yes.  So we are in Exhibit DD2 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Which contains Mr Nhantsi’s statement and we 
10 
are at page 6 paragraph 21 and as I have it there you – apologies.  I 
made an error Ms Nhantsi.  At page 6 paragraph 21 you make the point 
that it was at the 3 December meeting that famous one where the FDC 
decision was taken that there is a decision now that a transaction 
advisor must be appointed to – in relation to the 15 billion debt 
consolidation, is that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you had a meeting with Ms Stimpel on 
the 6 January 2016 where in terms of her evidence she – you relayed to 
her at the end of that meeting – remember that is the meeting at which 
20 
she recounts to you what National Treasury’s attitude is in relation to 
the mandate of FDC and on her evidence you said to her at the end of 
that oh and by the way the board wants to appoint a transaction advisor 
and she said but we do not need it because that work has already been 
done.  Do you recall that? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 124 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair I do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As I understand your statement you however 
stand by the decision to appoint a transaction advisor, is that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And as I read your statement you said that 
there were three reasons given and you will see them over the page at 
page 7.  It is the second part of paragraph 21.  There are three reasons 
there Chair you will recall we went through them with Ms Stimpel for 
her comment.  I would like to take you Ms Nhantsi through them for 
your comment.  The first that you were given was that Ms Stimpel was 
10 
inexperienced in the position, is that correct?  That was one of the 
motivations. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would like to have your comment on that.  Ms 
Stimpel gave evidence last week to say that she disagreed with that as 
being a legitimate reason.  She explained that she had been in the 
treasury department for ten years.  That she had often deputised for 
the then CFO’s over periods and the Group Treasurers and in that 
context she did not believe that she lacked the experience to be able to 
advise on the debt consolidation.  What is your comment on that? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  My comment Chair yes the board raised a 
concern that there is a lack of experience and expertise at the internal 
treasurer at SAA and I agreed with them more because as much as in 
contrary to what Ms Stimpel said that she had experience of ten years 
in the treasurer – as a treasurer she had only eight months in acting 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 125 of 266 
 
and only a month in the permanent position.  So I believed as well as 
the board raised concerns that she might not have the kind of 
expertise.  Also if you allow me to combine with the other reason that 
the board also said in the past treasury of SAA and finance ignored the 
Section 217 for example of the constitution where they would not follow 
the processes and all that so they would like to get an independent 
opinion of an expert considering that this is the 15 billion magnitude 
and they have to be accountable for that.  I did not have a reason not 
to agree with them at the time Chair because indeed when I checked 
the Group Treasurer left SAA in February and then Ms Stimpel started 
10 
acting and she was permanent for just a month. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Let us focus on that third reason that you were 
given which is that the board wanted external advise in relation to the 
debt consolidation transaction.  Is that as I understand the rationale 
that was given? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes the – in terms of the – yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That as I understand your evidence was a 
decision taken at the same meeting that the FDC loan offer was 
supported by the board and you were mandated to execute, is that 
correct? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair it is correct I was mandated to 
execute but I then made a submission back to the board more because 
on the extract or on the resolution the transactional advisor part was 
not reflecting so I wanted a resolution to say as such. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can we just separate two things.  I think at the 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 126 of 266 
 
moment you talking about the processes that follow the 3 December 
meeting we will come to those. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because it is part of the trend that develops 
through your statement that often the board takes a decision and then 
there are steps taken thereafter.  I will probe that with you but what I 
am interested in is it is at the very same meeting that the board 
mandates you to conclude the 15 billion debt consolidation with FDC. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Agreed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That they say we need a transaction advisor to 
10 
advise us on the very thing that they have just told you to go and 
execute, is that right? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes except that it is two things.  The 
transactional advisor was going to assist the company in reviewing the 
loans, the scope is there on the letter.  The FDC was going to give the 
funding.  So basically the transactional advisory services were only 
going to be done at the receipt of 15 billion.  So it is two things. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So just help me with that.  There was no need 
then to procure a transactional advisor until there had been the 15 
billion funds secured? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes.  No I do not want to say yes.  The 
process even if the transactional advisor for an example the 
transactional advisor process in terms of procurement was done in 
March the 20 t h but until the funds are in SAA’s account the 
transactional advisor was going to do nothing much, nothing really. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 127 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We will have to look at that because that does 
not come out in the motivations that I have seen.  But we will go to 
them in a moment.   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can I just be clear so it was not the case that 
the transaction advisor was going to be advising on the debt position, 
the merits of the debt consolidation, the position in relation to the loans 
because all of that had been taken care of on 3 December.  You were 
going to conclude with FDC, is that right? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  The FDC was going to source – give SAA the 
10 
funding.  The transactional advisor was going to review the debt loan 
book of SAA and advise which loans to pay first and which ones not to 
pay.  One of the reasons that they raised – the board – was for an 
example from the naked eye I am not sure if I am allowed to name the 
banks Chair.  There was a loan to the tune of 1.3 billion that was with 
Nedbank.  The rate there was high but from the naked eye you would 
think that is the loan that you would immediately need to pay but it was 
a strategic loan because on SAA’s balance sheet that loan was 
classified as an equity and it was strengthen the balance sheet of SAA.  
So one of the duties of the transactional advisor was to review the loan 
20 
book and advice the board – was to review the balance sheet and 
advice on how to restructure the balance sheet.  That of course if after 
the receipt of 15 billion.  And also look at the loan – the leases – the 
lease book in terms of how to minimise and reduce the exposure of the 
exchange rate and all that.  FDC was just going to be bringing 15 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 128 of 266 
 
billion and the rest of the analysis and the work of advisory services 
was going to be done by the company that they requested that we 
appoint. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So the debt consolidation decision was not a 
product of that very analysis that you describe having been done the 
previous year? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No.  The debt consolidation decision was 
based on that fact that the company was paying 15 billion – sorry 1.2 
billion interest in a year and it would – the loans – the company owed 
loans to various financial institutions to seven of them so the decision 
10 
was more taken to say can we consolidate the debt and put it into one 
pot. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  And so that we can maximise the benefit of 
the interest that you are paying. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you do not accept that the work in 
assessing the existing loans, their impact on the balance sheet, all of 
that had been done the prior year by the treasury department.  The 
outcome of which was this decision of a saving by consolidating the 
debt.  In your view there was still more work that needed to be done? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  In my view and it is in board’s view as well. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well my thinking had been that the transactional 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 129 of 266 
 
advisors that their role would dictate logically that they come even 
before you get the money and look at your situation that is SAA’s 
situation and be able to advise even in terms of which entity is 
providing you or  SAA with the best arrangement loan in terms of the 
terms and everything based on SAA’s own situation of debt.  That had 
been my thinking.  My thinking had been that even before the decision 
is made as to who do we go with that the transactional advisors would 
have had a role before that but I have never been involved in 
something as big as that and anything as big as that, is that 
understanding wrong? 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  The understanding is correct Chair hence 
before the receipt of the 15 billion we started sharing the information 
with a transactional advisor after the processes were done and it was 
appointed – we started sharing the information but I believe minimal 
work was done because the information that they requested was the 
debt profile so they have not – they never requested the loan 
agreements and with the banks so that they can then advise that 
strategically this one is – you should not touch it. This one you should 
touch it.  The only thing that we gave them was the debt profile of the 
company, how much we owing whom, when are they maturing, how 
20 
much are the guarantees that we still have unutilised, how much 
utilised, that is the kind of information that we already gave them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but the reason I am asking this is because I 
understand your evidence in response to Ms Hofmeyr’s questions to be 
that the transactional advisors did not need to come before the money 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 130 of 266 
 
from FDC was in SAA’s bank account.  They needed to advise when the 
money was already in SAA’s account and – did I misunderstand you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  They did some minimal work Chair.  I think I 
was more trying to attempt to distinguish between the fund raising and 
the transactional advisory services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  They have started some work and the reason 
why I am saying even the work that they did was minimal and you are 
right in saying they are supposed to start before – hence we give them 
the information but the work was so minimal that they never even 
10 
invoiced the company themselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I would have really thought that if you are 
going to need advice you need it before you make the decision as to 
who? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You should enter into an agreement with you might 
need advice even after for other aspects but it seems to me that the 
most important – maybe not the most important but certainly before you 
choose that you might need advice on various aspects so that you do 
not choose an entity that is not appropriate in terms of its terms and 
20 
conditions and rates that is not appropriate for your own situation.  Is 
that more or less your own … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I am not sure if I am getting that last one 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright maybe I am confusing you.  But I am 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 131 of 266 
 
simply saying my expectation would be that SAA would say we need to 
have transactional advisors who can look at our situation as a 
company.  Look at the debts, look at long term commitments, short term 
commitments, look at everything and look at what is maturing when and 
so on and so on and our investments or whatever and say, as you are 
looking for a lender for this purpose this is the type of lender you 
should be looking at.  Or maybe not the type of lender but the lender 
who would be most appropriate for your situation is one that can give 
you at least the following terms bla, bla, bla in terms of minimum you 
know.  Anything that does not contain these would not be good for you.  
10 
That is my expectation of what a transactional advisors would do but I 
may be wrong. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I get you Chair.  Yes Chair that was the 
intention for them to review hence we gave them the information.  But I 
should admit that certain things were overtaken by events Chair.  
Because immediately when the FDC could not give the funding and also 
their loans maturing I never made a follow up with them in terms of how 
far are you on the advisory service?  The last time I spoke to them was 
when I gave them the information on the maturing of the debts and the 
investments and all that.  So I never followed up on getting the report 
20 
because now we were busy chasing the 15 billion itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Nhantsi the upshot of my 
querying is the reasonable of a board of SAA taking a decision on the 3 
December 2015 to mandate you to conclude a transaction with FDC to 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 132 of 266 
 
secure the 15 billion debt which would thereby be consolidated and in 
the same breath appointing a transaction advisor to advise on the very 
thing that they have decided to mandate you to implement.  Can I have 
your comment on that?  Do you regard that as unreasonable? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Can you repeat it? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  My difficulty is that on the 3 December as I 
understand your evidence. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The board said we going with FDC we want you 
and the acting CEO to conclude that transaction which is going to 
10 
enable us to consolidate the debt and bring 15 billion into the company. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Right. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And in the same breath they decide that a 
transaction advisor needs to be appointed to review all those parts of 
SAA financial position which are secured through the very agreement 
you have been asked to execute.  Does that not strike you as 
unreasonable as the Chair was indicating earlier it seems as though 
that work needed to be done before the decision was taken on the 3 
December.  On the 3 December they had taken the decision and they 
want the person to advice on the very taking of the decision they have 
20 
taken.   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No Chair I do not see it as unreasonable 
because on one hand the company is going to get 15 billion, on the 
other hand the boards wants surety that the 15 billion is used as per 
the purpose of it.  So I see it as two different things because the 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 133 of 266 
 
transactional advisor was going to advise that pay A, B, C do not pay 
this, restructure balance sheet like this and all that so I do not see it 
unreasonable. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I understand your answer but your view was 
those resources did not live inside in SAA we needed to go externally 
for them? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and you – you view the decision as not 
unreasonable even bearing in mind that it was taken on the basis of the 
10 
letter at page 289 that we looked at where there was no rate specified 
and the letter said this is not a commitment and a lot of information 
that you said was important to be before the commission was not there.  
So you regard the decision as having been reasonable notwithstanding 
all of those things? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair I regard it as reasonable on the 
basis that the letter was unsolicited proposal.  So there was still some 
probing that needed to be done at operational level.  So there was work 
that was still needs to be done.  I think for me the reason why I say it 
was reasonable is the board understands that there is 15 billion coming 
20 
in.  At the same time the board is accountable and responsible to make 
sure that the money is used according to the specification because at 
the end they have to account.  So it is – for me it is more reasonable 
on that basis Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is it not the normal process that you gather 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 134 of 266 
 
information before you make a decision?  You do not make a decision 
first and gather information after. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  That is the normal process Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Hence – hence after the decision that was 
taken by the board at operational level we followed the process and 
gathered the information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in terms of what was before the board – in terms 
of FDC that letter really how much information did that letter give them 
that was important for that decision? 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Without talking on behalf of the board Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no not on behalf of the board you were at the 
meeting. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know what was before them and we know it was 
that letter. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that letter only in terms of documents if I recall 
correctly.  So that letter was – that – it seems to me to have been the 
kind of letter that did not give you – give the board enough information 
20 
to justify making a final decision like that on such an important issue. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair but that letter was an unsolicited 
proposal hence apologies if I sound as if I am repeating myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Hence at operational level.  Chair if the 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 135 of 266 
 
decision for the board I would have just implemented it.  After that 
meeting I would have just given FDC the letter of award. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I understand that and I understand that you have 
said from your point you wanted to check certain things. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when you read the decision of the board it does 
not seem to suggest that there is the implementation of its decision is 
dependent on anything that was yet to be – that was still to be 
checked.  It seems to be final. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I agree with you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is what strikes me because if you are 
supposed to make a decision and here we are talking about a very big 
decision involving billions of rand for a company that was in serious 
debt.  If you are going to make a decision like that I would have 
thought that you would want to make sure that all the information that 
you need to have is placed before you first before you make the 
decision.  But what we see here is a situation where even on your own 
evidence certain important information was not before the board.  
Nevertheless the boards says go ahead, conclude an agreement.  It 
does not say, it principle we think we are inclined to go with FDC 
20 
interim CFO and acting CEO look at ABCD.  If ABCD is in order go 
ahead.  It does not say that, you agree? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It just says take steps and conclude.  That is what 
concerns me about the decision but you have made – you have stated 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 136 of 266 
 
your views unless there is something else you want to add that should 
be fine. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No there is nothing Chair that I want to add. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi I mentioned that we would go to the 
question of process again because you recall the FDC decision is taken 
but then you go through a process thereafter.  In relation to the 
transaction advisor appointment a similar thing occurred, did it not? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we go to your motivation you will find it at 
10 
page 47 of your bundle which is DD2.   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You see what strikes me as odd about this 
submission is as I have your evidence on the 3 December the board 
decides to approve the appointment of a transaction advisor but then as 
you see on the date of this motivation this 15 January the following 
year you write a motivation to the board and I quote under purpose “To 
request board to approve the appointment of a transaction advisor 
regarding the 15 billion consolidation debt restructuring exercise.”  How 
can that be regular? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  When you say how can that be regular you 
are asking why did I do the motivation. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  After the very decision that you are asking 
them to approve has already been taken. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes.  As I have highlighted Chair the 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 137 of 266 
 
discussion on appointing the transactional advisor was discussed on 
the 3 December but it was not on the board resolution.  I wanted it to 
be on the board resolution so that the processes can be run. 
Procurement department for an example told me that mostly they run 
especially if I would say it is a board decision I need a board resolution 
and it was discussed 3 December but the board resolution as we have 
read it it did not reflect it.  So I was more – this is more a formality to 
the board for me to get the board resolution.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Are you aware that there was another board 
meeting on the 9 December 2015? 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes there was I think I am aware. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I – if you go in DD1[a] – [c] apologies that is 
Ms Stimpel’s bundle.   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will see… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say DD – Exhibit DD[c]? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what page? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And we are at page 915.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  915.2 
CHAIRPERSON: 1915. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is under Tab A3 if that assists. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will see those are the minutes of the SAA 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 138 of 266 
 
board of directors meeting held on Wednesday the 9 December at 
Emperors Palace. I see reflected as in attendance includes yourself, if 
that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you go all the way to page 20 of 21 which is 
the – it is a very long record of that meeting you will find it at page 
915.21. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we just go back a page to 915.20 you will see 
a heading “Eleven Governance” there.   
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you will see under 11B there is Round 
Robin Resolutions and then the SAA board of directors noted and 
ratified the Round Robin Resolutions and then all of them are listed.  
And then if you go to 915.21 you will see just after half way down the 
page there is an entry appointment of transaction advisor.  You will see 
there: 
“The Board by round robin as of 23 October 2015 
resolved to approve the engagement of a competent 
transaction advisor to deliver, validate or enhance 
20 
the A320/A330 swap transaction and the 15 billion 
funding requirement and RFP.” 
Is that not the Board Resolution of – approving the 
engagement of a competent transaction advisor on the funding 
requirement? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 139 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It is Chair but also I think for me I was not 
here at the time but it was also discussed on 3 December the 
appointment of transaction advisor.  So I did not have a resolution.  So 
I wanted a resolution. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well on 9 December do you accept that there 
was a resolution? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I see it Chair.  I do not recall it though hence 
I did this again. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay because you then will agree that if they 
did approve it on the 5 t h – on 9 December it would be inexplicable to 
10 
then go to them in January 2016 and ask them to approve the very 
thing that is already been approved? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I agree with you but they did approve it again 
even the company … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Secretary (intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed they did but what I am probing with you 
is why you would go to ask for approval of something that has already 
taken place. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair you would see that they were ratifying 
20 
the – the round robins that happened.  For example this submission 
was 23 October 2015. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Huh-uh. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It was before my time.  So – and it was 
discussed as – as I am emphasising on 3 December.  I think the 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 140 of 266 
 
prudent thing that perhaps could have happened was the Board or the 
Company Secretary to alert me to this to say hang on this decision had 
already been taken … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  But a memorandum was taken – taken back 
to the Board and I got the – the approval … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Of the transaction advisor. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In your statement Ms Nhantsi you give a 
different justification for your motivation in January.  If you go to page 
10 
7 at paragraph 23 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Wait.  Before that Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Pardon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so it seems that the – when the Board made the 
decision on 3 December to go with FDC they had a number of weeks 
before that.  They had already the appointment of transaction advisors.  
Is that correct? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And those transaction advisors were not 
20 
appointed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So then the query remains. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, the query remains. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We get to 3 December … 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 141 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  On the same day that they approve FDC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  They want a transaction advisor appointed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As I understand Ms Nhantsi’s evidence she did 
not have a resolution to that effect yet.  That is why I took her to 
9 December … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  To suggest that then reflects the resolution of 
10 
the Board … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And what we are now probing is well does it 
make sense then in January to go and ask them for the approval and I 
indicated to Ms Nhantsi as I read your statement you justify that 
conduct in January 2016 on the basis that that is something your 
predecessor had done as well. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Where …? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us go to that if we may.  It is page 7 of your 
bundle which is DD2. 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  DD2? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Oh, mine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That is your statement. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes.  Yes I am there Chair. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 142 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you pick it up towards the bottom of 
paragraph 22.  You say there in a sentence just before paragraph 23: 
“Based on the instruction and the recommendation 
of the Board I compile the submission dated 
January 2016.” 
That is a reference – as I have it – to the document we were 
just looking at. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Huh-uh. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Then you say at 23: 
“Then 
the 
Board 
at 
their 
meeting 
held 
on 
16 January resolved under Item 14.11 that the 
Board approves the request for an appointment of 
transaction advisor to advice regarding the 15 
billion debt consolidation restructuring exercise.” 
And then you – as I read your statement give your 
justification for doing it in what I am going to suggest to you is the 
reverse order. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Huh-uh. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You say: 
“I 
did 
not 
foresee 
anything 
untoward 
when 
implementing the Board’s instruction because based 
on the historical information my predecessor used 
to also take instructions from the Board and submit 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 143 of 266 
 
a motivation afterwards.” 
Do you see that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that as you understand the position that your 
predecessor Mr Meyer used to do a similar thing?  There would be a 
Board decision and then he would submit a motivation for the very 
decision that the Board had just taken previously? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No I think here what I was trying to – to say 
and to justify I think when I met with the – including yourself 
Ms Hofmeyr - you insinuated that it looks like I was just implementing 
10 
the instructions of the Board – just take the instructions and – and go 
with them. 
I think here what I was – I was doing is to show you that I do 
not see anything untoward because even the – the Memorandum of 
Incorporation does say that the CEO is to implement the instructions 
from the Board. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  So here basically I am saying the Board 
discussed on 3 December and I am doing the submission taking – 
taking it back to them for them to formalise.  So I was trying to say 
20 
even my predecessor did the same at some point. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well I would like to follow up on two aspects.  
Let us go to what your predecessor did because you do offer as 
justification the fact that Mr Meyer did a similar thing … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 144 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you give as an example of that the email 
correspondence that appears at page 52 of your bundle - if we can go 
there. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 5-2? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  5-2 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes I am there Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi just as a preface to my question I 
do not want my question to misunderstood.  I take no issue with the 
10 
Board taking decisions and management executing those decisions 
afterwards.  The force of the concern is that the Board takes a decision 
and then a submission is made to it requesting that it take the very 
decision it has taken. 
Do you contend that these emails at page 52 show that 
Mr Meyer did the latter?  In other words received – was aware of a 
decision taken by the Board and then went back to the Board to ask the 
Board to take the very decision they had taken. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair if – if you first look at the first 
email on page 52 if you allow me to read it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  “Dear Chair …” 
It is coming from Mr Meyer. 
“Dear Chair, following the decision of the Board to 
withdraw the RFP we formally in writing advice all 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 145 of 266 
 
the recipients of the RFP that it has been 
withdrawn.  We shall work on and provide the Board 
with a formal paper on debt consolidation as a 
matter of urgency.” 
So how I interpreted this is Mr Meyer was given instruction by 
the Board to cancel the RFP because the RFP did not follow the 
procurement process and all that and – and he was then instructed to 
provide a formal paper on debt consolidation as a matter of urgency.  
So this email confirms that he was given an instruction and then he is 
agreeing here that okay I am taking the instruction and I am going to 
10 
compile the debt consolidation right up. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi I put it to you that those are two 
very different things.  The one is a decision of the Board to withdraw 
the RFP which Mr Meyer is instructed to implement and he does.  The 
other is that they want a further paper on debt consolidation which he 
gets his team to work on. 
We understand from Ms Stimpel’s evidence that indeed took 
place.  I put it to you that that is not a situation in which the Board took 
a decision to withdraw the RFP and Mr Meyer then made a submission 
to the Board requesting them to take a decision to withdraw the RFP.  
20 
Do you accept that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I accept that and I would also like to add and 
say perhaps the reason why it looks different in the past a funding as 
Ms Stimpel testified that it was excluded from the procurement – from 
the SCM Policy.  What we were doing here is to ensure that the funding 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 146 of 266 
 
because it is not exempted from the SCM Policy. 
So perhaps what you might see it different is because now we 
are following the procurement process.  The Board will take a decision 
and I would want to make sure that it is in line and it is aligned with the 
SCM Policy. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi just to be clear so that there is no 
discrepancy on the record. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am not debating at all the merits of whether 
there should have been a procurement process followed. 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What I am interested in is a developing theme 
… 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In the management of SAA that appears to be 
evidenced in your statement.  That the Board takes decisions and then 
thereafter they get motivations from management that they take the 
very decision that they have taken and I submit to you that email is not 
evidence that Mr Meyer engaged in that but that your motivation of 
16 January is evidence of that procedure being adopted. 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I guess through you Chair yes it might be 
seen as a theme but I think going forward it is – it is how it is 
especially if it is a Board transaction.  A Board will take a decision and 
at operational level will ensure that the processes are followed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not – I am not entirely sure that you are not at 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 147 of 266 
 
cross purposes.  Maybe – maybe you are not at cross purposes.  Let 
me try this.  What Ms Hofmeyr is saying to you is this. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She says when she looks at the documentation – 
some of the documentation she sees that what you did is that after the 
Board had made a certain decision you would approach the Board and 
ask the Board to make the same decision again and the understanding 
is that you seem to – you may seem to have suggested that your 
predecessor used to do the same.  Is that your – do you understand 
what I am talking about? 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I think the context is that on 3 December 
certain decisions were taken but on 9 December a certain decision was 
taken also relating to transaction advisors and there had been a round 
robin resolution on 23 October about transaction advisors but in 
January you approach the Board – January 2016 – and – and ask them 
to make a decision that they had already made.  That is – that is the 
concern.  You understand it? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  (No audible reply). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she is saying the correspondence to which 
20 
reference has been made at 52 does not reflect – does not support 
anything you may be saying along the lines that your predecessor used 
to approach the Board and ask it to make decisions that it had already 
made. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair thank you for – for clarity.  Chair I 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 148 of 266 
 
think one I agree with you that – and I agree with Ms Hofmeyr – that I 
would take it back to the Board.  The reason for me to take it back to 
the Board would only – it is on instances where the Board Resolution 
does not reflect it and – and the second one maybe what it might be 
seen as abnormality is because in the past the funding was excluded 
from SCM Policy. 
So it was derived from the Financial Risk Framework.  Maybe 
how it was done was the – the Treasurer would – would compile 
documents and then take them to the Board.  So what was happening 
on this one was firstly we took it as this is a Board transaction and the 
10 
Board has to make decisions on them. 
So on instances where for an example there is an extract 
from the Board like when they decline Seacrest.  When they mandated 
myself and the Acting CE to – to conclude with FDC I did not take it 
back to the Board but on instances where I do not have the Board 
Resolution I would take it back to the Board. 
It might have been a new thing at SAA Chair but also I would 
expect if that was not the normality because I would assume that for 
any instruction from the Board it has to have a Board Resolution but 
the Company Secretary as well allowed me to do that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi I understand your answer to involve 
the proposition that the Board needed to take a decision in relation to 
the appointment of the transaction advisor that is why you needed to go 
back to them again to get a resolution.  Is that right? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 149 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Are you aware that they did not make any 
decision in relation to the appointment of the transaction advisor?  That 
ended at the CEO level.  It never went to the Board. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes there is a reason for that Chair.  After 
the procurement process was – was conducted by all the committees 
the amount of the – the amount that the – the transaction advisor was 
2.6 including VAT.  I think it was 2.8 million.  So because it was the 
amount itself was – it was falling within the – the ambit of CEO we were 
advised that we can take because the Board has already approved the 
10 
concept that and you must go upon the transaction advisor now the 
amount is low.  The CEO can sign it.  So the resolution is signed by the 
Acting CEO. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It did not have to go back to the Board? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No that one because already the Board took 
a decision on it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right and in relation to this theme that I have 
described do you agree from a corporate governance point of view the 
challenge that might present itself when the records of the decision 
making of SAA is maybe looked at from the outside might be the 
20 
following:  if the Board takes a decision but then management there is 
on record asking for that very decision to be taken again. 
There is at least an appearance that the originator of the 
perceived need is management in the company and not the Board.  Do 
you see that by presenting your submission that is what it makes it look 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 150 of 266 
 
like?  That it was management who identified the need for a transaction 
advisor. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes I agree and I would say perhaps the only 
shortfall on the submission would be on the background.  I think where 
I fell short was perhaps on the background – on the submission for 
example I should have said this decision was – was already taken by 
the Board on 3 December. 
We are just making this submission to get the – the Board 
Resolution.  Maybe I – going forward as well what I have learnt I will 
then improve the – the writing but I will still take it back to the Board if 
10 
the – I do not have the Board Resolution but I would beef up - as you 
rightfully say – that the outsider will read as if it is us as management 
who is requesting. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because ordinarily those decisions would come 
from management.  Would they not? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  If it is within the ambit of management, 
agree. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What the company needs to operationalise 
itself, what sort of expertise it needs to assist it.  That is usually 
something feed from the bottom up.  Is it not? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Both sides because the Board as well needs 
to make sure that the – whatever decisions that are taken by the Board 
especially if they fall within their delegation of authority they need to 
be comfortable.  So it would both be coming - those decisions will be 
coming from both sides. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 151 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But do they not rely on management to guide 
them? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  What do you mean? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You are saying that the Board should get 
external people to advise it on decisions that fall within its delegated 
authority.  Must it not rely on management for that purpose? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It depends if they do not feel comfortable 
that internally we have got the expertise. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  They - it is within their right to request that 
10 
external sources – resources be obtained. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do – are you aware that the Board is 
responsible for appointing the CFO and the CEO of SAA? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  The Board is responsible for appointing the 
CEO with – in consultation with the Minister.  The CEO is responsible 
for doing the recruitment process of the CFO but recommended to the 
Board. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Are you – do you take issue with the fact that if 
the SAA Board had any misgivings about the expertise within 
management of SAA they could steps to resolve that and get new 
20 
people in those positions? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Come again. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You suggested in your answer that Boards can 
go outside … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 152 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For expertise that I am suggesting to you 
should come from management and I understand your answer to be well 
if there are not those expertise in management … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  If they feel. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  They can go outside, yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  If – if they feel Chair.  If they feel that is not 
enough expertise especially on the transactions that fall within their 
delegation of authority.  If they feel there is not enough expertise it is 
within their right and it is catered on the SCM Policy for them to go and 
secure the – the work outside. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So they should not be required to beef up their 
management team for that purpose? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes they would – they are required to beef 
up their expertise but all I am saying is they are not confined.  Only the 
Board has got a right as well to feel – if they feel that there is no 
expertise for this transaction internally they do have a right to source it 
externally. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes I guess the point is if they feel – well – it 
would be a justified decision if as a matter of fact those expertise were 
lacking within SAA.  Is that not correct? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes it would be justified. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If they were available internally then the 
decision to go externally would not be justified? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It would not be justified. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 153 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  But also can I clarify that?  As we – you took 
me to the minutes of 9 December where the Board was ratifying the – 
the resolutions that were taken via round robin.  This transaction 
advisor was one of the – let alone that I repeated it – but the 
transaction advisor was one of the things that the Board – the decision 
that was taken by the Board in October. 
So it means even in October the Board felt that there are no 
expertise to run with this transaction internally. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  The only point is either they were right 
or wrong about that. 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Oh, okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Let us now move to the actual 
selection of BNP Capital as the transaction advisor if we may.  You – 
your statement does not deal in much detail with this appointment but 
both you and Ms Stimpel agreed with the supply management’s 
assessment of the bids that were received and supported the 
appointment of BNP Capital.  Did you not? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes we – I supported it Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can I understand from your evidence because 
Ms Stimpel’s 
evidence 
was 
that 
she 
relied 
solely 
on 
the 
20 
recommendation that was produced by Global Supply Management and 
did not look at the underlying tender documents.  Were you in the same 
position as her? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair I was in the same position as her 
and also there is a reason for that Chair.  I guess the one reason – the 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 154 of 266 
 
reason why I do not give much detail on the process is because I never 
sat in any of the committees.  I did not sit in BA – Bid Adjudication.  I 
did not sit in Evaluation and the Selection Criteria. 
I was made aware when I joined SAA that we as the business 
units we tell the procurement or the GSM the needs that the company – 
the needs for – for your business but you would be meddling if now you 
want the - and the details as in okay you are recommending A.  Give 
me all the documents supporting A. 
So the information that you are given and I was given as 
surety that all the – all the members that are sitting in those 
10 
committees they signed a confidentiality agreement and the committees 
are comprised of various expertise in the organisation.  So I also relied 
on the – on the information that I was given. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can we go to that recommendation document?  
It is in Ms Stimpel’s bundle which is EXHIBIT DD1 and it is the A 
Bundle of DD1 and you will find it – it is the last document in that file at 
page 4-2-7. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It is the last document? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  You go all the way to the back you will 
find 4-2-7.  You will see that is where the document commences and 
20 
then if you go to page 436 I see that as your signature confirming that 
you recommend the appointment of BNP Capital.  Is that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Where is my signature?  On page 4-3-6? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  4-3-6 you will see at the top it says 
“recommended by” there is a space for Cynthia Stimpel and then a 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 155 of 266 
 
space for Phumeza Nhantsi to sign. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Are we on DD1A? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes we are. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  4-3 – oh 4-3-6.  Oh, sorry I was on 4-3-6.1 
sorry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No not a problem. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes.  Okay, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Can you confirm that is your signature? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes it is mine Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you indicate there that the budget is going 
10 
to be catered for under your cost centre.  Is that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Agree Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And was this a document then that you 
considered in determining whether to support the recommendation that 
BNP Capital be appointed for these services? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Apologies Chair.  Can I – I just want to see 
the front of the … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is at 4-2-7. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes, yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So can I take it you would have considered this 
20 
document before you decided to support the recommendation? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let us go through it just in two respects.  I am 
interested at page 4-2-9. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 156 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So 4-2-9 tells you amongst other things – sort 
of mid of the way down – the names of the bidders who were responded 
to this bid for transaction advisor services and you will see there the 
first bullet is Nedbank and the last bullet is BNP Capital.  Do you see 
that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if you go over to page 4-3-4 you will 
see at page 4-3-4 the consolidated scores for price and BBBEE are set 
out under 11.  Do you see that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And those show the different scorings of 
Nedbank, Regiments, Nisela Capital, BPS and BNP.  Is that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So at the time that you supported the 
recommendation that BNP Capital be appointed I take it you would have 
been aware that one of the other bidders was Nedbank.  Is that right? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then just at the bottom to – to conclude on 
a point we made earlier.  The approval required here was BAC support 
and CEO approval.  Not Board approval.  I understand your evidence to 
20 
be that is because the amount was only 2.6 million.  Is that right?  
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  So Ms Nhantsi you like Ms Stimpel 
were relying on that document … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 157 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For the purposes of recommending BNP.  Is 
that right? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you were told that there were irregularities in 
the BNP bid such that it ought not to have qualified or indeed been 
selected would you then revise your previous answer at the 
commencement of today that you supported the decision to select BNP 
as the transaction advisor? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  The question is if I – if I knew at the time – if 
I was told … 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  That there are irregularities with the BNP – 
no I would not have supported it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if I told you about those irregularities now 
and we went through them and they were things like failures to provide 
a consolidate BBBEE certificate for the JV that BNP Capital was 
entering into and I told you that that was a requirement of the tender.  
Would you regard that as irregular? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if I told you that it was a requirement of 
20 
the tender that there be a JV Agreement provided in any circumstance 
where the bidder was bidding in a JV and no agreement was provided 
with the bid would you regard that as irregular? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes I would. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if I told you that there was no pricing 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 158 of 266 
 
schedule that identified what work BnP Capital would do and what work 
its JV partner would do despite that being a requirement of the bid.  I 
take it your answer would similarly be that would have been irregular to 
a point then? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Yes Chair especially if the requirement was 
saying they must have those yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Indeed but I have your evidence to be you 
were not aware of those failings in the bid submission of BnP Capital at 
the time? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   I was not aware Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:     But would you – would it have – would it not have 
fallen within your responsibilities to satisfy yourself whether there was 
– whether there were any irregularities in terms of that bidder, would 
that have been something that fell – would have fallen outside of your 
responsibilities to check those things before you say, okay I support 
this? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Yes Chair there are certain documentation 
that we are not supposed to see it stays in those committees so Chair, 
if in this submission there were irregularities that were highlighted 
20 
basically that are being brought to my attention, it is then my 
responsibility to act upon them and that is why I’m then saying, if at the 
time I was told that there were those irregularities, yes my response 
would be different from the approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes but you say there was some documents that 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 159 of 266 
 
didn’t come to you or that wouldn’t come to you? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Ns Nhantsi I’d just like to probe that a bit 
further this was going to come out of your cost centre because there 
was no other budget for it, is that right? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Would that not heighten your level or 
responsibility then to ask to see those documents? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     No not to see the confidential documents 
10 
Chair, in terms of the budgeting process at SAA there are costs that are 
budgeted on CEO cost centre, on CFO cost centre and also on 
Company Secretary cost centre.  Most of those cost centres are used 
when the Board, for example, have requested the likes of an external 
service provider and I looked into my budget, which is the CFO’s 
allocation and I had money on it, that is why I said it will be catered on 
my budget because at the beginning of the year when the budget was 
done, this decision was not yet made, so I was going to accommodate it 
on my – so it was not going to – to answer your question straight, 
Chair, the budget of 2.6million was not going to trigger me to request 
20 
the confidential documents that I’m told I’m not suppose to see. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Ms Nhantsi why would they be confidential vis 
a vis you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Chair the committees, I was told when I 
joined SAA and when I joined SAA as well I was also mindful and 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 160 of 266 
 
careful of not meddling with procurement processes.  I was told that the 
members of those committees, they sign confidentiality agreements and 
all that, so for me I would see as if I’m meddling and when they’re 
recommending this company, it’s like I’m question why others so 
basically I should have sat on one of the committees.  So I’m not sure 
whether you perhaps checking if – I should have checked all the 
submissions that were done by the bidders and how did they score 
them and how did they come to the recommendation, I relied on their 
expertise and their qualifications that they’re qualified to be in those 
committees and they’re qualified to recommend and we rely on them.   
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Ms Nhantsi, I’ve got no difficulty with the 
proposition that you were relying on this submission and you didn’t look 
at documents that underlay this submission, what I am probing is why 
you think you weren’t allowed to see those documents, that they were 
somehow confidential.  You are asked to support this recommendation, 
you do support it correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI: Yes.     
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    I understand your evidence to be you did it on 
the basis of this document alone and not the underlying documents. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Agreed. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    How could it possibly be that if you wanted to 
raise a question, I’m not sure about this or there’s a point here I want 
to follow up on, you wouldn’t be allowed to see the submissions. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I think if I would have a question, I think I 
was going to be – the Chair of that committee would give me clarity, I 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 161 of 266 
 
don’t think I’d be allowed to see the supporting documents, I’ve never 
probed it Chair.    
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So you don’t know, you don’t actually know as 
a matter of fact that you are not allowed to see those documents? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     I was told that I’m not allowed but in this 
instance I didn’t probe any question to see the underlying documents. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Who told you that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     In procurement I think it’s a general 
understanding at SAA that you don’t meddle with – to the extent that I 
was told that if you sit in those committees, one you sign the 
10 
confidentiality agreement, secondly the members of those committees 
they leave the documents.  If I’m the Chair, let’s say for argument sake 
I’m the Chair of BAC the other members of BAC, when a decision or an 
evaluation is done they leave all the documents to the Chair of BAC. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Yes but that wouldn’t – from what I 
understand of your description preclude you from looking at the 
documents yourself, to satisfy yourself before you recommend 
the…(intervention). 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     If I ask for it maybe. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you.  I’d then like to just ask you BnP 
20 
gets appointed as a habit finally on the 20 t h of April 2016, does that 
accord with your recollection? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And can you tell us, how soon thereafter you 
start engaging with BnP Capital? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 162 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Chair I would not know the exact date but 
it wold be three weeks, two weeks after they received the letter of 
award. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   And I understand from your previous evidence, 
at no point since BnP Capital was in fact appointed did you have any 
face-to-face interactions with Mr Mahlangu, correct?  
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Every piece of correspondence, well formal 
piece of correspondence from BnP Capital however came from Mr 
Mahlangu, didn’t it? 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes via email Chair.     
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Did that not concern you, did you not think 
you should engage with Mr Mahlangu directly? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Not at that time Chair, as I said certain 
things 
were 
overtaken 
by 
events 
because 
we 
appointed 
the 
transactional advisor 20 March and in 20 April FDC – the funding from 
FDC fell off the table, so we were then busy ensuring that we were 
going to get money to settle the loans that were going to mature in the 
next two months.  So in that one month, no it didn’t bother me because 
there was correspondence and also I’d like to highlight to say, I think I 
20 
had one discussion with Mr Mngadi on this, as I’m saying I saw him as 
part of the team of BnP. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    I’d like to follow that up but before then I just 
want to get the chronology right, you correct in some respect to refer to 
20 March as a relevant date to the appointment of transaction advisor 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 163 of 266 
 
but as a matter of fact, as I understand Mr Mahlangu’s evidence that 
was an incorrect date on the appointment of the transaction advisor, 
the transaction advisor was only in fact, appointed on the 20 t h of April 
and that must be so because your processes involving SMG only 
occurred later in April, do you want to have a look at it, just to satisfy 
yourself? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes please. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    If you just go back to the page we were at 427 
you’ll see the submission from Global Supply Management that you 
relied on to recommend the appointment of BnP Capital – sorry I’ll wait 
10 
for you to get there, 427, its date 15 April. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     No you’re right Chair sorry that 20 March 
was a typo and it was corrected 20 April. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Correct, I just wanted that to be clear, so it’s 
common cause that they were appointed on the 20 t h of April, you said 
that it didn’t worry you that you weren’t having engagements with Mr 
Mahlangu but you did say you had interactions with Mr Mngadi who you 
understood to be part of BnP Capital is that right? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Agreed Chair but it would be after the 
appointment of…(intervention). 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Indeed so some point after 20 April, you don’t 
meet with Mr Mahlangu but you do meet with Mr Mngadi. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And you understood Mr Mngadi to be a 
representative of BnP Capital, is that correct? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 164 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Did it concern you at all that he was employed 
at Nedbank at the time? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     I asked myself that question Chair but I 
don’t recall it asking him that question. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Because you were aware Nedbank was a 
competitor bidder, weren’t you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes I was aware because it’s on the 
submission. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Yes. 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So did you raise with him, how he could 
possibly come up in BnP Capital? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    I vividly remember asking him Chair, but I 
the reason why, I’m reluctant to say I did because I don’t remember his 
response, I think he just laughed on it but I did as, how come you are 
in Nedbank and also you are at BnP but I don’t have a firm – and I 
didn’t ask it on WhatsApp so I don’t have a proof.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Do you accept that his appearance in BnP 
Capital despite being employed at Nedbank who was a competitive 
20 
bidder would be irregular. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     I accept that Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    But you did not probe it further with him at the 
time? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     No I didn’t Chair. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 165 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Despite knowing of this conflict in him 
occupying both positions? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     I did not Chair. One of the reasons, I think 
Chair, no I didn’t I remember I asked him but I think the decent thing 
that I should have done perhaps was to ask the Chairperson of the 
Board, because he was (indistinct) but I did not Chair probe it further. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But I might have missed something, did you say you 
did ask him, how come you are in both places? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes but I think he just laughed it off, he 
didn’t give me a concrete answer. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes but when you asked him, it must have been 
because you found it strange isn’t it? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Yes because he was – I found it strange, I 
asked – I found it strange Chair because I think there was one meeting 
that we had with the banks where…(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:    He was there. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     He was there with Nedbank. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And now he was also involved with BnP? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     You say that you think you – maybe you should 
20 
have asked the Chairperson about this, is that what you just said? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes I think Chair if I had the time, and it’s 
not an excuse, because we had loans maturing, certain things I 
wouldn’t have followed them through because the decent thing to do, I 
think would have been to follow-up with the Chairperson and get a 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 166 of 266 
 
proper answer that why is he involved in Nedbank and also in BnP. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Or maybe even – not even with the Chairperson, 
maybe you should have insisted on a clear answer from him. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes I agree…(intervention) 
CHAIRPERSON:    To say, I asked you a question how can you be in 
both, at Nedbank and BnP, so - because this was something that was 
raising some conflict of interest. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair, I agree and I should have 
probed it further yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Why would you have gone to the Chair about 
it?  
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Because he’s the one who introduced me – 
she is the one who introduced me and gave the numbers of Mr Mngadi. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And as I have your evidence you were also 
aware of him engaging with her in the background and then coming to 
you with feedback about what she had or had not said to him, is that 
correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Come again Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    I understand later in your statement, 
20 
particularly when you deal with the WhatsApp communications you were 
aware that Mr Mngadi was dealing with the Chairperson, they were 
having conversations about what was happening and then he was 
feeding back to you some of the input from those conversations, is that 
right? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 167 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So he was fairly termed the Chairperson’s 
person, is that right? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    But you were concerned about this conflict 
you asked him but you did not take that further? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     I did not take it further Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Did you not think it was a reason to sound an 
alarm and say we cannot continue with the engagement with BnP 
Capital because they’re represented by a person who’s in a conflicted 
10 
position? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     At that point no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    We have had a few occasions in your evidence 
where you are able to admit that you should have raised an issue and 
maybe followed it up – raised an issue but you didn’t do so in 
circumstances where you should have, one, we had the meeting of the 
Board where you should have raised certain issues before the decision 
was taken, yet you didn’t, I don’t know if there is another one but this 
is another one where there’s a conflict involving Mr Mngadi, you do see 
the conflict, you do raise the issue with him but you allow him to not 
20 
really come out clearly and give you a clear answer and you don’t take 
it up with anybody.  Why do you think you had these situations where 
you should have really raised issues and taken them up but didn’t why- 
what is – what do you think was responsible for this on your part? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    On the – thanks Chair, on the first one, as 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 168 of 266 
 
I’ve said I should have brought it up to the Board, one I was new in the 
company and I knew that I would follow the processes as we have 
discussed that Chair.  On this one, to be honest I asked it and I didn’t – 
I would be honest Chair I didn’t take it too serious to follow-up on the 
conflict of interest and I don’t think I have a real reason, I think at the 
back of my mind I just told myself that this is Dudu’s person and I 
moved on.  So on this one I don’t have a real reason Chair but most 
importantly, as much as I don’t have the real reason here Chair, the 
fact that Mr Mngadi was involved in this transaction, it made me to look 
at it with the hawk eye hence at the end I’m the one who pushed 
10 
despite all the pressures that I was getting from the Chairperson that 
this transaction must be cancelled yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m not sure whether to ask you this question, but 
I’m going to ask you so that you know what’s going on in my mind. Is it 
possible that maybe – I think from what we have said when you started 
at SAA in 2015 you had been a chartered accountant for about 7/8 
hears or there about. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Is it possible that maybe this was a situation that 
needed somebody maybe to be much more experienced to deal with 
20 
some of these challenges.  I said I’m not sure whether to ask it, I’m just 
being honest with you, it may be that - I’m just wondering whether, 
faced with all of these challenges you found it easy to take up issues 
that you may have believed should be – or you believe should be taken 
up? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 169 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Also Chair, I’m not sure if I’m going to give 
you the right answer but let me attempt…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes it’s good if we are both not sure. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Chair looking – especially after this 
transaction and looking at the challenges that I faced where sometimes 
I felt I’m swimming against the tide, where I feel – for example, let me 
give a practical example, towards the end of the transaction where it 
was clear that BnP for example misled us as SAA where they didn’t tell 
us that there FSB license was suspended and yet they knew that it was 
a critical criteria and when I raised that with the Chair of the Board 
10 
together with acting CEO raising those and she would insist that let’s 
continue with them, they’re going to  - let’s not cancel they’re going to 
sue us and all that, perhaps maybe now, looking back, maybe juggling 
with the politics and juggling with the procurement processes and the 
policies and running the day-to-day operations Chair, without meddling 
with who’s (African language) and all that, I think it’s an easy job to do, 
I can still do it today. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Provide the translation for (African language). 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     The translation is whose person is this, so 
I felt my plate was full whilst I’m juggling with loans that are maturing, 
20 
I’m juggling with the procurement processes and all that but there are 
also underlying politics where there’s certain pressures that are 
coming.  I would then say my plate was too full, I don’t want to say 
Chair -  I don’t want to say I was not the right person to do the job, but 
I think the politics that came about were…(intervention). 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 170 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Were too much. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     One, perhaps I would say at the end 
looking now after this transaction maybe I would say I was too naïve to 
think that all the Board members of the Board members of the 
institutions always act in the best interest of the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Mr Nhantsi, I’d like to move to the decision to 
extend the scope of the transaction advisor to source funds, if we may 
and I pick this up at page 8 of your statement, paragraph 24. In 
paragraph 24… 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair, I’m there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    At paragraph 24 as I have it you talk about 
the tele conference at which the unavailability of FDC to fund the 
15billion is discussed and you record there that the Chairperson, during 
the tele conference that we had organised to give the Board an update 
on the FDC, instructed and recommended that we approach the same 
service provider that was appointed as a transaction advisor to source 
the funding for SAA and then – that is when I made the error at the 
beginning we get that Board resolution, if we can just go to it you’ll find 
it in Ms Stimpel’s bundle, so that’s DD1B, it’s the first document there, 
20 
It’s page 441. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    You’ll see that is a Board resolution as of 21 
April to approve the extension of scope of a transaction advisor to 
include sourcing of funding for 15billion for South African Airways, do 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 171 of 266 
 
you see that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    You make the point in your statement that 
there’s no debate about who this transaction advisor is at the time it 
was BnP Capital wasn’t it? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So when the Board passed this resolution on 
the 21 s t of April they are approving the extension of scope of BnP 
Capital to source funds for 15billion for South African Airways, is that 
right? 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So a transaction advisor was actually not correct it 
was the – it was a particular transactional advisor they were talking 
about, BnP in other words. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Now at this point, did you raise your concerns 
about Mr Mngadi’s conflict because at this point BnP Capital stands to 
earn 2.6 million from SAA but if their scope is extended to source funds 
for South African Airways, there’s a possibility that, that increases in 
20 
magnitude, hugely.  Did you raise the concern about his conflict and his 
continued involvement in BnP? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     I did not Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Do you regret that now? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     I do, deeply. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 172 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Because they stood to benefit in the order of 
– we’ll come to the figures 325million if all had gone according to plan. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Having what I’ve heard with the testimony 
especially of Mr van der Merwe, I do regret it Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Well let’s see what happens after the 21 s t of 
April because that decision is taken, but you again, then follow it with a 
recommendation for the same decision that was taken. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Yes and you’ll have the sense of the question 
there, whether that isn’t the incorrect order in which these events 
10 
should take place, do you accept that it is? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     It is in the order, my understanding Chair 
because the Board resolution is approving that we extend the scope of 
transactional advisor but internally we had to do – we had to follow the 
procurement process. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    But you did go back to the Board for the 
decision that they’d taken didn’t you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And insofar as extension of scope is 
concerned, I would just like to pause on that, the only reason BnP 
20 
Capital was a service provider to SAA at this point was because of the 
transaction advisor services it had been procured – contracted to 
perform, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    It was a critical criteria of that bid that they 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 173 of 266 
 
have a FSP license, wasn’t it? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So I want to suggest to you that the extension 
would only have been lawful if they maintained that requirement, do you 
accept that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Agreed Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:     This extension of the scope did it mean that they 
were the ones who were now were required to seek and find the 
15billion rand? 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Yes Chair, if you allow me just briefly on the 
process that we just discussing with Ms Hofmeyr, the Board, on the 21 s t 
of April we gave them an update that FDC can no longer provide the 
funding to SAA and with a concern and the concern of the loans 
maturing, the Board then approved that we extend the scope to the 
already approved transactional advisor to go source the funds but we 
didn’t immediately do that Chair, we followed the process.  Again I 
engaged with the procurement team to understand if – how can we 
implement the Board resolution but also to be in line with the 
procurement process.  There are clauses on the supply chain Chair, 
20 
one is the emergency, the second one is the confined bidding.  When 
we engaged those two, this transaction to be particular because even 
on Ms Stimpel’s submission on the 27 t h of November, she highlighted 
how urgent the funds are and should the company not…(intervention).      
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes let me interrupt you, she probably will take you 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 174 of 266 
 
there, the reason why I asked for clarification in regard to whether this 
resolution of the Board meant that BnP should find the funds as well, 
was that the being transactional advisors I would have thought that the 
roles should not be combined in one entity namely of looking for funds, 
getting the funding providing the funds and advising on that 
transaction, do I misunderstand something? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    No Chair there’s nothing that prohibits them 
from providing the funding and also advising on which loans to be paid, 
there’s nothing that excludes them to do that, there’s no conflict in that. 
CHAIRPERSON:     But if they’ve got the funds, aren’t they going to 
10 
want you to take the funds that they’ve got and not somebody else’s 
funds? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  In this case Chair this is exactly what 
happened especially with the emergency and the confined bidding.  We 
did not go out on an open tender because of urgency of the funds.  So 
the board resolution we requested them to go get the funds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But ordinarily would it not be seen as undesirable in 
terms of maybe governance to say if you are going to advise on a 
transaction of obtaining funds you should be different from the person 
who must look for the funds because you have in an interest in your 
20 
client obtaining the funds that you have got and you might not be 
objective in advising. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No Chair ordinarily if we went out on an open 
tender they would be eligible to apply as well if they have capacity to 
source – to give SAA the funding.  The roles are different. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 175 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi can I just understand.  At this point 
in time had BNP delivered at all on its transaction advisor services 
mandate? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No, no Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So why were you comfortable with them now 
being charged with more work from SAA including sourcing of funds? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Firstly what I did after the board resolution I 
engaged with them requesting and checking if they have capacity to 
source the funds. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And who were those engagements with? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  They were – I wrote an email to Daniel 
Mahlangu. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you never spoke to him?  Did you engage 
with Mr Mngade about this? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I think I did Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we could go back to the 21 s t April because 
that is the board resolution. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  What is interesting from the evidence of 
20 
Mr Van Der Merwe is that on the 22 April so just the day later BNP 
Capital start engaging with him about sourcing funds that is when 
Grissag appears again in this funding endeavour of SAA.  Did you 
inform BNP of the decision taken on the 21 April? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No not immediately.  We first followed the 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 176 of 266 
 
procurement process to check with BAC and all that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I did not immediately inform [indistinct]. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because you went through a whole process. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As I have it that eventually takes you to the 24 
May when the board again approves. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That which they previously approved that 
happened on the 24 May and as I have the evidence on the 25 May a 
10 
letter congratulating BNP on being selected to source the funds goes to 
BNP, does that accord with your recollection? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes, yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So if you did not tell BNP on the 22 n d or the 
21 s t April that they had already been appointed to source funds who do 
you think might have done that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chairperson of the board might have done 
that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you know it for a fact or do you speculate? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I speculate because Mr Mngade is his 
20 
person. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would then like to just move to the question of 
the emergency procurement. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You deal with this Ms Nhantsi at page 10 of 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 177 of 266 
 
your statement and you in particular from paragraph 31 that is where 
you talk about the provisions of the SCM Policy that allowed an 
emergency procurement in exceptional circumstances. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will be aware I take it that that particular 
clause of the SCM Policy has a proviso because it says that bad 
planning will not be a justification for emergency procurement, are you 
aware of that provision? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I am aware of it Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And I then would like to just return to some of 
10 
the evidence we traversed earlier. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Would you accept that the urgency that is 
created by April if there was indeed urgency 2016 is a product of not 
having determined early on in January that FDC was a no go? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Come again 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay in January 2016. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It could have been determined that FDC had no 
legal capacity to enter into this transaction, could it not? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No due diligence was still going to be part of 
the process that the company was embarking on. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes but National Treasury had told you on the 6 
January that FDC did not have the mandate, right? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I never received any formal communication 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 178 of 266 
 
from National Treasury telling me… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No but you had a meeting with Ms Stimpel that 
you have confirmed already in your evidence in which that was 
conveyed to you that National Treasury’s view was that it was beyond 
the mandate of FDC to fund this? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Agree except that the formal communication 
between National Treasury and SAA is via the chairperson of the board.  
The National Treasury will write to SAA so one of the reasons why 
perhaps we engaged and we did not stop at that time National Treasury 
never wrote to us and informed us that FDC does not have a mandate. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you never followed up in SAA to get a legal 
view on that – a formal legal view, did you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes I did not get a formal legal view but I got 
a view. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you had determined in January that FDC did 
not have the mandate then you would not have been in the urgent 
situation you were in April would you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes I would not be. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think you agreed with me there is that right? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  About what I am not… 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I just – there might – I might – there might 
have been a negative in my question so I just want to be clear.   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If you had established in January that FDC did 
not have the mandate to fund this transaction you would not have had 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 179 of 266 
 
to get to April to urgently procure sourcing of funds, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes except that I agree except that we were 
following the processes to ensure that  
1.  We implement a board resolution and 
2. National Treasury if they felt strongly about it they could have 
written to SAA to say FDC does not have a mandate.  So I 
engaged with FDC and at that point in time I still believed that 
FDC had a mandate. So… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So FDC did not tell you about their meeting 
with National Treasury in December of 2015 where they were told they 
10 
did not have the mandate? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No I am not aware of the meeting. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay.  You did not take steps though in January 
to clarify the legal position, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I got the discussion of – with the legal 
person. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay but by April it is urgent because you have 
lost out on three months where you could have gone to the market for 
sourcing funds, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair perhaps if you can go back as well to 
20 
the – and check how much time did SAA take during the time then they 
recommended Seacrest because it is not three months Chair I think it is 
longer than that.  So the procurement process even if we went to the 
market is not three months. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Sorry my three months is January to April 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 180 of 266 
 
because I am saying you could have done something in April to realise 
that FDC was not available and then you could have used those three 
months up to April to go to the market and see if there was another 
provider for a sourcer of funds? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes I agree… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You accept that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I agree with you and I am also saying I am 
not sure if three or four months is enough to start the tender process 
from the beginning up until the end. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well… 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Hence my reference is Seacrest. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let me help you with that.  The previous tender 
process. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Where Seacrest was recommended took a 
week. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No, no, no the advert – the advert and 
everything a week? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Oh. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It opened – we can go to the document but we 
went through it with Ms Stimpel it was one of the concerns she had at 
the time. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Hm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I think it was very short let me just get it for 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 181 of 266 
 
you.   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  That cannot be. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies I just have to move in these 
documents.  No apologies it was two weeks I stand corrected on a 
week.  The week actually related to the transaction advisor.  If you go 
to DD1[a]. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will find it at page 220.   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You have that.  So you will see that when the 
10 
request for long term funding went to the banks as well as all of those 
entities that the board members had required beyond the list – I can 
see you doing the calculation I also was too adventurous on two weeks 
I think the start date was 23 September and the closing date was 13 
October so that would be in the order of three weeks, are you happy 
with that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair I am… 
CHAIRPERSON:  She will get the number of weeks much better than 
you and I could get she is a chartered accountant. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No Chair I am counting in fact the date that it 
went to the bidders on 22 September and the submission recommending 
to the board was on the 27 November.  I think… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh I see. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I am not talking about … 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 182 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The period in which you could [indistinct] 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It was advertised. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I understand. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right so there we have – let us take it then 
your fuller period. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You have it is – the opening is 23 September. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then you will recall the culmination of it is 
10 
a representation to the board on the 27 November/ 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So that is two months give or take a few days. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  That is two months yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you could have done it between January and 
April? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair except that on this because we 
fully thought that we were going to get money from FDC I would not 
really take responsibility and say we were negligent on this.  We 
thought strongly that FDC was – would give us the funding and also 
20 
being quoted the section that they are – that makes them to do – to act 
as an agent on the FDC Act I believed that we were going to get the 
money. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi but you did not go and get that 
legal due diligence that the member of your legal department said was 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 183 of 266 
 
required on the 11 December 2015 did you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Legal department was doing its own work 
and I am not sure how far they were on the process.  This one I 
contacted – after the – my meeting with Ms Stimpel I contacted the 
CFO to ask if indeed what section allows them to be able to give SAA 
the funding of 15 billion hence I said I ask the permission from the 
Chair to say using layman’s language he told me that they are allowed 
to think outside the box and bring monies to the Free State Province. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But Ms Nhantsi in terms of proper process you 
would have needed your legal department’s formal view on this to sign 
10 
off on the legal capacity of FDC would you not? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes.  Chair they were still busy with their 
procurement.  Ursula Fikelepi was still busy with the due diligence. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So did you follow up regularly with her to 
establish what the legal status was of FDC? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No I did not follow up regularly. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you going to go back to them about the issue of 
due diligence if the information that came through was not that FDC 
was not an option? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair definitely I was going to go back to 
them.  Chair one thing for sure we were not going to sign an agreement 
with FDC without passing the due diligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi you signed the recommendation to 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 184 of 266 
 
extend the scope of BNP to source funds, is that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Which page is that? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What I am going to ask you to go to is actually 
in Ms Stimpel’s bundle because there is one in yours but I think it is 
actually not the signed one. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So let us go to bundle B of DD1 and it is page 
450.   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Is that your signature on that page? 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes it is Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Now Ms Nhantsi as I have it you 
actually raised the query about why you needed to sign in a situation 
where there was already a board decision.  Can we go to that in your 
statement it is at page 11 paragraph 33?   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As I have it at paragraph 33 you say there:  
“GSM Global Supply Management through Advocate Lester gave me a 
confinement for that is the one we were just looking at. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Before submitting to the BAC and when I asked 
why I should be the one to sign he stated that because the board had 
already approved then the CFO should sign and it was going to be a 
see just for noting since BAC was below the board in terms of DOA and 
then you say the BAC indeed noted the submission and referred it back 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 185 of 266 
 
to the board.  Do you see that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So is it the fact that the BAC was just noting 
what the board had already decided that you did not have any 
misgivings about it? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  What do you mean by misgivings? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well otherwise I suspect it is part of the reason 
why you were saying to him why must I sign it if the board has already 
taken the decision, right?   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Not really I was more asking why is this form 
10 
not signed by GSM why me? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay and his explanation was it is just going to 
go to BAC for noting so that is not an issue, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sorry.  Did you understand that answer that 
he gave you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did it makes sense to in terms of your query? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Not really Chair more than anything I was 
20 
asking why am I signing because it is just a page of a check list. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  So I was asking why are they making me sign 
this and then I was told that I can sign it because the board has 
already taken a decision to confine. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 186 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but I am trying to check whether that answer 
whether you were able to make sense of that answer in terms of the 
question you had put to him? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Not really Chair but I moved on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But then you signed? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because… 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I signed more because I was confirming that 
it is for business reasons why you confining… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm because I – when I look at the capacities 
10 
underneath there where you signed your position does not appear to be 
there, is it not or is it?  In other words it is a document as I understand 
it at page 450 if that is where we are? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I am there Chair I am there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I am the GM.  I am the General Manager. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you are the General Manager? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay then I understand.  So that General is meant 
General Manager Regional is meant Regional Manager. 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Country Managers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Country there is also Country Managers? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Country Manager yes.  Regional Manager 
and Station Manager. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  So your query had nothing to do with the 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 187 of 266 
 
capacity in which you were signing it was simply on the need? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For anybody to sign? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi I am not going to take us there we 
have been through it already but one of the difficulties I have with this 
process again is that despite the board decision on the 21 s t that is 
followed by motivation that they take the decision that they have 
previously taken.  That is a motivation that came on the 11 May.  Then 
10 
there is your signing of the confinement that takes place similarly on 
the 11 May.  And then it goes to BAC. There is one point I want to pick 
up with you on that though.  You say it was only going to the BAC for 
noting, is that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But if we go to that actual bid adjudication 
committee decision record you will see that they did not note they 
recommended the decision be taken that had already been taken.  I will 
take you there it is in DD1 which is Ms Stimpel’s bundle B at 453. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  453? 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Sorry it is in B you will need to be in the 
next file.  Apologies.   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes I am there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will see that that is the bid adjudication 
committee decision record of the 13 May to request for BAC support to 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 188 of 266 
 
confine and award the contract for sourcing funds for SAA Group to 
BNP Capital and then you will see down the page that it is not recorded 
as noted it is recorded as recommended, do you see that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In the tick.  So again we have after the fact 
entities within SAA confirming that the processes of going up to the 
board for approval are followed albeit that the board has already made 
this decision on the 21 April, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair to follow the processes to be 
aligned. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes but after the fact Mr Nhantsi. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Agreed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you accept that doing it after the fact is 
problematic? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair it is yes and no in this way.  If a 
decision is taken by the board and we do have the responsibility to 
guide the board on the operational matters.  Not just to take the board 
resolutions and implement them as they are hence we are – we are 
there every day.  So one as much as I agree and I accept that it is a 
board – it is within the board’s ambit it does not exclude that every – 
20 
all the transactions there is nowhere in the SCM where it says this is a 
board transaction because it is above 50 million therefore you will not 
follow the process.  So what we are doing here on all these instances 
because 
1.  It was the first time that funding followed the procurement 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 189 of 266 
 
process at SAA. 
2. We needed to ensure that it is in line with the procurement 
processes.  So the board yes would take a decision but we need 
to run it through the processes and make sure that it is aligned 
because at the end as the operation mangers we need to be 
accountable.  We need to say processes were followed and they 
were in line with the SCM Policy. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi just a correction.  It was not the 
first time that it had followed procurement processes for funding recall 
in 2015 there was an entire RFP process for funding the product of 
10 
which was the Seacrest recommendation so this was the second time, 
correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I agree except that as well you look at how it 
started. It started the board taking a decision and recommendation and 
a board resolution to say go and cancel and start the process and 
follow the procurement process. So the board took that decision and 
then the management then went to do the process. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No but Ms Nhantsi the decision that was taken 
by the board in about August or September 2015 was to go out on RFP 
and then that whole process was followed.  The process was followed, 
20 
they got the guidance that you speak of and then it was presented to 
them in December what they should do, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I am not following you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The board made a decision in August of 2015 
that they wanted to go out on RFP for this funding. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 190 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because prior to that point it had been done 
purely in a liaison with the banks correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Pursuant to that decision an RFP was 
designed, it had to be evaluated by the board. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The board then confirmed its terms.  It then 
went out to the market.  Then bids were received.  A whole evaluation 
process was followed.  A recommendation was made by the Group 
10 
Treasurer on the 27 November and that served before the board on the 
3 December, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Agree which is the same process that I am 
trying to explain. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes but your evidence was that when you did it 
it was the first time? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Oh sorry apologies.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right let us go back to the guidance of the 
board because I absolutely accept that boards need to be guided by 
management and I understand that that is your justification for 
20 
following this process after 21 April 2016’s decision, is that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But how do you guide the board if you do your 
processes after they have made the decision? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No Chair the decision number 1 the decision 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 191 of 266 
 
lies with the board. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But without any guidance.  On the 21 April 
when that decision was taken by the board of SAA they had received 
absolutely no guidance from management on that question, had they? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Two things that through you Chair.  Two 
things that could have happened Chair.  On the 20 April when we 
received the news that FDC could no longer give the funding as 
management through my guidance and acting CEO we could have just 
kept quiet and not update the board and follow the process and see if it 
is practical to confine or to go out on a tender and update them at a 
10 
later stage when we are done with that process.  Or we could 
immediately arrange a telecom because this is the transaction that is in 
their per view could immediately engage them and say the new –news 
on this we are back on square one.  We no longer have the funding. 
This is the situation right now.  So either we could have on the 20 April 
not update the board and navigate and explore what is the possibility to 
get the funding or we could have – we could have done what we have 
done.  Because what we have done in discussion and in agreement with 
the acting CEO was let us engage company secretary.  Let us have a 
telecom with them and get – and update them on this. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi do not take issue with the updating 
of the board on the 20 April whenever it is.  The difficulty from a 
procurement process point of view is that they decided on the 21 April 
to appoint BNP to source the funds before you had done analysis of 
whether the confinement could be justified, what the SCM Policy 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 192 of 266 
 
provided, what the rate would be with BNP Capital, whether those terms 
were adequate to protect the financial position of SAA, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes on the 21 s t we have not navigated all 
those options. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would then like to move to the 
FSP licence.  Chair I note we just before four I do not know if it is 
appropriate to take a short adjournment? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I am not sure whether you may have lost in 
the process a point that you wanted to make. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I might be thinking I know what the point was but 
I may be mistaken. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It is entirely possible Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe I will ask you a question that I wanted to 
ask.  I still have some concern about why it was thought necessary to 
ask the board to make a decision that it had already made?  Because 
we have a few of these of instances.  I can understand if you are not 
aware that the board has already made the decision that if you dealing 
with a matter and you think a board decision is necessary that you 
approach the board which you may have said was the case with regard 
20 
to when in January you approached the board.  But I am not sure 
whether each time there has been an instance out of the instances that 
Ms Hofmeyr has dealt with in her questions. Each time there has been 
an instance where you asking the board for a decision where it has 
already made a decision whether it was because you were unaware that 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 193 of 266 
 
it had made a decision? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair it might be – this reason might – two 
reasons.  The first one would be perhaps when the company secretary 
is capturing from the minutes the resolutions is not taking all the 
resolutions because when you go to the business and give update after 
the meeting that the board has resolved ABCD they want a board 
resolution.  So if it is – if there is no board resolution we then forced to 
do the submission and give it back to the board so that we can have the 
board resolutions.  So that is why I am saying it two things.  Either as a 
company we are fixated that we can do things by seeing the Round 
10 
Robin – the board resolution itself or perhaps there is an improvement 
that is needed on the capturing of the resolutions extracting them from 
the minutes or from the discussions that happened in the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you saying that sometimes you could have a 
situation where you do know that the board did make a decision 
because you have got the minutes but you do not have a document 
separate document saying this is a resolution of the board and 
therefore on some of the occasions it may be that you asked the board 
for a resolution not because you are unaware that they have made the 
decision but that you particularly want a separate document marked 
20 
Resolution or something like that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Not because Chair I want a particular – one I 
would be aware that a discussion was held in the board.  But now when 
I am giving the discussion or the decision to the business feeding it 
back to the business for us to implement - they want a board resolution 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 194 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no.  I accept that you could have a situation 
where in a meeting the board discusses an issue. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But does not make a decision.  I am not dealing with 
that situation.  I am dealing with a situation where a – the board has 
discussed an issue and has made a decision and when you read the 
minutes it is clear that it made a decision whether in that situation were 
you aware of that you would still approach the board afterwards and 
ask for a resolution or a decision on the matter? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair an example is the transactional 
10 
advisor Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It was discussed in the – and resolved that 
we need to appoint a transactional advisor on the 3 December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ys. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  But it was not on the resolutions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  So I needed a resolution hence the 
resubmission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  So more I am saying Chair certain decisions 
would be taken in the – in the board meeting through discussions and 
there might not have been a submission from the business units and all 
that.   So a discussion would be initiated by the board and a decision 
would be taken by the board. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 195 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  But it will not transpire when you look at the 
resolutions it is not there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so if you needed a decision of the board to be 
under the resolutions. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the minutes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it was – it is clear from the minutes as part of – it is 
one of the resolutions of the board then it is fine. 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  We will not go back.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would be content with that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would not go back to the board? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair because one of the – when you do 
the audit 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  One of the things when you start saying the 
board has resolved, has approved that you must do ABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  You must have the board resolution. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so where you would go back to the board is 
where either the minutes reflect that there was a discussion but on an 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 196 of 266 
 
issue but there is no resolution or there was a discussion and a 
decision but that decision does not fall – is not reflected as part of the 
resolutions. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then in that case too you would feel the need. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I will go back yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To approach the board for a resolution. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the latter case where it was clear is the decision 
that was taken you would not need to just go to the company secretary 
10 
to prepare a resolution because that is clear – it is clear the board took 
a decision. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Latter case be… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would need to go back. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Latter case being the which one Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I am just talking in general. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Mostly company secretary would not – we 
have tried that but they very strict. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  They want to go to get the approval of the board. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi just to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe we should take it at quarter past? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 197 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that fine unless – we will take the break at quarter 
past. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi so if a decision just to follow up 
lastly on the Chair’s questions. If a decision had been taken at the 
board and you did not have a resolution yet you would just need to go 
and get that piece of paper recording the resolution, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You would not have to go through a whole 
process. 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of making submissions. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  For the decision that has already been taken. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would like to now move to the 
FSP licence issue.   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because this is something that comes up in 
relation to BNP’s appointment on an extended scope to source funds. 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You deal with this at page 15 of your statement 
if we can go there.  Ms Nhantsi and it is really around paragraphs 50 
and 51 on page 15 as I read your statement.   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 198 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You deal with this question about their failure 
to have updated SAA about the fact that their FSB licence had been 
suspended, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Now Ms Nhantsi I just want to clarify when you 
were notified that their FSP licence had been suspended?  Because as 
I read these two paragraphs you do not actually give a date to it but 
you do locate it in time insofar as there was a letter from Webber 
Wentzel, you see that in paragraph 51 you say: 
“Indeed a letter from Webber Wentzel acting on 
10 
behalf of OUTA was sent to our acting CEO 
demanding that the contract not be concluded with 
BNP Capital and any intention to pay them any 
money should be put to a stop.” 
You say: 
“During this time we were not planning to pay 
anything to BNP Capital.  After hearing of this I 
called FSB myself and asked if BNP Capital was in 
good standing that is when I received a letter that 
shows BNP Capital was suspended in April already 
20 
but they failed to disclose this information.” 
Do you see that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So if I told you the Webber Wentzel letter was 
dated the 7 July and I told you that that letter was dated the 8 July I 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 199 of 266 
 
can take you to both of those would it be consistent with your evidence 
that that is the first time at which you were alerted to the suspension of 
the licence? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay that is fairly important because Mr 
Mahlangu’s evidence will be that he notified you as early as the 13 May 
about that fact.  Okay? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair.  Allow me – there is a letter when 
we received that letter to Mr Mahlangu that refers and say they told us 
on the 11 – on the 13 May I responded and said they must tell us who 
10 
they sent the correspondence to because we never received it.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Oh let us look at that then please. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes please. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because that is something I was unaware of.  If 
you go… 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  So it would be my correspondence after their 
letter. Firstly I would like to confirm yes it was between the 7 t h and the 
8 t h July and it was the first time that we knew about their FSB licence 
being suspended. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  They then with – we then wrote to them they 
responded and they said exactly what you saying but I am trying to 
navigate to your… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right let me take you there.  I think it is 
important that we maybe start with the 13 May letter. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 200 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because that is the one that Mr Mahlangu said 
was when he gave you the original notification. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will find that in Mr Mahlangu’s bundle and 
that is DD4 and you will find it at page 143 of that bundle.  It is right 
towards the end under Tab 21. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay.  Yes I am there. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay so unhelpfully often BNP Capital’s letters 
are not themselves dated so you always have to search around to see 
10 
the covering email.  We have not been provided with that by Mr 
Mahlangu we will ask him about it in the course of his evidence.  But 
this is the letter that he says was sent on the 13 May.  Is this one you 
recall later being shown or can you recall having received it on the 13 
May? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair just one second. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of course take your time.  Can I ask you in 
particular to look at the last paragraph because what this letter is doing 
it is telling you about well an intention to suspend which I will deal with 
questioning of Mr Mahlangu on because the FSB at that stage had not 
20 
indicated an intention to suspend the licence it had in fact suspended 
the licence.  But if you look at the last paragraph what BNP is saying is 
they have got another partner Creed Capital Partners who can take 
over their responsibilities.  Do you remember getting this notification of 
the 13 May? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 201 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I do Chair but I am trying to locate where 
they are saying because I also remember that they said they informed 
us in May but I am trying to locate it in this specific letter. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  No it will not be in this letter. This is the letter 
that constitutes informing you in May.  Okay let us take Mr Mahlangu at 
his word that this was sent to you on the 13 May right?  You will see it 
is the day after the date referred to in the second line because in the 
second line they say: 
“I would like to clarify the issue of the FSB licence.” 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   
“BNP Capital received a letter from the FSB dated 12 
May 2015.” 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   
“Indicating its intention to temporary suspend BNP’s 
licence for a period of three months based on the 
reason that according to Phase Act Section 10 the 
key individual has failed to successfully complete the 
first level regulatory examinations.” 
20 
It goes on and in the last paragraph it says; 
“The conditions of suspension required at BNP work 
with another authorised financial service provider 
until it has fulfilled all its suspension conditions. 
Accordingly we have engaged Creed Capital Partners 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 202 of 266 
 
of which its licence is being attached.” 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You see that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes.  Chair the reason why I was asking the 
date of this letter when we respond – when we wrote a letter in July. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  To BNP we asked them in that letter to say 
we never received because their letter was saying we informed you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  On the 12 May and in our response we said 
10 
we never received it can you specify and can you please give it to us 
and they never responded on that. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  So it should be on my bundle. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I have not seen it in your bundle. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it will be useful if we can source this at 
some point. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe we should take the tea – the break now 
20 
so that could help also. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With locating any document that is necessary. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – shall we take ten minutes? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 203 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It is ten past four we will resume at twenty 
past four.  We adjourn. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Thank you. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes may proceed. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Chair just to update you.  We 
– we unfortunately were not able to source the document over the break 
but Ms Nhantsi indicates she may well have a copy of it at home and 
10 
she will provide it to us … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Over the course of the evening … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Or thereafter but I understand from Ms Nhantsi 
she will just give us the evidence as she recalls it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And we can follow that up with the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi the key question is did you receive 
20 
on 13 May in SAA the letter that appears as 1-4-3 in Mr Mahlangu’s 
bundle? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Thank you Chair.  No, we never received it 
Chair to the extent that on the letter that I will – I will circulate to the – 
to the investigating team later on – on the later dated 13 July chair we 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 204 of 266 
 
even – there is a paragraph that says: 
“Please note that the letter that you are talking 
about is saying you informed us on 12 May.  We 
never received it.  Can you confirm who did you 
send it to and can you provide us with a copy of 
that?” 
So we never received the correspondence from them.  This was 13 July 
Chair and we then gave them seven days to respond.  First immediately 
when we received the letter for – in fact before – on the 6 t h Ms Hofmeyr 
has that email. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes let us go there. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Just to aid your evidence. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  If we go in Ms Stimpel’s bundle - this is DD1B – 
and you turn up there page 5-7-3 which is under Tab 62. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  (Coughing) sorry Chair.  5-7-3? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Three, correct. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes I am there Chair.  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi that is a letter but the email that 
20 
you are referring to you will just see over the page at 5-7-5. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So this an email from Mr Ivan Moyo which I 
understand – who I understand to be a representative of BNP Capital.  
Is that your understanding? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 205 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  That is my understanding Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it is sent to Ms Ursula Fikelepi and 
yourself.  Correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Copied to Mr Mahlangu.  Do you see that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And on this 6 July what is being communicated 
to SAA in this email? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  They are communicating that as BNP they 
are in good standing.  They still have – can I read it Chair? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  “Dear Ursula, we can confirm that 
the funding entity has an FSB Licence and is 
authorised under South African law to provide this 
financial product.  See attached FSB Licence.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if you go over the page to 5-7-6. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes.  They then attach the – the FSB Licence 
of BNP and it is certified as well as – as a true copy.  The date of the 
certification is 23 June 2016. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So can I just have it.  As at this date … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am looking for the certificate. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right at the bottom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Right at the bottom. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 206 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Got it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, certified by a Commissioner of Oaths.  Is that 
right? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes as a true copy of the original. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As a true copy of the original.  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Let me just be clear on the evidence.  On 
6 July you receive communication from BNP Capital in which they say 
they have a FSB Licence and the licence that is attached is the one we 
10 
have just looked at.  So there is no suggestion in that correspondence 
that anything has been suspended.  Correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes.  In fact Chair – allow me on page 5-7-4. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  The email from Ursula Fikelepi to myself.  It 
is saying: 
“Dear Phumeza, please confirm that the lender has 
FSB Licence and is authorised under South African 
law to provide this financial product.  Please also 
send us a copy of such licence as well as 
20 
confirmation from the FSB and other applicable 
regulators of the latter’s good standing.” 
So this is their response to this question that has been asked 
by Ms Fikelepi and they are confirming on the email of Irvin Moyo they 
are confirming and they attaching the FSB Licence and they are 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 207 of 266 
 
confirming a good standing. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then – so that is 6 July.  Then as I have 
the chronology on 7 July you get the OUTA or the Webber Wentzel 
letter … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then if you go back to 5-7-3 you have a 
letter that is dated 8 July that is at 5-7-3. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – I am sorry.  Before we get there when you were 
dealing Ms Nhantsi with the letter at five – page 5-7-4 – the email from 
10 
– did you say it is Ursula? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It is Ursula Fikelepi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, Ursula Fikelepi.  She says to you – she is 
asking you to send them a copy of the licence … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And says: 
“…as well as confirmation from the FSB and other 
applicable regulators of the lenders good standing.” 
That suggests that what they want to know apart from just saying 
seeing the licence they want to know whether that licence is still in 
20 
order.  It is operational.  It can be relied upon. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Agreed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now this was being sent to you. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is your – are you suggesting that when BNP sent the 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 208 of 266 
 
letter to which you have just referred or the email from Moyo that they 
were aware that what was required included something that said BNP 
was in good standing with FSB? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I would say so Chair because on the same 
email on page 5-7-4 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Ivan from BNP is copied. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That is what I wanted to establish. 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So they get asked for that confirmation on the 
6 t h.  Less than an hour later - I have it in time – they provide that 
answer that we see at 5-7-5 attaching the copy of the licence that we 
have looked at.  The next day you get the query from Webber Wentzel 
and then if we just go back to 5-7-3 that is the letter that I understand 
came to you on 8 July 2016.  Can you confirm that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes.  It did Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair this letter bears a striking resemblance 
20 
to the one of 13 May except that there are some important difference.  I 
do not propose to deal with them with Ms Nhantsi.  We will deal with 
them with Mr Mahlangu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But as you have the facts Ms Nhantsi you did 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 209 of 266 
 
not receive 13 May letter.  Even on 6 July you were told by BNP that 
they had a valid FSB Licence … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And it is only on 8 July that that is corrected? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  I would then like to deal with the 
success fee – if we may. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The success fee is the next decision in the 
continuum of decisions. 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because we have looked at FS – the FDC.  We 
have looked at transaction advisor appointment.  We have looked at 
sourcer of funds appointment and the next thing that happens after BNP 
is appointed as a sourcer of funds on 25 May 2016 is on that very same 
day they write a letter to SAA asking – apologies – I am not doing the 
cancellation fee yes. 
I am doing the success fee.  Let us deal with – when I say 
success fee I mean the fee that they were going to charge for sourcing 
these funds. 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There is a debate between you and Ms Stimpel 
about the appropriateness of a 1.5 percent fee.  You are aware of that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As I read your statement Ms Nhantsi and we 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 210 of 266 
 
can go to page 19 of it - if we may. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You will see at paragraph 64 on that page you 
are dealing with the justification of the 1.5 percent which was the 
negotiated rate that had been agreed with BNP.  Correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you are also answering here - as I 
understand your statement – the accusation that was made in 
Ms Stimpel’s statement that despite her giving you information from the 
banks that they would have sourced these funds for much less.  You did 
10 
not take that information to the Board.  You are aware of those 
allegations? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As I understand your paragraph 64 what you 
are saying there is you were entitled to discount the quotations that 
you received from Ms Stimpel because – and I am reading from the 
middle of that paragraph: 
“The difference between a request you had made 
…” 
We will come to that request. 
20 
“…and that of Ms Stimpel was that she was asking 
on a hypothetical point of view and I was focusing 
on a factual point of view.” 
Do you see that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 211 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Was that your reason for discarding the 
alternative quotes that she presented to you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes – Chair allow me to – to just give further 
information there.  I said with Ms Stimpel – now we are talking the 
success rate? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I – I think it was 6 May. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  We discussed and in contrary to – to her 
statement as well where she said I gave her a submission to sign and 
10 
she refused that had 3 percent.  I never gave her a submission but 
what I did was the discussion with her to say I engaged with SNG – 
Sizwe Ntsaluba Gobodo Corporate Finance and the – I asked for the – 
the industry norm. 
They said it is two to 3 percent.  So she told me that 3 
percent is high.  I then asked Ms Stimpel to go and do the analysis and 
– and revert back to me.  Ms Stimpel was aware of the – of the urgency 
of – of these funds that are needed for the company to settle the loans.  
She told me that she is going away on leave and she would ask 
Mr Kleyn to do the analysis which – which I agreed. 
20 
On the day - perhaps let me because she said it on – on the 
public that she made it as if Mr Jacob Zuma when he went to SAA he 
was having a meeting with me.  I would like to put it on record that 
Chair Mr Jacob Zuma when he went to SAA he went to address the 
entire employees of SAA. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 212 of 266 
 
So there was no way I could not have attended because even 
the Board Members were there.  That is number one.  Secondly, 
Mr Kleyn did not do the analysis and we forged ahead because of the 
urgency that we had of the loans.  We prepared the documentation 
starting from BAC.  As you have said we followed the processes.  She 
came back and wrote to me… 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi I am sorry to interrupt you there but 
I would just like to ask a follow up question in the chronology. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  You meet with her on 6 May? 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  She says she is going on leave and she is 
going to get Mr Kleyn to do these alternative quotes for you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You say he did not produce them? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did he – did you follow up with him? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I have asked Mr Kleyn.  He said he has done 
anything. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Was it not very important for you to get some 
20 
alternative quotes at that point?  Should you not have instructed him to 
do so? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair I – I had a – the reason why I – I asked 
for – for SNG Corporate Finance on the submission that Mr Kleyn had – 
sorry – Ms Stimpel had on the 27 t h.  The famous submission – 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 213 of 266 
 
27 November.  There was a list of – of bidders and potential bidders 
and a list of the ones that have responded and the others that have not 
responded. 
The financial institutions specifically the ones that she 
requested some never responded some did not show up.  Some were 
given the rates of – of 7 percent and all that.  So I felt there is no need 
to go and probe the bank further because what she has done is to just 
engage the banks and the same banks that last week she did testify in 
saying there are more cautious. 
They cannot – they will not put all their resources in one pot.  
10 
So the – I could not ask the banks and two, the reason why I did not 
engage further when she came back the hypothetical quotes is because 
those were hypothetical quotes and to quote one from RNB it even said 
without taking into account other information hypothetically this is the 
rate. 
So the – the rates that Ms Stimpel got from the banks needed 
some work to be done for – for those rates to be compared to the actual 
rates. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would like – if I may – just to break that down 
a bit.  I had not jumped yet to 20 May which is when you got the 
20 
hypothetical quotes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay, sorry. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We are still in about 11 May or thereabouts. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Your submission to the Board was on 18 May.  
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 214 of 266 
 
Correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  So what I am interested in is the dates 
between 6 May and 18 May when Ms Stimpel leaves to say I am going 
to get you some alternative quotes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  She leaves it to her Deputy to do so. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  He does not do so. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Huh-uh. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I am interested in why you did not seek further 
quotes at that point.  It is not relevant to what you do get from 
Ms Stimpel at the time. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Huh-uh. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why are you not going for more than the SNG – 
it is around two to 3 percent conversation that you had? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair the reason why I did not go out for 
more in fact I thought I did very well because when I sat with 
Ms Stimpel on 6 May SNG told me that the – the going rate is two to 3 
percent and the rate that I negotiated with BNP was 1.5 percent. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So your view was you needed no more than 
that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  My view was 1.5 percent is even less than 
the – the minimum of – of the industry norm and – and also high level 
calculations were once other factors are taken into account on her 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 215 of 266 
 
hypothetical quotes – allow me to link them. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  On her hypothetical quotes it would go to the 
same rates. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did the information you receive from SNG give 
you clarity as to what the industry norm was or what SNG would 
charge? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  The – they gave me the industry norm 
because Corporate Finance at SNG they do deal with these kinds of 
transactions.  So SNG itself does not give funding but they get involved 
10 
in the advisory of – of these kinds of transactions (intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And they also source funds.  Do they not? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  They also assist the companies in sourcing 
funds. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Which is the exact position that … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That BNP would occupy here? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Fonya is the person you dealt with at SNG.  
Is it not? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You included a statement of his that was 
unsigned in your evidence.  Did you not? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You are aware that the Commission followed up 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 216 of 266 
 
with him? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  About that statement … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Because an unsigned statement we needed to 
explore further. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Agree. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You have been sent a copy of the affidavit that 
he provided for the Commission.  Correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Correct. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  He says in that affidavit that – let us get it 
Chair - if we may - at page 3-1-4 of your bundle which is DD2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  3-1-4? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right towards the end. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I would like to pick it up at paragraph 8.  He 
says at paragraph 8: 
20 
“During 2016 …” 
She there is a reference to you. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  “…called me 
one day on the 
telephone.  I was in the office.  I do not recall 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 217 of 266 
 
precisely when this was in 2016 but I can confirm 
that it was before the news broke in the media 
about the BNP transaction with SAA.” 
Chair just for reference that only occurs later in July. 
“The phone call did not last more than five minutes.  
She asked me what SNG would charge to source 
funds for SAA on an urgent basis.  I responded that 
transactions for sourcing funds can range between 
two to three percent of the transaction depending 
on the size of the deal.” 
10 
11: 
“She did not give me further details about the 
transaction or funding required by SAA.” 
Ms Nhantsi do – do you accept that what Mr Fonya 
understood you to be asking was what SNG would charge to source the 
funds? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I asked for the industry norm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you agree that that is not consistent with 
what he says you asked him? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  (Witness reading to herself). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Unless SNG charged industry norms. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I suspect they are an avid competitor in that 
market.  So … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair the call that I had with Mzuyanda I 
asked what would the industry norm – what would be charged in the 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 218 of 266 
 
market for 15 billion on an urgent basis because SAA needs money in 
two months or I remember I said two and a half months.  So he said 
between two to – between two to 3 percent. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Do you accept that that is not consistent with 
what he says occurred on that call? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I see Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I note it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So assuming Mr Fonya’s recollection of that 
call is accurate do you accept that if you only had the SNG rate 
10 
available to you it would have made sense to at least test that in the 
market – get a few alternatives? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes if – if my understanding at the time was 
this is SNG rate.  My understanding was this is the industry norm which 
is why on my submission as well it talks about the industry norm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Then let us move forward to 20 May because at 
that date you get “Evidence of Hypothetical Quotes” that the heading on 
the email – correctly so – from RNB and then later Absa indicating that 
they would charge much less than that to source these funds.  
Ms Nhantsi why at that point did you not engage the Board and say I 
20 
have come to you previously for 1.5 but I have just received the 
information that the banks will do this for much less? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair as – as I have indicated that 
Ms Stimpel asked the banks for the hypothetical quote. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 219 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  If these were the actual quotes I would 
definitely have done the same or maybe if I know what I know today but 
at that point in time I – I felt we are not comparing apples with apples.  
We are comparing the actual rates with the hypothetical quotes 
because they even on the response from the lenders they do say 
without taking into account other information. 
The urgency is critical Chair in – in sourcing the funds 
because it means the – the funders would have to go and break the 
investments. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why are you – why you more comfortable with 
10 
the telephonic conversation you had had with Mr Fonya? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It is because … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That was not a formal quote.  Was it? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes.  It is because his – I called him one, I 
was – I was – because I was still a secondee at – at SAA so basically 
SNG was my support structure number one.  Number two, I did not think 
at that time that I should get a formal quote especially after I - I 
thought I deserved to – a well done because I managed to negotiate a 
rate that is less than the industry norm. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi I still struggle with why even if you 
20 
had all those reservations about the hypothetical quote they were 
coming in under half a percent.  You are aware of that – the 
hypothetical quotes that Ms Stimpel had? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes.  They were somewhere on 0.75 basis 
points yes. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 220 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Basis points which is a percentage of a percent 
as I understand the lingo. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  She was saying to you it is considerably 
cheaper if we go to the banks.  Do you accept that your role at SAA is 
to act in its financial best interests? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes I do and … 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why would you not then try and change those 
hypothetical quotes into actual quotes because you have your Group 
Treasurer saying to you I can get this for much, much less.  We can 
10 
save the company hundreds of millions.  Why would you not then go 
and ask for a formal quote if necessary? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Two things Chair.  One we were acting on a 
confinement and emergency basis.  So for me to open and go to the 
banks and engage on hypothetical quotes it would mean I am nullifying 
the emergency and the confinement that was approved by the Board.  
That is one. 
Two, as I have highlighted now that we are not comparing 
apples with apples.  Three, the question that I had in mind is one of the 
things if also Ms Stimpel acted in the best interest of the company as 
20 
she is saying these hypothetical quotes as well she should have 
received it when she received the Seacrest tender and the Seacrest 
term sheet and if you compare this with the Seacrest tender as well the 
company was going to pay a much, much higher rate on Seacrest. 
So I had questions.  The Seacrest one was at the back of my 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 221 of 266 
 
mind especially when every time I meat with Ms Stimpel she always 
talks about how the Board took a wrong decision by – by not taking 
Seacrest. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Two, the hypothetical quotes I felt as well 
whilst we pushing for the company to get the funding so that we are 
VAT the default on the loans.  Ms Stimpel is - or is still fixated on 
Seacrest and now she is coming on the very last hour with hypothetical 
quotes that are not actual quotes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi I would like to just pick up the first 
10 
of the answers that you gave there.  You said you could not go the 
banks because you were working with the decision of the Board to 
award this sourcing of funds to BNP.  Is that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  On the basis of – of emergency and 
confinement. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Indeed but you will accept that when the Board 
gave that instruction and decision that it took on 21 April it had no idea 
what the cost would be to it … 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  (Intervenes). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of sourcing these funds? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Definitely but my point Chair is we were 
working on the ambit of emergency and confinement and in terms of 
SCM we were confined to work - because of urgency we were left with 
two months.  We were confined to work with BNP and knowing what I 
knew at the time I thought 1.5 anyway is – is a good rate. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 222 of 266 
 
The company is going to save money especially Chair that 
even if you look at the term sheet of BNP the rate was even now much 
less than the one that they gave for FDC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well did you take the view that it was unlikely that the 
banks would give you a lower rate than the rate that BNP was providing 
if – even if you approached them for an actual rate? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Comparing it to 1.5 Chair I took the view that 
with giving and factoring other factors it would come to 1.5 percent 
especially the industry norm being two to 3 percent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I am not sure if that answers my question. 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you think about asking for an actual rate from the 
banks either yourself or asking Ms Stimpel to do that for you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  At the time no – no Chair.  I did not ask her 
because in my mind I thought the rate – after the factored the urgency 
on – on the hypothetical quote it will come to the 1.5 percent anyway. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long would it take to get an actual rate from the 
banks?  How long would that process take?  Would it be a question of 
picking up a phone and/or sending an email and within the few days 
you would get an answer? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  You would send an email Chair depending if 
you one, you send the email to the General Liaising Banker or you are 
sending to the – because the communication would be you send it to 
the liaising person who you normally deal with at the bank and then 
that person needs to send it to the Corporate Financiers. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 223 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Different banks, ja. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  That are dealing with these transactions 
which was one of the reasons Chair that I thought the people who 
responded they did not say the Corporate Financiers are saying this.  
They – they responded from their knowledge as the liaison people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But how long would it take to get an answer? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   A minimum of a week Chair I think would be 
right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A minimum of a week. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And at that stage was that too long, would that cause 
too long a delay? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Chair it was going to be too long of a delay 
now we’re talking, we are at the dates of 24 t h of May and we’ve got 
loans that are maturing 30 t h of June yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Just to pick up one point there Ms Nhantsi I 
understand your evidence to be you worked out that if the banks had 
been given the fact of urgency which is the only fact as I compare what 
Ms Stimpel went to the banks on the basis of and you went to Mr Fonya 
20 
on the basis of, that’s the only point of discrepancy, that if they had 
been told about urgency you surmised that their rates that were less 
than half a percent would then go up to 1.5%, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Chair the emails, I’m sure we can go back 
to them, they didn’t give, the other bank, because she went to two or 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 224 of 266 
 
three, two things is the urgency and it is the fact that the money that 
the SAA needed should be in local denominators ...(intervention)  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Yes but Ms Nhantsi you did not give that fact 
to Mr Fonya? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    That is what he is saying on his affidavit 
Chair.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   He does not say that you specified that it must 
be rand denominated. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    I’m sure that I did Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    But he doesn’t say that in his affidavit do you 
10 
accept that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Yes he doesn’t say that I did. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Right.  We are now Ms Nhantsi at the last 
point on the success fee which is that you concluded on your own 
estimation that the ultimate fee would get around 1.5, you didn’t check 
that with anyone at the banks did you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     No I didn’t Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you.  I would then like to move to the 
cancellation fee which is where I thought we were previously, I do 
apologise for that, the cancellation fee is in fact the last decision in 
20 
this sequence and that you deal with at page 12 Ms Nhantsi of your 
statement if we can go there. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So there starting at paragraph 38 you’re 
dealing with the motivation for the cancellation fee.  You gave us 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 225 of 266 
 
evidence earlier this morning that you no longer support the 
cancellation fee but your evidence as I have it was also that you never 
supported it, is that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Correct Chair.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Can you then clarify for us why you 
recommended to the Board that they approve the cancellation fee? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair the cancellation fee Chair on the 
25 t h of May when we sent signed by Mr Lester Peters the letter of 
award to BnP to source the funds for the company, when they 
acknowledged the receipt of the letter of award they then included a 
10 
new clause that says should SAA cancel for whatever reason they are 
obliged or entitled to pay 50% of the total fees within five days or 
seven days if I’m not mistaken.  This was the new term or the new 
clause altogether.  When we discussed with the Board the cancellation 
fee was not there, so we then, I then engaged with BnP in trying to 
understand what is the basis of R128million because 50% of 256 
inclusive of VAT is 128million. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Ms Nhantsi sorry to interrupt, who were you 
dealing with, with BnP in these conversations? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     With the – the correspondence was with Mr 
20 
Mahlangu and there were also I think there was a telephone call with 
Mr Mngadi 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   So both of them I engaged with them on 
this.  I wanted to understand Chair the cancellation fee clause it’s not a 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 226 of 266 
 
new clause in the business environment, but I felt it was too high and it 
needs to be justified, why would one – it was never discussed with us 
as management it came as a shock, number one, because it was never 
discussed with us as management so that we can take it to the Board, it 
came in a letter saying should for any reason, and at that point I was 
not anticipating any cancellations, cancellation of the mandate, but I 
was aware, in the back of my mind I was aware that there was a tender 
that was done and which was declined.  Why would a company pay to 
the magnitude of R128million. 
 
I engaged with them, they gave me another submission, 
10 
sometime in May, sometime in June I think Chair, first on the 25 t h if you 
allow me to take you through the chronology.  On the 25 t h after we’ve 
received this as I am saying I was shocked with the cancellation fee.  
The acknowledgement was we had an attachment of a term sheet.  I 
was – I then, I remember I received a call from Mr Mngadi, there was 
also, I’ve attached on my statement his Whatsapp message putting 
pressure on me to acknowledge the receipt of the letter and the term 
sheet.  On the 2 n d of June I then responded to say we acknowledge 
your – the term sheet and also acknowledging the new term of the 
cancellation fee, please be aware that I need to take this to the Board, 
20 
so I then signed – I signed the term sheet and I put a close with the 
advice from Legal because we discussed this with Acting CEO and also 
Ms Fikilepe.  The advice that I got was if we just signed the term sheet 
it would be like we are accepting this new clause of the cancellation 
fee, but yet we still need to take it to the Board because this is a Board 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 227 of 266 
 
transaction and this new term they need to be aware.  I signed the term 
sheet and I included a handwritten note to say this is not binding until 
we receive board approval of the cancellation fee.  This is the 2 n d of 
June Chair, from after the pressure that I received from Mr Mngadi.  
The Whatsapps I have attached Chair, I am not sure if you want us to 
go through but between the 2 n d – when I signed the non-binding term 
sheet up until the 8 t h I will come to the 8 t h because also Mr van der 
Merwe testified on the 8 t h, there was a lot of pressure that I was 
receiving, there were lots of Whatsapps from Mr Mngadi, there were 
lots of calls from the Chairperson of the Board and the words that she 
10 
used to use is I am behaving as if it is business as usual, and it is not 
business as usual, the company is going down if we don’t get the 
funding. 
 
I resisted, I wrote the acknowledgement and I said I am going 
to take it to the Board.  On the 8 t h – before the 8 t h there was a board 
meeting, there was a meeting that we  had at National Treasury on the 
3 r d of June.  I woke up with a Whatsapp from Mr Mngadi saying if it 
looks like one, it’s saying they appointed me to lead them, therefore I 
must lead them, I should not say I am waiting for Legal on certain 
things and if I don’t want to cooperate or before I go to the meeting of 
20 
the 3 r d I should sign that term sheet and take out the Landbank deal or 
I should tell him because he needs to engage and inform the 
stakeholders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was saying that, I missed that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Mr Mngadi, on the Whatsapp. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 228 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he was saying they appointed you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    He said we have appointed you to lead us, 
so lead us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he was not part of SAA? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   He was not part of SAA hence Chair 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  So how could he have been part of appointing you, do 
you know? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Chair after the – after he read the 
Whatsapp from Mr Mngadi I called Ms Yaki Kunana to say this is not 
10 
what I signed up for, it looks like now I’m tapping into damaging the 
integrity and my name, if I am asked to sign things that are beyond my 
mandate that are the Board’s mandate, this is not what I signed up for 
and then ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to go back, I want to make sure I understood you 
correctly. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He sent you a Whatsapp message or was it a 
telephone conversation? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    It was a Whatsapp Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, saying we ...(intervention)  
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     We appointed you to lead us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ... lead us, we appointed you to lead us. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     That’s what it’s saying the Whatsapp Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes, okay continue. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 229 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   I then called with frustration Ms Yaki 
Kunana as I have related earlier Chair that I worked with her at Denel 
to say this is tantamount to tarnishing my reputation because if now I 
am asked to do – to sign things that are beyond my mandate that are 
the Board I will not be able to do that.  Her response was if you feel 
that your integrity is going to be tarnished and your name don’t – her 
words where “don’t even walk away run away” so I even responded on 
that Whatsapp, normally I don’t respond on some Whatsapp, I respond 
on some, I responded to Mr Mngadi on that day to say this is the Board 
mandate, if I am expected to take decisions this is beyond my mandate 
10 
and unfortunately when I joined SAA I was told that Legal needs to be 
involved, now basically his Whatsapp wanted me not to involve Legal, 
but I never questioned the part of we appointed you to lead us, so lead 
us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I just want to go to that Whatsapp message. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Indeed, let’s go there Chair, if I may suggest 
can we do them in chronological order, the Whatsapps? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s fine, that’s fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So we will start at –of Ms Nhantsi’s bundle 
page 84. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Sorry I just suggested to you to see the 
progression in time, because Ms Nhantsi’s evidence is that there was 
increasing pressure placed on her and if you read these Whatsapps in 
chronology you see that pressure mounting.  If we begin at 84 it’s a 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 230 of 266 
 
Whatsapp I have at 31 May so that’s six days after they had been 
awarded the sourcing of funds, six days after the first letter saying we 
want a cancellation fee of 50% of our total fees.  It talks about on page 
84 as they have it a whole lot of reasons why they  should be getting 
this cancellation fee, it’s about costs that they have been incurring 
etcetera, but what I think is useful is if we go over to 85, you will 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe just for the sake of completeness I didn’t 
see this, maybe to the extent that some of them have got some 
sentences in isiXhosa or isiZulu, if arrangements can be made for a 
10 
translation and – of those parts which are not in English. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I will understand it but somebody else might not 
understand. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Yes, I have previously been assisted with a 
translation by one of our investigators but we will do that formally 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no that’s fine. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  We will do that and we will just 
supplement the bundle with those translations. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, that’s fine ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    But if we go to page 85 I would like to pick it 
up in the middle of the page, Ms Nhantsi what you see there is just a 
little bit above the middle, this is the sort of conclusion of the 
justification: 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 231 of 266 
 
“When SAA’s customers cancel or change tickets SAA charges 
cancellation fee.  We wanted 75% cancellation fees but in 
dealing in good faith with SAA so we negotiate we end at 50%.  
We ask for BnP’s actual cancellation costs are.” 
Ms Nhantsi you will have heard the evidence of Mr van der Merwe did 
you not? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes I did. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    You are aware that he denies any of those 
costs had been incurred. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    You didn’t know that at the time though did 
you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   I didn’t know Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    If we go to point 2 it says: 
“Ray your statement that you take instructions from Yaki, 
unless Yaki and the Chair comes up with a unanimous position 
with respect ....” 
You will have to assist me there. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   I don’t know. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    You don’t know?  Well we ...(intervention)  
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    That’s what he’s saying, (indistinct) means 
I don’t know.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Oh I see, I don’t know. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, it’s either I don’t understand ...(intervention)  
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 232 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Either I don’t understand or I don’t know 
what’s happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Ja. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    And then if you read on there, he goes on to 
say? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   “Your allergens I thought you were a part of 
our collective team.” 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Could you just stop there, what did you 
understand that to be, what team were you a member of with Mr 
10 
Mngadi? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   I didn’t understand Chair, this is one of the 
things that I didn’t understand on his pressure, hence I ended up 
calling Yaki to say maybe I got the wrong memo when I signed up with 
SAA, this is not what I signed up for.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Nhantsi in these Whatsapps that you’ve 
provided to us we often see what Mngadi said but not what you’ve said 
either prior or after these conversations, can I take it you don’t have a 
difficulty providing those to the Commission? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Some of them I never responded, the ones 
20 
that I have I will give it to you Commission. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Thank you.  I’m just interested 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, I think she must just complete that 
message. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 233 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Please 
complete 
this 
message 
because 
you 
understand the isiXhosa or isiZulu there, you provide what your 
understanding was. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Ja, (indistinct) means my apologies if I 
misunderstood, have a good day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you.  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Then if we go over to 87 ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  So ...(intervention)  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Apologies Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...here this last sentences or two of that Whatsapp 
message he conveys to you that his understanding was that you were 
part of what he calls our collective team? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say you didn’t understand what he was 
talking about. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes, I didn’t understand Chair but on the 
31 s t of May because it was the first Whatsapp that talks about the team 
I didn’t do anything about it, I will check if I responded, but now as the 
pressure mounted where now he was telling me to do things, if I don’t 
20 
do I must inform him because he needs to inform the stakeholders 
which I didn’t know who the stakeholders were, that’s when I decided to 
call Ms Kunana, to say I am not sure if this is what I signed up for, 
because it looks like now we are tapping into my integrity and in how I 
do things, because I would never sign up for anything, the transactions 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 234 of 266 
 
that belongs to the Board I respected and throughout my evidence I 
have been respecting the fact that they are the board’s transaction.  So 
now he wanted me to just sign the term sheet and take out non-binding 
without addressing the cancellation fee, yet on BnP’s acknowledgment 
of the sourcing of funds they included this cancellation fee. 
 
So that is why on the first part of the Whatsapp he says why 
am I combining two issues, why am I combining the term sheet and the 
cancellation fee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the time you got this message you – were you still 
feeling comfortable about Mr Mngadi’s role in these SAA matters? 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Chair I was not comfortable at all, in fact 
the pressure Chair I was not only getting it from Mr Mngadi, I was also 
getting calls from the Chair of the Board, maybe I missed this at the 
beginning to say when I first joined SAA I would say we were still on 
good terms with (indistinct), she once told me that the reason why 
nobody can find anything on her is because she does not write anything 
down, so she would hardly send these Whatsapps but she would give 
me a call to say you and Mossa think this is business as usual, it is not 
business as usual, you need to sign these things urgently, the funders 
are in Paris and somewhere and waiting for the term sheet and yet I am 
20 
playing around. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So how soon after you had commenced your work at 
SAA did she make this statement to you that the reason why nothing 
could be found on her is that she did not sign anything? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   I’m sure it was a week or two Chair, we were 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 235 of 266 
 
just chatting outside the board meeting 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   And then it started, she asked me if I know 
any – she said she is popular in the media and have I read anything.  I 
said I’ve read about SAA and in the accounting space we are normally 
very busy but I have heard about her name and then she said, she 
laughed and then she said the reason why nobody can find anything 
pointing to her is because she does not write anything down. I used it 
to my advantage later on Chair what she told me because I just laughed 
and then I said serious (indistinct) serious Chair and then she said yes, 
10 
but I used it to my advantage as the time goes on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   If we could then turn over to 87 Ms Nhantsi 
because this is a Whatsapp, it’s not obvious from the page what date it 
was on but I take it to be the 2 n d of June because it’s referring to that 
letter that you’d sent on the 2 n d of June which didn’t include the 
binding, it had that caveat about being non-binding, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    I really would like us to unpack those first few 
sentences on the page, let’s start with the first Sis Wam. 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     My sister. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    My sister.  This letter you have sent with 
respect means nothing, and I’m really interested in the second 
sentence and your help with that.  It reads: 
“It is of no use to the funders, to me, to everyone.” 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 236 of 266 
 
Who is the everyone that is going to benefit from a conclusion of the 
funding arrangement and agreement on the cancellation fee? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:     My – the only person at this point Chair 
that I knew now especially getting uncomfortable at this point I would 
say is the Chair of the Board. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    It then goes on to say: 
“We might as well have waited for you to get Board approval 
for the cancellation fee clause.” 
What did you understand that to mean? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Basically he expected me Chair to sign the 
10 
term sheet and not include the non-binding, I was trying to read the 
entire, because there’s somewhere he says why am I mixing the two, 
the term sheet and the cancellation fee because he said he was under 
pressure from the funders and the funders are now their view is they 
are not taking, they think SAA is not serious in getting the funds. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Hmm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was saying he was under pressure, Mr Mngadi. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Mr Mngadi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But why would he be, have any contact with the 
funders of SAA since he was outside of SAA? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   He was working with BnP.  He was working 
with BnP Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh from that capacity?  
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 237 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    So Mr Mngadi Chair at this point as I 
understand the chronology is seeking to motivate for the cancellation 
fee because if its paid to BnP it he is sitting associated with BnP at 
that point.  If we can then go on ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  So – I’m sorry again. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:    Apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we – the picture we have is of Mr Mngadi who at 
the time you arrived at SAA you were told was the Chairperson’s 
person? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    And you established that he was not being paid for 
his services by SAA? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who nevertheless was very involved in SAA matters? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then at the same stage you established that he 
was part of Nedbank? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then later on you found that he was involved with 
BnP? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   Yes because he started giving me pressure 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but throughout or as at the time of this Whatsapp 
message as far as you knew he was still involved with all of these 
people, he was still involved with Nedbank and still involved with BnP 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 238 of 266 
 
and was still as you were told the Chairperson’s person? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:   I assumed Chair that he was ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  That was your understanding? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:   Ms Nhantsi were you aware of any personal 
relationship between Mr Mngadi and anyone in Ms Nene’s family?  
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Family? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No Chair I was not until I read one of the 
10 
affidavits that I got from the Commission that – and also the transcript 
that Ms Kunana had with OUTA that he is friends with – I just forgot his 
name, but it’s Ms Chair’s son. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Mr Talente Majeni? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes, yes Mr Talente Majeni, so I knew it, last 
week I think on Friday when I got ...(intervention)  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You didn’t know that prior? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And did you ever see him arrive at SAA with Mr 
Majene? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No I never saw him. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Chair we will return to that in the 
course of Mr Mhlangu’s evidence, but in relation to what carries on, on 
page 87 I would just like to pick up a point midway down where Mr 
Mngadi says: 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 239 of 266 
 
“I thought the Board Resolution was circulated yesterday to be 
dealt with today.” 
Were you telling him when board resolutions were being circulated 
within SAA? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No certain information Mr Mngadi would 
know and then I assumed that he was getting that information from 
Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes certainly that seems to be apparent from 
the Whatsapp messages.  The other one I can think of is the one that 
he sends you on the 23 r d of May.  Remember the 23 r d of May is before 
10 
the board has approved the appointment of BnP to source the funds, 
well the second time let me be clear that they approve it. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And the Whatsapp communication with Mr 
Mngadi has him saying to you: 
“I know the Chair has approved but what has happened to the 
other two.” 
Do you recall that Whatsapp? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes I do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So I would suggest to you that’s a further 
20 
indication that he was receiving information about what was happening 
within the decision making of SAA. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And not from you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Not from me Chair. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 240 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  If we then go over to page 89, this 
is a Whatsapp where as I read it there was a reference directly to the 
Chair, this is going on Ms Nhantsi about why you have to sign this term 
sheet and why this is needed for SAA, and then it goes, this is the one, 
sorry you were looking for it – why link these issues with the term 
sheet. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That’s at the bottom. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But the one I’m interested in is can you just 
10 
read for us the last sentence and translate it there? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It is saying please talk to the Chair 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, are you at 89? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 89?  Is it page 89 that you asked us to be? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m trying to – I didn’t see what she has just read. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it on page 89? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes the ...(intervention)  
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It’s the last two sentences. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  The last two sentences. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  The last two lines.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, I’m looking at the top, okay, yes. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 241 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It is saying please (African language) 
meaning please can you talk to the Chairperson she is expecting your 
call. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What did you take that to mean? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  As a – I think now I take this as more he’s 
given up now, he’s giving me – handing me back to the Chair to talk to 
the Chair of the Board.  I will check the dates Chair, I think this is the 
8 t h of June.  So I am with all this backwards and forwards waiting for 
the Board now she is handing me, this is the – this is the this is also 
linked to the email that I got from him on the 8 t h of June.  It was for the 
10 
email from Mr Mogadi to me and Moosa and the only board member that 
was copied was the Chair, Ms Myeni(?). 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You’ve included that email? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes, I did. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, we can go to that in a moment.   
CHAIRPERSON:  At this stage, I’m sorry.  At this stage, how many 
Board members did the Board have? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Three Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Still three? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Still three. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Including the Chairperson? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We can then go to but to 91.  Chair this is the 
WhatsApp you were particularly keen to take a look at. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 242 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  This is the one Ms Nhantsi, as I have your 
evidence you got early on that morning that you were scheduled to 
meet at National Treasury, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And there you have the reference after him 
indicating he hoped you had a restful evening, where he says you have 
been chosen to lead SAA to lead us.  I have faith in you to please 
demonstrate your leadership qualities, you take decisions not legal.  Do 
you see that? 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And then he goes on to explain again why he 
needs a signed off term sheet without conditions. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And he ends off saying that he wants to inform 
all the stakeholders.  Who are all these stakeholders he wants to inform 
about the successful conclusion of the term sheet, do you think? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I assumed it would be the Chair and also the 
Grissag Funders because on all the communications he’s been 
consistent in saying the Funders is out in Canada, in Paris and 
20 
everywhere awaiting for the term sheets that does not have the none 
binding because he even on the other SMS on the other WhatsApp said 
they’re expectation- allow me to just on page 89.  He said the 
impression created is that SAA does not want this funding, the funding 
term sheet you say is not binding is subject to issues that have nothing 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 243 of 266 
 
to do with a term sheet.  I don’t know what to say to the Funders 
(African Language) means I don’t know what to say to the Funders now.  
Please let us withdraw the letter.  So this is the WhatsApp where he is 
instructing me even towards the end of that WhatsApp he says if we 
don’t lead this airline, someone else will lead it for us.  Believe me 
when I say we don’t have time.  If you can’t execute my request by 
latest 9 o’clock this morning, please let me know in the morning so that 
I can inform all the stakeholders accordingly. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi, at the time that you were receiving 
these WhatsApps were you concerned about the closeness of his 
10 
relationship with Ms Myeni? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes, I was and I was always in discussion 
with all what is happening with Mr Zwane.  I used to even ask is this 
how the Corporate world works?   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And we’ve had some references to teams and 
the collective in these WhatsApps.  Was your understanding that the 
persons who stood to benefit from the conclusion of the cancellation 
fee included Ms Myeni? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes, I did because on the basis that the Mr 
Mogadi would know what we discuss in the Board meeting and without 
20 
me informing him.  So I then understood that he is working with Ms 
Myeni. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi, why didn’t you sound the alarm 
then? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair, I was going to- we discussed this with 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 244 of 266 
 
Mr Zwane to say this is starting to suggest something else.  And I even 
asked Mr Zwane what is the process of the whistleblower and all that.  
He then said, no let’s see how this goes because the Board is not going 
to approve the cancellation fee.  Even Chair allow me to say, eventually 
after I signed the term sheet and took out, it was on the day when Ms 
Myeni called me.  I told her that I will only take it out if she agrees with 
me that I will still- I’m still going to deal with the cancellation fee.  I 
can take out the non binding so that the Funders can go and give 
money but the cancellation fee I’m still going to take it to the Board.  I 
recall that from our conversation, Mr Zwane got a call from the Chair to 
10 
ask how much is his DOA, how much can he sign up to.  Mr Zwane said 
up to 50 million.  And two days later we received a revised cancellation 
letter from BNP Capital saying they’re trying to put us at ease because 
we’ve been saying the cancellation fee is high.  Now they’ve reduced it 
to 49.9 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This was after you had insisted to the Chairperson 
that you wanted the opportunity to raise the issue of the cancellation 
fee with the Board even if you took out or cancelled the non binding 
statement. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So after that the amount was reduced. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  To 49.9 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  So which was suspicious Chair one BNP 
failed to demonstrate the make-up of 128 million. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 245 of 266 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  If I recall on their letter there’s somewhere 
where, I think the second letter of justifying the cancellation fee.  They 
said, Grissag is going to charge them 5 million US dollars if this 
transaction is cancelled.  So this is just a direct filter as they get the 
penalty from Grissag, they then sending it to SAA.  From there Chair 
it’s then reduced to miraculous amount of 49.9 million which I knew at 
the time and also the acting Chair knew that Ms Myeni is behind it.  
Because he called him, I think the reason why he called him was he 
wanted to make sure that this transaction does not go to the Board.  
10 
Because it was after I said to her, I’m going to take the cancelation fee 
to the Board still even if I take out the non binding.  So I then did a 
submission for round-robin because Chair again this was in the purview 
of the Board and in terms of the SCM policy term, now this was an 
addition amount to the 256 million inclusive of vat.  So what she was 
not aware of none the less I’m going to take it to, we’re going to take it 
to the Board.  So I did the submission Chair to the Board and then I 
called Dr Thambi and I also called Ms Myeni to say there’s a round-
robin that routes the company secretary is going to send, I’m not 
comfortable with the amount but Chair is pushing it.  I remember I even 
20 
said to Ms Kwinana that I’m scared now of even pushing this further.  
Can they take a decision because I’ve been- Chair has been calling me 
day and night about this, can the Board take a decision, I am scared.  I 
abstained I think Chair the intention was not to abstain but I was very 
busy but I knew that I’m not going to approve it, I was going to reject 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 246 of 266 
 
but I abstained.  And Dr Thambi abstained after my call, Yakhe 
abstained, Mr Zwane rejected and Ms Myeni approved it.  I think before 
she approved it she gave me a call to ask why am I taking things that 
are not concerning the Board to the Board.  I told her that it is part of 
the it’s an addition and especially it’s a new term that I needed to give 
to the Board and the Board must deliberate on it because this is the 
Board transaction so she said okay and then she responded.  Then as 
Ms Hofmeyr asked Ms Thembile to read it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair, I see we’re at 17h30.  There are a few 
10 
follow up questions but I’m happy to raise them tomorrow.  There’s not 
much more of Ms Nhantsi’s testimony.  There’s this aspect on the 
cancellation fee which we’ll conclude shortly and then one or two other 
aspect of her evidence to traverse. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it’s going to finish within the next 10 15 minutes or 
even up to six if you are still strong enough and if Ms Nhantsi is still 
available to continue, I am prepared to continue until at least 6 o’clock 
if that will help us to make sure she is done.  Would that be enough or 
would that not be enough? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair, my fear is that it will be a bit more than 
20 
half an hour but that’s not a reason not to use it now.  And then if we 
have to pick it up briefly tomorrow morning to do so.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you still fell strong? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I’m strong enough Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Nhantsi, are you able to continue to try and see if 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 247 of 266 
 
we can finish? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair, I am strong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright, let’s go at least up to six and let’s look 
at the situation at that time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you, Chair.  Ms Nhantsi, what I’d like to 
pick up on in relation to your last answer is we were at about the 8 t h of 
June when you told us you had that conversation with the Chair, you 
said okay I’ll sign ... (intervenes) 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, I’m just wondering whether seeing that we 
won’t get to Mr Mahlangu whether you want to make any arrangements 
for about him.  I’m assuming he’s here because he was meant to 
continue? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  He is indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yeah, in terms of continuing I’m just thinking people 
might have had other plans.  They didn’t know we would get, oh he’s 
cancelling the case then there’s no problem.  Okay, no that’s alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, let’s continue then. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So on the 8 t h of June you signed a binding 
version of the term sheet, correct?   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But I understand your evidence to be you did 
so after a conversation with the Chair, correct? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 248 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  In which you said that you were still going to 
take the issue of the cancellation fee to the Board, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes, correct. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And by this state you’ve had all of this pressure 
in the correspondence with Mr Mogadi.  Now as I understand your 
evidence, you are concerned that the Chair is unduly involved in this, 
correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And stands to benefit from it in some measure, 
10 
correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why don’t you blow the whistle then?  We still 
in June, you only get to your submission to the Board to recommend 
this approval on the 4 t h of July.  Why not blow the whistle in those three 
weeks?   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair, blowing the whistle I wanted to but I 
must also admit that I was not familiar.  This was the first time that I 
left the accounting practice and I’m in there in the Corporate space.  
So blowing the whistle will not be the first thing that come to my mind. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You had had a conversation with Mr Zwane 
about that, haven’t you though? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I had and I asked in terms of reporting things 
like this what then happens.  And he told me that there’s a policy the 
custodian is the Chief internal auditor that we can report this to.  But I 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 249 of 266 
 
think at that point we said let’s- he used to say is it kit for kat, he said 
let’s take it one day at a time and see what happens. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And taking it one day at a time as I have it then 
culminates on the 4 t h of July where you send a recommendation to the 
Board that they approve the cancellation fee, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes, this was also after lots of pressure.  
Now the pressure was also coming from BNP if I’m not mistaken.  They 
wrote a letter as well to me about the cancellation fee. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But Ms Nhantsi, you owe BNP nothing don’t 
you? 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes, I definitely owe BNP nothing but I feel 
that the decision needs to be taken by the Board. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But why recommend it?  If you recommend it 
you are saying to the Board, I stand behind this.  If we go to it, let’s 
just look at it.   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yeah sure. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We go to, its Stimple’s bundle that’s exhibit 
DD1B. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  It’s at 555. 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes, I’m there Chair.  Chair, this is I guess 
I’m answering why I’m recommending to the Board. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Yes, because can we just look at the document 
before you give us the answer because it’s a motivation for this 
cancelation fee to be approved.  And it is your motivation, correct? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 250 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes.  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why do you motivate for a cancelation fee that 
you are highly suspicious of at this stage? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair, first this is the template that SAA use 
to communicate to the Board and if you ask me today whoever company 
I’ll be working for, what would I change, is the last page where it’s 
saying recommendation or not recommend or not recommend.  This is 
how the template is basically I’m not saying I’m recommending to the 
Board.  I’m saying this is the Board for their consideration hence after I 
even wrote it I called Dr Thambi and Ms Kwinana to say one I’m scared, 
10 
two I’m- the pressure is mounting.  I can’t even, I don’t know what to 
do.  Can they now as the board deal with the cancelation fee and take 
responsibility of it.  So this is all the memos Chair that we’ve dealt with 
today.  Today this is the template this is the format that is used by SAA.  
There are certain memos that we also took to the Board that are saying 
recommend to approve but the Board had declined.  So this is the 
template for the Board for their consideration. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi, with respect I don’t think the fact 
that it is a template is an answer to my question.  You took a decision 
to recommend to the Board on the 4 t h of July motivated in the terms 
20 
recorded here for a cancelation fee to be paid, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I took a decision to do a memo to the Board 
for their consideration. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  That contained ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, maybe let me help.  In that memo, did you 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 251 of 266 
 
recommend that the Board approve the cancelation fee? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair and the reason for that ... 
(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, is it yes? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you did approve.  You did recommend. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I did recommend but in contrary ... 
(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr is then asking the question, why did you 
recommend that the Board approve the cancellation fee because you 
10 
were suspicious of this whole thing. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair, it was because of the one of us 
have agreed that I’ve done the submission recommending to the Board.  
Chair it was the pressure that I was getting from Mr Mogadi, it was the 
pressure that I was getting from the Chair of the Board Ms Myeni to the 
extent I remember this is one of the things that I discuss with my 
husband to say, I’m not sure if the decision to join SAA was a good 
one.  Because I’m very scared now with the decisions that needs to be 
taken but I even said I will follow my guts and call the other Board 
members and alert them that I’m concerned.  But I was scared Chair as 
20 
well to put it on writing here to say, hey I’m scared and I’m not in 
agreement with this 49.9 million.  But I was hoping and I knew that Mr 
Zwane is not going to approve it because we’ve been discussing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, one you agree that the memo that you sent to 
the Board recommended that they should approve the cancelation fee.  
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 252 of 266 
 
We’ve agreed on that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But is the position that you are saying in 
sending in making that recommendation, you were uneasy about making 
that recommendation.  But you made it because you were under 
pressure, is that part of what you are saying? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you talk about you having called members of the 
Board or having planned to call the members of the Board or some 
members of the Board, is that right? 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that a decision you made before you made the 
recommendation or before you sent it that you were going to call 
members of the Board? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I planned to call members of the Board as I 
was doing the submission.  I then took the submission after both myself 
and acting CE signed, we followed the process of round-robin and sent 
it to company secretary.  Once it was still with company secretary, I 
then called two other members of the Board to say ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Two out of the three members of the Board. 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Two out of the three because the first one is 
Ms Myeni, it’s the one who’s giving me pressure.  So there’s the other 
two members, I then said to them there’s a round-robin coming.  By 
then company secretary has not sent it.  There’s a round-robin coming, 
I’m concerned.  I even said I’m scared at because of the pressure that 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 253 of 266 
 
I’m getting from the Chair.  I’m concerned, the amount is high but can 
the Board take the responsibility and the accountability. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say to them when they see- did you say to 
them they will receive from the company secretary a memo from you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  From the company secretary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From the company secretary but the memo would be 
written by you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you say to them in that memo you will read 
that I’m recommending that you approve the cancelation fee? 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you then say to them that’s not my true view.  I’ve 
written it like that because I’m under pressure.  I’m actually not in 
support of the cancelation fee.   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I said that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To both of them? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  To both of them Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what did they say? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Ms Kwinana said okay, she hears me.  She 
will wait for the memo to come through.  Dr Thambi said the memo is 
not yet with him, he will check his inbox.  So I didn’t then make a follow 
up but they abstained from voting for this decision.  So Chair, I also 
abstained, Mr Zwane rejected and Chair was the only person who 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 254 of 266 
 
approved the cancelation fee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi, I’d like to just clarify some aspects 
of those conversations you had with Dr Thambi and Ms Kwinana. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Did they give you an undertaking on that call 
that they would vote against it? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No, they did not.  They did not tell me how 
they will vote on it.  I raised all my concerns, I raised everything, they 
said they hear me.  Ms Kwinana said she will apply her mind when she 
10 
gets it.  Dr Thambi as well listened to me and then said he will check, 
he will be on the outlook to check that submission that I’m talking 
about. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So they gave you no guarantee as to the way 
they would vote? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Dr Thambi gave me no guarantee but I could 
sense from the discussion that Yakhe would not vote for it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But it was foreseeable ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, you stop to speak of Dr Thambi and Yakhe. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Sorry, Ms Kwinana.  Sorry. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, just repeat what who in respect of whom did 
you get the sense that he or she was not going to vote in favour? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair, I got the sense from Ms Kwinana after 
I raised all my concerns that she will not support it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 255 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But it was a sense, it wasn’t an undertaking 
correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  It was not an undertaking at the time. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it was a foreseeable possibility that she 
may consider and vote in favour of it?  Yes? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No, it was probably it was more probable 
than not that she will not vote for it. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And was it reasonable foreseeable that Dr 
Thambi could vote either way? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  He did not, I couldn’t sense anything.  He 
10 
said he was going to wait for the email. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So he could have voted for, he could have 
voted against correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Are you aware of the manner in which board 
resolutions are passed by majority vote of the votes cast.  Are you 
aware of that provision of the memorandum of incorporation of SAA? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes, I am. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So it’s not the majority of the votes available, 
it’s the majority of the votes cast which means that if Board directors 
20 
abstain, they don’t count for the total number that you have to get a 
majority vote on.  Do you understand that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No, come again. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Okay, let’s just go to the memorandum of 
incorporation.  It’s in your bundle at page 152.   
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 256 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  152, sorry.  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You’ll see ... (intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:  While Ms Hofmeyr you are looking at that, can I just 
ask this.  At some stage when you were talking about the memo to the 
Board that we are talking about from you that was going to go via the 
company secretary to Board members.  You said the only thing you’d 
change in it is the recommendation part where it says recommended or 
something like that.  Is that correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair, I was more saying the templates going 
forward knowing what I know today, I would give myself a space where I 
10 
state my view as the author of the document where I say am I 
recommending it or as the author what is my view.  Because if that’s 
the case on this one but not having all the pressures that I was under 
at this current transaction, I would say the amount is too high.  I am not 
comfortable with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I’m not sure that I understand that.  That 
suggest to me that you are saying that this template did not give you 
room to say you are not recommending if in fact you are not 
recommending. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair, it was not giving room and 
20 
company secretary insisted that we don’t change the templates.  There 
were two templates of SAA this one and the other one.  So you were 
not supposed to temper with the template. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Yes, 
but 
there 
under 
three 
where 
it 
says 
recommendation, obviously you must have understood that there you 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 257 of 266 
 
write what you support should be done by the Board.  If you say you 
recommend that they approve, you write that.  But equally it must be 
that if you don’t approve, if you don’t recommend that they approve 
that’s where you write that as well.  Was your understanding different? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair, because I was part of the Board 
members because I have to take it to the Board at the submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I understand that. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  But now if I’m saying that I’m recommending 
that the Board should not approve it, my understanding is why am I 
taking it there? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but if you are not the one who’s supposed to 
decide aren’t you putting everything before them?  And then you 
expressing your view but your view is not binding on them? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No, I agree Chair, hence I am saying 
differently if it was not this kind of transaction where I was under 
pressure, I was scared.  I couldn’t put it Chair even though I knew at 
the time that I was writing this that I’m not in support and I’m not going 
to support it.  But I had to write the submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but what I would- I thought your evidence was it 
you accept that in this memo you recommended that the Board 
20 
approves the cancellation fee. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  That’s what I said Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You agree with that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I thought you agreed with that.  And then I 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 258 of 266 
 
thought what you meant was you did intend to recommend that they 
approve but your intention to recommend that they approve but that 
they approve but your intention to recommend that they approve was 
based on pressure. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you were getting. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not because had you’d been given another space to 
say recommend or not recommend you would have said not recommend 
which is what I understand you now to be saying. 
10 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Oh no Chair, this it was just an example for 
other things to say the lesson that I’ve learned here on the template.  
But you are right I was under pressure to recommend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you recommended you knew that you were 
recommending.  You knew that if you didn’t want to recommend it, you 
would say, I do not recommend it.  (Audio Microphone is off) 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But because of the (inaudible) you recommended.  
(Microphone is off) 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair, sorry to interrupt.  Just your microphone 
has gone off, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, let’s just do that again so that it’s captured on 
the trans- on the recording.  So when you signed the memo you knew 
you knew that you were recommending that the Board should approve 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 259 of 266 
 
the cancelation fee? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that’s what you intended them to know?   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you did so because of pressure. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If there wasn’t pressure, what would you have written 
here? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I would have written Chair to say for the 
Board to consider and for the Board to note that I am not comfortable, 
10 
the amount is too high therefore I’m not recommending the Board to 
approve it.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You would have said you are not recommending the 
approval? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Who had applied the pressure in the led up to 
the 4 t h of July? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  The Chair- I’m sorry.  Ms Myeni the 
Chairperson of the Board and Mr Mogadi. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And in what form did the pressure come from 
Ms Myeni? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Via phone calls, I would get more than two or 
three calls a day, Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And is that so over the period from about the 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 260 of 266 
 
8 t h of June where you sign the term sheet to the submission on the 4 t h 
of July? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  What justification did she give you for it each 
time? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Each time she said there are the BNP is not 
making profit.  There was a point where she said maybe I’m of the view 
that BNP is profiting for this.  BNP is not profiting, BNP is taking the 
cost filtering the cost from Grissag and they can’t incur losses because 
they are assisting a SAE.  So he said those are the direct cost that are 
10 
coming from Grissag AG. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi, we now know from the evidence of 
Mr van der Merwe that that is false, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  We were at the memorandum of incorporation 
because I wanted to probe with you what you knew in relation to this 
vote relative to what it would take to carry it.  And I directed you to 
page 152, that’s a part of the memorandum of incorporation that was 
operative at the time. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You’ll see just above the middle of that page it 
deals with 13.11.7 and its setting out there the votes that each director 
will have.  It reads that each director shall have one vote on a matter 
before the Board and say for otherwise provided in this MOI I a majority 
of the votes cast on a resolution is sufficient to support to approve that 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 261 of 266 
 
resolution.  Do you see that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes, I do. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So my question to you was, it’s relevant how 
many votes are cast because it’s the majority of the votes cast that will 
carry a resolution.  Do you see that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I see that now, Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Were you aware of that at the time? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No Chair, I was aware of the fact for the 
Board resolution to be approved or to go ahead, we have to get the 
majority and the majority would be 50 plus 1. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So out of a Board of five it would be three, 
correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair, yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  But you now see that was relevant was how 
many votes were cast, correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So if only three people vote for example the 
resolution will be approved if only two of those three approve it, 
correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Correct, that’s the understanding. 
20 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  So you didn’t seek clarity as to the position 
that the Board members would take on whether they’d abstain or vote, 
correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No, I said the sense that I got was from Ms 
Yakhe.  So in my calculation I was like me, it’s Mr Zwane and Yakhe.  
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 262 of 266 
 
So even if Dr Thambi goes the other way, it will not go ahead. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As it happened you didn’t vote though, did you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  At the time I was not aware that to abstaining 
does not count, Chair. 
ADV 
KATE 
HOFMEYR: 
 
But 
you 
did 
not 
vote 
against 
this 
recommendation to the Board, did you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  No, I did not I abstained. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Right.  And Dr Thambi abstained. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You made a correction to your statement 
10 
because in your statement you said that Ms Kwinana voted against it 
but you wanted to change it to the fact that she abstained.  Is that 
correct? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Correct, it was a typo. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  As I have it she did actually vote against it.  I 
can take you to that resolution if it’s necessary.  But because she voted 
against it and because Mr Zwane voted against it, Ms Myeni’s vote did 
not carry the day.   
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair, I was not aware that all along even 
through the internal disciplinary hearings, I think the company 
20 
secretary said she abstained. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  I’ll find you the resolution, we do have it in the- 
well, her vote on it.  But the force of the point Ms Nhantsi is that it’s 
only because Mr Zwane and Ms Kwinana voted against it that it did not 
carry.  You accept that? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 263 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you didn’t take a step to vote against it 
yourself? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Chair, as I’m saying at the point in time I 
calculated, my understanding at the time was we are five Board 
members and if three vote against it doesn’t go ahead.   
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Well, you didn’t have guarantees as to the 
other votes, did you? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I did not guarantees but I got a sense for Ms 
Kwinana. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Why not just vote against it Ms Nhantsi 
because then you would have had a definite one vote against. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes chair, this is the mistake that I made 
Chair.  As I’m saying at chances I were very busy because one of the 
other things that was keeping me awake at night was the liquidity crisis 
at SAA where I had to have engagement with the suppliers and 
negotiate with the suppliers because we didn’t have enough money to 
pay them and all that.  So I’m sure in that process and in that craziness 
if you allow me to say so, I then forgot to vote. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean to vote against? 
20 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  To vote against, Chair.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did you forget with the appreciation that voting 
against at that particular significance compared to abstaining or are 
you simply saying you didn’t appreciate whatever distinction there 
might be in terms of the effect of abstaining and voting against? 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 264 of 266 
 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  In fact sir, to be honest I though abstaining 
and voting against is the same way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would amount to the same thing. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Ms Nhantsi, let me just give you the record of 
Ms Kwinana’s decision.  You’ll find it in Ms Stimple’s bundle B, so it’s 
DD1B. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And you’ll find it at page 560. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I’m there Chair. 
10 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  You’ll see it’s an email from Ms Kwinana to 
amongst others the members of the Board including yourself and it 
reads, dear Madu(?), the cancellation fee should not have been 
included as part of the bid.  Sorry, should have been included as part of 
the bid and the amount being included as one of the factors to 
considering evaluation and adjudication and be compared with all other 
bids which may with this inclusion be cheaper.  In view of this I do not 
support this round-robin.  Do you see that? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  I see it Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Of course her reference to the fact that there 
20 
would have been comparison with the other bids is of course not 
correct, is it? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair because ... (intervenes) 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  There were no other bids. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes, this was confinement. 
18 JUNE 2019 – DAY 114 
 
Page 265 of 266 
 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  And if we go back one page to 559, you see Ms 
Myeni’s approval there. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Again, giving some credence to your 
assumptions about the drop in the cancelation fee amount because Ms 
Myeni’s email reads, dear Madu, does this need Board approval?  If so, 
I approve it.  Regards.  Do you accept that she is querying whether 
Board approval is require at all for a cancellation fee of less than 50 
million? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Yes Chair, and as i said I’m not surprised 
10 
because immediately after it went through the round-robin, she called 
me to say why is this going to the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As a matter of interest I see that in that email at 559, 
under her name is written Executive Chairperson.  Was she an 
Executive Chairperson? 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  Not to my knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought she was non Executive? 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  She was non Executive. 
MS PHUMEZA NHANTSI:  She was non actually, not to my knowledge.  
She was non Executive. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, but it’s written Executive Chairperson there.  
Okay alright. 
ADV KATE HOFMEYR:  Chair, we are at 6 o’clock, I only have two
