CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Ms Sindane 
during the year 199 – ag 2013 around May 2013 you were a Director 
General for the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development, 
is that correct? 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  How long did you remain in that position? 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Until March 2016. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And before you became the Director 
General for Justice where were you employed? 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  I was employed at Eskom. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Right.  You know the reason for your 
appearance here today is about the JCPS Report that you together with 
your colleagues compiled? 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you just tell the Chairperson quickly 
how did it come about that you had to investigate together with the 
other directors general? 
20 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Okay.  We were appointed 
by the Ministers of the JCPS cluster to undertake the investigation of 
what had transpired leading up to the landing of the Gupta chartered 
aircraft in Waterkloof Air Base.  This had arisen because there was a 
lot of public outrage arising from that landing and there were a number 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 4 of 130 
 
of issues that we raised as to how this happened and so it was felt that 
an investigation is needed.  The relevant Ministers of the JCPS cluster 
met and then they issued an instruction to us appointing us as the 
responsible team to do an investigation. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And how many were you who were tasked 
with this – with the responsibility to investigate? 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  There were four of us who 
were appointed.  It was Mr Dennis Dlomo who was the – working for 
SSA at the time and he was the Chairperson.  It was myself and I was 
working for the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development 
10 
at the time as the DG. It was Commissioner Moyane, Tom Moyane who 
was at the time working for the Department of Correctional Services 
and then it was Doctor Swemmer, Clint Swemmer he was the 
Coordinator for Intelligence.  He was co-opted into the committee. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.   What was your mandate?  You deal 
with it as terms of reference.  Could you just outline what those terms 
were? 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Thank you.  The mandate 
was just to determine the sequence of events as to how we ended up 
where we did.  So ultimately firstly it was to determine the sequence of 
20 
events prior to, during and after the landing of the chartered 
commercial aircraft at the Air Force Base Waterkloof.  Secondly to 
assess the actual events in the light of established legislation, 
regulations, government and departments held protocols.  Thirdly to 
interview and interact with relevant persons to establish facts and 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 5 of 130 
 
factor in investigations that were currently underway.  And then finally 
to make findings and recommendations to avoid – to avert similar 
occurrences in the future. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So naturally you would then have 
had to come up with a method as to how you were going to go about 
doing the investigations.  Could you just tell the Chairperson as to the 
method that you adopted in conducting the investigations? 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  There were two limitations 
that we started off with.  One is that the matter was already out there 
unfolding in the public space and that is the context.  And secondly we 
10 
were given just a little over a week to do this whole investigation of a 
whole event that even if some people were aware of it we in this task 
team were not aware of.  So to go back and establish all of that would 
take time we understood even as we started.  So we then sat around 
the table and we said by the way not all of us were present at the time.  
Mr Dlomo was travelling so he was not in the country so he was 
appointed in absentia but he was due to return either that day or the 
following day.  So what then transpired was we sat around the table 
and we said now that we have been appointed and now that we are 
facing very limited time lines how are we going to deliver on this 
20 
mandate?  Obviously the aviation sector is quite a complicated sector 
and it is not a sector that we are operating in or at least we were 
operating in at that point in time.  And there was a need therefore to 
get to understand the protocols associated with that as well as 
obviously the protocols in defence and the protocols in DIRCO.  We 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 6 of 130 
 
then realised that the team was very thin in terms of numbers as well.  
It just meant that you had four people to do all of this all at once in two 
weeks to get this work finalised.  We then agreed that we will do all the 
work together we will sit with people together, we will talk to them 
together, we will prepare documents together but initially because Mr 
Dlomo was not around I then – I undertook that I was going to do the 
writing, the inviting and of all the people that we had – we would 
identify obviously as the process unfolded but those that were easily 
identified we then started writing to them.  I took – and I undertook that 
process for two reasons.  One because of limited time we needed to 
10 
give people a reasonable opportunity to understand why you were 
calling them and a reasonable opportunity for them to make themselves 
available and to respond and or to send statements or whatever it is 
that they would ultimately conclude they wanted to do.  So I took that 
responsibility so that was a responsibility but it was not a formalised 
responsibility it was a responsibility that I said will do and in addition 
to everything else. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  That we were going to do.  
So part of how we were going to get this investigation to get rolling 
20 
there were a few things that we were going to do.  We were going to do 
other than letter writing we were going to do interviews of identified 
people.  We were going to talk to everyone.  We were going to read all 
the documents, protocols and everything that would have been in place.  
We will talk to committees that already were set up or some kind of 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 7 of 130 
 
investigations that were set up in different departments arising out of 
this landing of this Gupta chartered aircraft at the time.  Once we would 
have been done with that we would then sit and assess how much 
information we still needed after talking to everybody that we would 
have interviewed and if we needed more information we will interview 
people again and again until we were satisfied that we had the 
information.  Obviously this within the scope of the limited time that we 
had. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now if I may just refer you to – you 
have a bundle that is marked Exhibit FF1 in front of you which has your 
10 
statement.  I would like you to just identify the report because we are 
going to go to how you decided to split up the investigations into 
certain phases.  Could you turn to page – I beg your pardon. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No,  
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  I do apologise. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Norman did we enter this into the record, this 
exhibit? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh no – not yet, no, no not yet 
20 
Chairperson we have not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We should have is it not? 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes, yes.  Could you just 
CHAIRPERSON:  The file  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  FF1 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 8 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Containing Ms Nonkululeko SIndane’s statement will 
be marked Exhibit FF1. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  There is Chairperson pleases thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Then Ms SIndane if you could just take – 
there is a divider that is marked 2, number 2 and once you page on you 
will see number 5 begins with the JCPS Cluster Report. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you – and then that report goes 
right up to page – where is the last page – up to page 34.   
10 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Sorry you  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Do you identify? 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  You said up to page 34? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  34 yes. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Under divider 2? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  The reports I have goes up 
to page 30.  Oh you mean your …. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, no, yes, yes our… 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Not the page numbering. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes our pagination. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Okay I know. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is that correct? 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay and that is the report that came out 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 9 of 130 
 
of the investigations.   
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes it is 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.   Thank you I see in paragraph 
2.1 of that report you deal with the phases.  You decided to split the 
work into – you got the pre-arrival phase.  You have got the arrival 
phase and you deal with them.  Could you just tell the Chairperson how 
you dealt with those phases and who you interviewed? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well do you – do you not want her to identify the 
report first? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  She has just identified it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before going into it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  She has… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I did not hear that so it must..; 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, yes she has just identified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Sindane the document that you have been referred 
to which appears at page 5 at the top there under 2 what is that 
document? 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  It is the reports that was 
issued by the Ministers of the JCPS Cluster after being prepared by the 
task team. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the product of the work of the investigation 
team that you were part of? 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  I must have missed that Ms Norman. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes, yes thank you Chair.  
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 10 of 130 
 
Yes. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then you had referred her to particular – to a 
particular page? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes paragraph 2.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  At page 9.  You have got the pre-
arrival phase. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you just briefly outline what – what 
10 
you looked for in trying to get facts around that phase? 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  First we had to understand 
how the Waterkloof Air Base works and because unless we understood 
that we would not be able to get to whether there was any violation or 
otherwise.  The natural reaction would have been to go to the OR 
Tambo airport.  So to get to the Waterkloof Air Base was the first thing 
that we had to understand how does it work?   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  So that was the pre-arrival 
phase.  So is – if people – if any person wants to for instance apply to 
20 
come to South Africa and apply to land at Waterkloof Air Base what 
should they comply with?  So that was the first thing.  Now the 
Waterkloof Air Base as it was then I do not know whether it still is 
today but as it was then its responsibility was generally to receive for 
instance aircraft of – of Heads of States and Deputies – Deputy Heads 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 11 of 130 
 
of States as well as obviously defence top brass as it were.  Now to 
then have this aircraft landing there we had to understand how that 
works. Thank you so much.  How that unfolded.  So that was the first 
thing.  So obviously there are certain protocols that needed to be 
followed.  And one of those protocols was obviously to announce that 
request and that request is done formally through a note verbal which 
is done from an originating country into DIRCO in our country.  DIRCO 
is the Department of International Relations and Cooperation.  So that 
request goes to DIRCO and then DIRCO processes it and once DIRCO 
has processed they either say they approve or they do not approve.  So 
10 
we had to understand that.  Secondly we had to understand how things 
work at the Airforce Base itself in terms of the structures.  Does anyone 
have to be approached and if that person is to be approached who is 
that person, what kind of level are they in terms of seniority and what 
are they approached for?  What should they be doing?   Then the third 
issue was to look at – if the people are bringing something into the 
country as would be normally in the travelling guest what kind of 
customs and excise responsibilities would be imposed on Waterkloof 
Airbase in particular in receiving those guests?  And then what kind of 
clearances are needed and if those clearances are needed who must 
20 
apply for a clearance – who must give the clearance, under what 
circumstances the clearance must be given?  And then we also had to 
understand what then becomes the role of DIRCO other than just 
receiving a note verbal.  And once DIRCO has decided that this is an 
appropriate visit what does DIRCO do in terms mobilising and arranging 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 12 of 130 
 
with other departments to do?  What is necessary as per the 
categorisation of that visit?   And then obviously then looking at what – 
how were these guests going to be led out of the Waterkloof Air Base 
as it were?  So those were the key things perhaps that we had to focus 
on but for any visit in South Africa whether it happened privately or 
otherwise Home Affairs plays a very significant role.  So we needed to 
understand what role Home Affairs was expected to play, what role did 
they actually play in terms of identifying and discharging its role in 
relation specifically to the aircraft. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now in dealing with those phases 
10 
your pre-arrival, arrival, post-arrival and exit phase you would have to 
rely on information that you would have gathered.  So did you interview 
people or did you – did some of them submit affidavits?  How did you 
go about doing that? 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  We did both.  We 
interviewed people and indeed some gave affidavits but let me start by 
even before getting to interviewing people.  We had to read the 
protocols but maybe I do not know whether I am allowed to just step 
back a bit because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Because I think… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Step back and… 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  It does allow for some level 
of context to be understood in this commission.   Prior to the actual 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 13 of 130 
 
appointment of this task team there were already a number of meetings 
that were happening in government in National Government let me not 
say in government as if all government levels.  But in National 
Government there were a number of meetings already happening no list 
of which was the meeting by the government communication systems 
GCIS to try and respond to the flurry of the enquiry – enquiries that 
were arising as a result of this.  Secondly there were meetings that 
were being initiated by NICOC within the space of NICOC and NICOC is 
an agency under state security to deal with what had transpired.  So 
these meetings were already happening.  There were also meetings of 
10 
the – and these meetings would – would feed into the JCPS Cluster 
which I was chairing at the time.  So all of this then comes into context 
with how did we deal with these issues?  So two meetings then that I 
would like to focus on.  One it is the meeting of communicators 
because that meeting almost drove the urgency and the pressure with 
which this thing – this investigation had to be undertaken.  And of 
course Ministers were also meeting to try and understand what was 
going on at the time.  Secondly the NICOC was a meeting where a 
whole range of people, senior government personnel in the defence 
space in particular SAPS, Home Affairs and all of us including myself 
20 
we participated in that meeting but the convener was NICOC of that 
meeting.  And in this meeting it was really for the first time for me to 
understand the nature of what had happened and those meetings 
happened probably either on the 1 s t or the 2 n d of – the 1 s t or the 2 n d of 
May just as we were being appointed or just before we were being 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 14 of 130 
 
appointed.  So as a result of that – of these meetings a whole lot of 
information started flowing and we started understanding the magnitude 
of the problem that had just arisen and so when we then met and we 
were appointed that context was – was almost like a flow from the 
original work that had been done in these meetings or discussions that 
had been done in these meetings straight into what the investigation 
team was ultimately going to start investigating.  So that was the 
context that I just wanted to put before you.  So then to come back to 
your question as to how did we do this?  We identified people that we 
were going to invite to these sessions which is the discussion sessions 
10 
or the interview sessions.  And those people we started off with where 
the first discussion about the request to host this wedding started 
which would have been at OR Tambo therefore ACSA.  So we identified 
to speak with the CEO of ACSA and luckily the CEO of ACSA was quite 
responsive.  When he knew we wanted to speak to him he responded 
immediately so we then had a discussion with him and that discussion 
was telephonic.  The second person and I am not going to itemise all of 
the people that we identified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  But the second person that 
we identified we needed to speak with would have been the Minister of 
Transports at the time.  We did not invite him almost immediately but 
we identified him and we knew more or less what his movements were 
likely to be.  So when we did call him ultimately he made himself 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 15 of 130 
 
available and we literally drove to where he was and we interviewed 
him and that was the end of that.  And we requested for a statement, he 
also gave us a statement subsequently just to confirm our discussions.  
The other people that we identified would have been obviously the 
Gupta family.  It would have been a whole range of other people but 
key to those people would have been in [indistinct] Ambassador 
Koloane.  And why Ambassador Koloane because he is an official – was 
– I do not know whether he still is but he was the official responsible 
for this kind of work where international guests land in South Africa on 
a state visit kind of arrangement you would have had to apply and – to 
10 
him and he would have had to assess and then talk to the Department 
of Defence accordingly. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Just to take you a bit back.  You 
mentioned that you had to invite members of the Gupta family may I 
just – there is a bundle – a small bundle next to you which is marked 
Exhibit FF8.  Just – if you can just move your handbag it is just there.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it – I think it is the lever arch file on the… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The lever arch file, the small one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Other side of your bag.  Hm. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Sorry … 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  He is not educated. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  I do not know how this 
works. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  If you could – if you could FF8 
turn to page 44 please, 44.  Are you there? 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 16 of 130 
 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  If you turn over the page, 
page 45 that is – is that your signature on that page? 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That appears to be a letter that you wrote 
to Mr T Gupta. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Sorry I missed that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry that appears to be a letter that you 
wrote to Mr T Gupta. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And you asked for certain things for him – 
from him.  Can you just briefly state what you wanted from him which 
appears at page 46? 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Okay.  First maybe what 
would help  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Is to just itemise some of 
the things that we had requested which are contained in the letter. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  On the first page of that 
20 
letter under item 2, under paragraph 2 of the letter.  Because we had 
requested a sworn statement or an affidavit or an attestation all 
documents in his possession that he may have had.  A written 
chronology of events and of course whatever else that he could have 
been able to give us that would have been the theme in the main. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 17 of 130 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  But then specifically going 
to where you are requesting me to go for the pre-arrival phase we were 
requesting Mr Gupta to answer the following questions.   
1. In planning the wedding which government institutions urgencies 
and officials did they meaning the Gupta family or did he and any 
other member of the family approach and for what purpose and 
how often did you meaning them and any other member of the 
family approach officials. 
2. Was it intended that the services that you were requesting would 
10 
be paid for and then 
3. Did you request the usage of the blue light in your convey escort 
and then 
4. Did you make an approach to the Indian High Commission to 
assist in facilitating landing clearances at Waterkloof Air Base for 
your chartered aircraft Jet Airways? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So this approach was sort of a standard 
approach to all the persons that you were interested in you would write 
a letter to them, some of them and then you would give them a list of 
questions that you wanted them to answer.   
20 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:    Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    And I see at page 47 to 48 that is a 
response from Mr – appears to be a response from – it does not say 
from T Gupta but it says the Gupta family. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:    Yes.  But may I just 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 18 of 130 
 
clarify? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Not everyone who was 
invited to – who was identified to come and testify would have had to 
be written to because of the time pressures it was agreed that we could 
speak to the Directors General and identify people to be invited 
especially those that were coming from government.  So I just wanted 
to clarify that aspect. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC: Yes, alright. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  However even those – some 
10 
of them we were able to write to them. Those that we had identified 
early but if we had not identified them early then we would speak to the 
DG’s to facilitate.  I just wanted to clarify that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  And then – sorry you 
can put the file away now and you go back to – you can put FF8 away 
and then you can go back to the main FF1, Exhibit FF1.  You mentioned 
that – that you had to speak to Ambassador Koloane.  Did you speak to 
Ambassador Koloane? 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes we did. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  How did you invite him? 
20 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  He was invited through his 
Director General Ambassador Matjila at the time.  We had met with 
Ambassador Matjila in parts in the earlier meeting I spoke about. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  But we also had met with 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 19 of 130 
 
Ambassador Matjila in the actual session because we also had 
questions for him as the head of department responsible for… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then when you meet with Ambassador 
Koloane did you have standard questions set for him? 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And just tell the Chairperson about that 
process, how did you embark on that process? 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  When we – we met with 
10 
Ambassador Koloane it must have been on the – I cannot remember the 
exact the dates but I have it in my own notes.  But he was invited and 
the invite went to his DG and he then – we got confirmation that he was 
indeed going to come and indeed he did come and met with the team 
where we were stationed.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  And was that the only time you met 
with him on this matter or did he – did you subsequently have another 
meeting with him? 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  We met Ambassador 
Koloane twice.  We met him – can you give me just a few minutes to 
20 
find it? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  We met Ambassador 
Koloane on the 1 s t May which would have been prior to our appointment 
when we were meeting as that big meeting if you recall that I said 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 20 of 130 
 
earlier. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That you mentioned.  Yes. 
MS TERESSA NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  And so some of the 
information we got him – we got it from him through that process and 
then we – because we were all there in that meeting, but we had not 
formally been appointed.  The second meeting was the meeting that 
was most important because when we requested to meet with 
Ambassador Koloane it then turned out that he had been suspended or 
on some special leave and – and so we could not meet with him almost 
immediately. 
10 
So we met with him only on 16 May when we were final – 
when we were finalising the report because he – at some point he was 
in Durban and then he was here. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Then during this process … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  So does it – does that meant that you did 
not have a meeting with him between the date when you were appointed 
as a team and a date you submitted your report to the Ministers? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  We did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Yes.  Our reports were 
submitted on the 17 t h … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Of May. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 21 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  We met with him on the 16 t h 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Of May. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Then other than 
interviewing people did you have any other source of information that – 
that you obtained either from (indistinct) or from Waterkloof Air Force 
10 
Base like recordings?  Did you listen to any recordings and if so what 
sort of recordings were those? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE: 
 
We 
specifically 
on 
recordings yes we did listen to recordings.  There was a recording – I 
do not know whether it is standard protocol.  At this point let me say 
this.  That if it is information that is classified because I do not know 
whether it is or it is not.  I do not know what the Commission is going 
to do about that if I am breaching those classification rules. 
I saw in the document that you – you had already requested it 
and release … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Norman should know what the position is. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  No, just to highlight what recordings 
and without giving us the content. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 22 of 130 
 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  It – it was an audio 
recording and I could also set the context of the audio recording.  It 
was 
an 
audio 
recording 
of 
telephone 
conversations 
between 
Ambassador Koloane and Lieutenant Colonel Anderson … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  And Major General Ntshisi. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So those are the recordings you listened 
to? 
10 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So then - once then you were satisfied 
that you had made contact or at least interviewed everyone that you 
thought was - was necessary to interview or speak to then you about 
the certain – you wrote the report? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Yes but we – the writing of 
the report we – as we – as we did a section we would prepare some 
kind of notes on the pre arrival – some kind of notes … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  That will guide the final 
20 
writing of the report.  So yes after we had interviewed everyone we 
then finalised the – the report because you could almost say it was 
stage writing even though the full writing of the report would have been 
on the last day but the progressive write up would have been happening 
in that context yes. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 23 of 130 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Did you have any officials who 
refused to participate in that process and if – if there were can you just 
mention their names? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  There were no officials who 
refused outright.  There was an arrangement with Colonel Anderson.  
Actually I – I do apologise.  I am not very good with military titles but – 
so for the record I – I do not mean to be disrespectful … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Of her real title but … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  For the purposes of my 
response let me call her Colonel Anderson.  So for – we had made an 
arrangement for Colonel Anderson to talk to us.  We had been to 
Waterkloof Air Base on the one day to understand the layout and the 
set up and all of that.  So – however on the day that the team went to 
go and speak with her it may not have been the exact following day but 
the day that someone was – we as the team were supposed to go and 
speak with her. 
She was not available on that day but she did not refuse to 
20 
speak to the team as far as I am aware. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and do you know whether she 
subsequently met with any members of the team? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Not until the report was 
written. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 24 of 130 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  And then – so you wrote 
the report and I see at page 33 you had recommendations and I would 
like you to just take the Chairperson through those recommendations 
and – and your conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before she does that – in terms of the people 
who you interviewed that you regarded as quite important to – to 
interview 
for 
purposes 
of 
your 
investigation 
- 
I 
am 
sure 
Ambassador Koloane was one of them – would you just identify those 
who you regarded as important.  Say we did interview so and so and 
those who you regarded as important to interview for purposes of the – 
10 
of the investigation and those who circumstances might not have 
permitted you to interview them but whose evidence as important that 
maybe submitted affidavits. 
So it is not everybody that you interviewed or that submitted 
an affidavit that those that you regarded as important for the 
investigation. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Thank you.  Those who were 
absolutely necessary to be – to be interviewed would have first and 
foremost been Ambassador Koloane.  It would have been the Gupta 
family.  It would have been the Minister or Ministers who were 
20 
mentioned 
in 
the 
request 
and 
in 
the 
conversations 
between 
Ambassador Koloane and Colonel Anderson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The recorded conversation?  Are you referring to the 
recorded … 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Yes. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 25 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Conversation? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE: 
 
Yes 
and 
of 
course 
information that arose from other people we interviewed who confirmed 
certain discussions.  So – so in the main those would have been the 
three – it would have been the Presidency and the Presidency for two 
reasons.  One because there was an ongoing reference of – to number 
one or about number one and – and so we needed to know what was 
the story with the reference to number one. 
10 
So the rest of the people were important for us to understand 
as per the first aspect of the terms of reference to understand how the 
aircraft landed here.  So those I will not go through because they are 
clearly set out in the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do – I do think that one of those who you would 
have regarded as important is the one who would have had the 
authority to grant permission for the landing at Waterkloof? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Who was that?  Was that Ntshisi? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Yes.  Yes, I think it is Major 
20 
General Ntshisi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ntshisi? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Ntshisi, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and you did interview him? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Yes.  We did. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 26 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Could you – you 
mentioned the Presidency that you also had to approach the 
Presidency.  Did you actually interview the President – former 
President? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  No we did not.  We did 
speak to the Director-General in the Presidency and we did say the 
President’s name.  At least number one not his name in person but 
number one keeps being referred to.  We would like to know whether 
there is an opportunity to have a discussion with him and as far as the 
10 
DG then said is that I think the President was not around or something 
along those lines. 
I cannot remember the exact detail but what I do remember 
and – and what we do say in the report is that the DG was fully aware 
of what the issues were and he made himself available to respond to 
the issues and he then gave us a written statement to that effect. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and at page 33 then you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well - I am sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is – that is important.  You – you wanted to 
20 
interview the President because his name kept on or rather reference 
kept on being made to number one which you were made to understand 
was a reference to the President.  Is that right? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you did convey your request to the Director-
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 27 of 130 
 
General in the Presidency that you would like to interview the 
President? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  We – we conveyed what was 
coming out that the President’s – reference to number one was -0 was 
coming up and we would like to understand what that was about and the 
DG in the President – in the Presidency was quite clear that the 
President does not deal with those issues.  He does not grant those – 
those permissions and all of those things and – and as a result he as 
DG in the Presidency is happy to provide information which he did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  May I also … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  No continue. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  I do apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe what I wanted to ask is what you will deal with 
just now. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes continue. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Thank you so much.  May I 
also add and perhaps be very categorical about this because it is – it is 
– unless I clarify it – it leaves people wondering. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  With all the people we spoke 
to starting with Minister Ben Martins, Ambassador Koloane who were 
the two people allegedly who could have spoken to the President.  Both 
of them had said to us the President did not instruct them, give them 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 28 of 130 
 
any insinuation that he wanted them to facilitate this and therefore to 
insist on having to interview the President. 
Unless anyone of the two in particular perhaps I could add 
even the Minister of Defence at the time did not link the President to 
the landing of the aircraft.  Where the landing - where number one 
comes through it is in this telephonic conversations between 
Ambassador Koloane 
and 
– 
and 
I 
am 
going 
to 
say 
between 
Ambassador Koloane.  I would hope it is him but in the telephonic 
conversation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE: 
 
Between 
Ambassador Koloane and – and Colonel – Lieutenant Colonel Anderson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE: 
 
As 
well 
Lieutenant Colonel Anderson and Major General Ntshisi, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess the – the point you – the last point you were 
adding was that although you may have wished to interview the 
President the fact that Ambassador Koloane and Minister Ben Martins 
at the time all insisted that the President had not given them any 
instructions persuaded you not to insist? 
20 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That - that is the point you want to make? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  That is the point I am 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 29 of 130 
 
making, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay; but in terms of what the Director-General in the 
Presidency said - (coughing) – are – are you okay? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  (Coughing) – I will be.  I do 
apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  Okay, you must just tell – tell me if you 
want – you must tell me if you want us to adjourn … 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For a few minutes.  Okay. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  I will be fine.  Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Just repeat what the DG in the 
Presidency said.  You did say it.  I just want to understand it again. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Thank you.  The DG in the 
Presidency said – let me – let me step back a bit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  When we approached the 
DG in the Presidency we said one of the things that keeps coming up is 
number one.  We take it because it is generally understood that number 
one is the President.  So we would like to know whether the President 
has any responsibilities around the landing of the aircraft because I do 
20 
not want this thing to be under – to be misunderstood as if we were 
saying – we were asking whether the President authorised the landing 
of the aircraft. 
Our 
question 
was 
whether 
the 
President 
has 
any 
responsibilities in law or otherwise to authorise the landing of the 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 30 of 130 
 
aircraft whether it is the Gupta aircraft or any other aircraft in the 
Waterkloof Air Base.  So – so that was the context of our question, 
thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that distinction may be significant because you 
were not asking whether at a factual level the President had said 
anything to anybody or instructed anybody authorised anybody with or 
without powers to do so to do anything.  You were asking simply 
whether in terms of legislation or prescripts there is responsibility on 
the President with regard to the authorisation of the landing of the 
aircraft. 
10 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  That is – that is an important distinction. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Absolutely. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and you say the DG submitted 
a statement.  Did he submit an affidavit or just a statement? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  This is the part where my 
memory fails with me whether it was a – an affidavit or a statement but 
he did submit a document in writing.  I have – it is – it was in 2013 so I 
20 
cannot recall everything but I am sure that information is available in 
state security and – and we can check that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:   
CHAIRPERSON:  So just to clarify the point we have just dealt with.  
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 31 of 130 
 
So you did not ask the DG to establish whether the President had had 
any discussions with the people mentioned in – well with anybody who 
may have referred to number on in the conversation or whatever?  That 
you did not ask? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  No.  We … 
CHAIRPERSON:  About the (intervenes)? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  We did not ask that question 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  And let me – let me go 
10 
further and – and give the reasons why we did not ask that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  We did not ask that question 
because we ought to have been led … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  To the President directly … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  By someone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Not by people who are 
20 
talking about … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  But people who - we ought 
to have been led by as I indicated previously if Ambassador Koloane 
had said I was instructed by the President that would have led us … 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 32 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then you would have, yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  To the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  If Minister Martins had said 
I was instructed by the President … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  That would have led us … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then you would have, yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  To the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  So our view was what – 
what is the basis of us going to ask … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  The President on the basis 
of people who are just talking … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Between themselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Telephonically saying … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  The President – number one 
knows, number one instructed, number one has no problem.  That is not 
– I mean it is like listening to gossip somewhere and then going and 
asking someone who has been gossiped about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 33 of 130 
 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  So that was the context of 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Of the approach we took to 
say … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Let us look at officially what 
could the President do to sanction or authorise the landing.  If he has 
those powers perhaps we would have then spoken to him and said in 
discharging your powers Mr President … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  How did you do it but we did 
not get to that level of inquiry because it – the point of the discussion 
ended before we got to that level of inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you at any stage during the investigation aware 
of any contradictory statements with regard to anyone of the people 
who may have referred to number one in some other document or 
statement without disclosing what that source is or are you not aware 
of anything like that?  Were there was one version and there was 
another and by the same person. 
20 
I am not able to speak more freely because you – you – ja 
because some of the things I do not know if they – what there status is. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Okay.  I am going to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is – it is difficult. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  I am going to assume that I 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 34 of 130 
 
understand the question and therefore be able to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  To answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  So forgive me if I do not 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no I understand that it might not be clear, ja. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Yes.  I would request that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  It be asked again. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  But on – on the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe – or maybe this might help.  Any of the 
important witnesses – important people who you identified as important 
in your investigation were – were there any of those who may be made 
conflicting statements?  Not all in writing maybe.  One in writing and 
maybe another not really in writing? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Okay.  I - conflicting maybe 
would be taking it too far. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe inconsistent rather than conflicting? 
20 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Yes maybe a variation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or not completely, ja variation yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Variation of facts yes. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 35 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  There were definitely a 
variation of facts … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  From time to time and I – I 
will wish to articulate those variations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we – I think we understand each other. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Thank you very much.  I 
10 
would wish to – to try and articulate those variations of what would 
otherwise be statement of facts.  This wording part – I do not know 
whether wording is a party but anyway – this wording part originally in 
February when the first encounter with South Africa happened it was a 
wedding. 
Where the variation of facts start from this thing being a 
wedding to this thing being a delegation to this thing being likely to be 
attended – not likely - will be attended by four Heads of State and then 
later by Senior Ministers and Government and then later it is – it is a 
delegation as opposed to a wedding.  So – so this thing was very 
20 
woolly in – in its real nature. 
So – so if – if that is the question yes indeed.  We did 
encounter that and – and that was encountered whether through formal 
discussions with Ambassador Koloane or through listening to the 
recordings or through talking to other people we interviewed at the 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 36 of 130 
 
Waterkloof Air Base or – but in particular through listening to those 
recordings absolutely yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No thank you. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we understood each other. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You may proceed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank - thank you Mr Chairman.  Maybe 
because you have just mentioned something which just alerted me to 
what you mentioned in consultation are you aware that there were 
10 
Ministers who were invited to the wedding? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Yes I am aware. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and (intervenes). 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  You mean South African 
Ministers? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  South African Ministers. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Yes I am aware. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you just tell the Chairperson as to 
20 
whether you know that there was any decision because Mr Ben Martins 
mentioned that it was decided that the Ministers were discouraged 
actually to – from attending the wedding.  Are you aware of that 
meeting and how it happened that there was such a meeting and a 
decision taken in that regard? 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 37 of 130 
 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  It would have been either on 
1 May – excuse me – or on the – actually I think it was on 1 May.  If I 
am mistaken about that I – I apologise but the 1 s t or 2 May.  The 
meeting that I referred to earlier when I started the NICOC Meeting … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Where all of us attended.  
This meeting was a NICOC Meeting but was attended by all JCPS 
Cluster Departments and for the purposes of this session let me just – I 
am not going to itemise all the JCPS Cluster Departments … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  But I am going to itemise a 
few that are directly relevant.  In the JCPS Cluster – I will come back 
to the question … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  If you do not mind. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  In the JCPS Cluster is the 
Department of Justice.  It is the Department of State Security.  It is the 
Department of Defence, Police, Home Affairs, DIRCO and then – oh and 
SARS – specifically SARS and then there are many others that play a 
20 
supportive role.  So the Ministers of the JCPS Cluster would – would 
talk regularly on issues of security and therefore the DGs will talk 
regularly but the core line function is that of – of state security which is 
– which is delivered under NICOC. 
Now in terms of that NICOC would have convened this 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 38 of 130 
 
meeting as their line function as responsible for state security and – 
but in inviting this meeting they then extended it to members of the 
JCPS Clusters – Cluster which is why I was there present in that 
meeting.  In the meeting many things were discussed.  In fact if you do 
not mind I want to just try and get to it.  So now I must go to your own 
referencing for the purposes of your document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you tell her what you are looking for she might 
assist you. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  I am almost there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  DCJ.  On page 17 – no on 
page 21 of your reference. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh, okay.  That is EXHIBIT 1 – FF1. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Is it 21?  Just bear with me. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Almost there.  Okay.  It is on 
NS20. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright, page 20. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Okay.  So on NS20 these 
were the decisions that were taken by the – by that meeting that broad 
meeting.  It was – it was quite a big meeting.  That the 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 39 of 130 
 
Directors-General should advice their Ministers against attending this 
wedding in Sun City.  It was almost common cause that most Ministers 
– I – I would not say all of them but most Ministers and in particular 
most Senior Ministers had been invited to this wedding. 
So we – the conclusions of that meeting was to encourage 
Ministers not to attend the wedding especially given the environment 
that had just unfolded. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
10 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  There were many other 
decisions that were taken at that meeting and I do not know whether 
you would wish me to deal with all of them or you wanted just that one. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No I wanted just that one because it is 
relevant to – to what we are dealing with.  Could you then turn to the 
page where having gathered now all the facts and the information, 
having drafted the report then you reached a point where you said now 
we can make recommendations and could you just take us through 
those and that would be on …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you not want her to deal with the findings they 
20 
made before the recommendations? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh, beg your pardon.  Yes at page 28 – 
page 28 the findings.  Could you just deal with those?  Thank you.  
Paragraph 4. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Okay. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 40 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You could just summarise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not need to read all of this or to mention all of 
them because the report is there … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are able to read it but you can highlight those 
findings that you believe are important among the findings that you 
made. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:  Okay.  Thank you.  The 
findings that we made were as follows:  of course the airports company 
10 
was correct in not yielding to the request of the Gupta family. 
That if and when the Gupta realised that going through a relationship 
issue in other words going and talking to the Minister and saying 
number one knows it and those kinds of things did not work they then 
opted to use a formal process which would have required a note verbal 
and all of that and we found that there was no formal note verbal and it 
is confirmed and it was confirmed at the time by the people who would 
have otherwise have dealt with the note verbal if they had received it. 
That there was no note verbal that was received. So that was the first 
finding that we made. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Again, again just on the note verbal. I think you did 
say and other witnesses said I think yesterday that was a requirement 
that had to be received. It had to be received by Waterkloof from Derco 
or Department of Defence from Derco? 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  No. A note verbal would have been 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 41 of 130 
 
initiated by a requesting country. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes to Derco? 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  In this particular case it would have 
been India. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Requesting South Africa to allow the 
delegation landing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Generally a note verbal would not be 
for private matters. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  It would be for public. 
CHAIRPERSON:  State. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Or official if I may call it that official 
trips or arrangements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  And therefore if that, if this was 
regarded as a formal official State visit, it would have required a note 
verbal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that would come from the foreign government, 
20 
India in this case. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Into Derco. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it would be directed to Derco? 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. Thank you. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 42 of 130 
 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Alright, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that was not there? That was one of your findings? 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes, definitely it wasn’t there and it 
even the India High Commission confirmed that it was not done. They 
said it was an oversight. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you? No, you were still going to deal with other 
findings that you regard as important. Did you get to understand about 
how long before the arrival of an aircraft that will be caring Head of 
State or Deputy Head of State, would note verbal be sent? Did you get 
an idea what the practice is? I would have imagined that it should come 
10 
quite well in advance normally. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  I am not responding from this 
investigation necessarily. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  But when a country is invited or a 
request is being made to the country for something to happen, is given 
quite in advance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  And so, and these are not the timelines 
from the protocols. I cannot recall what the timelines were. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  But I would imagine it would be a 
period longer than three months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. Yes, and I would imagine that somebody at 
Derco who normally deals with that if he was made to understand or 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 43 of 130 
 
she was made to understand that there was a State visit, that must be 
the first thing he or she would be looking for before doing anything 
else. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Absolutely. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  So that would have been the first issue 
that we found. The second, we went through the approval processes as 
I had indicated the protocols and all of that. In no area in the relevant 
10 
protocols defined space for Ministers to approve or sanction the 
landing of an aircraft. It’s purely a formal process that is undertaken by 
officials to allow for the landing of the aircraft because they would have 
looked at what is required for the aircraft; I mean what is required for a 
delegation and then they will give the necessary approval and that 
responsibility fell under the portfolio whose owner was at that time 
Ambassador Ramfolo, sorry Ambassador Kholoane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  The third issue was obviously, the 
correct clearances only in so far as the military base we found 
20 
clearances but I don’t want these clearances to be confused with the 
foreign operator’s permits because the foreign operator’s permit was 
not there but the foreign operators permit would have applied if this 
aircraft would have landed at OR Tambo. In the Waterkloof airbase what 
was relevant would have been the approvals that Major General Ntshisi 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 44 of 130 
 
would have had to sign off and then the aircraft would be able to land. 
Obviously he wouldn’t do that out of context. He would receive 
information from Derco. He would use that information to then approve 
the landing and from our investigations and our discussions with Major 
General Ntshisi what we discovered was that he was quite a prudent 
person. He asked several questions that were relevant as to why is the 
wording party. We are not allowed to make the wording party land here 
and this is an official business and I mean this is an area where only 
official business of government and official delegations of government 
would land and many other things that he said. So we found him to be 
10 
very robust in how ultimately discharges use responsibility but I guess 
with the persuasion from, I don’t know whether I would say he seniors 
or otherwise he ultimately granted the necessary clearances. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  We also found that not only was the 
aircraft that landed was given permission to land but there were other 
supporting aircraft, the fixed wings and helicopters that were also 
allowed to land at the airbase. And which would ordinarily not be 
normal but it was done. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Excuse me Mr Chairman, I see the time is 
20 
quarter past. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I was also looking but maybe let her finish the 
important; mentioning the important findings and then we will take the 
tea break. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  As Chair pleases. Thank you. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 45 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, continue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  I am not going to cover all of them. 
Then in that case but. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, only those that you think are important to 
articulate. Otherwise we have got the report. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those that you think are important to articulate. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Still free to articulate them. 
10 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Okay. Perhaps the other finding that 
you will not see in the reports it’s because at the time it was felt that it 
would be sensitive because it would impact on diplomatic relations and 
that would have been the role that was played by the High Commission, 
the Indian High Commission. I wish not to speak at length because I’m 
not advised on how I deal with those issues here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, hm. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Only, the only thing I would like to say 
is that we did find that some of the actions of the High Commission 
were consistent with the willingness of how this trip or wording party 
20 
was defined from time to time depending on the circumstances. Thank 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I will put this question and you can indicate whether 
you feel comfortable to respond to it. Did the picture that emerged from 
your investigation suggests that either the High Commissioner or 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 46 of 130 
 
somebody or some people within that office may have facilitated the, or 
may have done things not in the way that was expected of them in 
regard to the process for that ended up in the landing of this aircraft at 
Waterkloof? You can indicate if the question is one that you would 
rather deal with after getting advised 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Okay. To the extent that this was a 
wording, pure wording. The diplomatic pleasantries that were being 
requested were not consistent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  With what would ordinarily be 
10 
requested. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  If I may leave it at that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no thank you. Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. Maybe you might want to 
highlight what you found in paragraph 4.8 at page 29. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  We found that Ambassador Kholoane 
and Lieutenant Colonel Anderson in facilitating this landing ignored the 
whole range of things that they knew needed to exist before this 
landing was permissible. We found that. And we also found that they 
20 
were aware maybe not so much Anderson as much as Ambassador 
Kholoane and I will clarify briefly. The fact that this was so hooley 
being a delegation and, and, and is one classical example that tells us 
that there was something amiss in this whole process. Secondly, in the 
recordings that we had access to the conversations between the two 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 47 of 130 
 
and the conversations between Anderson and Ntshisi clearly indicate 
what ought to have happened in terms of what kind of landing; what 
kind of permission would have had to be given. No, no retract. Would 
permission have been given if this was just a pure wording? The 
answer is no and Ntshisi makes it very clear that the answer is no. And 
therefore, and they knew it. Which is why they would then gravitate 
from VVIP; there are Ministers, there are Presidents and all of those 
things. So there was serious knowledge of what was going on. What I 
certainly personally can’t say with sufficient confidence because I 
didn’t speak to Colonel Anderson, would be whether this relationship of 
10 
common knowledge was equal between the two parties. That I can’t 
say. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the position that the team or yourself were quite 
clear that for example in the case of Ambassador Kholoane he knew 
exactly what the nature, true nature of this trip was but misrepresented 
to other people what it was. Was that either one of the findings you 
made or if you didn’t make was that a view you came to quite clearly? 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. You might also want to refer to 
paragraph 4.13 at page 30. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Sorry four point? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  4.13, four point 13 at page 30. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 48 of 130 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, could you just tell the chairperson; 
summarize what you found there in that paragraph. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  So what we found was that obviously 
the Chief of State protocol was working very closely with Colonel 
Anderson, Lieutenant Colonel Anderson in facilitating this. And in 
calling Major General or Sergeant General; Sergeant Major Ntshisi to 
get the necessary approvals done basically. So what we found was the 
really did more than what they were required to do to ensure that this 
10 
landing happened. Almost going so far as ignoring the rules that and 
the protocols that are put there for this thing to happen.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. And you also found in 4.15 that there 
was somewhat abuse of higher office. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes, there was as I indicated earlier 
that there were references to the presi – well number one let me not 
say the president. Number one, number one, number one. And we say 
this was abuse because at least not so much for Anderson but at least 
for Ambassador Kholoane. We interviewed him and he denied having 
been instructed but, by number one. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was Colonel Anderson male or was female? 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Female. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Female. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you say, you interviewed Ambassador Kholoane? 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 49 of 130 
 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he denied?  
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Having been instructed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By? 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  By the president. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Sorry I lost the question. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You were dealing with the abuse of higher 
10 
office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  So, yes thank you very much. So what 
we found was that this reference to number one knows the Minister is 
okay with it meaning the Minister of Defence is okay with it, the 
Minister of Transport has been instructed by number one, excuse me. 
When we interviewed the Minister of Transport and through his own 
statement he clearly said number one did not instruct. When we 
interviewed unfortunately, Minister Mapisa Nqakula at that time was not 
available but her advisor Mr Rama – oh I can’t remember what his name 
20 
was. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Ramakgoba 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes. He was very forthcoming with 
information and participated fully and give us all the information and we 
were satisfied that Minister Mapisa Nqakula who was the Minister of 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 50 of 130 
 
Defence at that time did not authorize this landing; did not want 
anything to do with it and as a result this assertion that they were okay 
with it was not true. So they were using the power of the office of the 
Minister to say the Minister is okay so that this thing can happen so 
that the junior officials can make it happen. The Minister of transport 
has been instructed by the President so that the junior officials can 
kind of get a picture that there was activity high up the letter and 
therefore they needed to do something. And so we felt that was abusing 
the position almost the positions of power of these people that I have 
identified. At least specifically in relation to the three; Minister Mapisa 
10 
Nqakula. Minister Ben Martins and the President. Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And your understanding was that the statements that 
number one or the President knew this or had given instructions and 
that Minister Mapisa Nqakula had authorized this, you concluded; did 
you conclude that they were made by somebody who knew that that was 
not the case? 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you, chair. And then you make, we 
20 
made a finding, sorry again at paragraph 4.22. I would like to make 
reference to that please. That is at page 32. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  You said four? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  4.22. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Hm. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 51 of 130 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, could you just highlight that because 
it is relevant for our purposes? 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Okay. I had indicated earlier that there 
are a number of paragraphs that had been there other than the main 
commercial aircraft and none of these aircrafts were funded by SAND 
and SABS as far as we could find in the information that we were given 
but they were definitely there at the Waterkloof airbase. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. And you say that they were funded by 
the Gupta family? 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In that funding? 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then you also deal with the BMWs that 
were used in the convoy. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, what do you say about them there? 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  They were, all the vehicles other than 
of course the police vehicles that would have gone through the normal 
joints operation, all the vehicles were funded; were privately funded by 
the Gupta family. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Right. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see also in page 33 paragraph 4.24 that you made 
this funding, that it was commendable notwithstanding the manipulation 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 52 of 130 
 
by a few public servants in the affected government departments and 
structures raised concerns without fear, favour or prejudice. Some of 
them repeatedly as to what was transpiring. However, their concerns 
were neither addressed nor acted upon by those in positions of 
authority over them bent on manipulating the system. You confirm that 
is one of your findings? 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes, and it is in the context that I had 
indicated where in particular Ntshisi, again I can’t remember the title. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, Ntshisi, ja. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes, had said we are not allowed to do 
10 
this. The rules do not allow us to do this and the responses and this is 
true the recorded conversation, the audio conversation that he was told 
he doesn’t matter the reason. If Derco approves we can do it. Now a 
Department of Defence as far as I understand having worked for 
government has its own protocols and the Department of Derco has its 
own protocols. So you have to first stick with it your own protocols. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Before you can take instructions from 
an external department even if the working relationship is tight. First 
you are guided by your own protocols first and foremost. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. Then if those are the important 
findings but I don’t know if you have any then we can take a break and 
then when we come back then she can deal with recommendations and 
any other matters that she might consider important. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 53 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But on findings is there anything you still? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, no I think she has highlighted most, 
all of those that are quite critical. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Sindane, on findings done in terms of the 
important ones you wanted to, you would like to highlight? If there is 
any that you haven’t, you can just you can mention it or we can start 
with it when we come back from tea. 
MS NONKULULEKO SINDANE:  Yes, I think I’m done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. We will take the tea adjournment and we will 
resume at 11:45. We adjourn. 
10 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let’s proceed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Ms Sindane 
could you then deal with the recommendations at page 33. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:   Thank you very much.  The 
first recommendation was that ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry before you start on the recommendations; it 
is quite clear from what you have said and from the report that 
whatever process or procedure was applied to try and legitimise the 
20 
landing of this aircraft, those processes were not applicable to it and it 
should never have been authorised, is that correct? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    Yes that was our finding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes because it did not meet the requirements for an 
aircraft to qualify to land at Waterkloof. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 54 of 130 
 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Okay, 
yes 
you 
can 
then 
deal 
with 
the 
recommendations 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    Okay because there were 
many 
investigations 
that 
were 
happening 
concurrently, 
we 
recommended that those investigations be finalised soonest and that 
action be taken against any and all of the people who may have 
contravened with the legislation, internal protocols and all of that in 
relation to this landing and if there were any matters of a criminal 
10 
nature that those also be dealt with.  On the issue of the Waterkloof air 
base, it being a national key point, I mean it had been in the media a 
lot at that point where people were thinking that the Waterkloof is a 
national key point at that time, it was not. I think it is still not a national 
key point but it’s a strategic defence installation and because of that, 
we recommended that it stay as such because it plays a very specific 
role for the Defence Department but it also plays a very specific role 
for the heads of state and we recommended that it be kept as such and 
then this might sound like a very light recommendation, 5.3 and may I 
spend just a minute or two on it.  We recommended here that the public 
20 
service must do something to deal with this issue of name dropping 
because it is dangerous for government and for the country we were in 
this embarrassing situation precisely because people use people’s 
names, titles to achieve objectives that would otherwise not be possible 
to achieve if it is not because of the – not because of the name that is 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 55 of 130 
 
being used.  In this particular case we were specific, we were referring 
to the use of the name of Minister Ben Martins as being okay with this, 
the use of the name of the Minister of Defence being okay with this, the 
use of number one knowing about this because – and this I need to 
explain.  In the public sector and in particular government, people use 
Minister’s names, DG’s names a lot and a lot of damage happens and if 
this is not attended to, it may sound, for an ordinary person who is not 
in government may not understand the implications but for – there were 
people who did something wrong because they genuinely believed that 
either number one was okay with this either the Ministers were okay 
10 
with this and they acted, genuinely believing that to be true.  Now this 
does not end here in this investigation it may come up in other 
investigations because these things happened all the time in 
government and that is why we were recommending – and we felt if it’s 
not addressed it will continue and ultimately we will be embarrassed as 
a country and so that was the third…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let’s talk about that just a little bit.  When I read 
that recommendation I wasn’t sure whether labelling this conduct as 
what happened here seemed to have happened here in terms of the 
evidence that was presented to you was name dropping in the – was 
20 
name dropping in the sense at least in which I understand name 
dropping, you know.  The impression I get when I read your report, and 
I think that also comes through in your evidence is that certain people 
who knew what the true facts were deliberately misrepresented facts.  
Now I’m not sure that that’s name dropping, maybe it is, my 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 56 of 130 
 
understanding of name dropping is something along these lines but I 
can’t say it’s the only case of name dropping is that if I talk to you, 
maybe I need something, I just find a way of making sure that you know 
that I know so and so and maybe we are close, that I know, if you know 
– I know that person and we are close that might change your view as 
to my request or the way you will look at me is going to be different 
from the way you were looking at me before you knew of my 
relationship with so and so.  Now maybe it does fall within but as I 
understand here, somebody, from your evidence, I think it’s - you have 
made it quite clear that on the – your investigations revealed that 
10 
Ambassador Koloane at least on his version, that he told you, he had 
said, as I understand, he had said that number one knew about this, he 
had said that number one had instructed Minister Ben Martins, he had 
said Minister Mapisa-Nqakula authorised or something to that effect but 
what emerged is that he knew, at least what he told to you was that, 
that was not the case.  So if he accepted that he had made those 
statements and then he then said to you, I actually wasn’t telling the 
truth in saying that number one knew about it and that number one had 
instructed Minister Ben Martins and whatever else, then it would seem 
to have been a deliberate misrepresentation of facts which under the 
20 
public service ought to and can be dealt with in terms of discipline in a 
serious way.  So I’m just mentioning this, I don’t know whether you 
would say, it’s still name dropping or – maybe what you were sensing 
when you say people might think it’s a minor recommendation, maybe it 
reflects what, the impression I also got that it’s name dropping but I am 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 57 of 130 
 
saying 
it’s 
misrepresentation 
of 
facts 
knowing 
that 
you 
are 
misrepresenting them and using the names of people in high authority 
in that situation where you know you shouldn’t be doing that.  That was 
my impression, so I don’t know if you have got any comments but as I 
say it may be that it is name dropping, yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    Okay thank you very much, 
I think the Chairs reading is correct but I think I would like to add the 
reading – your interpretation absolutely honourable Judge, Deputy 
Chief Justice, is quite correct what first there must be facts to be 
misrepresented, in this particular case the facts are not borne out by 
10 
any of the evidence we found, in other words there were no facts 
whether the number one knew about this or at least sanctioned it or 
instructed anybody, there were no facts neither were there facts that 
Minister of Defence was okay with this, neither were facts whether the 
then Minister of Transport had been instructed.  So you can’t even 
misrepresent that because there were no facts as a starting point but I 
agree…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well look at it this way from the point of view from 
Ambassador Koloane, from what he told you and from what emerged 
from the evidence, he did not know and was not aware of any fact that 
20 
number one had instructed Minister Ben Martins in regard to this issue 
and he did not know that Minister Mapisa-Nqakula had authorised this 
landing, 
at 
least 
from 
what 
emerged 
in 
your 
investigation.  
Nevertheless, he misrepresented his knowledge, he represented that he 
knew that these facts existed, you understand? 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 58 of 130 
 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    I agree let me therefore go 
back to name dropping I think the summation as presented from the 
Chair is a correct one in terms of name dropping but we were saying 
something probably we were poorer for words, but this is what we 
meant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also you had to do all of this in a very short time. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I take it you were still having your other normal 
10 
responsibilities as DG’s of various departments. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    Yes, so – yes I agree but I 
just want to clarify this, because it is true that certain officials at a 
particular level will act in a particular way if you say either the Minister 
is aware or the Minister desires this or that and this is what we are 
saying.  Perhaps it may not be an accurate formulation that we chose at 
the time but this is what we were communicating, we were 
communicating then and we are communicating through these reports 
as a public document, that if this is not addressed, where people can 
just use people’s names, because sometimes they use your name and 
20 
you end up in trouble because – let me use a particular example.  If 
someone, and I was a DG at the time, went to another and said the DG 
said appoint somebody, a junior official, if there was an interview 
process would think that I want that person appointed and so 
sometimes you can be in trouble for things you had nothing to do with 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 59 of 130 
 
and that is very common and that’s the point we were making.  That if it 
is not addressed, it puts people in trouble, it makes innocent people act 
wrongly simply because they believe authority wants this – these things 
to be done and that’s the context of that recommendation we were 
making, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I understand that but you – I take it that you may 
have wanted something specific because it’s not as if, people who do 
that can’t be dealt with in terms of what exists because if you are DG 
and some director goes to somebody at the Department and says, the 
DG said this is what must be done, when you didn’t say that, that’s a 
10 
false statement and if that person knows that you didn’t say that, it’s 
dishonesty, there are ways of dealing with that. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    Agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I take it that you might have wanted something 
specific to name dropping but not because this kind of conduct cannot 
be dealt with within the existing framework. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:   I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you, and maybe is that – just 
following up on the Chair’s last question, is that the reason why you 
20 
recommended, in addition, if we just deal with that page 34 as to how 
you wanted this whole issue of name dropping – how you wanted it to 
be dealt with.  The sentence begins with, “in addition”. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    Yes we wanted it to be 
specified because we felt that – misconduct is a very broad category of 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 60 of 130 
 
offences and you want to narrow some of those offences to something 
specific because if you narrow it to something specific then people will 
– people’s attention will be brought to – specifically to this to say, if I 
do this, it in itself is now an offence or under public service rather than 
putting it under a generic category of misconduct which already exists 
and of course perhaps we said this because what we saw, we felt it 
could never have happened had senior names not have been used, 
maybe it could have, I don’t know but we thought at the time, it could 
never have happened if senior names had not been used. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you, thank you Chair and then you 
10 
have your conclusions in chapter six, can you just summarise what you 
concluded? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    Our conclusion was as 
guidance has been given from the Chair, was that in this particular 
transaction or in this particular – I don’t know if it was a transaction but 
in this particular event, I withdraw transaction in this particular event 
there was lack of professionalism in how people dealt with their 
responsibilities and what we were encouraging people to do is to deal 
with these issues and report them where, for instance, if things like 
these happen.  So – because otherwise if people have to endure undue 
20 
influence they are not able to do their work objectively so that was the 
point that we were trying to make in that statement and we then 
concluded, perhaps that some the behaviours that were displayed 
during this whole process could almost be  unethical, could almost be 
lack of professional – ascribed to lack of professionalism or if not, then 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 61 of 130 
 
I would even argue it was  outright reckless in how this was undertaken 
but we also noted that sometimes the public, when the public is 
outraged by something and as having been a senior official in 
government for many, many years, sometimes we’re like, oh my God, 
but the reality of the matter is that unless or public is enraged enough, 
nothing happens and it was good in a bad way that the public was so 
enraged about this thing and because of that action was taken and I am 
not – please let  me be understood correctly, I am not talking about 
action, disciplinaries everywhere because I would not know whether 
that was taken or not, our interaction with this work ended when we 
10 
said here’s the report, it’s now yours, you do what you have to do and 
we moved out of it, it’s no longer our report as it is as it sits here and 
then also we – and this – and I read in the media, subsequent to this 
report that people were making very light of the fact that  there are 
indeed good hardworking honest and dedicated officials in government 
and in this particular case we picked that up so clearly, it was so 
unequivocal that there were people who were asking the right questions 
but I think, either because of the rush of the moment and I don’t want 
to assume, because this we did not find, we did not find anything that 
was of a direct personal benefit to any of the two people, we did not 
20 
find that and we are not making any assumptions express or otherwise 
that they did get any direct  benefit, we are not making that finding but 
we are saying how the other officials dealt with this is, in our view, very 
acceptable in the fact that they raised questions, they kept on raising 
questions and how the people who were making this landing to happen 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 62 of 130 
 
were doing it.  They were either pressured by things we don’t know 
because they never told us but that pressure may have been too much 
for them but unless they share or unless they shared at the time with 
the task team what the pressure was and the source of the pressure 
was, we do not understand how, and we couldn’t understand it then how 
they could have formulated, there’s a wedding, there’s a delegation, 
there are heads of states, there are Ministers and then it turns out 
there’s no Ministers, there are no heads of state it’s some MC’s, how 
did that happen. What was the source of the pressure and unless, they 
themselves told us that this was the pressure point and that is why we 
10 
probably in a willing kind of way formulated to end up the way that it 
did. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you, you’ve mentioned the public 
outrage but did this incident on its own, rattle government at all, you 
were there you would have seen and maybe have experienced it as a 
senior official at the time? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    Absolutely government was 
rattled to a point that I hadn’t seen in my experience in government 
until that point.  Other things that are big would be major disasters and 
all of that, I’m not comparing this to that, absolutely by any means, but 
20 
government was so rattle by this thing, I had never been in meetings 
where there were so many senior officials of government in one 
meeting or the other for like, hours on end discussing one thing.  So I 
think government was very rattled.  Did we learn something out of this?  
I probably would say, we could have learnt something if action was 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 63 of 130 
 
taken, I don’t know what action was taken as I sit here and therefore I 
don’t know whether we learnt enough to prevent this thing from 
recurring into the future. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you and then when you 
concluded in your report who did you hand it to? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    To the principles that had 
appointed us who would be the JCPS cluster Minsters. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes is it correct that it was published on 
the website? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    It was published on the 
10 
same day and I think a hard copy was also delivered to the Public 
Protectors office. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and from the time you had written this 
report, were you ever made aware of any person bringing applications 
to it, set aside or reviewed or any action against it? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    I was not aware of any 
application setting the report aside, I was, however, aware that – I 
really want to cite it correctly this time, Lieutenant Colonel Anderson 
had raised issues, now I don’t know whether she went to Court 
necessarily because I don’t know how she raised those issues, I do 
20 
know that she went to the Public Protector at that time. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you, and you’re satisfied, you’re 
happy 
with 
the 
report 
and 
you 
stand 
by 
your 
findings 
and 
recommendations in it? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    Absolutely. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 64 of 130 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You didn’t interview Colonel Anderson or did you? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why not? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:     We – there was an 
arrangement, maybe to explain this, we went to the air base on, say 
day 1 or whatever the day was, we went on the air base just to see, 
almost like an in loco just to see what was going on, the layout and all 
of that and once we had done that we identified people that we wanted 
to speak to, they were organised for us to speak to them. I think 
10 
subsequent to that we went again and we discussed with a whole range 
of officials at the air base and then we – there was a follow-up meeting 
to meet with Lieutenant Colonel Anderson and I wasn’t going to be 
there on that day but I was advised by the three members of the team 
who went there to interview her, that she was not available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Until you finished the investigation? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, former Minister Ramatlhodi gave evidence 
earlier this year here and in his evidence he touched on the issue of 
the landing of the aircraft at Waterkloof, I don’t want to put words into 
20 
his mouth, but my understanding of his feeling about this incident was 
something along the lines that it shocked him and he referred to what it 
said to people like him who had even gone out of the country to fight 
for freedom and my understanding was that he was expressing the 
sentiment that this brought shame to some of us to have a private, you 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 65 of 130 
 
know, a commercial plane landing at such a strategical important base 
in our country and he seemed really to find the whole incident quite 
shocking and I put my own words, like something that we maybe as a 
country should see as something that brought national shame, you 
know, I’m just using my own words based on what I understood him to 
be saying.  Having conducted this investigation, and heard from 
different people how it came about, are you able to describe what your 
own feeling was about this incident once you had gathered all the 
information that you had gathered, how would you describe it? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    That’s a big question. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to have an understanding of how bad you 
or your committee thought it was, you might not be able to speak for 
others in the committee but for yourself, once the picture emerged 
through the investigation, how you saw it. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    Okay I will speak for 
myself, not for the committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    As the senior civil servant 
at that time and a South African, I was extremely embarrassed and the 
embarrassment is not that something like that happened, the 
20 
embarrassment was how could a wedding of people who are not from 
the country take place – a wedding party land in a strategic installation, 
what went wrong, where were we, including myself.  Of course I wold 
never – technically I would never have known anything about it at a 
technical level but that was the question I was left with, what went 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 66 of 130 
 
wrong, where was I – I mean I’m a convener of the JCPS cluster, how 
could we not have seen this coming, why was this so difficult to spot.  
So one, it was embarrassing but two, it was also disappointing it was 
extremely disappointing because you would imagine that such a 
strategic installation is not so easily accessible.  Where I think, 
perhaps my biggest shock, but I know this because a lot of people were 
shocked by this, but my biggest shock was why are we even in this 
wedding never mind everything else, why is this wedding such a 
national important event in our calendar. So for me those were the 
questions, I accept that their relations, cabinet members are entitled to 
10 
have relations with whomsoever they choose but when it gets to this 
point where national assets are abused to that level, it’s a shock and 
it’s particularly a shock because people get fired for the smallest things 
and for something this big, I mean it just – I’m disappointed today as  I 
was disappointed when this thing happened and I even wonder because 
obviously we were just oblivious going on about our responsibilities, if 
the media had not picked this thing up it would have gone on and 
nobody would have been the wiser and so that’s what shocks me and 
shocked me at that point but still makes me very disappointed even as I 
sit here that sometimes – I’m no fan of the media and I – not that I hate 
20 
the media, ja but that’s that but the long and the short of it, if no-one 
had picked this up it could easily have gone  on yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mentioned something along the lines that people 
get fired for small things, I thought you didn’t finish that sentence, I 
though there was a point you wanted to make, do you want to make that 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 67 of 130 
 
point? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    The point I’m trying to get 
to is, ja, that’s the point, I lack the words to say the point but here is 
perhaps what I’m trying to get to.  At a personal level I have disciplined 
employees for the simplest things and fired them and without being 
excited about having fired them I reflected and said, it was a good 
decision, they may not feel the same way by the way but 
…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry what was a good decision, you mean the 
employees? 
10 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    That an employee was 
fired. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS 
NONKULULEKO 
TERESSA 
SINDANE: 
 
 
 
So 
I 
would 
say…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you mean when you have made a decision to fire 
an employee for whatever reason the employee might not feel the same 
way you feel but you might look at principles, you might look at a 
number of factors and say, it was a good decision? 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    So – but on this thing that 
brought the country to a standstill I know of no-one who was acted 
against, or acted upon as a result of this and that’s all I wish to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And acted upon, you mean fired as you have just 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 68 of 130 
 
been making examples of being fired. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    Yes or more. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought that was the point you wanted to make I’m 
glad that I saw the point, are you done? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes just one question Ms Sindane at our 
consultation you raised something, you reacted – you mentioned that 
the author of the book, “The President’s Keepers” , Mr Jacques Paul I 
think it is page 268, I beg your pardon Mr Chairman, had indicated that  
because of how this report was done, you were actually rewarded and 
you had a comment to make to that, can you just tell the Chairperson 
10 
what your understanding was about what the author was saying about 
you and then give your comment to that. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    “The President’s Keepers”,  
when it was – it probably was on the same day that it was released that 
I started getting calls, SMS’s and those kinds of things, WhatsApp 
messages, someone even sent me a book because of how the thing was 
mentioned, the investigation was mentioned but if you go back to the 
book, the title of the book says it’s “The President’s Keepers”, whatever 
20 
the right formulation is.  So what offended me about that which is still 
offending me as I sit here is that you use the information as though you 
have either verified with me or that kind of thing when you write a 
statement like the statement he wrote about us being rewarded for 
having done this.  Now here is the deal Mr Chair, Mr Glomo is now an 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 69 of 130 
 
Ambassador in a country I don’t know, Clint, Dr Clint Swemmer is in the 
UN somewhere and who else, Commissioner Moyane, until recently he 
had moved on to SARS from being a Commissioner in correctional 
services.  So perhaps one could say maybe that’s what he meant and of 
course I went to the private sector a few years after that, after, either 
some of the promotions or all of the promotions.  I joined a company 
which had no business in being drawn into this thing of “President’s 
Keepers”, so I felt it – that statement had an impact on the business 
and the company that I work for which incidentally I’m also a small 
shareholder in and I felt it was not right for him to have done that, 
10 
though I understood that the media normally can say things and kind of 
get away with them.  So I understood that but I am still feeling very 
aggrieved and I want to put it on record and thanks for the question 
because I want to put it on record.  I am not a “President’s Keeper”, I 
did not defend the President, there may have been errors in the 
process but I did not defend the President when I compiled the reports I 
participated in the process there was no link that was given by, in 
particular one person, but maybe two, one Minister Ben Martins was the 
Minister of Transport at the time, denied categorically having been 
instructed by the President.  Two the Ambassador Koloane denied 
20 
having been instructed by the President, I and my team could not have 
gone to the President and say, eish Mr President we heard some 
skinner somewhere there and we think we must now come and talk to 
you.  What we decided to do, which was procedural, was to go to the 
Presidency and say, under which protocols can the President, if any, 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 70 of 130 
 
authorise the landing of the aircraft because if we had received that, 
we possibly could have had a direct link to the President in terms of 
saying, Mr President this is the protocol, this is what you did.  In the 
absence of that and in the absence of the link from the people we 
interviewed there was no way, as I sit here today, reflecting on 
something that happened in 2013 there was no way that a right thinking 
person would have said, okay there were people who were talking and 
we are now talking to you about this and so I am not the “President’s 
Keeper”, I resent the connotation associated with that even though 
some of the information came from our website, the tone that it was put 
10 
in our website and the tone that it is used in that book, in my view, is 
intended or was intended or continues to be intended as the book 
continues to be read to diminish the role we played, I played in this 
investigation and perhaps me as an individual, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Ms Sindane, just for record 
purposes, those remarks about you are at page 153 of the book, thank 
you, thank you that is all Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Ms Sindane for having come to 
give evidence to the Commission, thank you very much.  Should the 
need arise for you to be asked to come back, the Commission will be in 
20 
touch with you, there may or may not be somebody who might want to 
apply for leave to cross-examine you, we don’t know at this stage so – 
but in that event you will be contacted, but thank you very much for 
coming forward. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    Thank you so much, I 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 71 of 130 
 
appreciate the opportunity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are excused, thank you. 
MS NONKULULEKO TERESSA SINDANE:    Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman the next witness 
will be Major Thabo Ntshisi he will be led by my learned friend Ms 
Rasivhetshele thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I’m going to adjourn for five minutes, we 
adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
10 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Good day Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Are you ready? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Indeed so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair I will be leading the evidence of 
Major Thabo Ntshisi who at the time of the landing of the chartered 
commercial aircraft at the Air Force Base Waterkloof on the 30 April 
2013 was a Warrant Officer stationed at the Air Force Command Post.  
The Air Force Command Post as relayed to me by Major Ntshisi is the 
heart of the Air Force and a critical channel wherein the necessary 
20 
authorisation is given in order for an aircraft to land at the base.  The 
second witness is Mr William Matjila employed at the Department of 
International Relations and Corporation and for all intents and 
purposes I will be mentioning it as DIRCO.  Mr Matjila at the time of the 
landing acted in the capacity… 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 72 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we – are we not having Mr Ntshisi’s evidence at 
the moment? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes indeed so Sir this is just a relay 
just to bring to the Chair’s attention concerning Mr Matjila’s affidavit 
which is a confirmatory affidavit.  Just to give a background – a short 
background to the circumstances leading to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No let us deal with – let us hear Mr Ntshisi’s evidence 
at the moment. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  As the Chair pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I see two people there. 
10 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is going on? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair Mr – Major Ntshisi I beg your 
pardon has requested an interpreter to accommodate him in Isi-Zulu his 
home language and for all intents and purposes I am not certain – I am 
not certainly sure my mistake that I have not received the interpreter’s 
name apologies for that.  That he will relay the evidence to Mr Ntshisi 
who will then reply in Isi-Zulu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the interpreter a sworn translator?  I – yes. 
MR STANLEY DUMISANI NESE (INTERPRETER):  Yes Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are? 
MR STANLEY DUMISANI NESE (INTERPRETER):  Yes I am a sworn

CHAIRPERSON:  And you can make arrangements to produce the 
necessary documentation? 
MR STANLEY DUMISANI NESE (INTERPRETER):  The necessary 
documentations I think are with Mr Moloko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you provided them. 
MR STANLEY DUMISANI NESE (INTERPRETER):  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  No then that is fine.  Then I am happy.  
Okay thank you.  And of course I take it that you interpret from Isi-Zulu 
to English and vice versa? 
10 
MR STANLEY DUMISANI NESE (INTERPRETER):  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Okay then let us go – let us proceed. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair.  Chair if I may refer 
you to the following exhibits that – that will be used with Major Ntshisi’s 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  The following exhibit in consecutive 
order is Exhibit FF4 that would be the chief SANDAF board.  On the 
spine it is written case number 01/2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  The next exhibit is FF5 it is on the

Page 75 of 130 
 
Exhibit FF6.1 and Mr Matjila Exhibit FF6.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us deal with Mr Ntshisi only now. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Indeed so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja is Mr Matjila not going to give evidence later? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes indeed Chair however Mr Matjila’s 
affidavit is actually a confirmatory affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but are you – will he not be called? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Our view as the team Chair is that Mr 
Matjila’s affidavit is a confirmatory affidavit to Ms Sindane’s annexure 
which would be the JS – the JS Report about the landing, the cluster 
10 
report and we felt that there was nothing contentious about – he agrees 
with everything according to – that he has mentioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I just said last week that I decide whether a 
witness will be called or not be called. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Of course, of course based on… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nobody has come to me and says –  
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  The Chair’s approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And said there is this witness this is the nature of his 
or her evidence we propose not to call him and hear what I have to say. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Indeed so Chair that was just our 
20 
recommendation based on your approval? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the process to be followed. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Indeed so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 76 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think for now let us focus on Mr Ntshisi’s evidence 
and whatever else in relation to another witness can be dealt with later. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And finally Chair Exhibit FF8 that would 
be on the spine it is written … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got it. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Additional information bundle.

report of the Board of Inquiry?

deals with the Board of Inquiry.  It has got statements also a transcript 
and 
also 
other 
annexures 
based 
on 
the 
Board

CHAIRPERSON:  The lever arch file which contains documents relating 
to the Board of Inquiry of the SANDAF with a sworn statement of an 
affidavit by Mr Mgwebi will be marked Exhibit FF4 and the lever arch 
file containing emails – written emails reference bundle will be marked

ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes we did Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  We did ja.  And we entered Exhibit FF6 yesterday 
when we were – and I heard the evidence of Mr Martins.  Ja I think that 
takes care of everything. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair.  If the Chair is 
satisfied may the witness please be sworn in? 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 77 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will you administer the oath to the witness or 
affirmation? If there is going to be a need for the interpretation of the 
oath the interpreter will interpret but Mr Ntshisi will indicate if he does 
not need interpretation for that part.  Oh he says he does not.  Okay. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  Ikamalane Thabo 
Ntshisi. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to making the prescribed 
affirmation? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  No. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly affirm that all the evidence that you will

ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Major Ntshisi can you please just turn

MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And what is that document?

03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 78 of 130 
 
Your Worship. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Major Ntshisi I am talking about the 
document in front of you, your statement, is that your statement? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you told him where to find it, what page? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes on page 1 – ja I did indeed so 
Chair.  Major Ntshisi… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think look at – when she mentions pages look at the 
top right hand corner. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  Yes I can see that 
Your Worship. 
10 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And can you page – turn to page 2 of 
that document? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  I have already 
opened the page. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Is that your signature at the bottom? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  That is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we should say there is a signature that is much 
lower and his is higher than that on the page.  Is it your signature that 
appears immediately above the words TGC Operation Officer at Road 
AOT? 
20 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  That is true Your 
Worship I am the one that signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair.  Major Ntshisi are you 
satisfied with the contents of your affidavit and you attest that it is the 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 79 of 130 
 
contents within is true and correct? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  Yes I am satisfied 
with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well except for one thing this does not appear to be 
an affidavit.  It appears to be just a statement I said except for one 
thing that is that I see there is a SAPS stamp or there are two at page 
2 that you do not say in that statement that you state under oath and 
that does not appear to be any certification by a commissioner of oaths 
that you took an oath before him or her before making the statement, 
am I correct? 
10 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  Yes that is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair.  Major Ntshisi can 
you just give us a history about your career at the Air Force in the 
military? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry before he does so.  That might be a long 
history do you want to relate to what position he held at the time 
otherwise he could give you a history of over twenty years. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Indeed so Chair.  Let me just rephrase 
that question.  Major Ntshisi from 2013 can you just give us a history of 
20 
your career from the commencement of 2013 onwards? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  During 2013 Your 
Worship I was employed at the Common Post.  The place which was 
called Flight Centre.  My rank at that stage Your Worship I was 
Sergeant Major Ntshisi.   
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 80 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what is your present position? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  At this stage Your 
Worship I am working at number 46 Brigade.  46 Brigade is an army 
unit Your Worship.  But we also have an Air Force office there Your 
Worship.  My rank now Your Worship I am Major Ntshisi Your Worship.

microphone closer to him they are having difficulty.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you.  Major Ntshisi taking it back 
to the landing of the aircraft in questions and in terms of your 
statement – in terms of paragraph 2 can you please explain to the Chair

MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  According to the 
processes that we are in today Your Worship their request Your Worship 
came all the way from India Your Worship coming down to us Your 
Worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The request you refer to was what request? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  The request Your 
Worship that there was a flight that is coming Your Worship which is 
going to land at Waterkloof Your Worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe to step back a little bit in the position which 
10 
you held in 2013 what were your functions – you do not need to tell us 
all of them but those that might be relevant to what we are talking 
about today? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  Your Worship at the 
army Your Worship the rank Your Worship is what is important.  At the 
time when the request was sent Your Worship as I say I was a Sergeant 
Major I was working with the other two Your Worship who were under 
my command.  When the request arrived Your Worship it will depend 
from the person who saw the request first Your Worship as there were 
three of us.  With this Your Worship the request was actually seen by 
20 
myself Your Worship and I then dealt with the request.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And he request as you said was a request for 
permission authorisation to be granted for the landing of an aircraft? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  Yes Your Worship.

one who saw – who sees the request is the one who acts.  I think he 
was still continuing just finish that part of the evidence.  In this case 
you saw it and what happened? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  The request Your 
Worship after it arrived as it was from the Indian Embassy it is the 
duties Your Worship of the person who received the request Your 
Worship to organise it.  As I am the one who received it Your Worship I 
was the one who was supposed to process it Your Worship by sending it 
10 
to the government departments Your Worship.  The government 
departments Your Worship mentioned at paragraph 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes continue if you have not finished. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  The departments I am 
talking about Your Worship some of them that are important is DIRCO.  
After I received this request Your Worship we send the request to all 
these important departments Your Worship which are mentioned here. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
maybe 
you 
can 
just 
mentioned 
those 
departments, mentioned in paragraph 3. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  ATNS – ATNS which 
20 
is Traffic Navigation System.  CAA Civil Aviation Authority.  Then the 
DOT which is the Department of Transport.  And then the DFR Defence 
Foreign Relations.  And then the SSO which is the Senior Staff Officer.  
And then DHA the Department of Home Affairs. And then the CJ Ops 
Chief Joint Operations Your Worship. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 83 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yes you may proceed. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair.  The request Major 
Ntshisi the request that you are talking about Chair I would just like to 
refer the Chair to Exhibit FF8 on the additional bundle.  Page 27.   
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  Page? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And it continues Chair to page 28 and 
29.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got the right file?  It should be written 
Exhibit FF8 on the spine.  FF8. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  FF8 Your Worship 
10 
yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay page 27.  27 is – is there 027?  You will see on 
the right hand top corner it will be written WKAEDI INFO 027 but when 
she refers to pages she will not mention all these letters and she will 
not mention the 0 before 27. She will just say 27.  So if that has not 
been explained you can be confused.  Okay you have found it. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  Yes Your Worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair.  Major Ntshisi can 
you just identify that document? 
20 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  Over flight and 
landing clearance Your Worship. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And is this the document that was 
received by the Command Post? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  Yes. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 84 of 130 
 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And after receiving this document what 
steps did you take in terms of this document? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  As I have already 
testified before after receiving such a request you send it to different 
departments Your Worship.  But the highest department is DIRCO Your 
Worship.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think you may want to just complete the process 
that you explained and I see in paragraph 4 it says: once the process 
has been completed then you say what happens then you can deal with 
the question of whether that is what you did with this request? 
10 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  After you shall have 
sent this request Your Worship to the specific departments Your 
Worship it is then your duty Your Worship to make a follow up as to 
what they are doing about that Your Worship.  As they are still busy 
checking on it Your Worship you will wait for that period.  After you 
shall have waited Your Worship and they will then send you a feedback 
as to what is actually happening about it.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Who would – who would come back to you?  Is it 
DIRCO or is it all of the departments to which you would have sent it? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  DIRCO Your Worship. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes and what are the possible responses that 
could come from DIRCO in any particular case when you have sent 
them this kind of request? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  The answer might be 
that continue with the request.  
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 85 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if they say continue with the request what does 
that mean?  Is it that they are happy with it you should do what you 
need to do? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  After they sent us the 
email that we must continue with the request Your Worship I mean 
Chairperson we as we are at the Command Post.  If they say we must 
proceed Your Worship they call it in an English word which note verbal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  As the Command Post 
if you did not receive information which says continue with the request 
10 
you do not have the powers to can – continue with such a request. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So am I correct that you can expect either to receive 
the note verbal in which case you continue and give consideration to 
the request for clearance or you do not receive anything from DIRCO in 
which case you do not give further consideration to the request? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  That is correct 
Chairperson.  You only continue if you get a message from DIRCO 
which says you can continue but if you do not get such information you 
do not have any powers to continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you do not get the note verbal but somebody tells 
20 
you telephonically that you may proceed.  Do you have power to 
proceed and consider the request? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Chairperson before I 
can answer that question the person with whom we were working hand 
in hand at that specific point was Mr William Matjila your worship which 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 86 of 130 
 
means your worship sometimes we could receive a message will say 
you can continue with such a request.  If I am answering your question 
Chairperson it does not happen that you can continue your worship only 
after receiving a telephonic confirmation your worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and a note verbal is a specific document? 
INTERPRETER:  Pardon Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is a note verbal a specific document that gives you 
this go ahead? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Yes your worship it 
must be a document your worship with all the particulars your worship 
10 
of the request which will say you can continue your worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And am I correct in understanding that it is not just 
any document in writing.  It has to be a note verbal before you can 
proceed that you are given by DIRCO? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  That is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Continue.  I think we will take the lunch 
break at quarter past. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Indeed so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair since we are on the note verbal 
20 
topic if Chair can please turn to page 87 of Bundle FF8? 
CHAIRPERSON:  87? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  87. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Major Ntshisi are you there? 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 87 of 130 
 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Yes I am there. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Major Ntshisi can you identify this 
document? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  This is the note 
verbal from DIRCO your worship. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Just to be … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it is a note verbal not any particular one 
relating to this incident.  Is that correct? 
INTERPRETER:  Come again Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is – is it a note verbal and not the note verbal 
10 
relating to this incident? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  No it is not this one 
your worship.  This is just your worship a copy which shows that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes.  No, I understand that.  It is – it is an 
example of a note verbal.  Okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Indeed so Chair.  This was a document 
received from DIRCO just for an example what a note verbal would look 
like. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What – how it looked like - looks like, ja.  Thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And the note verbal - just to add Chair 
20 
would usually as relayed by DIRCO – would usually have the emblem of 
the country. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The requesting country? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  The requesting country … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 88 of 130 
 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And if you look at the bottom of the 
page Chair you will then see a stamp from the embassy of the republic 
of that – this particular country on that note verbal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair I would just also just like to refer 
to another exhibit file.  It would be on page 1-9-8 of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which exhibit? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  EXHIBIT FF4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page on that one? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  1-9-8 Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  1-9-8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Major Ntshisi are you on page 1-9-8? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  The lower half of that document can 
you identify this – it – it particularly relates to an email.  Can you 
identify from who it is from to whom? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Yes.  Yes I can. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Can you please relay that – can you 
20 
just talk who it comes from? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Usually as I have 
already stated your worship this email was from Mr Matjila. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  To whom? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  To us at Command 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 89 of 130 
 
Post where I was working at that point in time. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And can you see the – can you just 
read out the subject line of that email? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you should just read – read that yourself … 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because there is interpretation. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  As the Chair pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Subject line:  A request for flight 
clearances Indian delegation. 
10 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  I can see what is 
being written here your worship but twice your worship – the first one 
your worship it is – what is written here state visit that indicates that 
Mr Koloane approved and the second one it says: 
“Dear colleagues, please see the message below 
your urgent assistance and information.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it is fine.  He read it in English.  So it is fine, 
ja. 
INTERPRETER:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I see the – the one email that says: 
20 
“Please 
see 
message 
below 
for 
your 
urgent 
assistance and information.” 
The one that I am struggling to see is the one he mentioned earlier 
about Mr Koloane.  Oh, is it the top email just above the – where it is 
regards Les Lombard.  Is it the sentence above that that you read or 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 90 of 130 
 
that you are referring to? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Yes your worship that 
is what I was referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you.  You said you can talk about these 
two issues? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  When I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  1-9-9. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Turn the page to page 
1-9-9 the first one that I read in page 1-9-8 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  It does not exactly 
specify as what is said in page 1-9-9 your worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is alright.  Maybe this is the right time 
for us to take the lunch adjournment and then we will come back and 
continue. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are going to take the lunch adjournment and we 
will resume at quarter past two.  We adjourn.

HEARING ADJOURNS 
20

ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Some of the – most of the facts are around

03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 91 of 130 
 
like what letter he wrote.  We can move fast on those things. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Indeed so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  As the Chair pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair just to touch base we were on – 
Major Ntshisi was talking to the email on page 199 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And he was talking to that email.  
Major Ntshisi can you please turn to page 199 to the previous email. 
10 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  You brought it to the Chair’s attention 
about that particular email.  Is there anything you want to talk to that 
email about? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes go ahead. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  What I wanted to 
explain is that the request that came from DIRCO - that is now from 
Mr Matjila - that is the email that explains whether we can continue 
with that request.  That is the email your worship that caused the 
Command Post - that is the email or the email that caused that we must 
20 
agree to the email to continue opening the number your worship to give 
access to the flight to come in your worship. 
If I can explain about the number that I am referring to.  In 
English language your worship it is called a clearance number.  After 
you got the mandate that you can continue your worship that is when 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 92 of 130 
 
you open up the number so that you can continue forth your worship … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does that mean you …? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  With the request. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does that mean you allocate a clearance number to 
the particular request? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  That is so your 
worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Continue and what follows after that? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  After you shall have 
received all the information or the particulars your worship as the 
10 
person who – who was actually busy with this request.  I must then go 
and explain to my commander as to from when up where what and what 
did I do.  Then I will do that.  Explain to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who – who was your supervisor or commander at the 
time? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Lieutenant 
Colonel Van Zyl your worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay continue. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Major Ntshisi I would just like to take 
you to Bundle/EXHIBIT FF4 page 1-9-3.  Are you there Major Ntshisi? 
20 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe – I am sorry.  Before we move to that – the – 
the email that came from Mr Matjila what page was it again? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  One … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you remember it? 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 93 of 130 
 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  1-9-9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1-9-9.  Major Ntshisi I just want to go to the letter 
that you say gave you clearance or gave you a go ahead that was from 
Matjila.  Is it the one at page 1-9-9? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
Your 
worship/Chairperson if you can start at 1-9-8 and then to page 1-9-9.  
You will see that Mr Matjila emailed us your worship the place where 
we were working – the Command Post.  When we come to page 1-9-9 it 
is where he is now sending us the message that is coming from 
Ambassador Koloane your worship. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now I have heard evidence that not every 
aircraft can just land at Waterkloof and that only certain aircrafts in 
terms of who they are – their passengers are may be allowed to – to 
land.  Are you able to tell me under what circumstances or what 
aircrafts may be allowed to land or what business or passengers they 
should carry before they can be allowed to land generally speaking at 
Waterkloof? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  According to my 
knowledge only three people given permission or allowed to land at the 
air base your worship.  The first one is the President.  The Deputy 
20 
President your worship and any other person that shall have been sent 
by the President to do Government duties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and of course and military aircraft? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  They are also 
allowed. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 94 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and I heard evidence that if an aircraft is carrying 
Ministers that also can be allowed.  Does that accord with your 
understanding?  Ministers not – not Prime Ministers, Ministers.  I think 
your interpretation was Prime Ministers. 
INTERPRETER:  No I said Ministers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or Premiers. 
INTERPRETER:  Ministers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (IsiZulu).  Okay.  Ministers would that be allowed? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  No it is not allowed 
your worship. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Now in the letter that came from Mr Matjila 
was there any indication - in the letter that gave you a go ahead – was 
there any indication that this was an aircraft that would fall within 
circumstances where it should be permitted to land at Waterkloof? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  It was not clear your 
worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  In order for it to be clear would the letter from 
or the communication from Mr Matjila have had to mention that the 
plane would be carrying the President or Deputy President?  Is that 
what you were looking for? 
20 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  I will repeat the question.  In order for the 
letter from Mr Matjila to convey to you that this was an aircraft that 
would be permitted to land did you expect it to tell you that the aircraft 
would be carrying the President or Deputy President?  Is that what you 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 95 of 130 
 
were looking for? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Before I can answer 
that question Chairperson when they send the report your worship there 
would be actually a reason or a – ja – a reason your worship as to why 
the request itself and the reason your worship was not clearly 
understood what the reason actually was your worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you say when they send the request they would 
state the reason are you talking about the request that would come 
from another country? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  That is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when you say in this case the letter did not – from 
the letter the reason was not clear.  Are you referring to the letter - that 
request that came from India? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Quite correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what about the letter from Mr Matjila did you 
expect it to give you information that would satisfy you that this was an 
aircraft that should be permitted? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Yes that is so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would it be possible that if the letter from Mr Matjila 
did not satisfy you that this would be an aircraft that should be 
20 
permitted would it be possible that you would not proceed to process 
the request or is the position that once you got a letter from Mr Matjila 
you just had to proceed and process the request? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  I could not have 
proceeded your worship if I did not get such a letter your worship. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 96 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but my question is whether it was up to you to 
examine the contents of the letter from Mr Matjila and make a decision 
whether you – it is fine you can go ahead and process the request and 
approve if you were the one to approve or whether as long as 
Mr Matjila said in his letter go ahead and approve then you were bound 
to go ahead and approve? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  I would not have any 
powers your worship or the might of continuing your worship if that was 
the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if you were not satisfied with the contents of the 
10 
letter from Mr Matjila you would not proceed you would not process the 
request.  Is that correct? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and did the letter from Mr Matjila in this 
particular case satisfy you that this was a case where you should 
process the request and if you were the person to approve the request 
to also approve it? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  I do not know 
Chairperson if I can start a little bit behind and explain coming further 
to this letter. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may do so because it is an important part of 
your evidence. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  As I have already 
stated that many a times at DIRCO I am working hand in hand with 
Mr Matjila.  When I asked the request by the Indian people as to how 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 97 of 130 
 
far it is so that we can continue with it and then I explained to him the 
reason why I am calling him always your worship telling him that the 
people from India your worship they want to know how far their request 
has gone your worship. 
When I spoke to Mr Matjila that is when he then informed me 
that this issue is no more in his hands your worship.  That is where 
Ambassador Koloane’s name then surfaced your worship.  The email 
your 
worship 
that 
gave 
us 
the 
go 
ahead 
to 
continue 
your 
worship/Chairperson was actually written by Mr Matjila – the email was 
written by Mr Matjila which is the email that was from Mr Koloane that 
10 
we must continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  If there was not such 
an email or letter we should not have continued with the request but 
instead your worship it does not look like the one that we normally get.  
The note verbal that is coming from DIRCO to Command Post does not 
look like this one.  That is why I say this is an email that is coming from 
DIRCO but the note verbal does not look like this one your worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I understood you earlier on to say the only 
document that gives you a go ahead for – to allow a commercial aircraft 
20 
to land at Waterkloof is a note verbal.  Is that correct? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Yes that is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this letter that you say gave you a go ahead from 
Mr Matjila was not a note verbal.  Is that correct? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  It was not a note 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 98 of 130 
 
verbal which we normally had to do with your worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Did it look like a note verbal even if it is not the 
one you normally work with? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  This one says go 
ahead with the request your worship because it comes from the highest 
rank your worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It is just an email? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One would have expected that you would not process 
it because it was not a note verbal.  Why – why did you nevertheless 
10 
process it? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  I do not know if I can 
go back a bit until I come to this email your worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine.  It is important, ja. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  The reason why we 
continued your worship as far as this email is concerned I had already 
spoken to two people your worship whom I was not used to talk to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  The first one was 
Colonel Anderson.  The second one was Mr Koloane.  As I have already 
20 
stated that this letter said the request from the Indian flight to go and 
land at the air base is allowed.  That is why it gave us the might your 
worship/Mr Chair to continue with the request. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you find out why you were not being furnished 
with a note verbal as is – as was normal? 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 99 of 130 
 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Your worship in talks 
with Mr Matjila he told me that this issue was no more in his hands. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh.  Does that mean you did ask him why – why 
am I not getting a note verbal as is normal or is the position that you 
did not ask that question? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  We came to that talk 
your worship and that is when he then explained to me that that issue 
is no more in his own hands and that those – that issue is now in the 
hands of Mr Koloane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay and I assume that thereafter you had some 
10 
discussion with Mr Koloane to see whether he was the one who was 
going to give you an explanation as to why you were not being given a 
note verbal in this particular case as you – as it used to be normal? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Yes I did ask him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what did he say?   
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI:  (IsiZulu). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes no that is fine. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  We have a statute 
seeing that it is now quite long since 2013.  I cannot be able to require 
the exact word that he uttered through his mouth your worship. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  The document that is 
in front of me is EXHIBIT FF6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  There is where I 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 100 of 130 
 
agree with the report as to what were we talking about with Mr Koloane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI:  Paragraph 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On what page? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  Page 2 paragraph 
eight. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  Those are the talks 
between myself and Mr Kholoane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  Those talks, Your 
Worship, were taken from the cluster report which is on page 8 
paragraph 2.17. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. I will let you continue just now. I just want 
to satisfy myself on this aspect. I’m going to the report of the JCPS 
cluster. Is that where you are referring us to? Yes? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  Can we make some 
corrections? Page 8 from the report, Your Worship, which is paragraph 
2.1.18, Your Worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At page 8 at the bottom of the, oh page 8 of the 
20 
report which is page 12 of the paginated Exhibit FF1. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Indeed so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And paragraph 2.1.18. There is a report says. 
 
The Chief of State protocol then called Sergeant Major Ntshisi 
and stated and is quoted, ‘‘I believe you have spoken to Colonel 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 101 of 130 
 
Anderson?’’ Ntshisi confirmed this and stated that he would go ahead 
with the clearance immediately. Ntshisi asked whether he should fax 
the clearance to Mr Matjila; Mr William Matjila directorate State visit 
Derco. The Chief of State protocol asked where Ntshisi was at the time 
and was unable to understand the explanation given. He then requested 
Ntshisi to email a copy of the clearance to his private email address 
and to his official email address.  
Is that what you are referring to? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  Yes, that was the 
talks between me and Mr Kholoane, Your Worship. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That doesn’t reflect that two of you talked about why 
you were not being furnished with a note verbal. Maybe it is somewhere 
else. Do you know where it is somewhere? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  If we go back again 
Chairperson on the same report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  Page 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  Paragraph 2.117 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  That was the talks 
between myself and Colonel Anderson which continues until the talks 
between myself and Colonel Kholoane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. Paragraph 2.1.17 at page 12 of Exhibit FF1 
which is the report of the JCPS cluster says, Lieutenant Colonel 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 102 of 130 
 
Anderson returns Sergeant Major Ntshisi’s call. Anderson stated that 
she had just spoken to the Chief of State protocol who had informed 
her that Ntshisi had rejected the request. She questioned him as to how 
he could have refused such a request from the Chief of State protocol. 
Ntshisi clarified that he had requested written confirmation. Anderson 
then stated that “in confidentiality I must be very careful now. Our 
number one knows about this. It is political. Allow them. I will phone 
the Ambassador back to find out who is the senior Minister.” Ntshisi 
asked Anderson to confirm that the base could only receive flights 
carrying Heads of State and Ministers. Anderson responded that, “it 
10 
depends on the visit type and that it would be acceptable for a private 
visit if Derco approves it is not a problem. Yes, my dear they can.” So 
you say that is what you were told when you kept on asking why you 
were not being furnished with a note verbal? Is that correct? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  Yes, that is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. You may proceed. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you, Chair. If I just may assist? 
There is a document on Exhibit FF1 on page 123. This is a 
memorandum and I see on page 124 that it has been deposed to, there 
is a stamp at the bottom by the Department of Defence. From 
20 
paragraph 3 of that statement of on that memorandum 123 that would – 
this from paragraph 3 onwards until paragraph 7. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  Yes, I’m there. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And the contents of this would be the 
reason as to why you never – questioning why you never received a 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 103 of 130 
 
normal nonverbal. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  Can you repeat? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Major Ntshisi, let me just rephrase. If 
we, let’s just go to paragraph 4 that would be on page 124. Chair, with 
your permission, may I read this into the record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Lieutenant Colonel Anderson returned 
my call. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, you must first just say that this is a 
memorandum that appears to have been written by Mr Ntshisi and was 
10 
addressed to CJOPS. Do you confirm Mr Ntshisi that that’s the – that 
memorandum was written by you? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  Yes, I confirm that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. It is dated 31 May 2013 and it is at page 123 of 
Exhibit FF4. Then you can read the relevant part. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you want to read. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Paragraph 4 on page 124 of this 
memorandum. It states that, Lieutenant Colonel Anderson returned my 
call. She believed I rejected the request. I mentioned to her that asked 
20 
for a written confirmation from Derco for landing clearance at (FAWK), 
that I assume in front would be the Air Force space and Waterkloof. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Is that correct, yes? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  Yes, that is correct. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 104 of 130 
 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  I asked Lieutenant Colonel Anderson, 
who should be received by the Air Force in terms of VIP because of my 
knowledge only Head of State and deputies. Lieutenant Colonel 
Anderson responded that it depends on the visit type also because 
Ministers may arrive at the Air Force if it’s not too busy and the 
availability of parking for the flight I should allow them. The number 
one (President) knows about the flight.  
Was this the contents of your conversation? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  Yes, that is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, there is – there is also a sentence that’s quite in 
10 
point at page 123 towards the end of paragraph three where you wrote, 
the Ambassador telephoned air command post to inquire as to progress 
with the clearance request from Indian High Commission. I spoke to him 
and explained the nature of (FAWK) being used for the port of entry and 
I indicated to him that (FAWK) can only allow Head of State, I think 
that’s Waterkloof, Head of State and their deputies. The Ambassador 
responded that there would be 4 to 5 Ministers on board. I requested a 
note verbal from him. The Ambassador responded by saying the 
challenge was that this could not be put in writing and the President 
authorized the landing of that flight. I should call Lieutenant Colonel 
20 
Anderson to confirm that. 
Is that what you were told by Ambassador Kholoane? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  Yes, that is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Is your evidence – were you say it was after 
you have been told all of these things that you decided to process the 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 105 of 130 
 
request? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  After all these talks, 
Your Worship, that is when we had to make a decision that we proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  With the request. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Major Ntshisi, you have spoken about 
you know the nonverbal not being the normal nonverbal that you would 
receive. Is that correct? 
INTERPRETER:  Can you repeat? 
10 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  He has spoken about the nonverbal 
being it was not the normal that they would receive. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And am I correct in saying that a 
normal nonverbal would indicate, identify either the Head of State, the 
deputy or whatever ministry, the passengers the flight would be caring. 
Is that correct? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  Yes, in nonverbal, 
Your Worship, will have quite some number of particulars, Your 
Worship, according to the request for the flight that will be coming in 
20 
and then it will further explain extensively about the people or the crew 
that will be in the flight; also explain extensively about their positions 
and their respective duties they are doing and as to where it is from 
and where it is going to land. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And the normal note verbal would be 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 106 of 130 
 
the previous example that we have noted on page 87; example from 
Derco. That would be Exhibit FF8. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  Page? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Page 87, of which file? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you need him to go back to it because he did 
confirm it?   
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  No, Chair, not to go back; just to 
explain that what he has just said that would be the normal, how in 
normal note verbal would look in contents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I’m saying he did say that before. Do you want 
10 
him to repeat it? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember when you showed it my recollection is that 
he looked at it or did he not look at it and confirmed exactly that what 
he had received did not, was not a note verbal as they know it. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Indeed so, Chair. Major Ntshisi, so in 
this instance, from the look of it and what you would normally know this 
nonverbal that’s sent by email this confirmation email to go ahead was 
irregular? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  Look the one I 
20 
received, Your Worship, was not the normal one which had all the 
particulars, Your Worship, which in normal nonverbal would carry, Your 
Worship. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Major Ntshisi, if I could take you to 
Exhibit FF4 on pages 193. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 107 of 130 
 
INTERPRETER:   Page 9? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  193. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  Yes, I’m there. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Can you identify that document? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  It’s a cover page for 
the defence intelligence. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Major Ntshisi, are you on the correct 
page? 193 of Exhibit FF4. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  Pardon, I was on the 
wrong page. 
10 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Major Ntshisi, can you identify that 
document? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  The document in 
front of me is RSA05, which is an external clearance. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Can you talk about when would this 
document be issued and can you talk to the contents of this document? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  This document 
explains where is it from and to which people is it going to and as to 
who the author of it is and who the person that is making a request is 
and the reason for such a request. 
20 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Okay. Major Ntshisi so, on the top page 
on the left-hand side in queries go to, it is written there, Warrant 
Officer T Ntshisi. The requester is the Indian delegation, the contact 
person is Captain Khathi and the address the India Embassy and at the 
bottom of the page we have an authority off-sign, Lieutenant Colonel SJ 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 108 of 130 
 
Van Zyl. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  That is so. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And would it be correct that Colonel 
Van Zyl would have to sign these documents for the clearance to be 
valid? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  That is true. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And knowing the none normality of the 
note verbal that you had received and you had questioned it and so 
forth, did you bring this to Lieutenant Colonel Van Zyl’s attention before 
he authorized this clearance? 
10 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  As I have already 
explained, when it came to the finality that Colonel Van Zyl must sign 
you shall have already told him about the problems and the reasons 
why you came to such a decision that you have to continue, Your 
Worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would have briefed him fully about the process up 
to that point. Is that what you mean? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  Yes, you tell him 
about the onset of the request or the beginning, Your Worship, until to 
the finality of it where he must finally sign and give a go-ahead, Your 
20 
Worship. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Major Ntshisi, can just short in just a 
short sentence just relay the conversation that you had with Colonel 
Van Zyl? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  Even though I cannot 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 109 of 130 
 
remember the exact words seeing that it happened quite long ago. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before he answers. What he has said is that 
the norm is that but the time he would ask Van Zyl to sign he would 
have briefed him from beginning, from the beginning of the process up 
to the point. Do you want him to mention the whole process? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  No, Chair. This was just you know 
shortly on how did he state, tell, relay to Colonel Van Zyl that you know 
the nonverbal was irregular and also in terms of the conversation he 
had with Lieutenant Colonel Anderson and Ambassador Kholoane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think maybe it would be better if you put a specific 
10 
question out of that whole process what you would like him to deal with 
if you want to ask him whether he told Van Zyl, Mr Van Zyl that there 
was something irregular about this. Put the question if you want to, him 
to, if you want to ask him whether he told Van Zyl, Mr Van Zyl that 
there was no note verbal. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  As the Chair pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And instead there was just a letter. Just direct that 
otherwise. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Indeed so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He would start all over again and then tell the whole 
20 
process. So he has told us to process and he has told us that he would 
have informed Mr Van Zyl of the process from beginning to the point. 
So he would have briefed him. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes, indeed so, Chair. Thank you Chair. 
Major Ntshisi, did you inform Colonel Van Zyl about the note verbal not 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 110 of 130 
 
be normal and it coming through as an email instead and not having the 
correct contents of a normal nonverbal? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  It was very important 
that I tell him about that and the reason being he was still new in the 
position he was holding at that time, Your Worship, and as a new 
person, Your Worship, he was relying on us, Your Worship, to give him 
the knowledge, Your Worship, about what we know is normally 
happening in the process, Your Worship. After informing him that, Your 
Worship, that is when he came to the decision that he can sign, Your 
Worship. 
10 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Major Ntshisi, there was another 
request that came in say for the main Airbus that landed. There was a 
request for helicopters to land at the airbase. Is that correct? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI  (through Interpreter):  There were such 
requests, Your Worship, and such requests, Your Worship, were; that 
request, Your Worship, was in line with the requests of the Airbus, Your 
Worship, which was going to land at Waterkloof. And because the 
reason for that, Your Worship, the airplane that was going to land at 
Waterkloof, Your Worship, was carried 217 people or crew, Your 
Worship. And because of that, Your Worship, the other request for the 
20 
light aircrafts, Your Worship, where the light aircraft which were going 
to carry people from Waterkloof to where they were going to, Your 
Worship. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair, that request can be found on 
page 10.  It can be found on page 106 and 107 of Exhibit FF5, is that 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 111 of 130 
 
the request Major Ntshisi? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  That is correct. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:   And the subsequent clearance is in 
Exhibit FF4 on page 194, is that correct? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Page? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:   194. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):   That is correct. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:   And in terms of the Airbus and the 
light aircraft was the same processes followed, in terms of the two 
requests? 
10 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):   Yes that is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let’s go back to when you took the letter from Mr 
Majila to is it Lieutenant Colonel van Zyl? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was Lieutenant Colonel van Zyl the person who was 
supposed to approve the authorisation – the clearance? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  That is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you supposed to make a recommendation to him 
as to whether you thought he should provide the authorisation or not? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  According to my 
20 
explanation and knowledge that I have, the knowledge Your Worship of 
the request, when you tell your supervisor or commander Your Worship 
where it started to where that is now going to be his thinking or 
decision as to what he is going to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you were not required to indicate whether you 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 112 of 130 
 
thought he should approve it or not approve, you’re simply supposed to 
brief him fully about the process and place (indistinct) documentation 
before him and he would have to make a decision himself? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  That is true Your 
Worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you were, yourself, not satisfied that every – that it 
should be approved were you still obliged to take everything to him for 
him to make a decision or if you were not satisfied that everything was 
in order you could have not processed this whole request up to him? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Chairperson when you 
10 
are in the army there is a department where you report to, you cannot 
ask or think what is supposed to be done Your Worship if a person is 
your senior. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say that you can’t tell your senior what he 
should do? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Totally you cannot tell 
your senior what to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:   Thank you Chair, I would like to refer 
to the SANAF Board file which is Exhibit FF4, starting at page 324, just 
20 
for clarity purposes this is the transcript of the Board of inquiry into 
Lieutenant Colonel Anderson that was held in Pretoria, the front page 
of this transcript can be found on page 284…(intervention) 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry was it 284? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  284, it’s just the 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 113 of 130 
 
cover page for the transcript, the identification of the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you want us to go to 324. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:    Yes 324 Chair please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are there. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:     Major Ntshsi, are you there? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:     In – just to deter in just a repetition 
in evidence I’m just going to pick it up from the fifth line on that 
document where it starts with “WO Ntshisi”. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Where it starts with? 
10 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:     It starts with “WO Ntshisi”, the first 
line of page 324.  Chair if I may read that in the record or should I just 
give a synopsis of the contents of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that looks like evidence that he has already 
given isn’t it? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  That is just a slight introduction to the 
core of what we’re trying to get at so we can…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I don’t want us to waste time repeating evidence 
that has been said. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:   Yes, if we could just page to 325 of 
20 
that document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:    If we go to line – if we go to lines 8 of 
that document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s page 325? 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 114 of 130 
 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:   325 line 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Warrant Officer Ntshisi states, 
 
“I have spoke to Mr Koloane he indicated to me that the 
 
sensitivity of the flight is not supposed to be on a note of 
 
verbale because it’s a high security risk, then we skip a 
 
line there on line 12, Warrant Officer Ntshisi states, we need 
 
to go ahead with that clearance although I was not happy with 
 
the response that is why I even – the second time I spoke to 
 
Lieutenant Colonel Anderson, she also confirmed that I must 
10 
 
go ahead because the President authorised the flight”.     
CHAIRPERSON:  Major Ntshisi did you say at that Board of inquiry that 
you had spoken to Mr Koloane and he had indicated that the sensitivity 
of the flight was not supposed to be on the note verbale because it was 
a high security risk, did you say that? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  No I never said that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you did not say at the Board of inquiry that Mr 
Koloane – you had spoken to Mr Koloane and that he had indicated to 
you that the sensitivity of the flight was not supposed to be on the note 
verbale and that this was because it was a high security risk, you did 
20 
not say that at the Board of inquiry? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  No. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:   On that same page on 325, that would 
be line 28 on that page, at the bottom of the page…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe let’s do the other one that you had 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 115 of 130 
 
mentioned.  On that page Major Ntshisi it’s also reflected that you told 
that Board of inquiry that, and I read, 
 
“We need to go ahead with that clearance although I was not 
 
happy with that response that is why I even, the second time, 
 
spoke to Lieutenant Colonel Anderson, she also confirmed that 
 
I must go ahead because the President authorised that flight”, 
 
I’m sorry did the interpreter interpret? 
INTERPRETER:  I’m sorry I didn’t get that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I’m going to repeat, ja let him read as I repeat.  
Did you say this at the Board of inquiry Major Ntshisi as reflected at 
10 
page 325 somewhere in the middle of the page, 
 
“We need to go ahead with that clearance although I was not 
 
happy with that response that is why I even, the second time, 
 
spoke to Lieutenant Colonel Anderson, she also confirmed that 
 
I must go ahead because the President authorised that flight”.  
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):    What is written 
here, I don’t agree with Your Worship because it is against what I’ve 
said in my statement and it is also against the report which is on the 
cluster report Your Worship. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:   Major Ntshisi are you stating that you 
20 
never uttered these words irrespective of it being contrary to the 
statement and the cluster report?   
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  The words that are 
written here, I am against Your Worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 116 of 130 
 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  So Major Ntshisi are you stating that 
the transcription done here is incorrect?    
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  Yes whatever is 
written here I disagree with. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  On that same page on 325 at the 
bottom of that page, would start at line 28 where it’s stated,  
 
“for that time it was amazed if he (she) asked me why you 
 
rejected what you call the request from the Chief, so but 
 
because she says to me, she indicated that it’s the President 
 
authorisation and that is why we go ahead with it”. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  On what page were you reading just now? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair that is on line 28 on page 325, 
that same page that we were on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, well let me ask this, Major Ntshisi I thought 
your evidence earlier on was to the effect that Ambassador Koloane 
had said, and I may be mistaken, when you were insisting on the note 
verbale, had said that this was a unique case and that when you asked 
for written confirmation he said what you asked for could not be put in 
writing, was that something else? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):   
 Chairperson 
as 
20 
I’ve already stated Your Worship the wording Your Worship on this 
transcripts are not my wordings Your Worship. It looks like as if there is 
someone who printed this wording Your Worship as if they are coming 
from me, which I disagree with.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Do those words or those parts of that page to which 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 117 of 130 
 
you are referred, do they make points that are true but is the wording – 
it’s the words that are used that you don’t agree with but you agree 
with the points but you may have used different words to make the 
same point? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):   
 The 
wording 
appearing here Your Worship I, they don’t mean what I said to them as I 
was talking to them telephonically.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you, continue. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair we are going to move on to 
Exhibit FF8. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  What will need to be investigated later is the issue of 
that transcript so that – for later on, maybe on another day when there 
can be clarity as to the accuracy of the transcript.      
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  We’ve made a note of it, thank you 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that in the end we know whether – what the 
position is, ja okay.      
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:   Thank you Chair.  As I said we’ll be 
moving to Exhibit FF8, Chair I’m not particularly sure, I assume that it’s 
been done, there is a folder in FF8 with a divider with the number 4 on 
20 
it and it should be the same as well with Major Ntshisi, that will be on 
paginated page 161. 
CHAIRPERSON:  161, yes, let’s see if he has got it, I think he has got 
it, yes.      
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:   Now this is a book written by author 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 118 of 130 
 
Pieter-Louis Myburgh, “The Republic of Guptas”, a story of state 
capture wherein Major Ntshisi has been mentioned in this book and we 
have noted and highlighted certain extracts that, if the Chair allows, to 
read in that record and have Major Ntshisi comment on those 
allegations by Mr Myburgh.     
CHAIRPERSON:    Well this was done with the earlier witness but what 
is the point, is there something written there by this author that 
concerns him that he wants to refute?    
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:    Yes well basically Chair, this book 
highlights that Major Ntshisi might have benefited from the landing of 
10 
this aircraft by receiving a promotion in a sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just ask him that question.       
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:    Major Ntshisi, I’m not particularly 
certain that you’ve read the contents of this book but Mr Myburgh, in 
his book, relays that you benefited in, from being Warrant Officer to a 
Major within – it was a huge acceleration without going through the 
proper processes and your colleagues were surprised that you had 
gotten a promotion out of nowhere, what do you have to say to this?    
INTERPRETER:   From which rank to which rank?       
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:     From   Warrant Officer to where he 
20 
was to the position of today which is Major. 
CHAIRPERSON:    You can just respond to what they say is alleged in 
the book about you, I’m sorry Mr Interpreter I see I took over, okay 
alright, yes.    
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):   
The 
author, 
Your 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 119 of 130 
 
Worship of this book is not telling the truth that is why I was asking the 
Chairperson if, can I  explain my feelings about this Your Worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well that author is not giving evidence before the 
Commission as far as I know and I don’t know if he has substantiated 
those allegations.     
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:    Chair we had a conversation with Mr 
Myburgh yesterday late afternoon about presenting this book and 
perhaps also handing it up as also as an Exhibit, he was more than 
happy in doing that…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but is he coming to give evidence to substantiate 
10 
the allegations?    
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:   
 No 
he 
is 
not 
coming 
to 
give 
evidence but he was more than happy to…(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja if he is not going to come and substantiate the 
allegations I think it’s enough if the witness refutes that allegation and 
I see the witness hasn’t been given a chance to look at the book so if 
at a later stage they witness has looked at the book and there appears 
that there is something more, then we can look at that but I think at this 
stage let’s try and finish with this witness.  I think what was important 
with this witness was really he’s role with regard to the clearance and 
20 
maybe one or two things, a lot of things are not in dispute.    
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:    Indeed so Chair.  Just for purposes of 
Major Ntshisi, where he is  mentioned in these allegations is on page 
148 of the book and 150 and 151, I’m just talking about the context not 
the paginated bundle.  So I’m talking about the book actual page 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 120 of 130 
 
number not the bundle Major Ntshisi so you can refer to the book.   
INTERPRETER:  Page what? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:   
Page 148, 150 and 151.   Apologies 
Chair, just a correction Mr Myburgh had actually agreed to us referring 
to the book and not us handing them up as Exhibits, be that as it may 
due to the fact that the witness has not read the book in any event, he 
cannot refute it substantially. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes let’s get on, are there any other questions about 
the real issues that this witness is here about? 
    
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:   
No Chair, we have covered the issue 
10 
of the request, the processes that the witness has relayed and from us 
there aren’t any further evidence to be led for Major Ntshisi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Major Ntshisi as you sit there, do you accept that the 
landing of this aircraft at Waterkloof should not have been authorised?    
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):   
Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You appear to have opposed the authorisation of the 
landing of this aircraft up to a certain point, is that correct?     
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Am I correct to say that from a certain point you 
appear to have been prepared to go along with the authorisation? 
    
20 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI (through interpreter):     That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Do you want to confirm to me again why it is that 
you changed your mind about – and decided no longer to oppose the 
authorisation? 
    
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  The reason for that 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 121 of 130 
 
Your Worship is the email I got from DIRCO which was written by Mr 
Matjila – which was sent to me by Mr Koloane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We did discuss that I just wanted confirmation.  So it 
was that email from Mr Matjila that made you change your mind and 
what else? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  Only the email Your 
Worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were there any conversations you had with anybody 
that also persuaded you or it was only that email? 
 MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  The talks were only 
10 
between me and Colonel Anderson, Mr Koloane and then that was now 
the email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but what I am asking is whether you are saying it 
is only what was written in that email that persuaded you to change 
your mind or are saying it was what was in the email plus the 
conversations that you had with other people? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  It was only the email 
Your Worship no one else influenced me to change my mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said earlier on if I understood evidence correctly 
that if you were not satisfied that the requirements that a particular 
20 
aircraft should be authorised to land after looking at whatever DIRCO 
sent to you, you would be entitled to – you would be entitled to or not 
to process the request.  Was my understanding of your evidence 
correct? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  Yes that is correct. 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 122 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So why did you not refuse to process this request 
because 1. You have told us that this letter or email from Mr Matjila 
was not a note verbal and 2. It did not have its contents were – did not 
cover some matters that would be covered in a note verbal.  Why did 
you process it nevertheless? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  The reason for that is 
that I had already have had some talks with Mr Koloane and he already 
written to me Your Worship – I mean Chairperson that I must go on with 
processing the request. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But were you permitted – did you have power to 
10 
process the request just because Mr Koloane said process it even if 
you were not satisfied that it met the requirements? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  I did not have those 
powers Your Worship that is the reason why when I finished processing 
the request that I took it to Colonel Van Zyl. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you saying you did not have the power to refuse 
or are you saying you did not have the power to authorise or to process 
the request in those circumstances? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  Chairperson if you 
were on the position I was at at that point in time and after you shall 
20 
have spoken to someone senior than you by giving the clearance 
number to the requests of that flight.  In other words I say a specific 
flight with such and such a number has got the right or permission to 
get into South Africa. By giving it a number Your Worship I do not say 
myself per se that it is allowed to enter Your Worship.  That is why 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 123 of 130 
 
when it come to that you have to take it to the person who is senior 
than you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So is the position that whatever you thought of the 
request and whatever you thought of the email from Mr Matjila you were 
obliged to take the request to Colonel Van Zyl? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  That is true Your 
Worship that is why when you finalise the request you must take it to 
the person that is in charge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is very important that I understand this part 
because it relates to the last stages before the authorisation.  My 
10 
understanding of what you said earlier on was that if you were not 
satisfied that this request was in order you were not obliged to process 
it forward.  Did I understand your evidence correctly in that regard? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  Yes that is so.  That 
is why it eventually came to the talks between myself and Mr Koloane.  
The reason for that I was not satisfied from the onset. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I am trying to understand what made you change 
your mind and earlier on we talked about the contents of the letter – of 
the email from Mr Matjila.  And I even asked you whether you were also 
influenced by conversations you may have had with other people other 
20 
than the contents of the email and you said you were influenced as I 
understood you only by the contents of the email.  Did I understand you 
correctly so far? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  So then I come back to the question why 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 124 of 130 
 
did you not say I am not processing this request forward because I am 
not satisfied that it is in order? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  I could not have 
refused Chairperson if there was already an email that I must continue 
with processing of the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Once you received the email from Mr Matjila are you 
saying it was not open to you to satisfy yourself whether the request 
was in order and all you had to do is take it forward even if you did not 
think it was in order? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  Chairperson as I have 
10 
already stated if you are in that position and there was also a person 
senior than you who informs you to continue with the processing of that 
flight permission there was nothing I could do.  I did not have the 
powers of refusing to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was the person who was senior to you who had 
said you must go ahead with the request and process it? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  If I say a senior 
person Your Worship I do not mean someone who was the army itself 
Your Worship it is someone we were working hand in hand with Your 
Worship who was from DIRCO Your Worship who is Mr Koloane. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I would have thought that the person that you may 
have been obliged to obey if he gave you any instructions along those 
line would have been somebody within the SANDF or within – who was 
your senior at work not somebody from another department. 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  That is the truth 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 125 of 130 
 
Chairperson.  Yes Sir seeing that we were working hand in hand with 
DIRCO Chairperson I was in the lowest rank in such a way that I was 
not going to be capable to fight against the orders that are coming from 
people from the higher ranks Your Worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you not supposed in that situation to take the 
request rather to somebody higher and say here is this request I think 
it is not in order but the people at DIRCO say we must process it, what 
do you say?  I do not agree, what do you say?  Is that not what you 
were supposed to do in that situation? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:   That is why 
10 
Chairperson when I explained that after I came across the particulars 
that were in the email that is when I went to Colonel Van Zyl and I 
explained to Colonel Van Zyl everything that happened or the whole 
process until where we were with the request. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well part of what you say suggest to me that what you 
are saying is that you were not persuaded that this request was in 
order but because you were being told or instructed by somebody 
senior from senior to you but from DIRCO you were bound to take it to 
somebody senior to you at SANDF and yet earlier on I thought you said 
you were opposed to this request earlier but later on you were 
20 
persuaded that it should be – it should go ahead.  Is – which is the 
position?  Is it that you never changed your mind that it was not in 
order throughout you thought it was not in order but it was it was for 
Van Zyl to make a decision or is the position that although initially you 
thought it was not in order after some time you thought it was in order 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126

and you took it to Colonel Van Zyl.  Which one is the real position? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  From the beginning 
Chairperson I had some suspicions I was not satisfied with the request.  
That is why I explained what was the reason for us to at last continue 
with this request.  The people that I have already explained that I have 
spoken to as I have already mentioned the main reason as I have 
already stated I was never forced by anyone.  The document that I 
received which was an email which said continue was the main reason 
why I continued. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So am I to understand – am I to understand your 
10 
evidence to mean that nobody put any undue pressure on you to 
process the request up to Colonel Van Zyl? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  As I have already 
stated from the people I spoke to Colonel Anderson and Mr Koloane – 
until to the point where we were talking about the request Your Worship 
and according to what we were discussing with them Your Worship 
those talks Your Worship are in the cluster report and then the email.  
That is why it then came that after the whole report was compiled that 
it must also land to Colonel Van Zyl. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So at the time that the authorisation was granted 
20 
would it be correct to say at that stage you were in support of the 
authorisation being granted or would that be incorrect? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  That is – Chairperson 
as I have already stated that after the report has reached Colonel Van 
Zyl I was not going to have any powers to disagree with him how to go 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 127 of 130 
 
about signing it Your Worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to conclude from my side but you did say that as 
you sit there your view is that the authorisation should not have been 
granted? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  As I am seated here 
Your Worship the flight was not supposed to land at Waterkloof. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And is that because it did not – it did not have a head 
of state or deputy head of state as one or some of the passengers? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  Yes that is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
10 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there anything? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  There is nothing left with evidence from 
our side for Major Ntshisi.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you very much Major Ntshisi is there 
anything that we may have left out that is important that you wanted to 
say? 
MAJOR THABO NTSHISI [through interpreter]:  At this moment no 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much for coming to give evidence.  If 
20 
you somebody applies for leave to cross-examine you and they are 
granted that leave we will ask you to come back.   
MAJOR 
THABO 
NTSHISI 
[through 
interpreter]: 
 
Thank 
you 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see some communication between counsel for 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 128 of 130 
 
Ambassador Koleane. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know if there is anything I need to know? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:   I am not particularly sure what the 
legal representatives of Ambassador Koleane wants to put on record 
but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja maybe … 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  But Advocate.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe he could come forward.  Ja. 
COUNSEL:  Thank you Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COUNSEL:    I will not detain the commission for very long. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COUNSEL:    We just wanted to place our position on record.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
COUNSEL:    We did not receive a Rule 3.3 Notice in respect of this 
witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
 COUNSEL:   So we obviously reserve our rights we will consider in 
due course whether we want to exercise those rights. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine.   
COUNSEL:    Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine thank you.  Thank you very much you are 
excused Major Ntshisi.  And thank you very much Mr Interpreter. 
INTERPRETER:  Thank you Chairperson.  May I also… 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126 
 
Page 129 of 130 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you are excused.  Thank you.   
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair.  I have noted the time 
it being twenty past four. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  However we do have a second witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Mr William Matjila. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  He has a confirmatory affidavit which is 
quite short but however a confirmatory affidavit to the report but 
10 
however there are annexures that he would wish to talk to.  I do not 
believe that his evidence will be long. I estimate no more than thirty 
minutes and that would be to my best an exaggeration.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you may be like me I am very poor with regard to 
estimating how long anything is going to take.  So well maybe we 
should – I should listen to his evidence tomorrow morning.  How many 
witnesses have you got for tomorrow? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair we have two more witnesses for 
tomorrow that would be Lieutenant General Msimang and General 
Mgwebi. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So Mr Matjila would be a third witness? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes Mr Matjila would be a third witness.  
I assume. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long would the others be more or less, 
understanding that you don’t have confidence in your own estimation? 
03 JULY 2019 – DAY 126

probably an hour each. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I think let’s start with Mr Matjila tomorrow, is he 
available tomorrow? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Let me just relay this.  He is indeed 
ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, let me hear his evidence tomorrow at ten. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  As the Chair pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  We will adjourn for the day and tomorrow we 
start at ten.  We adjourn.
