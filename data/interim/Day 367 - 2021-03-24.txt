PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 24 MARCH 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Franklin, good morning 
everybody.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I must give my decision on Bain’s request 
of yesterday and then I will have an announcement – a 
brief announcement to make and then we can start. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yesterday morning I heard 
argument in connection with a request that has been made 
10 
by Bain and Company South Africa Incorporated that I 
should provide it with written permission in terms of 
Regulation 
11 
– 
11.3 
A 
of 
the 
Regulations 
of 
the 
commission.   
 
That provision reads as follows and I quote: 
“No person shall without the written permission of the 
Chairperson. 
a. Disseminate 
any 
documents 
submitted 
to 
the 
commission by any person in connection with the 
inquiry or publish the contents or any portion or the 
20 
contents of such document and the dissemination of 
any such document and or any portion thereof is a 
criminal offence in terms of the Regulations.” 
Bain’s request was communicated to the commission by 
way of a letter dated 26 November 2020 to which I had 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 4 of 319 
 
regard yesterday. 
 
After dealing with certain matters in paragraphs 1, 2 
and 3 of that letter Bain’s attorneys wrote the following in 
paragraph 4 and I quote” 
“While 
we 
await 
directions 
from 
the 
commission in respect of the hearing of the 
application we also wish to address a 
request to the commission in respect of the 
publication of Bain South Africa’s affidavit.” 
And then in paragraph 5, 6 and – that was 5, 6 and 7 it 
10 
says: 
“Bain South Africa may wish to publish the 
affidavits accompanying their application 
when Mr Williams begins his testimony 
before the commission.  That is necessary 
to ensure that Bain South Africa is fairly 
treated by them, the media and the public 
at large even the serious inflammatory and 
potentially defamatory material contained in 
Mr Williams’ affidavit and presumably his 
20 
forthcoming testimony.  Fairness demands 
that Bain South Africa’s version must be 
publicly available simultaneously with his 
so that they can be assessed alongside one 
another.  The need for this even handed 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 5 of 319 
 
release of information is particularly acute 
where Bain South Africa will not be able to 
test Mr Williams’ evidence at the time that 
he gives it and we will only have an 
opportunity to cross-examine him later if at 
all.” 
6. 
“We 
note 
that 
Regulation 
11.3 
A 
of 
the 
Regulations 
applicable 
to 
the 
commission 
provides 
that 
“no 
person 
shall 
without 
the 
10 
written permission of the Chairperson  
a. Decimate any documents submitted to the 
commission by any person in connection 
with the inquiry or publish the contents or 
any 
portion 
of 
the 
contents 
of 
such 
document.”  The object of that provision 
appears 
to 
be 
to 
prevent 
information 
submitted to the commission from being 
leaked 
by 
that 
party. 
 
We 
do 
not 
understand it to operate against a party 
20 
like Bain South Africa which wishes to 
disseminate its own affidavits to promote 
transparency 
and 
openness 
in 
the 
commission’s process.  Moreover once Mr 
Williams begins his testimony and thereby 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 6 of 319 
 
discloses the evidence he has submitted to 
the commission there is further no reason 
to 
maintain 
confidentiality 
over 
his 
affidavit. (bar those portions that Bain 
South 
Africa 
has 
sought 
to 
withhold 
permanently from disclosure due to – due 
to confidentiality of privilege obligations) 
or 
to 
preclude 
Bain 
South 
Africa’s 
reference to it.” 
7. 
10 
“We accordingly request the commission’s 
confirmation alternatively permission that 
Bain 
South Africa 
may 
publish 
and 
or 
decimate 
its 
affidavit 
as 
soon 
as 
Mr 
Williams commences his testimony.” 
 
The 
request 
by 
Bain 
was 
not 
based 
on 
any 
substantive application that may have been brought it was 
simply based on this request and as I indicated I heard 
argument upon it. 
 
It is quite clear that its basis is simply that Bain 
20 
believes that if it is not allowed to publish its affidavits 
when Mr Williams gives evidence that will be unfair in 
circumstances where Mr Williams will be giving evidence 
implicating it.   
 
I must indicate that during the course of argument 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 7 of 319 
 
and following upon a remark that I had made namely 
whether or not instead of seeking the publication of the full 
affidavits Bain would be satisfied with the publication of a 
summary of the contents of the affidavits so that not all 
details in the affidavit would be published. 
 
Following that Counsel for Bain indicated that Bain 
no longer sought permission to publish the whole affidavit 
and they confined their request to seeking permission to 
publish a summary of the affidavit. 
 
It will be clear from the letter on which Bain’s 
10 
request is made that there is nothing special that Bain 
relies on really to ask for permission.  Its Counsel 
indicated yesterday that it had provided comprehensive 
affidavits but I do not think that that is a feature that 
makes its case special. 
 
Therefore this case must be or its request must be 
decided on the basis that it is a request for permission as 
contemplated in Regulation 11.3 A but there is really 
nothing special in the features of its case. 
 
As I read Regulation 11.3 it appears to me that it 
20 
seeks to lay down what would be the norm namely that 
there should be no publication of a document that has been 
submitted 
to 
the 
commission 
unless 
the 
Chairperson 
provides written permission therefore.  And it would seem 
that the Chairperson would have to be satisfied about 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 8 of 319 
 
something special with regard to such a request before he 
provides such permission because otherwise if he were to 
provide permission in regard to a case that does not have 
any special features then that would undermine Regulation 
11.3 A. 
 
But the whole case of Bain is based on the 
suggestion or contention that there will be unfairness if 
Bain is not able to publish its affidavits or a summary of its 
affidavits when Mr Williams gives his evidence. 
 
In this regard it is necessary to have regard to the 
10 
legal framework that governs the proceedings of this 
commission.  Obviously this commission has to operate 
within the parameters of the constitution, the Commission’s 
Act, the Regulations promulgated under the Commission’s 
Act which apply to this commission as well as the Rules of 
the commission. 
 
Now the Rules of this commission particularly Rule 
3 makes provision that when a witness has submitted a 
statement or has made a statement to this commission or 
an affidavit implicating somebody that person should be 
20 
notified of – about a statement and that he or she or it is 
implicated by that witness and that person must be given a 
copy of the statement or the relevant portions thereof and 
that person then is advised that he or she or it has the 
right provided for inspection in Regulation – in Rule 3.   
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 9 of 319 
 
 
And those – those rights include the right to apply 
to the commission for leave to adduce evidence or to 
testify.  The right to – for leave to call other witnesses in 
support of your version as well as for leave to cross-
examine the witness.  Indeed you have such a person has 
the right to be present when that evidence is given by that 
witness. 
 
In this case Bain has applied for leave to cross-
examine Mr Williams but that application has not been 
decided as yet.  I indicated during argument yesterday that 
10 
from my position that application could be decided even 
later this week or next week if all the affidavits are in.  I 
understand that Mr Williams has furnished his response to 
the application but Bain is yet to decide whether they file a 
further affidavit or not. 
 
As far as the commission is concerned I will be 
prepared to hear that application as soon as possible after 
I have been advised that either Bain has decided that it 
will not file a further affidavit or 00:15:55 has filed an 
affidavit. 
20 
 
But I raised with Counsel for Bain yesterday the 
fact that Bain seems not to have applied for leave to testify 
and that appears to be factually true and I think he was not 
in a position to indicate whether – whether Bain wished to 
testify and I asked him the question whether Bain would 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 10 of 319 
 
subject themselves to questioning before the commission 
and he indicated that he did not have instructions at that 
time on that point. 
 
Now 
the 
legal 
framework 
applicable 
to 
these 
proceedings make it clear that Bain could have applied for 
leave to testify before the commission and if they had done 
that it would have been possible for example to include its 
witness or even witnesses this week so that their witness 
or their witnesses or at least one of them could well have 
been able to testify soon after Mr Williams but they did not 
10 
make such an application. 
 
If they had made such an application and such an 
arrangement could have been made and had been made it 
is clear that its version could have been articulated by its 
own witness maybe the same day as Mr Williams or the 
following day. 
 
The fact that that is not going to happen is because 
Bain elected not to make that application. 
2. To the extent that Bain has put its version in the 
affidavits with regard to Mr Williams’ evidence when the 
20 
evidence leader leads Mr Williams he will put Bain’s 
version to Mr Williams for him to comment on it and 
therefore the essential features of Bain’s version will be 
put to Mr Williams and the public will know what Bain’s 
version is or response is to Mr Williams evidence. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 11 of 319 
 
 
Of course if Bain decides to apply for leave to 
testify and that leave is granted and there is no reason 
why it would not be granted generally speaking when there 
is a witness who implicates them in a serious manner then 
Bain would get a chance to put its version. 
 
The upshot of all of this is that  
1. Any unfairness that Bain believes will flow from the 
fact that it cannot publish its – or it does not – or it is 
now allowed to publish its affidavits or a summary of 
its affidavits while Mr Williams is giving evidence one 
10 
will be mitigated by the fact that its version will be put 
to Mr Williams.  I say mitigated but actually it seems 
to me that there will be no unfairness because its 
version will be known publicly.  It will be put to Mr 
Williams 
at 
least 
the 
essential 
features 
of 
its 
response but also if there is any unfairness it seems 
to me to flow from Bain’s own failure to apply for 
leave to adduce evidence because as I have said if it 
had done so and it had sought to make sure that its 
witness gave evidence as soon as possible after Mr 
20 
Williams has given evidence that could well have 
been arranged.  That – that arrangement was not 
done flows from the fact that Bain did not take the 
initiative to apply for leave to testify or adduce 
evidence and did not make those arrangements. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 12 of 319 
 
In the past it has happened in this commission that 
kind of arrangement has been made and in this regard I 
want to refer to the Aviation work stream where implicated 
persons were given an opportunity to testify as the 
witnesses that were implicating them were testifying or 
soon as – soon as possible thereafter. 
  
In these circumstances I am of the opinion that this 
is not a case in which I should provide the written 
permission 
contemplated 
in 
Regulation 
11.3 
A 
and 
accordingly I decline to provide such permission. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Yes 
I 
will 
now 
just 
make 
an 
announcement.   
 
I have previously said that the President of the 
Republic President Ramaphosa will appear before the 
commission at some stage and that he had indicated that 
he would be ready to come and testify and be questioned 
about any matters that are being investigated by the 
commission once I had determined the dates. 
 
I have now determined the dates when he will 
20 
appear and I deem it appropriate that I should make this 
announcement publicly. 
 
I have determined four days – the dates are 22 and 
23 April and 28 and 29 April.  On the 22 n d and 23 r d of April 
those dates are effectively provided for the ruling party the 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 13 of 319 
 
ANC because I have also indicated this commission cannot 
complete its work without the ruling party also coming to 
give evidence and deal with certain matters and I was 
assured by its President that it would come and it was – 
was just prepared to do that. 
 
I understand that President Ramaphosa will testify 
representing the African National Congress but I have 
indicated that from the commission’s side the President will 
have to testify as President of the country and former 
Deputy President of the country but it is up to the ANC to 
10 
provide its witnesses but I understand that he will lead that 
delegation as well in his capacity as President of the ruling 
party. 
 
But the dates of 28 and 29 April that is when 
President Ramaphosa will be testifying in his capacity as 
President of the country. 
 
So I thought I should just make that announcement 
so that the public is aware.  
 
Yes we may proceed. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you Chair. Chair before we 
20 
continue with the resumption of Mr Williams’ evidence as 
you will know there are two further SARS witnesses who 
have been scheduled to testify today Mr Symington and Mr 
Van Loggerenberg both were required to be here at ten 
o’clock this morning and because of the way that events 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 14 of 319 
 
unfolded yesterday Mr Williams’ evidence is not yet 
complete and will still take some time. So the request 
Chair is for you to excuse the witnesses until further 
notice.  We will be in touch with their legal representatives 
and let them know our estimation of when – when it is that 
they will be required but we would just ask that the Chair 
formerly excuse them from continuing in attendance right 
now. 
 
The second issue is that there are a number of my 
learned 
friends 
who 
are 
here 
who 
represent 
those 
10 
witnesses in addition there is a colleague who represents 
the State Security Agency and I believe that they would 
like to place themselves on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay one I will excuse those who – the 
witnesses 
for 
today 
who 
need 
to 
be 
excused 
from 
attendance at the moment and they will be advised by Mr 
Franklin through their legal representatives in terms of 
when they should come back.  So that is done. 
 
And then the legal representatives who need to 
place themselves on record you may do so from where you 
20 
are if your mic is working.  
ADV FOURIE:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV FOURIE:  My name is Greg Fourie I am an advocate 
at the Johannesburg Bar and I represent Mr Symington. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 15 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you. 
ADV HOTZ:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV HOTZ:  My name is Bernard Hotz from Werksmans 
Attorneys I represent Mr Van Loggerenberg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Okay are we 
done?  Is there somebody else?  Oh you need a mic that is 
working?   
ADV MAHLATE:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
10 
ADV MAHLATE:   My name is – my name is Ntete Philip 
Mahlate I appear together with my learned colleague 
00:27:57.  We are here on behalf of Security Agency South 
Africa but it (inaudible).  There are submissions that were 
made in fact we did have submissions.  I am not too sure if 
the Chairperson would have seen this application? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have seen the application yes. 
ADV MAHLATE:   My instruction or rather our instruction is 
to address the Chairperson insofar as the concerns that 
are raising up. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Do not do that now because we are 
not going to deal with Mr Van Loggerenberg’s evidence 
now.  I think once we are done with Mr Williams’ evidence 
we can then look at that application. 
ADV MAHLATE:   Thank you Chairperson. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 16 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you.   Are we done 
with legal representatives who wish to place themselves on 
record?  It looks like we are done.  Okay Mr Franklin. 
ADV NGOJANA:  Chair I appear today for Mr Williams. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where are you? 
ADV NGOJANA:   I am right behind – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NGOJANA:   It is Advocate Ngojana. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV NGOJANA:   I appeared before you previously when 
10 
the matter was postponed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes were you here yesterday? 
ADV NGOJANA:   No yesterday I was not in [?]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were not here oh okay. 
ADV NGOJANA:   My attorney was here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I was wondering how I missed your 
presence. 
ADV NGOJANA:   Apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright thank you.  Thank you.  
Yes. 
20 
ADV GOODMAN:  Chair Isabel Goodman.  Mr Cockrell and 
I were here and remain on record for Bain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay no thank you.  Okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you Chair one matter of 
procedure.  We intend calling Mr Symington next and so I 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 17 of 319 
 
would ask that the – any such application as need to be 
argued in relation to Mr Van Loggerenberg take place in 
...[indistinct – word cut] ... to him being due to give 
evidence.  So just to let my learned friend know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And we will keep in touch with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   In order to let him know what our 
estimate is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Or when that is likely to be. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And the – our also ongoing 
interactions between the Commission and the agency in an 
attempt to reach some accommodation that will a need for 
an application but we will obviously report on that to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes.  No, no.  That is fine.  I would 
have imagined that the kind of arrangements that were 
made previously when there was evidence concerning the 
State Security Agency, you would have been easy to agree 
20 
upon but I will leave it to the parties to talk about it. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright.  If we may then call 
Mr Williams to continue his testimony? 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 18 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Good morning, Mr Williams. 
MR WILLIAMS:   Good morning, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The oath you took yesterday will 
continue to apply today. 
MR WILLIAMS:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ATHOL WILLIAMS:   (s.u.o) 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Franklin. 
EXAMINATION 
BY 
ADV 
FRANKLIN 
SC 
(RESUMES):   
Thank you.  Good morning, Mr Williams. 
10 
MR WILLIAMS:   Good morning, Mr Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   We continue with your testimony.  
You will recall that yesterday we had reached the point 
where I have led you through the various operational and 
other strategic plans that had been compiled by Bain South 
Africa in relation to the restructuring of the South African 
economy and also certain plans in respect of SARS itself.  
Do you recall that? 
MR WILLIAMS:   I do, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And I had asked you to indicate to 
20 
the Chair whether in your experience that was an example 
of typical CEO coaching or not. 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct Chair.  I recall that. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright.  I would like to move on from 
that and I would like to deal with a topic which relates to 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 19 of 319 
 
Bain’s knowledge of Mr Moyane’s appointment before that 
was announced publicly.   
 
And to that end, may I ask you, please, to firstly 
turn to AW-67 which appears at page 420 of the SARS 
Bundle 01.  So I would be principle in SARS Bundle 01 
until I tell you otherwise.  Do you have page 420? 
MR WILLIAMS:   I do, yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   That is a document which we 
referred to yesterday.  Just to remind you.  It was 
Mr Massone’s partner ’s self-assessment in December of 
10 
2013.  And if I could ask you to look, please, at paragraph 
2 on page 421? 
MR WILLIAMS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Do you have that? 
MR WILLIAMS:   I do, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes.  The second sentence reads as 
follows: 
“The person we prepared the document with 
and we pitched to the SA President is most 
likely to be appointed as Commissioner in the 
20 
next 
few 
weeks/months 
and 
they 
will 
be 
assisting them should he get the job...” 
 
Just stop there.  It would appear from this that 
Bain had information in December of 2013 that Mr Moyane 
was likely to be appointed as the new SARS Commissioner.  
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 20 of 319 
 
Is that your understanding? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is how I read it, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Then would you look, please, at AW-
86 which is on page 470.   
MR WILLIAMS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   That is an email chain.  At the 
bottom, 
it 
is 
Mr 
Franzen 
who 
sends 
an 
email 
to 
Mr Massone on the 4 t h of April 2014 and he says: 
“Ciao.  Just wanted to check how your “big 
meeting” went yesterday.  Take care...” 
10 
 
There is then a response from Mr Massone to 
Mr Franzen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Franklin.  I am looking at 
page 470.  Is that the right page? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   That is right.  470. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I referred the witness first to the 
bottom of the page, which is the first short email and then I 
am looking at the middle of the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay now I can see... 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Massone 
responds to the enquiry.  
“Thank you, Fabrice(?), it went very well...” 
 
And then the first dash is: 
“- SARS is...” 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 21 of 319 
 
 
It looks like Pe-go-go(?) [phonetically].   Sorry: 
“SARS is a go, right after the elections. 
Central Procurement Agency:  He loves it.  
Wants an implementation plan.  Wants to 
accelerate Phoenix. 
- Asked us to organise a workshop with the 
new Cabinet of ministries after the elections 
(sort of new strategy by a sector, plus-
minus, RDO/mobilisation.  
So I would say very well.  I will update the 
10 
team on next call...” 
 
In 
the 
context 
of 
your 
analyses 
of 
the 
information provided to you, can you elucidate what is 
being said here? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, my understanding of this meeting 
that is referenced here is a meeting between Mr Massone 
and former President, Jacob Zuma that happened and 
obviously during the meeting a number of things is 
discussed and he is giving an update to his team of what 
was discussed, what was agreed. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   H’m, h’m. 
MR WILLIAMS:   So it certainly seems to me that from that 
meeting Mr Massone is giving the impression that SARS is 
a go and my understanding of what he means by SARS is a 
go is that Bain was expecting to be doing work with SARS 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 22 of 319 
 
and they would given some assurance of that.   
 
Also – or also in the sense that Bain was 
expecting that Mr Moyane was going to be appointed as 
the Commissioner and that seems to be that is a go.  In 
fact, there are two points to be reversed.   
 
The first is that, he seemed to get assurance 
that Mr Moyane was going to be the Commissioner and 
therefore Bain would be given that work.  But I think the 
points below that, I think make reference to some of those 
plans we discussed yesterday.   
10 
 
So by this point, Mr Massone and Bain had 
presented the Central Procurement Agency plan and we 
see that the President seems to like that, the once 
implementation plan which indicates that the President 
supported the concept of this that Bain had presented and 
now want to move towards actually making it happen.   
 
I think the reference to Phoenix, we discussed 
yesterday.  So those plans we saw presented to the 
President three, four, five times and he wants to move 
along with that.  I think the last point, just RDO, is typically 
20 
– it is a Results Delivery Office.  The Programme 
Management office.   
 
But that begins to yet indicate this point about 
let us get on with things now.  We have discussed the 
concept.  So we now want to act.   
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 23 of 319 
 
 
So they are talking about Bains setting up a 
Programme Management office to put some of these plans 
into action and particularly to start with the workshop with 
Cabinet Ministers to discuss some of these plans that have 
been presented to the President.   
 
Chair, that is how I understand this email in the 
context of what I know. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Is that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second Mr Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Sorry, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The technicians, if they could switch off 
the screen here?  It does not...  [Speaker ’s voice drops – 
unclear]  The witness is here.  I cannot look at him.  Yes, 
okay.  Let us proceed.  I see, Mr Williams, that Mr Franzen 
– I am not sure which one is the surname and which one is 
the name. 
MR WILLIAMS:   Fabrice Franzen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  He refers to the meeting that was 
supposed to have taken place the day before as the “big 
meeting”.  I wonder whether you could be troubled to go 
20 
back to that schedule of meetings Mr Massone and the 
President and other people to see whether there was any 
meeting on 3 April 2014 that is reflected because the date 
for this “big meeting” would have been 3 April since this 
email is on the 4 t h.   
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 24 of 319 
 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, I must check the notes.  I would 
have cross-referenced it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, we – it can be checked for 
later.  It could just be interesting. 
MR WILLIAMS:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, if – just to direct the witness in 
order to answer the Chair ’s enquiry.  The tracker table is at 
page 306.  On page 307, there is an indication of a 
meeting on the 3 r d  o f April 2014 at the bottom of the page.  
Do you see that? 
10 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct Chair.  I do see it.  In fact, 
there it confirms what was discussed was the workshop 
with the Cabinet Ministers and the Central Procurement 
Agency.  So cross-referenced. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  Then, please, if I could 
ask you to look at AW-106, page 572? 
MR WILLIAMS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   It is another email string.  The first 
of those emails at the bottom of the page is from 
20 
Mr Massone to Mr Beaumont and copying others, dated the 
28 t h of August 2014.   
 
And he says: 
“Guys, just had a call and heard that the SARS 
announcement 
should 
happen 
tomorrow 
or 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 25 of 319 
 
Monday. 
Meeting later in the office to discuss also a 
procurement process, Fabrice, Stefano(?), how 
many teams do we have?...” 
 
And then he continues.  Then in the middle of 
the page is an email from Stefano(?) to Massone of being 
others, dated the 28 t h of August 2014. 
“Vittorio, that is great news.  The latest 
thinking was to start with one team, et cetera, 
for three months and do fundamentally two 
10 
things.   
1)  Run a full operational/strategic assessment 
of SARS. 
2)  Assist Tom in starting properly his new role 
(direct CEO support work). 
We 
will 
then 
be 
able, 
based 
on 
the 
operational/strategic assessment to build up a 
platform for a broader SARS Transformational 
Programme (6 to 12-months plan)...” 
 
I am just pausing there.  It would appear that 
20 
Bain 
had 
received 
information 
that 
the 
SARS 
announcement was to take place in... 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct Chair.  That is how I read 
the email. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Could I ask you?  At this stage was 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 26 of 319 
 
this news public that Mr Moyane was going to be appointed 
as Commissioner? 
MR WILLIAMS:   In August of 2014, I do not think so Chair.  
I think it was announced in September of 2014. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright.  So it certainly was not in 
December of 2013, the document I took you to, or April of 
2014? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct Chair.  It was not public 
who the new Commissioner would be. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Could I ask you for your comment on 
10 
the fact that Bain as a consulting company appear to have 
been privy to information about an appointment of the new 
Commissioner of SARS before the public of South Africa 
new about it? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, I mean, I think that is highly 
unusual, I guess for anyone to know something that has 
not been announced publicly, something of this, the 
seniority of this person, the importance of the role.  So I 
think for any of us to have known that, I would think, would 
be problematic.   
20 
 
The fact that a management consulting firm – the 
fact that a non-South African management consulting firm 
staffed by non-South African seemed to this non-public 
information and access to it before any of us...  I 
personally, as a South African, find it problematic and I 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 27 of 319 
 
think in terms of normal business practice that that also 
seems strange to me.   
 
You know, one could argue:  Well, you know, 
maybe someone bringing a friend inside the presidency 
could have known but my understanding from this trail of 
events, it seems they had access to a channel of 
information into our public institutions where they go this 
information. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes.  Then, yesterday you made a 
comment on one of the emails which I showed you and you 
10 
said that it appeared that Bain had an insider at SARS who 
was providing information and you identified that person as 
Mr Jonas Makwakwa. 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Please would you look at paragraph 
113, page 58 of your affidavit? 
MR WILLIAMS:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, it is – I guess, you mean 
page 58 of the bundle? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   At page 58 of...  Yes, indeed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, of the bundle. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   That is correct.  I am sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And that is at page 58 of the bundle, 
appears paragraph 113 of your affidavit.  Do you have 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 28 of 319 
 
that? 
MR WILLIAMS:   I do, yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  You say there that: 
“The level of specifically with which Bain was 
able to offer action, guidance to Moyane would 
only be possible if access to inside information 
at SARS and as it turns out, this is exactly 
what happened.  
Franzen indicates in an email to Kennedy on 
3 September 2018, that Bain had multiple 
10 
meetings 
with 
Jonas 
Makwakwa, 
Head 
of 
Internal Audit, SARS and that Makwakwa was 
at “deep throat” relying on information about 
events at SARS to Bain and Moyane...” 
 
Now if I could just stop there.  Would you turn, 
please, to AW-96, page 509? 
MR WILLIAMS:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that 509? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Correct.  That is an email dated 
3 September 2018 from Mr Franzen to Steward Min and 
20 
Chris Kennedy.  Now this, of course, is at the time of the 
Bain Investigation and... the Baker McKinsey Investigation.  
Is that correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct, Chair, and the Nugent 
Commission. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 29 of 319 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Am I correct that this reflects 
information that have been uncovered by the investigation 
by Baker McKenzie on behalf of Bain? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct, Chair.  So ...[indistinct] 
had been asked to send the legal team his recollection of 
events and to this email he sent to them. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Please look at the fourth bullet 
point.  So Mr Franzen reports to these two members of 
Bain Legal: 
“In 2014, Vittorio also had multiple meetings 
10 
with Jonas Makwakwa the future Head of 
BIAT...” 
Do you know what that is? 
MR WILLIAMS:   It is Business and Individual Tax. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Is that at SARS? 
MR WILLIAMS:   At SARS.  The largest unit within SARS in 
terms of tax portion(?), Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   At that time, Head of Internal Audit 
at SARS.  First bullet point: 
“These meetings were with Vittorio, Moyane 
20 
and Makwakwa. 
They also happened in plain sight of the 
office...” 
 
And then the second bullet point: 
“As 
Vittorio 
indicated 
during 
witness 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 30 of 319 
 
preparation, Makwakwa was playing the sort of 
"deep throat” on events...” 
 
I think that is meant to me.   
“...happening 
at 
SARS 
and 
feeding 
into 
Moyane...” 
 
So that would appear to confirm what you have 
said in your statement at 113.  And your comment on Bain 
having access into a state organisation via a “deep throat” 
in preparation for an assignment there? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, firstly.  Bain had made it and 
10 
continuous to assert that all these materials prepared for 
Mr Moyane, was based on public information.  So it was 
outside in the – call them out and in document.  This all 
public information and so that they were using to prepare 
this document.   
 
And as indicated yesterday, you can see from 
some of the materials, it appears that there is actual 
information no one outside of SARS could possible know 
and so there was a case of specificity.  And as we see from 
these emails and one document we reviewed yesterday, 
20 
which is actually a document prepared by Mr Jonas 
Makwakwa which was fed to Bain.   
 
So it certainly – the first idea that Bain only 
relied on public information, to me seems to be incorrect 
because 
here 
is 
evidence 
that 
they 
had 
access 
to 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 31 of 319 
 
information from the inside of SARS.  Here we got 
Mr Fabrice Franzen who led Bain’s operational project day-
to-day at SARS saying that Mr Massone had met with 
Mr Makwakwa multiple times.   
 
Here, 
Mr 
Massone 
said 
he 
only 
met 
Mr 
Makwakwa once in discussing personal matters.  And this 
phrase “deep throat” which I find quite disturbing as well 
that in Mr Franzen’s mind Mr Makwakwa was feeding 
information multiple times to Mr Moyane and to Bain.   
 
Chair, the fact that and to the evidence leader ’s 
10 
question.  I am no legal expert but from my sense is, that 
someone, a senior executive in a public institution was 
feeding sensitive information to outsiders, to me, it is 
troubling.   
 
I also understand that it is illegal to do that 
because of SARS.  So I think, my interpretation of this is, 
that is – this is troublesome.  This is worrying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I see that this email also reflects that 
20 
they knew that Mr Makwakwa was the future Head of BAIT, 
which you say is Business and Individual Tax.  Is that 
right?  A section in – at SARS.  Is that right? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, I read it differently to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 32 of 319 
 
MR WILLIAMS:   I think he is writing with hindsight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, with hindsight. 
MR WILLIAMS:   He is writing with hindsight.  So he is 
saying, Makwakwa, the person who would later become the 
Head of BAIT. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  Well, if that is the inferences, this 
certainly change it to me because when you talk the future, 
the future is what will come after the day which you are 
talking.  Mr Franklin, is that your understanding as well? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, I understand Chair but this is 
10 
the Bain people writing in 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes. 
ADV 
FRANKLIN 
SC: 
 
 
What 
they 
are 
reflecting 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Ja. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   ...is what the original position is 
held by Mr Makwakwa and what he ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  Ja, I think you are right.  So he 
is talking about the person who would later become the 
head of the section? 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is just way of putting it that may have 
been confusing. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes.  One has to keep an eye on the 
date ...[intervenes]  
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 33 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the date, yes, ja. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   ...between what is the original email 
and what is produced in the Baker McKinsey Investigation, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no.  I think the date solves it.  
Ja, okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   In your experience.  What would be 
the normal source of information for a consulting company 
like Bain in relation to a potential future assignment? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, it would be public information and 
10 
it would be based on the experience of consultants who 
would have worked – who have worked at that organisation 
in the past.  Even that is very sensitive, the latter.  So if I 
worked at a client, I agree with the client that I have 
gained there is confidential.   
 
So typically as a consultant, I would form a view, 
very high-level view of what my take-aways are rather than 
the details.  But it would public information and it would be 
based on the consultant’s experience in that organisation 
or in that industry.   
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  I would like to move on 
to another topic which is the tender procedure which 
preceded Bain’s appointment.   
 
Just to remind you of the dates.  Mr Moyane was 
ultimately appointed as the new Commissioner on the 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 34 of 319 
 
23 r d  of September 2014.  SARS issued a request for 
proposals on the 12 t h of September 2014 and Bain was 
awarded its first contract assignment in January of 2015.   
 
Against that background, could I ask you please 
to turn to Annexure AW-108 at page 580? 
MR WILLIAMS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Firstly, if you could look at page 581 
which is part of the same annexure. 
MR WILLIAMS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   This is an email from Marilyn 
10 
Batonga from Baker McKinsey dated 22 November 2018 to, 
amongst others, you and the attachments are Project Arrow 
– the subject is Project Arrow Update.  And there are 
various attachments including Project Arrow Review Stats 
and 2018.11.21 Index of Documents for Client review.  Is 
this another one of the updates you received from Baker 
McKinsey regarding the progress of their investigation? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct Chair.  This was the way 
Baker McKinsey send updates.  You just... ja, a way to 
summarise about their progress and investigation. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And what was Project Arrow? 
MR WILLIAMS:   So Project Arrow was Baker McKinsey’s 
names for the investigation that Bain had to conduct into 
the work at the SARS and other SOE’s.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright.  So this is much the same as 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 35 of 319 
 
the tracker document scenario? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Please then turn back to page 580.  
That is headed:  Project Arrow, Index of Key-Documents, 
Privileged and Confidential.  And then there is some 
handwritten annotation.  Can I direct your attention to the 
bottom block on the page?  On the far left-hand side there 
is a date.  It looks to be 25/092014. 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And then it says under document:  
10 
Diary entry in Franzen’s calendar.  And then it is s.rfp.  
And then in the far right column, additional comments, the 
following is said.  Can I just before I read out that 
comment?  Who is the author, as you understand it, who is 
making these comments? 
MR WILLIAMS:   This would be an investigator from Baker 
McKinsey, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright.  What is recorded by the 
investigator is: 
“Franzen confirmed during his interview that 
20 
he did in fact draft the “South African Revenue 
Service Strategy and Operations Review – 
Request for Proposal” dated October 2013...” 
 
Do you know what document is being referred to 
there? 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 36 of 319 
 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, it appears that Mr Franzen had 
drafted the request for proposal that SARS would issue to 
proposals to do work at SARS. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Would you please turn to page 574 
which is AW-170? 
MR WILLIAMS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Is that the document which is 
referred to in the Strategy Review document that I referred 
you to earlier at AW-108? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct Chair.  That is how I 
10 
understand it.  This was the document that was referred to 
by Baker McKinsey’s investigators. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And just for the sake of completeness.  
The document is...  South African Revenue Services that 
would 
be 
an 
operation... 
 
Request 
for 
proposal, 
October 2014.  [Speaker is not clear – voice very soft.] 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, Chair.  So the Chair has 
read out the heading of the document at page 574.  Could I 
ask you then to go to the content of that document and 
would you, in summary, tell the Chair what it deals with, 
20 
subject matter wise? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, it is – the document describes 
quite a comprehensive organisational and strategy review 
of SARS and a redesign of SARS.  So it talks – he talks – 
starts 
from 
– 
it 
describes 
the 
scope 
of 
work 
and 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 37 of 319 
 
deliverables that starts with thinking and looking at SARS 
collection capability and how that can be improved.  It 
talks about how SARS’ operational performance can be 
enhanced.   
 
It 
then 
– 
there 
is 
a 
section 
of 
SARS’ 
infrastructure and how that can be improved.  And it main 
draft as questions.  So is the IT infrastructure adequate to 
sustain SARS in that context.  And then there is a section 
on organisation and governance.   
 
So my understanding of this document is.  Well, 
10 
firstly, it is something that you would expect SARS to draft 
not BAIN but it covers a broad spectrum of end-to-end 
almost of the things you would think about if you are going 
to restructure...   
 
Let me take that back Chair.  If you are going to 
think about massively and significantly improving the 
performance of an organisation.  But of course, it also 
includes parts of thinking about SARS’ structure.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright.  Can I take you back then to 
paragraph 1, Context for a Request for Proposal?  There is 
20 
some background in the fourth paragraph it is said: 
“In this context and in order to help the new 
Commissioner, 
frame 
the 
next 
of 
SARS 
transformation agenda. 
The service it is considering the support of an 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 38 of 319 
 
external third party consulting firm with the 
following three objectives...” 
 
So 
it 
would 
appear 
that 
the 
document 
contemplates the appointment of an external consultant.  Is 
that correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   You have dealt in paragraph – with 
paragraph – the scope of works and the deliverables, then 
look at page 577, selection process and criteria.   
“It is recorded this process will be a closed tender.  
10 
This RFP has been to a selected list of consulting 
firms that are part of SARS consulting panel.” 
And then it gives a number of characteristics or criteria of 
the consulting firms, as I understand it, that they must 
meet.  Is that how you see it? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And then at the bottom of the page a 
number of dates are given for the selection process, RFP 
issuance, that is in the future, Q & A session, proposal 
submission date, engagement to start no later than 10 
20 
November 2014.  Your comment on Bain appears on this 
document to be one of the potential consulting firms that 
might be appointed pursuant to a request for proposal 
process, your comment on it having drafted this request for 
proposal? 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 39 of 319 
 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, I find that again improper in two 
senses.  One, it is anticompetitive that one of the potential 
consultants, among others, is able to draft the rules of the 
game effectively for they are going to judged, so that is 
anticompetitive.   
 
Again, secondly, problematic for me because we are 
dealing with public institution in SARS that SARS could 
allow Bain to draft this document which then guided the 
actual RFP which SARS had issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it is interesting that that is what 
10 
seems to have happened here because it is not the first 
time I hear evidence of that kind.  I heard similar evidence 
in relation to allegations of corruption relating to BOSASA 
in 
its 
dealings 
with 
the 
Department 
of 
Correctional 
Services also where a potential service provider is allowed 
to basically prepare the request for proposal or the 
specifications [indistinct – dropping voice].  So, yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Following on the 
Chair ’s theme, would you look at AW109, page 583?  This 
is an email from Mr Massone to Mr Mehan dated the 18 
20 
November 2014 and I direct your attention to the second 
paragraph.  Before I read that out do you know what the 
subject matter of this email is? 
MR WILLIAMS:   As I understand the context here, Chair, 
Bain was expecting to be doing work at Telkom or 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 40 of 319 
 
expecting – yes, expecting to be doing work at Telkom and 
Mr Massone is trying to get his boss to I think strong-arm 
some of their colleagues around the 
world to send 
capabilities because Bain did not have the capabilities in 
South Africa to do the work that Telkom required. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   How do you discern from this email 
that it relates to Telkom?  There is a reference to an RFP 
for that famous separation project is out and actually 
includes the national broadband plan.  Is that…? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct, Chair.  Separation project 
10 
was one of the projects that Bain had been expecting to 
come from Telkom and, of course, talking about broadband 
would be linked to a telecommunications company. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright in that context of a Telkom 
request for proposal, I direct your attention to paragraph 2 
which says: 
“As much as it is “designed for us” (and allowing for 
a piece of work to be done by the Deloitte 
regulatory team) we need to make sure they feel 
comfortable with TM and our expertise (and we 
20 
know that we cannot claim to have done much on 
this specific topic)” 
The reference to designed for us, what do you understand 
that to convey? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, I understand that to be that this 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 41 of 319 
 
RFP for work to be done at Telkom, Bain described as that 
RFP was designed for Bain and so again, this idea of Bain 
influencing RFPs from public institutions seem to have 
been fairly widespread.  I think also relayed to that, this 
idea 
– 
you 
know, 
organisations 
hire 
management 
consultants 
for 
their 
particular 
expertise 
because 
organisations have people who should be running their 
businesses.   Here you go outside when you want some 
particular expertise and here you have Bain admitting they 
do not have that expertise and so they are trying to find it 
10 
somewhere else in the Bain system because, like he says, 
and my understanding is, “as much it is designed for us” 
meaning we are almost assured that we are going to get 
this work but just to kind of show that we have got some 
people who know something about telecommunications or 
broadband. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, then please go to paragraph 
128 on page 64 of this bundle.  What you have done is to 
collect 
together 
various 
examples 
highlighting 
the 
engagements between SARS and Bain around procurement, 
20 
is that correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Going to the first subparagraph you 
refer to an email of – sorry, it is AW112 at page 590.  So if 
you could just keep your finger at paragraph 128 but turn 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 42 of 319 
 
to page 590 and there is a request at the bottom of the 
page from Ms Mogopo Diyoka (?), dated 2 December 2014 
and she asks Mr Massone as follows: 
“Hi Vittorio, just a note to request any current 
public 
entity 
relationships 
and 
references 
you 
have.” 
That is a request for information at a time prior to the RFP 
having been issued, is that correct?  
MR WILLIAMS:    That is correct, Chair.  You would 
typically ask for references, even a higher organisation so 
10 
that you can speak to others who have worked with them to 
just establish their credentials. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right.  Then in 128.2 on page 64 
you make reference to an email of the 4 December 2014 
which is the next annexure AW113 at page 592. Again an 
email string.  I direct your attention firstly to the bottom of 
the page, Massone’s email to Mr Sipho Maseka dated the 4 
December 2014 and what Mr Massone says in the second 
paragraph: 
“I received a call from SARS (the Acting COO) who 
20 
told me that they would like to use Telkom’s 
contract to give a mandate to Bain.  Apparently law 
(or practice) says that they can piggyback another 
SOE.  This will enable an immediate start avoiding 
long and complicated tender processes.” 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 43 of 319 
 
Stopping 
there, 
do 
you 
understand 
the 
reference 
to 
piggybacking on Telkom? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, not an area of my expertise but I 
do understand that there are provisions among – for state 
entities that if once that entity has a contract with a 
provider, another state entity can piggyback on that 
contract to procure services from that provider.  So I think 
this was - the attempt here is to piggyback off Telkom’s 
contract for SARS. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, as it turns out was that method 
10 
used? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, it was not used, it was determined 
by, in fact, Mr Maseko’s and Telkom people say that 
piggyback arrangement is not appropriate or is not – it is 
applicable to Telkom so SARS could not use that avenue. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   As it transpires, Bain were awarded 
their first contract in January of 2015.  Could I ask you 
please to go to AW130 at page 630?  That is a document 
which is headed: 
“The Bain Team brings considerable experience and 
20 
expertise to the table.” 
Do you know what this document’s purpose is and who it 
was sent to? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Mr Chair, this document would have been 
part of Bain’s submission to SARS in response to the RFP 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 44 of 319 
 
and so this is Bain demonstrating or apparently trying to 
demonstrate their expertise that might be applicable to the 
work at SARS. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright, if we look at the members of 
the team who are reflected here, we have Mr Massone, Mr 
Franzen and Neville Eisenberg and then a Mr Bour, who 
have heard of before.  Do you know those gentlemen? 
MR WILLIAMS:   I know the first two, Mr Massone and Mr 
Franzen, I have not met the other two, the last two. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Are you able to comment on the 
10 
expertise and appropriateness of this team in relation to an 
assignment to a country’s revenue collecting authority, 
SARS? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, when you conduct a consulting 
project, the main source of the expertise on the consultant 
team derives from the partners on most senior people in 
the team.  So if I am looking to hire a consulting team I 
would look at their partners first and so I would be looking 
at Mr Massone and Mr Franzen to see what expertise do 
they have working with tax authorities around the world, in 
20 
Africa or actually at SARS.  And if you look at the expertise 
of Mr Massone and Mr Franzen there is no apparent 
expertise of working in tax agencies anywhere.  My 
understanding 
of 
Mr 
Massone’s 
expertise 
is 
in 
telecommunications, my understanding of Mr Franzen is in 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 45 of 319 
 
financial services but mainly in banking, that is not tax 
authority expertise. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright, I wish to take you out of 
bundle SARS 01 for a moment and ask you to look at SARS 
bundle 03.  Do you have that? 
MR WILLIAMS:   I do, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, please look at page 196 
of SARS03. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that 196? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Correct.  Mr Williams, that is an 
10 
affidavit deposed to by Ms Diyorka on the 16 February 
2021.  You have seen that document? 
MR WILLIAMS:   I have, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   You will recall that Ms Diyorka is the 
person who asked for references in AW112. 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And she was at the time SARS’ 
executive – from SARS’ executive procurement department.   
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I just want to put this affidavit to you 
20 
because Ms Diyorka has set out her version of events 
specifically 
in 
relation 
to 
paragraph 
128.1 
of 
your 
statement and the essence of Ms Diyorka’s intention is that 
she denies any irregularity in relation to having asked for 
the references that are referred to in her email.  If you 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 46 of 319 
 
could just read the affidavit to yourself and please give the 
Chair such comment as you have. 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, what Ms Diyorka says, she is 
referring to a paragraph in my affidavit.  So in my affidavit 
I 
say 
it 
seems 
problematic 
that 
Ms 
Diyorka 
sought 
references from Bain even before the RFP process had 
begun, even before SARS issued the RFP, she was already 
seeking references from Bain so why would she be seeking 
references from Bain if the RFP had not even started and 
that was a statement in my affidavit.  Her response is that 
10 
she makes no reference to the RFP process in her email to 
Bain.  So she discounts my reference to an RFP process 
and she is actually right, she makes no reference to RFP 
process in her email.  It does not change the fact that she 
is still asking a service provider for references and her 
explanation is that she was actually asking for references 
because they were still busy pursuing the piggyback 
avenue.  So she does not deny, in my understanding that 
she sought these references for procurement purposes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It has to be so, on her own version. 
20 
MR WILLIAMS:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR WILLIAMS:   And she does say she was – yes, she 
does not deny it was for procurement purposes.  It still 
raises the question of why would SARS be seeking 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 47 of 319 
 
references from Bain before work had been done or any 
tender process or contracting process had begun.  It seems 
that they already decided as early as 2 December 2014 
that Bain would be their consultant. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright, thank you.  In a word is 
there anything you wish to change in relation to what you 
have said in paragraph 128.1 having read Ms Diyorka’s 
affidavit? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, the essence of the paragraph 
would not change which was that it appears SARS had 
10 
already decided that they were going to procure services 
from Bain for this restructuring work.  I make reference to 
the RFP process but obviously there was a channel being 
sought even before the RFP process trying to get Bain in 
as the consultants. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright, could I then take you back to 
128 in SARS bundle 01 which is where we were before we 
deviated to Ms Diyorka’s affidavit.  What you have done 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we going back to his affidavit? 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   You have set out a chronological list 
of various interactions relating to procurement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was the page? 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 48 of 319 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   64. 
CHAIRPERSON:   64, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And you can confirm there were 
various phases to the Bain assignment at SARS. 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright, please look at 128.3 where  
you say that on 12 March 2015: 
“Massone 
sent 
an 
internal 
mail 
to 
colleagues 
informing them that Jonas at SARS…” 
Presumably Makwakwa. 
10 
“…informs 
him 
that 
Moyane 
met 
with 
SARS’ 
procurement department and that he does not see 
problem.” 
And this is a reference to AW116.  What do you make of 
that and do you know what context if being referred to 
here? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, it might be, if I may, to perhaps 
take a small step back just to describe the overall 
procurement process, if I may? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Okay. 
20 
MR WILLIAMS:   There was – so the RFP that SARS 
issued in December 2014, that is the RFP that Bain and 
other consulting firms responded to.  That was for a six 
week piece of work which they referred to as the diagnostic 
and the Bid Adjudication Committee at SARS expressed 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 49 of 319 
 
some discomfort with parts of Bain’s proposal – and I have 
seen this from submissions to the Nugent Commission, 
which are public, but they go ahead and agree that Bain 
can be appointed but they make it very clear, they stipulate 
that if there is any additional work SARS must go back to 
the market to open tender and so that is that first piece of 
work, that six week piece of work which started in January 
2015 and by the time we get to this stage, March 2015, 
that piece of work ended.  
 
So now the emails and the discussions are from 
10 
Bain’s side how are we going to extend this and we know 
that Bain ends up working at SARS for 27 months having 
only even been awarded a contract for six weeks.  This 
contract was awarded for 2 point something million rand 
and at the end they were paid R164 million.   
 
So I was very interested to understand what 
changed from being awarded a six week contract to 
working for 27 months and an email like this that in 
paragraph 128.3 gives us some indication of what was 
happening inside SARS because it indicates that the 
20 
Commissioner had gone to speak to the procurement 
people within SARS.  Now I have never worked at SARS, I 
actually have not worked at any government entities but my 
understanding again is of the PFMA and how procurement 
rules work is the procurement department and the legal 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 50 of 319 
 
teams makes those decisions of procurement.  You would  
have not the Commissioner going in and intervening in a 
procurement step.  
 
So here is an email from Makwakwa to Bain saying 
do not worry about this extension, we are going to make a 
plan 
because 
the 
Commissioner 
has 
gone 
to 
see 
procurement. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, then AW117 on page 600 
which is an email from Mr Eisenberg to Massone dated 13 
March 2015. 
10 
MR WILLIAMS:   Sorry, what page? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   It is 600. 
MR WILLIAMS:   And then Mr Eisenberg says to Mr 
Massone: 
“Spoke 
to 
Jonas. 
 
Here 
is 
the 
situation 
on 
procurement: 
-  They have to run the procurement process for 
phase 2, in particular they feel need to be bullet 
proof.  Jonas mentioned they received some 
letters of complaint already from some of the 
20 
losers of the original process.  They believe it 
will take four to six weeks.  In the meantime they 
want to run two of four streams as an extension 
of phase 1 org stream and RDO setup but not 
collection 
full 
potential 
or 
network 
of 
the 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 51 of 319 
 
future/process involvement.” 
Are you able to shed light on what is being discussed 
there? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am trying from my side, Mr Franklin, to 
see where you are reading at 600.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I am sorry, there is an opening 
paragraph: 
“Spoke to Jonas.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Then there is a first bullet point. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Second and third.  I read the first 
three bullet points. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, my interpretation of the email, I 
think two points jump out for me.  The one is that SARS is 
now telling Bain, look, we cannot – we have to run a public 
procurement process if we are going to go into phase 2 to 
continue the work. 
 
But secondly, what they seem to have done and 
20 
become quite clever, they have now said – because the 
first contract was what they called phase one, the six week 
contract.  They are now between Bain and SARS, say well, 
actually, there is phase 1A and phase 1B and so we are not 
extending the contract, it is not phase 2 but we are doing 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 52 of 319 
 
this phase 1B and so we are still covered by the initial 
contract and so they want us – so here you are saying 
SARS want us to run two of our four work streams, so 
continue the work as an extension of phase 1 because it is 
now phase 1B. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright, then AW118 page 602 is a 
further email from Mr Eisenberg to Mr Massone dated 19 
March 2015.  Do you have that?   And he says: 
“Ronald just called to inform me that they have 
decided they need to run an open tender process 
10 
and that no extension is going to be possible.  They 
still aim to be ready to start with the successful 
provider by May 1 s t and he said they still hope that 
we are the winning bidder.” 
So it would appear that they came to a realisation that they 
would have to run a tender process, is that how you 
understand this? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is how I understand it, Chair, which 
again the fact that there are SARS executives all just 
trying 
to 
not 
make 
this 
an 
open 
tender 
process, 
20 
immediately just a natural thinking to be doing.  We had 
the six week contract, it is done, the understanding was we 
need to go back into the market for tender process, there 
should not be a debate about it.  So the fact that the back 
and forth is going on to try and avoid it already for me is 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 53 of 319 
 
problematic but it seems now they have told by their legal 
team or procurement team they have to go to the market in 
open tender but still indicating that still like Bain would be 
the winner.  Open tender process does not have a 
preferred winner, as I understand them. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Then AW119 page 604, from Mr 
Massone to Franzen and others dated 1 April 2015, seems 
we are see-sawing back and forth because now what is 
written is the following: 
“Spoke with Jonas at SARS now, they might have 
10 
found a way to legally resume work without tender 
process.  Commissioner needs to make a final call 
but we should be ready to restart for phase 2 by 
mid-April.” 
Is that your understanding that there is now an attempt to 
engage Bain for another phase without a tender process? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct, Chair, so again indication 
of this internal battle going on and I imagine it is 
executives going to the procurement team trying to find 
ways to move them and they seem to have found a legal 
20 
way to have done that. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Then AW120 at page 606, Mr Bour 
writes to Massone and other on the 9 April 2015 and deals 
with procurement process in the first part of that email.  Do 
you see that? 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 54 of 319 
 
MR WILLIAMS:   I do. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And he says in the second bullet 
point: 
“Jonas does not anticipate any issue, he said “there 
is one person that is making some noise but he is 
not even a voting member”, they have had legal 
advice and it is okay to go through without an RFP.  
He said we should be “ready to run” when the 
decision is made.” 
Your understanding of what stage the parties are at by 9 
10 
April? 
MR WILLIAMS:   chair, it does seem that they have now 
found this “legal way” to move to proceed without going to 
the market, without going to the RFP.  Chair, if I may, Adv 
Franklin will guide me. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes. 
MR WILLIAMS:   I have got some understanding based on 
reviewing the transcripts and submissions to the Nugent 
Commission by National Treasury, Mr Solly Tshitangano of 
what was happening behind the scenes and, if relevant, I 
20 
can share that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR WILLIAMS:   So this legal way that they seem to have 
found was for SARS to declare this Bain project in 
emergency and in fact they invoked some rule that says 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 55 of 319 
 
you can extend the contract if it is an emergency, one.  Or, 
if it is single source.   
 
So if there is only one company in the country that 
can provide these services, you are allowed to then extend 
it and my interpretation is neither was this an emergency, 
restructuring SARS, no one will be saying SARS drastically 
urgently need to be restructured or that Bain was the only 
organisation in the country who could do that.  But that I 
understand from Mr Tshitangano’s testimony was what this 
legal route was. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  And then AW121, page 
608, an email from Mr Bour to Mr Massone on the 9 June 
2016.  Do you know what phase had been reached by this 
stage, 2016? 
MR WILLIAMS:   So, Chair, this is now over a year later 
from the discussion we have just been having.  So this is 
the third phase of Bain’s work.  So initial six weeks, then 
they 
got 
2.6 
million, 
then 
they 
got 
this 
emergency 
extension for a year and a bit and that they charged 150 
million and the now they come to end of that second phase 
20 
and now the question – the problem arises again of who 
they are going to extend it one more time without going to 
the market.   
 
In fact Mr Massone writes an internal email that 
says we cannot go the market because if we do go the 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 56 of 319 
 
market, we know we will lose.  So we have to continue 
here, we have to find a way of extending this contract it 
cannot be to go to the market, it cannot be to a competitive 
tender process.   
 
So this email is now more updates on discussions 
between Bain and SARS around extending this contract. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Could I direct your attention to the 
piece under the heading: 
“Feedback from Ronald. 
Said that we should not … the procurement/legal 
10 
process, they still need to provide feedback to him 
and Jed on the way forward but if they cannot 
formally extend the contract they will copy/paste the 
information in a new agreement.  This will not need 
to 
go 
through 
the 
typical 
process 
with 
RFB, 
Matsebani said there would be a deviation justified 
as in phase 2 [the difference of phase 2 is that they 
have all the documents ready].” 
So your understanding of the way in which the next phase 
was dealt with? 
20 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair so firstly it confirms that they 
figured out some way of justifying a deviation in phase 2. 
Now for phase 3 this reference to Jed, I will not be able to 
say his surname, but that Jed was the head of the customs 
part of SARS.  And so the three phases of work had started 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 57 of 319 
 
with phase 1 was focused on SARS structure and operating 
model, phase 2 was SARS structure and operating model 
and begun to do work on customs.  
And then phase 3 was going to be almost entirely 
work on customs.  So that is the relevance of them saying 
Jed seems to be, you know support this going forward.  But 
how they then did this was very creatively again, of saying 
we cannot go back to the emergency argument or the 
single source argument.  
The argument now was, if we do not do phase 3, 
10 
then phase 1 and phase 2 would become meaningless.  It 
would have no impact on SARS and in fact, it would render 
that as wasteful expenditure, and so our hands are tied, we 
have to do phase 3 otherwise, we have wasted money 
during phase 1 and 2.  There might be many arguments 
why that does not hold water but one is like I just 
described, phase 3 was focused on the customs.  
So even if they did not do phase 3, the work done in 
phase 1 and 2 on the overall SARS structured operating 
model would not have had zero impact.  So it would not 
20 
have been wasteful expenditure but that was according to 
again, National Treasury, the argument Bain put forward 
and Mr Chitten Garno[?] says, National Treasury found 
their hands tied because they did not want to have this 
wasteful expenditure. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 58 of 319 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, so, just to summarise on 
this aspect, was there ever an open tender process that 
was run as far as you know, in relation to phases 2 and 
following? 
MR SYMINGTON:   No, Chair, there was no open tender 
process run. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Chair, I am about to move on to 
another topic, I do not know if that is a convenient time to 
take the adjournment? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you have still about four minutes 
10 
we could either use that or we could adjourn now, I guess 
your indication is that you prefer that we will adjourn now.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay we will adjourn now; we will 
resume at 25 past 11. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Williams we know 
that of course Bain proceeded to do work at SARS and Mr 
Moyane was he commissioner.  I would like to just highlight 
certain aspects of the execution of that mandate and in 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 59 of 319 
 
particular just refer you to what has been dealt with in detail 
by the Nugent Commission that is the resignation or 
termination of a number of senior people. 
 
Firstly would you look at AW95 please.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Which is that page? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  That is at page 5 – 507 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  507. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  In the middle of the page Mr Franzen 
writes to Mr Massone the subject is Alert SARS and the date 
is 3 December 2014 and he says: 
10 
“Good bye Barry Hore…” 
And then the response is Massone to Franzen of the same 
date: 
“Now I am scared by Tom.  This guy was 
supposed to be untouchable and it took Tom 
just a few weeks to make him resign, Scary.” 
Firstly who is Barry Hore? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Mr Chair Barry Hore was the Chief 
Operating Officer of SARS.  His name was mentioned in one 
of the documents that Bain prepared for Mr Moyane saying 
20 
Test BH the COO and so the idea was test Barry Hore.  And 
my sense is the test was not for his technical or business 
skills. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Your reference to test Barry Hore that 
is from the 100 day TM Plan? 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 60 of 319 
 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Yes and then just the comment on the 
tone of the interchange between the two Bain people? 
MR WILLIAMS:  It is – so – so Mr Barry Hore had a 
reputation of being quite a tough guy.  He had been brought 
to SARS from Nedbank at Nedbank he was Head of 
Technology for Nedbank and I think it was Minister Pravin 
Gordhan who brought him to SARS at the very early stages 
of the modernisation program to build this IT capability.  So 
his – my understanding of Mr Barry Hore is seen as very 
10 
credible in terms of IT and building IT systems and also quite 
a tough guy and so the idea that they are now seemingly or 
joking saying goodbye Barry or Mr Massone saying this guy I 
read it to be meaning Mr Hore.   
This guy was supposedly untouchable but it was after 
a few weeks Mr Moyane was able to get him to resign.  So in 
my sense was that all he said we were going to test Mr Hore 
and this seems to have been the resolution that Mr Hore was 
not going to part of the future – that he has gone and so 
goodbye Mr Barry Hore in almost a joking way. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might or might not be able to answer 
this question and in which case you can say that you are not 
able to.  Would it be fair – or let me ask it this way.  Do you 
think there is a connection between Mr Hore’s departure 
from SARS with what Bain said or somebody from Bain said 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 61 of 319 
 
in one of the emails you looked t yesterday where they were 
talking about Mr Moyane having to neutralise certain people.  
I 
cannot 
remember 
what 
the 
other 
word 
was 
but 
I 
remember... 
MR WILLIAMS:  Watch out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Watch out yes. Are you able to say 
anything or you are not able to say anything? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair I think the Bain document answered 
that question because on the slide of the page right before 
that document where they describe the watch outs and the 
10 
neutralise it is on that page where they say test Barry Hore 
and so for me it was – he was probably… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh they specify him. 
MR WILLIAMS:  Him only. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WILLIAMS:  Yes.  So they describe the neutralise watch 
out process in general. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WILLIAMS:  So they say hey you can go in there do this 
you know label the watch outs, label the neutralised guys. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WILLIAMS:  But with 00:05:10 of that there is going to 
be specific guy you must watch out for and test and this is 
Barry Hore. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Franklin. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 62 of 319 
 
MR WILLIAMS:   Mr Franklin apologies Chair if I can just 
add just again part of the relevance of Mr Barry Hore he had 
70% of Star – of SARS staff – 70% of the operations 
reporting to him so he was the key guy who made SARS 
function. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Yes just so that it is clear for the Chair 
if we could go back briefly to the TM first 100 days document 
which is at page 492 and is AW92.  Please look at the 
second page 493 are those the references that you have 
been making?  Let us look at the top right hand side of the 
10 
page under the heading Keep the Ball Rolling the fifth bullet 
point Testing BH is that what you talking about? 
MR WILLIAMS:  I cannot see it. So page 493 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Yes. 
MR WILLIAMS:  Take Control. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Under the heading Keep the Ball 
Rolling. 
MR WILLIAMS:  Oh that is correct Chair.  So page 493 the 
column Keep the Ball Rolling the very last point there is 
testing 
BH 
and 
assessing 
performance 
at 
different 
20 
components of COO perimeter.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And but CA – BH was not COO is 
that correct or was he? 
MR WILLIAMS:  He was the COO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was the COO.  Okay. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 63 of 319 
 
MR WILLIAMS:  Ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WILLIAMS:  And later we know that Mr Jonas Makwakwa 
becomes the COO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And then just to complete it at the 
bottom of the page the last bullet point under the heading 
Build a Healthy Sponsorship Spine to Accelerate Change and 
Individual – sorry and identify individuals to neutralise the 
last bullet point is Identify individuals that could hamper 
10 
change – watch out – to neutralise.  That is what you were 
referring to? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Alright then just in relation… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Franklin.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you.  Just in relation to the 
climate at SARS once Mr Moyane had taken over did you 
have occasion to speak to Bain colleagues who were there at 
20 
the time 2014/2015? 
MR WILLIAMS:  I was Chair especially during my oversight 
period in 2018 I was able to also engage with Bain staff 
many of them came to me wanting to tell their experience of 
what happened when they were at SARS.  Many of them in 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 64 of 319 
 
my mind traumatised by what happened at SARS. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Alright let me just take you to a couple 
of annexures in that regard.  Would you look firstly at AW27 
page 621?  In the middle of the page we have an email from 
Bain investigation was that a general email address that 
relevant people were part of? 
MR WILLIAMS:  This was the email that Baker and McKenzie 
used to give the Bain investigation updates it was their email 
address. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Right it is dated the 18t h of December 
10 
2018 so this is during the Baker McKenzie investigation and 
Baker McKenzie say the following: 
“I wanted to bring the whistle blower email 
below to your attention.” 
Now just before we get to that – that email you see 
the 
person 
whose 
name 
it 
is 
– 
have 
you 
had 
any 
communication with that person and indicated whether they 
are concerned or not to have their name revealed? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair I had never met this person but I sent 
her an email and asked her firstly told her I would like to 
20 
include her testimony or her feedback in my affidavit would 
that be okay with her and she gave me her permission to 
include her name and her – her testimony. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Alright so this person sends an email 
dated the 18t h of December 2018 to the Bain investigation 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 65 of 319 
 
team and she says: 
“Dear Baker McKenzie team and indicates on 
page 
622 that 
she 
was a former Bain 
employee over the period 2015 to 2018.  She 
says although primarily based in Washington 
DC 
during 
her 
Bain 
tenure 
she 
spent 
September 2016 through April 2018 in the 
Johannesburg office and she was staffed to a 
SARS case from September 2016 through to 
early February 2017 while she was a second 
10 
year consultant.” 
 
Just looking at the third paragraph she sets out what 
her experience was like during that assignment is that 
correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And could you highlight for the Chair 
the features that she had communicated to the Baker 
McKenzie team? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair this consultant firstly because I often 
refer to them as junior consultants as a partner junior 
20 
consultant by that – my measure but yes she has got 
undergraduate degree, she has got a Master’s Degree from 
the Wharton School, an MBA from Wharton School so a 
highly 
educated, 
highly 
accomplished 
person 
and 
she 
describes in detail her awful experience being a Bain 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 66 of 319 
 
consultant working on the SARS project.   
“She says almost immediately a – it was 
apparent to me that we were not in fact 
creating any value for the client and that the 
clients were largely uninterested in us.  In 
another part she says our work there was 
effectively a sham.  Somebody is – sorry 
something was simply not quite right.  I tried 
to communicate this to management meaning 
her Bain superiors and she mentions those 
10 
who she communicated this to.  But the work 
they were doing was unethical she says and I 
felt 
my 
personal 
ethics 
were 
being 
compromised by the position I was put in 
while serving on this project.  I shared this 
concern with a partner in Washington DC and 
again twice she shared her concern with a 
partner in Washington DC and I requested to 
be removed from the project in January 
2017.” 
20 
And just lastly the last comment 
Her view is – ja she had this awful experience she 
did not just keep it to herself she shared it with senior 
people in Bain and was dismissed. 
“I told my supervisors that something 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 67 of 319 
 
was not right and I told the partner that 
something was not right and I was brushed 
aside.  My complaints were dismissed.” 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Alright in similar vein would you turn 
over the page to page to AW128 page 624 there is another 
email which is addressed to Bain Investigation 5 November 
2018 and that is another one that was brought to your 
attention, is that correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Now this particular person and you 
10 
indicated to the Chair whether this person is aware of and is 
happy to have their name revealed. 
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair despite what Bain says in their 
affidavit I do have this person’s permission as well to 
present his – his opinions and feedback. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Alright so what this particular person 
says at page 624 at the bottom of the page he indicates he 
was a Bain employee from November 2015 to August 2016 
and for the duration of that time he was 100% assigned to 
the SARS case and worked on three work streams and he 
20 
then identifies what those work streams were and over the 
page at 625 he gives the Bain team a – an indication of what 
it was like to work at SARS and once again could I ask you 
to highlight those observations that are relevant to and 
understanding of what the climate was at SARS at this time? 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 68 of 319 
 
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair again this – this consultant highly 
accomplished a degree from UCT and a Master’s Degree 
from Insead so I have referred to him as junior but again he 
is an accomplished person. He says  
“The SARS staff were highly sceptical of our 
presence at the offices.” 
He describes that one of his tasks on the team was to 
share media reports – media articles with the Bain team of 
what was happening at SARS.  And then the moment 
negative stories started coming out like the rogue unit and 
10 
other things happening at SARS he was told to stop doing 
that.  To selectively share the news articles within the Bain 
team.  But he goes on to say that: 
“Senior management resistance was obvious 
referring to SARS senior management.  The 
SARS senior management resistance was 
obvious through the organisation work. This 
was the restructuring work but again the 
perspective was landed upon me that we 
were to – was to power through and get it 
20 
done.” 
It is this idea that despite SARS senior management 
being resistant to Bain’s work the Bain team were told to 
power through and just to get the work done. 
 
And then just lastly one of his comments: 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 69 of 319 
 
“What 
does 
stand out for me was the 
arrogance with which the Moyane, Zuma, 
Bain links were dismissed.” 
And I think he is referring to the media articles were 
saying there is obviously a link between Moyane, Zuma and 
Bain and within Bain he is saying the arrogance with which 
they dismissed this link and the general acceptance that 
came from the floor in the team as the project grew evermore 
work streams.   
The feeling that we were smarter than them and we 
10 
will have our facts ready if they come for us was one 
definitely felt throughout the team in his time at Bain.  He 
says; I also felt leadership were dismissive of the reports 
when they first surfaced at the end of 2015.” 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Just for the record are you referring 
there to the second last paragraph on page 625? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Alright I would like to take you now to 
certain press releases which were issued by Bain in the 
course of the Nugent Commission workings.  Would you first 
20 
please go to AW3 at page 125.  I think you identified that 
earlier as being a Bain statement that was sent to the Bain 
team so that was an internal document, is that correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair it was sent to the Bain 
team and Bain’s alumni. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 70 of 319 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And you had – you had commented 
that – that the statement trivialised the real impact on Bain 
Alumni, is that right? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  But then please look at AW6 at page 
132 is that a Bain press statement that was issued to the 
public in general it appears on or about 2 September 2018? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair it was a public 
statement presented by Bain. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Alright this takes us back to the 
10 
beginning of your testimony and the reason for your 
appointment but we did not highlight what was said by Bain 
so in the first paragraph it is recorded that:  
“In light of new questions being raised during 
last 
week’s 
testimony 
before 
the 
SARS 
Commission 
of 
Inquiry 
and 
from 
media 
inquiries 
Bain 
and 
Company 
is 
now 
undertaking 
a 
deep 
and 
extensive 
investigation led by our global leadership 
and external counsel into all matters relating 
20 
to our work with SARS.  We want to be 
absolutely certain that we entered into our 
SARS engagement in full compliance of 
applicable procurement laws and that our 
investigations 
findings 
are 
accurate 
and 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 71 of 319 
 
unassailable.” 
And 
then 
the 
second 
paragraph 
just 
the 
first 
sentence. 
“We 
want 
to 
be 
completely 
open 
and 
transparent as we believe that is what the 
people of South Africa deserve.” 
Could I then take you to the fourth paragraph where 
the following is said: 
“We 
have 
listened 
with 
concern 
to 
the 
testimonies of SARS employees who feel 
10 
they have been mistreated and disrespected 
at 
their 
frustration 
and 
pain 
and 
the 
consequences this has had on the lives of 
these individuals and their family – families.  
We are dismayed by the way our work has 
been used to further a different agenda than 
was intended.  In our recommendations there 
was no need for any layoffs or terminations.  
This did not turn out to be the reality when 
the model was implemented.  We are deeply 
20 
sorry for how this turned out we wish we had 
known then what we know – oh sorry what we 
do now.” 
If I could then ask you to look at AW10 page 142.  
This is a further press statement dated the 10t h of September 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 72 of 319 
 
AW10 page 142, do you have it? 
MR WILLIAMS:  I do Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  The second and third paragraphs are 
as follows: 
“To understand what happened we launched 
an independent investigation led by the 
global 
law 
firm 
Baker 
McKinsey. 
 
The 
investigation is focussing on understanding 
the facts relating to people processes and 
governance that related in us getting and 
10 
accepting the work.  Our own internal review 
established that our engagement with SARS 
did not meet our standards for delivery of 
sustainable positive results for our clients.  
We do not want to benefit from work that was 
used to further a different agenda than was 
intended.” 
Just pausing there.  There have been a couple of 
references to a different agenda do you know what that is a 
reference to? 
20 
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair my understanding of that reference is 
Bain is asserting that they went into SARS with complete 
legitimate and wholesome intent and they were unwitting 
participants in some agenda to damage SARS and so while 
by their version yes they were there at SARS while this was 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 73 of 319 
 
all happening it was completely without their knowledge and 
so apparently expressing regret for having been there when 
this was all going on. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Then there is a further press release 
which is at AW45 page 252.  We have looked at it briefly 
before. This is 17 December I presume 2018.  You have 
that? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Yes I do and it is 2018. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Alright if I could just take you to some 
of the paragraphs the first is: 
10 
“The past few months have been a highly 
challenging and sobering period for Bain 
South Africa and Bain Globally through public 
testimony and documents submitted at the 
Commission of Inquiry head by Judge Nugent 
it has become painfully evidence that the 
firms involvement with the South African 
Revenue 
Services 
SARS 
was 
a 
serious 
failure for South Africa for SARS and clearly 
for Bain too.  The Commission’s hearings and 
20 
the final report published last week have laid 
bare the disarray in which SARS now finds 
itself with both morale and performance 
severely damaged.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Franklin you left me at 142. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 74 of 319 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  I am sorry.  This is page 252. 
CHAIRPERSON:  252? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Correct and that is Annexure AW45.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I have got it but I did listen as you 
were reading. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you.  So there appears in those 
first two paragraphs to be an acknowledgment that things 
went wrong.  On this right hand side of the page you will see 
what Bain writes is that:  
“We 
clearly 
made 
significant 
errors 
of 
10 
judgment on taking on this work.” 
And then in the third paragraph: 
“We accept that through various lapses in 
leadership and governance Bain became an 
unwitting 
participant 
in 
a 
process 
that 
inflicted serious damage upon SARS.” 
Just your comment about errors of judgment and 
being unwitting participants? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair on my read of the multiple emails that 
indicate that Bain knew about Mr Moyane’s appointment 
20 
coming, on the nature of the content of the materials that 
Bain had presented and prepared for and with Mr Moyane, 
the way that procurement process worked which seemed 
obviously to be irregular.   
All of this indicates to me that Bain did not arrive at 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 75 of 319 
 
SARS as unwitting participants.  In fact it appears to me on 
the reading of those facts that Bain arrived at SARS as 
apparently Mr Moyane did with the restructuring agenda.  
 It was designed months before either of those 
parties arrived because it is there in the documents.  The TM 
100 days and the previous document at SARS 2.0 documents 
lay out the plan for restructuring.  So to say that they arrived 
and they shocked by what happened and they were unwitting 
participants for me just does not accord with what the 
evidence I have seen. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  As part of your oversight function you 
were concerned to ensure that all material information was 
placed before the Nugent Commission, is that right? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  We know that Mr Massone testified and 
we know that Mr Min testified apart from those two did any 
other Bain employees testify? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair Judge Nugent invited Bain to present 
any witnesses they wanted to. In fact he created a whole day 
during the Nugent Commission for Bain to send any 
20 
witnesses and no one – and Bain declined that invitation. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Please look at your affidavit at 
paragraph 158 page 75.  There you have said that: 
“It 
was 
clear 
to 
Bain 
who 
the 
Nugent 
Commission would be interested in speaking 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 76 of 319 
 
to as witnesses.” 
And you have referenced an email from Mr Kennedy 
on the 28t h of September 2018.  Did Mr Kennedy identify 
people who would be of interest to the commission in his 
view? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair Mr Kennedy does and Mr Kennedy 
was leading from the Bain’s legal standpoint and he 
identifies in this email what he – who he thinks the Nugent 
Commission might be interested in speaking to and he 
names them as Fabrice Franzen which makes sense because 
10 
he headed up the Bain project and ran the day to day 
operations and he identifies Stephane Timpano who we know 
had drafted many of the materials that Bain had presented to 
Mr Moyane and to the President.   
Because this is relevant because Bain – the – the 
narrative Bain advances is that only Mr Massone knew what 
was going on and he was now gone so there is nobody could 
know what happened.  But it is interesting that they 
identified people internally who could have added – shed 
light on what happened. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Would you look please at AW143 page 
664.  In the second half of the email string you will see one 
from Mr Kennedy to Mr Min dated 3 October 2018 and he 
says: 
“Just thought I would give you the key points 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 77 of 319 
 
from the call.  He says Athol’s list of 
additional witnesses does make sense in the 
context of DOJ.” 
Now I am just stopping there.  What is Athol’s list of 
additional witnesses? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair Baker McKinsey had prepared a list of 
Bain employees who would have got an interview to gather 
additional information as part of their investigation.  And 
when I saw that list it seemed to omit very obvious members 
of Bain senior team who should be there and so I submitted 
10 
– well based on my own read of it a list of people who I felt 
needed to be included in that list of witnesses with the 
interview. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  I do not believe we have that – that 
email with your list of witnesses I might be wrong but do you 
recall offhand who you thought were obviously of interest 
and ought to testify at the Nugent Commission? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair I do not think we got that list here but 
my recollection were – there were obvious people.  There 
were people like Paul Niehand who was Mr Massone’s boss 
20 
surely he should be interviewed.  We heard the name Wendy 
Miller yesterday who was Bain’s Global head of marketing 
was involved in a lot of the discussions around the 
Ambrobite contract.  Her name was not on the list.  In fact I 
suggested that Mr Stuart Min who was Bain’s head of global 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 78 of 319 
 
legal should be on the list because he had knowledge of 
what was happening with Ambrobrite and a few others.  I 
think even Fabrice – no Fabrice Franzen was – there were 
other some operational people who was just obvious would 
know something was not on that list. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Then look at paragraph 160 on page 
76.  There you said, not only was Bain withholding 
witnesses from the Commission, they were also excluding 
key Bain people from the investigation.   
“I was contracted to oversee.  Given the facts 
10 
of the situation, it seemed extremely odd to me 
that Baker and McKinsey is not planning to 
interview...” 
 
 
And then you give a list of people.  Could you 
identify those people and briefly explain to the Chair why 
you believe they were obvious topics of – subjects for 
interview? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, so I will start with Stephan 
Compano(?).  We know he was involved in preparing 
materials that they presented to President Zuma to Mr 
20 
Moyane on SARS.  So I suggested... to be interviewed.  I 
mentioned earlier, Mr Paul Myan(?) was Mr Massone’s 
boss.  Not only did he have knowledge of what Mr Massone 
was doing, he would have seen Mr Massone’s personal 
assessments.  So Mr Myan...   
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 79 of 319 
 
 
I then mentioned Mr Min, Steward Min.  He was 
Global Head of Legal.  He seemed to, in my mind, be 
directly involved in many relevant discussions in his role 
as Global Head of Legal for Bain.  And then I mentioned 
Ms Wendy Muller, who would raised many of the concerns.  
I would have thought she would be instrumental because if 
she raised the concerns and someone told – someone 
wrote those concerns, they might be interested to know 
who that person was.   
 
I mentioned Christopher Cameron who was a 
10 
Senior Bain Manager.  He worked on the SARS Project.  So 
again, from an operational underground standpoint.  And in 
fact, I mentioned Chris Kennedy who was Senior Counsel 
at Bain because he in fact had negotiated the SARS 
contract.   
 
So when Bain had engaged with SARS at the 
outset, it was Mr Kennedy who that contract and was 
intimately involved.  Chair, Bain did not have any legal 
capability in South Africa.  So they relied on Bain’s legal 
capability in Europe and the US.  And so whenever there 
20 
was anything legal, it would have involved Mr Kennedy or 
others.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   As far as the investigation by Bain, 
which you say began as a short ad-hoc investigation by 
Bain itself and then was taken over by Baker and 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 80 of 319 
 
McKinsey, as far that is concerned.  Could I ask you to 
look at the document at page 160 which is AW-14, a letter 
from Baker and McKinsey dated the 25 t h of September 
2018 and it is headed, Bain South Africa Investigation 
Plan? 
MR WILLIAMS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right.  Just to highlight certain 
features.  The background at 1.1 records that: 
“This plan governs the investigation of Bain, 
contract with SARS which is to be conducted 
10 
by Baker and McKinsey...” 
 
And it records that: 
“Bain 
commenced 
the 
investigation 
in 
response to questions raised by the Nugent 
Commission...” 
 
And then in 1.3 it sets out what the investigation 
will address, the various questions it will address.  It gives 
the scope of the investigation in paragraph 2 and it gives 
the 
investigation 
methodology 
in 
paragraph 
3 
which 
includes interviews.  Just pausing on interviews.  Did you 
20 
ever see the interviewed notes of interviews that were 
conducted? 
MR WILLIAMS:   No, Chair not.  Despite continuous 
requests and urging appeals, access to interview notes 
was denied to me. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 81 of 319 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Then 3.6, the reporting and findings 
and independence but before we get into the detail of that. 
What was your understanding, having been appointed and 
with the background which led to your appointment.  What 
was your understanding of the ultimate objective of this 
investigation and whether it would be reported on, and if 
so, to whom? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, my understanding was that this 
was a real sincere attempt and effort on Bain’s part to 
really understand what happened at SARS and Bain’s 
10 
involvement with SARS and with some of the other state 
entities.  I really believe that Bain was shocked by what 
happened and what they have heard and so this was a 
comprehensive investigation to really get to the bottom of 
what really happened.   
 
Bain had made it very clear to me, to the staff 
and even to the public that the intent was to be open and 
transparent with what they find.  So much so that they to 
give public and the Nugent Commission some assurance 
that what they find will be reported truthfully.   
20 
 
And so my understanding of this process of the 
investigation was, I would see everything that Baker and 
McKinsey finds and at the end of the investigation, Baker 
and McKinsey would produce a report on these findings 
against which I could then write my report on whether I 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 82 of 319 
 
believe 
they 
had 
both 
conducted 
a 
comprehensive 
investigation and reported those findings truthfully. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Let us then proceed to examine what 
happened in fact.  Firstly, was a final investigation report 
by Baker and McKinsey ever produced to the Nugent 
Commission and/or the public? 
MR WILLIAMS:   No, Chair.  Baker and McKinsey nor Bain 
nor presented a report to the Nugent Commission, nor did 
they make a report public of their findings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that contrary to the plan that 
10 
persuaded you to agree to play a role? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR WILLIAMS:   It was contrary to what Bain had said 
publicly, what Bain had said internally, what Bain had said 
to me, what Bain had said in the contract, Baker and 
McKinsey and what Bain had said in my contract with Bain. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Mr Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  Let us just establish 
when you found out about this.  AW-160, page 796.  That is 
20 
an email string.  Would you look at the email at the middle 
of the page.  It is from you to Chris Kennedy and 
Mr Moolman dated 11 December 2008(sic). 
MR WILLIAMS:   2018. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Sorry, 2018.  And you have said: 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 83 of 319 
 
I think Bain not realising investigation findings 
will kick up a media storm... 
 
I do not use your exact words.  I take it you had 
found out at or about this time that there was no intention 
to release a report.  Is that right? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct Chair.  The role – my role 
was about oversight but I also felt that I had the 
responsibility to nudge Bain towards doing what the writing 
was because that is what they wanted me there to do and 
to be part and to show the public and to me Judge Newton 
10 
was that I also advance this effort to do the right thing.   
 
So when Bain said they are to going to release 
an investigation then into their findings, I said that is going 
to be massively problematic.  And so I raised this concern 
here as I did many other places.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Did they give you the reasons why they 
were saying they would not release the report to the public 
and they would, as I understand the position, give it to, 
despite the fact that they promised the public that they 
would be transparent about this investigation? 
20 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, my understanding is based entirely 
on an email that I received from Mr Kennedy because I 
asked that question.  And he – the answer to me was that 
the findings of the investigations will be problematic for 
Bain if it were public because they are likely to attract 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 84 of 319 
 
prosecution.  So I think rephrase that apologies.   
 
But they were problematic because they could be 
used against Bain should they be prosecuted.  And that will 
be problematic in South Africa and in the United States.  
So the findings were there, they looked at the findings.   
 
My interpretation saw that what was there, 
pointed to some wrongdoing or improper behaviour.  And 
then said there is no way that we can make this public 
because this will hurt us if there was a prosecution. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it would seem obvious that if the 
10 
findings were favourable, they would have made them 
available. 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is absolutely my understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Mr Franklin.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Just on the 
Chair ’s question.  The email at the top of the page, it 
appears to give a reason.  Is that correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:   This is an email from Mr Kennedy to me.  
Yes, that question had been discussed.  Referring to my 
question this will be a problematic if Bain would release 
20 
the findings.  It was the very clear advise from Baker and 
McKinsey that they should not release their findings to me, 
to the public.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Then please look at AW-162, page 
801 an email from you to Nicola Wilson and Mr Moolman 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 85 of 319 
 
dated the 11 t h of December 2018.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page number again? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   It is 801 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   801. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And this all seems to have happened 
on the same day and this is later in the day, the emails we 
saw at page 796 and what you say is this in the second 
paragraph: 
“I understand from Baker and McKinsey and 
Chris 
K 
that 
Baker 
and 
McKinsey’s 
10 
investigation findings will not be documented 
in a report. 
This is a significant change and complicates 
things for me. 
Would have appreciated being informed of this 
change 
proactively 
by 
somebody 
at 
Bain, 
rather 
than 
have 
to 
adduce 
it 
from 
the 
discussions with Baker and McKinsey. 
I have communicated to Baker and McKinsey 
and Chris that I will finalise my report based 
20 
on 
what 
I 
know 
and 
including 
this 
new 
development...” 
 
Why did you addressed this to Nicola Wilson? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Because Nicola Wilson was Head of 
Marketing and Public Relations at Bain in South Africa.  
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 86 of 319 
 
She was one of the people who I dealt with internally.  So 
it was either Mr Moolman who was acting...  Sorry, Chair.  
Either Mr Moolman who was acting...  Or Ms Wilson.  I did 
copy Mr Moolman in that email, saying this was a surprise 
to me to hear. 
 
And Chair, the reference to “I had to adduce 
this...”  at no point – so the plan was very clear.  Baker 
and McKinsey was going to wrote their findings, produce 
their report and will also come to me.  At no point did Bain 
or Baker and McKinsey said:  Athol, we have decided not 
10 
to send you this report.   
 
It kept coming up when I was saying:  Guys, 
when will I see the report?  When will I see this report?  
And it was sort of back and forth.  Eventually I then said in 
an email, am I going to see the report?  And they said no. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Then please look at AW-166, page 
809 which is an email from you to Moolman and Kennedy 
and others, dated 14 December 2018.  I think it is true to 
say here that you then your spleen on this topic and you 
have said that although Bain repeatedly committed to doing 
20 
the right thing, this latest development was a problem for 
you.  Can you just elucidate what it is that you said and 
why? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct Chair.  The...  As we 
discussed yesterday.  I engaged with Bain, one, because I 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 87 of 319 
 
had a history with this company and it is a long history with 
this company and a very proud history with this company.  
Two, that they gave me assurance... partner that we are 
going to do the right thing.   
 
And they contracted with me very specifically 
about what my role was going to be.  There was no doubt 
in anyone’s mind what was going to be.  There were even 
times where Bain would ask me to... their staff, to calm the 
staff down, to give them assurance that the right thing has 
been done. 
10 
 
In those meetings, I described the process that 
was going to unfold, whether the investigation should 
happen, I would see the report, we understand there might 
be 
some 
sensitivities 
in 
the 
report, 
people’s 
email 
addresses or bank account details, et cetera, that might be 
excluded but I would see the full report, fully investigation 
details and I would offer an opinion on whether that was 
truthful or not. 
 
That was very clear, Judge.  And so – and I put 
my reputation on this.  Externally, there were so many 
20 
people who were my trusted associates who said to me:  
Athol, what are you doing?  And I would say:  Guys, this 
process is going be a first in the country because here is a 
company who says we know we have done wrong and we 
are going to investigate it and report it.   
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 88 of 319 
 
 
So for me there was a lot at stake in this 
process.  So when it became clear to me that Bain were 
now deviating from that process, that upset me because it 
meant that they lied to the public, lied to their staff, lied to 
the authorities on what is going to happen and it appeared 
that I was part of that lie because I was there. 
 
And so I wrote to the most senior people who I 
dealt with, Mr Moolman, Mr Kennedy, Mr John Senior who 
replaced Mr Massone as the Head of the South African 
office, and Mr Hodgkinson.  Laid it out very clearly that 
10 
what is happening here is unacceptable, that they would 
consistently said that they were going to tell the truth and 
reveal the report, reveal the findings and now they are not 
doing it. 
 
And at the end of this email, Chair, I say to 
request and I say I would like to urge Bain to fulfil the 
promise made to the South African people to be completely 
open and transparent by making a version of investigation 
findings public and allowing me access to all the relevant 
evidence and document and findings so that I can act 
20 
without restrictions.   
 
And that phrase, without restrictions, was in 
public, was in my contract.  This access will allow me to 
conclude my oversight role and write my final report.  You 
asked me to stand up in front of a Joburg office on a few 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 89 of 319 
 
occasions describe my role.   
 
And I go on to say, basically, in the absence of 
you sharing this with me, I – you are actually blocking me 
from completing my duties. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Then paragraph 201 on page 89 of 
your affidavit, please.  Would you go to that? 
MR WILLIAMS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV 
FRANKLIN 
SC: 
 
 
It 
appears 
that 
on 
19 December 2018, you were eventually show something.  
Is that right? 
10 
MR WILLIAMS:   Not exactly Chair.  I was invited to be 
shown something. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right.  Will you explain what you 
were invited to see and what you did or did not see 
pursuant to that invitation? 
MR WILLIAMS:   So, Chair, as you could tell from this 
email that I was sent, I was urging Bain to let me see the 
findings because that would allow me to complete the 
duties that they hired me to do.  What Baker and McKinsey 
and Bain then go to – the point they got to was saying, we 
20 
can show you the report, you cannot print it or take it away 
with you and you cannot make reference to it. 
 
So you cannot talk about having seen this report 
but we will show it to you and I said I reject that.  That 
makes no sense to me to say I have seen something when 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 90 of 319 
 
actually I have not seen it.  So I rejected that. 
 
They then came back and said okay we have got 
another plan.  We will do a link with you, a top technology 
link where the report appears on your laptop and I can see 
it but I cannot download or print it.   
 
So on the 19 t h of December this meeting was set 
up with Baker and McKinsey and Bain and myself.  That 
was remote  I was in Cape Town and they were scattered 
around the world and I was to see this presentation.  Sorry, 
I was to see this report.  So the meeting was set up.  It 
10 
was clear I was going to receive the report.   
 
After the meeting, I still have not seen the 
report.  And so at that point I asked but when am I going to 
see the report and the Baker and McKinsey partner, 
Reagan Demas was in the United States and he said:  
Well, why do I want to see this report?  They will read it to 
me. 
 
And I said, well, that does not make sense to me 
at all. It is like you are describing a painting to me.  I have 
not seen the painting but I cannot see the painting, you 
20 
describe it to me.  That was exactly the metaphor I used on 
the call.  And he said, no, but he is going to read it to me.  
Do I think he will lie to me?   
 
But of course, that was not the point.  The point 
was this meeting was set up for me to see the report and 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 91 of 319 
 
so I was extremely angry and ended the call because it 
was clear that they were not going to show me this 
investigation report.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   As with regards to your own 
reporting, Mr Williams, will you look at AW-154, page 694? 
MR WILLIAMS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Can you confirm that document?  
From pages 694 to 733, it is an interim report dated 
20 November 2018 which you submitted to the Nugent 
Commission. 
10 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Then AW-155 at page 735.  Can you 
confirm that that is your final report to the Nugent 
Commission dated the 20 t h of December 2018? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, this is my final report.  Just 
...[intervenes]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, my mistake.  It was not 
submitted 
to 
the 
Nugent 
Commission. 
The 
Nugent 
Commission had completed its own report by then.  Is that 
right? 
20 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct Chair.  And the reason this 
was late to submit to the Nugent Commission was that I 
kept to have waiting for Bain to give me the investigation 
report.  And the reason I did the interim report was to give 
something to Nugent Commission in terms of reporting from 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 92 of 319 
 
me and Judge Nugent made extensive reference to my 
interim report in his final report but I could not get from 
Bain the final report from Baker and McKinsey in time to 
produce the final report in time for the Nugent Commission. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright.  That report speaks for 
itself.  You have dealt with a number of topics therein.  I 
take it that you stand by the conclusions which you 
reached? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, I stand by the conclusions I 
reached at that point of what I knew at that point.   
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And just taking that further.  Did you 
acquire further knowledge thereafter which informs your 
present view of the SARS engagement?  And if so, what 
was that further knowledge? 
MR WILLIAMS:   So, Chair, my view now is different from 
what I expressed in this report and two things led to that 
change of view.  One is the initial experience I have with 
Bain.  So this runs up to December 2018.  As you know, I 
did spend another eight to nine months with Bain and so 
that experience added to my knowledge of what really 
20 
happened and so it caused me to change my view. 
 
And secondly.  I then after making contact with 
the Nugent - the Zondo Commission, I then went and 
reviewed all of the materials I had and that informed a 
different opinion.  So what I reviewed at this stage, that 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 93 of 319 
 
particular view.  When I had this broad experience with 
Bain and with all the materials I had, I formed a different 
opinion. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright.  Could I ask you now to turn 
to a different file which is SARS Bundle 03 and Exhibit 
WW-6? 
MR WILLIAMS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Please look at page 12 in SARS 03.   
MR WILLIAMS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   You will see that that document 
10 
running form page 12 to page 37 is an affidavit deposed to 
by Mr Moyane dated the 3 r d of March 2021 and in it, what 
Mr Moyane has done, is to address various themes and to 
answer allegations that have made against him by various 
witnesses, who either had been called or are to be called 
to the Commission.  You have read this affidavit? 
MR WILLIAMS:   I have Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Please turn to page 29. 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, can I restate that?  Apologies.  I 
have not read the entire affidavit.  I was provided with 
20 
sections of his affidavit that applied to me. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright.  That is what I wish to refer 
you to.  The section at paragraph 62, page 29 to 68, page 
35.  Now I am not going to read the entire version.  I am 
going to just highlight certain of the allegations made by 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 94 of 319 
 
him and ask for your response.  Paragraph 62, page 29.   
 
He says he has never met you but says you are 
a 
self-styled 
whistle-blower 
and 
a 
determined 
and 
disgruntled former employee of Bain who is on a mission to 
implicate his former employer in an alleged wrongdoing, 
rightly or wrongly so.  What is your reaction to that 
allegation against you? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, it is interesting that someone can 
say they never met me but they have got such a clear 
description of me.  He describes me as a disgruntled 
10 
former employee.  Chair my response to that is.  I 
understand a disgruntled person as someone who is angry 
and dissatisfied with the situation.   
 
And so I am inclined to agree with Mr Moyane 
that I am disgruntled because I am angry and I am 
dissatisfied with the corruption in our country.  I am 
dissatisfied and angry about what happened at SARS.  I am 
angry and dissatisfied with what Bain has done to cover it 
up and being involved with it.   
 
So, yes, I am disgruntled.  I might not be for the 
20 
reasons he thinks I am disgruntled.  In fact, I think all of 
South Africa is disgruntled, angry and dissatisfied with 
what has been happening in our public institutions. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Secondly, in paragraph 64 he 
summarises your allegations against him in a number of 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 95 of 319 
 
propositions which we do not need to go to.  It is his 
summary of what he says you say.  He concludes in 
paragraph 65:   
“It is not clear how all the above, if true, 
translates into my personal involvement in or 
knowledge of state capture or even the capture 
of 
SARS, 
and 
if 
so, 
for 
what 
unlawful 
purpose...” 
 
So you can read 64 if you wish which is 
Mr Moyane’s summary of your allegations against him but 
10 
would you react to his contention that even if those 
allegations are true, it is not clear how this translates into 
any knowledge of state capture or the capture of SARS? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, I do not feel I am in a position to 
respond to that.  What is determined to be unlawful, I just 
do not think I have to enough to whether what I have 
observed was lawful or unlawful from what I read and 
understood was lawful/unlawful.  I do have a sense a lot of 
it was improper and unethical and not becoming of a leader 
of a public institution.   
20 
 
So if the evidence I have seen is correct that 
Mr Moyane planned with Bain to enter SARS to cause 
damage at SARS which is what the evidence seems to 
suggest to me and I do think it unethical and improper.  I 
cannot make an assessment on unlawfulness or not. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 96 of 319 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Fair enough.  Paragraph 66, he sets 
out his own version of events which he says...  Let me just 
read it. 
“I wish to narrate the following version of 
events so that the mind of the Commission can 
be put at rest about the absence about any 
possible state capture motives on my part...” 
 
He then sets that out.  I do not think it directly 
implicates you. 
MR WILLIAMS:   Mr Franklin, if I may?  And may it is a 
10 
typo in Mr Moyane’s affidavit.  At 66.3, he says: 
“At some point in the very early part of 2013, 
the President informed me in strict confidence 
that he intended to appoint me to the position 
of SARS Commissioner...” 
 
If that is correct, then it changes the narrative 
we have been working on quite substantially, that the 
President could inform him in early 2013.  I suspect it is 
early 2014 but... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, this early 2013. 
20 
MR WILLIAMS:   So much the point that he was informed 
very early on that he would get the job. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But this is strange because in paragraph 
66.1, he says sometime, probably in the second half of 
2013 the position of SARS Commissioner was advertised in 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 97 of 319 
 
the mass media.  So if he – if the President told him in the 
very early part of 2013 that he intended to appoint him to 
the position of SARS Commissioner, he says for which I 
had applied, then how could he have applied before the 
position was advertised?  Or am I missing something here? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Ja, let me...   Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR WILLIAMS:   I agree with you Chair.  But I am affording 
Mr Moyane the benefit of the doubt ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR WILLIAMS:   ...by saying it was a typo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR WILLIAMS:   But if it was not a typo, it does raise more 
serious questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes.  Yes.  It is very interesting 
because he talks about the General Election.  He says 
there is six...  Well, he says, just to complete that part of 
66.3 which you have started reading Mr Williams. 
“At some point in the very early part of 2013 the 
President informed me in strict confidence that he 
20 
intended to appoint me to the position of SARS 
Commissioner 
for 
which 
I 
had 
applied. 
 
He 
explained that his intention should be kept under 
wraps as he only intended for formalise it if he was 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 98 of 319 
 
still in office after the general elections which were 
scheduled to take place in May 2014.” 
And then he says at 66.4: 
“I fully understood that a decision was obviously 
conditional upon the happening of three political or 
constitutional events, namely the ruling ANC would 
win an outright majority in the 2014 elections and 
then there are other matters connected with the 
election in parliament of the President.” 
But he mentions 2013 in three sub-paragraphs there.  First 
10 
he says at 66.1: 
“Some time probably in the second half of 2013 the 
position of SARS Commissioner was advertised in 
the mass media.” 
66.2: 
“In or about early September 2013 I submitted a 
formal 
application. 
 
I 
did 
not 
do 
so 
at 
the 
suggestion or investigation of any person.  By then 
I was already a veteran civil servant having held 
several key positions in the civil service.” 
20 
And then I have read 66.3.  Do you know when the 
advertisement came out, other than he what he says.  Do 
we have by any chance a copy?  You do not have? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Chair, I do not, that is something I 
wish to establish.  
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 99 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, in Mr Gordhan’s affidavit statement 
that he submitted I think in 2018 he does deal with the 
advertisement of the position of SARS Commissioner but I 
do not know whether he attaches a copy of the advert nor 
do 
I 
remember 
whether 
he 
mentions 
when 
the 
advertisement would have gone out but he might be 
mentioning that. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, we will follow that up, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  The last part of the 
10 
version of Mr Moyane that I wish to put to you is at 
paragraph 67 on page 35 of SARS03.  67, page 35.  Having 
given the analysis which appears in paragraph 66 of his 
version of events he says: 
“The above analysis takes us to the next important 
issue namely that neither Mr Williams nor any of my 
abovementioned 
accusers 
has 
ever 
actually 
suggested to this Commission what my alleged 
motive or incentive possibly was for engaging in 
any alleged unlawful or state capture activities, 
20 
neither has anyone indicated what unlawful benefit 
or gains accrued to anybody as a result of my 
alleged conduct nor what prejudice was suffered by 
the public purse or fiscus, exactly to what end was I 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 100 of 319 
 
allegedly engaged in so-called state capture, who 
lost what, who benefited what.” 
Are you in a position to respond to that? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, just briefly, I reject that label or 
reference to me as accuser.  I did not set out to accuse Mr 
Moyane of anything.  If Chair recalls how I even tend to be 
here was because I had a set of documents which came to 
me by way of Bain and from Baker McKenzie.   
All I did was to read those documents, review them 
and offer my interpretation of what was happening but to 
10 
the extent that Mr Moyane’s name and activities were 
reflected in those documents, I just relay that in my 
affidavit.  I did not set out an argument to accuse him of 
anything. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes and then one further exercise I 
wish to conduct, I wish to give you the Bain application 
which is in SEQ44/2020.  You will see, Mr Williams, that 
the – Bain brought an application, as you know, to cross-
examine you and for other relief and the founding affidavit 
in support of that is Mr Min’s affidavit.  That appears at 
20 
page 10, if you look at the top right hand corner, page 10 
to 72 without annexures.  You have seen and read that 
affidavit. 
MR WILLIAMS:   I have, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And you have indeed, am I correct, 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 101 of 319 
 
you have filed an affidavit in response thereto and perhaps 
just for the benefit of the Chair, so that we know what we 
are dealing with, you filed two affidavits, one with an 
annexure or annexures and one without, is that right? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Let us look at the first one which is 
at page 227 to 274. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is now in the file containing Bain’s 
application. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   That is correct, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the application for leave to 
cross-examine Mr Williams. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it seems that it only has pagination 
in red numbers, is that right? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, and what is the page on the 
red numbers? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, it is the page 227 to 274 and 
could I ask you to …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, tell me the last three digits or 
four digits whatever it is? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   It is 227, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   227.  Okay, I have got it. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  That is a document 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 102 of 319 
 
headed respondent’s answering affidavit in your name.  
Would you look at paginated page 274? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Franklin, did you ask me 
to admit Mr Williams’ affidavit? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   No, I have not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, we must make sure we do that 
before we… 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just remember now that we are looking 
at this one. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And the purpose of this present 
exercise is just to indicate that there are two versions 
which are to be filed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I will only ask the Chair to admit the 
second one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, that is fine. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   So the first one, Mr Williams, if you 
20 
see at page 274 it is dated the 19 March 2021, is that 
correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And then the version I wish you to 
look at please is at page 275 to 322 and that version has 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 103 of 319 
 
certain annexures, is that correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   The second version which starts at 
page 275 runs to page 322 and we see a date of 22 March 
2021.  Is that an affidavit deposed to by you on that date? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And do you confirm the truth and 
accuracy of the content of that affidavit? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Yes, I do, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Chair, might I ask that that affidavit 
10 
be admitted?  It does not have an exhibit number because 
it is in an application file. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   But it is identified by reference to 
the page numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it is Mr Williams’ affidavit and his 
main one would be exhibit something, maybe W1 or A. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   It is WW1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so this we could make WW2, is that 
right or there is no another 2? 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I do not think there is another WW2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja or unless we make it 1A or 1.1. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I think the safer suggestion is to 
make it WW1.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright.  Mr Williams’ affidavit 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 104 of 319 
 
starting at page 275 will be admitted as an exhibit and will 
be marked as EXHIBIT WW1.1. 
AFFIDAVIT OF ATHOL WILLIAMS STARTING AT PAGE 
275 HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT WW1.1 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Williams, you 
indicated earlier that have read the affidavit of Mr Min and 
you have of course deposed to this affidavit which has just 
been introduced and in that you answer the contentions 
made by Mr Min, is that correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct, Chair. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I am not going to take you to all of 
them but I do want to direct your attention to some of 
them.  So I am going to be asking you to look at the 
affidavit of Mr Min and then to look back at your answering 
affidavit so have to keep both places open.   
 
The first paragraph that I wish to refer you to is 
paragraph 62 on page 39.  Remember always please to 
look at the red numbering at the top right hand corner.  I 
am sorry, the page is? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Page 39.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So in paragraph 62 Mr Min says 
that: 
“Bain accepts and has publicly acknowledged that 
there were ethical flaws in its conduct and it made 
mistakes.  Mr Massone in particular did not act 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 105 of 319 
 
appropriately in how he sought to interact with 
public entities and public figures and to generate 
public sector work.  We returned the fees we 
received on the SARS’ work plus interest before the 
Nugent Commission completed its work.” 
You have responded to that in paragraph 79 and 80 and 
could you just highlight for the Chair what your response to 
that contention is? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, my view that Bain admits to ethical 
flaws is that it is completely meaningless unless they 
10 
identify what those ethical flaws are.  Just saying we admit 
to ethical flaws does not constitute some admission of 
wrongdoing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and of course if they come to the 
Commission they will be asked about what those flaws are. 
MR WILLIAMS:   Absolutely, Chair.  It was very relevant in 
the context also of my role at Bain which was meant to 
plan remedy and to make amends and as an expert in its 
field of thinking about remedy and reparation, the first step 
is to acknowledge the wrongs you did and then the harms 
20 
you caused to people.  How can I make amends to 
someone that do not acknowledge firstly what I did to them 
that was wrong and harm might cause?  And just saying 
there were ethical flaws to mean says nothing. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, then the second aspect that I 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 106 of 319 
 
wish to put to you from Mr Min’s affidavit is paragraph 67, 
page 40.  There Mr Min says: 
“Mr 
Massone 
procured 
Ambrobrite 
Services 
to 
assist Bain SA in its attempt to gain traction in the 
public sector.” 
And he then goes on to describe the scope of the work.  
You have dealt with that at para 84, page 306 of your 
affidavit and again could I ask you to give the Chair, the 
gist of your response to that allegation? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, Mr Min describes Ambrobrite as 
10 
providing services, which he says are strategic services 
and operational services and I assert in paragraph 84 that 
just based on my reading these services – is it okay if I 
just read from this, much easier. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, I think it is. 
MR WILLIAMS:   Okay.  So I say: 
“This 
is 
misleading 
to 
say 
that 
Mr 
Massone 
procured Ambrobrite Services.  The truth is that 
Bain 
procured 
Ambrobrite 
Services, 
not 
Mr 
Massone.” 
20 
The first thing they are saying, Mr Massone procured 
services, it is Bain who procured those services and 
secondly, Mr Min writes that: 
“Bain was unaware of the nature and full extent to 
which Ambrobrite was facilitating these types of 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 107 of 319 
 
introductions at the time.” 
And I respond by saying – we had this evidence before us 
yesterday and today that Mr Min and many others at Bain 
knew full well what the nature of these introductions were.  
Ms Miller and Mr Min wrote in incredulous emails to 
colleagues 
in 
which 
he 
scoffed 
at 
the 
idea 
that 
Ambrobrite’s leaders as entertainment professionals were 
going to provide Bain with because advice. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, then paragraph 71 on page 
41.  The assertion is there made by Mr Min that: 
10 
“Mr Williams is also correct that the Ambrobrite 
contract raised a number of red flags. 
And he continues: 
“But it only came to my attention and that of others 
after 
Mr 
Massone 
had 
procured 
Ambrobrite’s 
services.” 
You have responded to that in paragraph 85 on page 306 
and you have said that is not correct.  Perhaps you can put 
that in context? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, I was at a meeting – and this I 
20 
have got no proof of – I was in a meeting where Mr Min 
was on the phone in the US and a number of us were in a 
meeting, 
it 
might 
have 
been 
someone 
from 
Baker 
McKenzie, Mr Kennedy were in a meeting in Johannesburg, 
so on the phone, where Mr Min says that he objected to 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 108 of 319 
 
this Ambrobrite contract and we know that from some of 
the emails he seemed to uncomfortable with the Ambrobrite 
contract but I say here even if he only knew about the 
contracts issues after the contract was signed, I saw he 
mentions that Mr Meehan knew – am I reading the right 
part?  Mr Meehan knew about it, the legal representatives 
of Bain Global, Mr Graham Luce knew about it and Mr 
Massone writes in his email to Ms Miller, he says legal and 
finance had approved this contract.  
 
Now as I said earlier, legal meant Global Legal 
10 
because there was no legal capability in South Africa.  
Finance we know refers to someone in Europe and the US.  
So this contention that people globally did not know what 
was happening just makes no sense to me.  And if I refer 
back to that meeting where Mr Min was on the phone call, 
we even said if Mr Min is overruled about his objection we 
asked who then overruled and Mr Min asked who was in the 
room and when we told him who was in the room he said he 
was not going to answer that question.  But it definitely left 
me with the impression that Mr Min had objected and he 
20 
was overruled by someone.  Now who overrules your head 
of Global Legal, Chair, that is someone senior within the 
organisation.  So this contention that Bain Global senior 
leaders had no idea what was happening here in South 
Africa and the detail of it, for me, I struggle to follow that. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 109 of 319 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Then would you look next at 71.5 on 
page 42?  There Mr Min says that: 
Partners of the Bain SA office had also queried the 
Ambrobrite relationship particularly the payment of 
success fees to Ambrobrite.  Despite their requests, 
Mr Massone refused to provide them with copies of 
the Ambrobrite contract beyond displaying briefly on 
screen during a meeting. Their grasp of what the 
contract entailed was therefore vague.  These 
concerns were escalated at the time by the local 
10 
partner team before Meehan who then sought an 
explanation 
from 
Mr 
Massone 
of 
the 
“rational 
benefits, the risk management issues”.  Of note is 
Mr Meehan’s question, “where is the rest of the 
partner group on this?  We had talked about getting 
everyone else on board before proceeding” to which 
Mr Massone responded “the partner group is on 
board, Innocent and Fabreze(?) in particular as they 
are also going to be involved in the target clients”.  
He says this was not true.” 
20 
And then you have read the rest of that.  Could I just take 
you to your response at para 87 page 307?  You says that 
in this paragraph: 
“They…” 
That is Bain. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 110 of 319 
 
“…tried to portray Mr Massone as a lone rogue who 
was acting wrongfully and without head office’s 
knowledge or ignoring head office’s warnings.” 
And perhaps you can just summarise the rest of what you 
say there? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, this is – anyone who studies 
calamities or things to go wrong in any organisation, will 
know that it is never just a lone rogue.  Very rarely do 
organisations work where one person can do something 
without absolutely no one else’s knowledge of it.  It is just 
10 
– that is just not how organisations work and we also, 
myself as a business ethics scholar, has studied many 
occasions where corporates get things wrong and the first 
they do is, they say it is a lone rogue.  McKinsey says, it is 
one guy but I fired him, do not worry, things are sorted.  
Steinhoff says do not worry, Markus Jooste is out, it is 
sorted.  That is the first response and that is a cop-out 
because there is always a number of people who know 
what is going on.   
 
So 
Bain 
continuously, 
their 
media 
internal 
20 
communications everywhere seems to say to us the world, 
the public, there was a bad guy who did these bad things, 
we did not know about it, but do not worry, we have got rid 
of him, so everything is fine, nothing to see here and I 
make the point that firstly, my expertise and common sense 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 111 of 319 
 
would suggest to you that is not possible that no one knew 
what was going on but even if you ignore my expertise, just 
looking at the facts of the evidence we have seen of the 
email exchanges of the self-assessment reporting, of the 
meetings were going on, Bain is a partnership, it is not a 
corporation, it is a partnership, so the partners would know 
what is going on in South Africa, around the world. 
 
So this contention that Mr Massone was this lone 
rouge has to me no substance both in terms of my 
expertise and experience, anyone’s common sense or in 
10 
fact the evidence that we have got from Bain. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  The next paragraph I 
wish to refer you to is 77 on page 46, dealing here with the 
procurement process, what Mr Min says is: 
“Bain SA later received a request for proposal, RFP 
from SARS on 12 December 2014.  While it is likely 
that Mr Massone knew that such an RFP would be 
forthcoming that Bain SA had given some input into 
the draft RFP as Mr Williams confirms and that Bain 
SA was well-positioned given his strong relationship 
20 
with Mr Moyane Bain SA received a final RFP as the 
same time as other potential vendors and pitched 
alongside them.  There is no evidence that Bain SA 
expected 
this 
to 
be 
anything 
other 
than 
a 
competitive RFP process, Bain SA pitched for the 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 112 of 319 
 
work in December 2014.” 
So we went through that procurement process earlier and 
you have responded to that paragraph in 91 page 308 of 
your affidavit and what you …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see, Mr Franklin, that even the 
deponent 
to 
this 
affidavit 
says 
given 
their 
strong 
relationship with Mr Moyane Bain was well-positioned to be 
given the job. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, precisely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think that is quite interesting that it 
10 
comes from them. 
ADV 
FRANKLIN 
SC: 
 
 
Yes, 
it 
is 
one 
of 
several 
acknowledgements, Chair, which we would emphasise in 
due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, you may continue. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, para 91, page 308.  
What you say in the second sentence is: 
“Well before the RFP was issues SARS had clearly 
decided that they wanted to hire Bain and so 
explored a piggyback contract arrangement with 
20 
Telkom.  Only when this failed did SARS follow an 
RFP process but it was clear that they wanted to 
ensure that Bain were hired going as far as 
requesting client references even before the RFP 
had been issued.  In trying to arrange the piggyback 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 113 of 319 
 
contract with Telkom Mr Massone wrote to Mr 
Maseko that the Acting COO of SARS had called 
him and wants to give a mandate to Bain.” 
I think that is self-explanatory.  Anything you want to add? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, just one small part where Mr Min 
says that Bain had provided input to the RFP.  I think we 
have seen that Bain actually drafted the RFP. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR WILLIAMS:   Down to details of dates and everything 
else. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean, I do not know whether he seeks 
to – anywhere he seeks to provide an explanation how 
come they would provide to make an input on the 
preparation of the RFP as an outsider. 
MR WILLIAMS:   It is an astounding admission.  Chair, 
even the statement that SARS want to give a mandate to 
Bain suggests that they decided they want to give Bain this 
work and they were going to find some contractual way to 
make it happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Mr Franklin? 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Williams you 
have filed a comprehensive affidavit in answer, I am not 
going to take you to any other provisions for now.  Is there 
anything 
else 
that 
you 
wish 
to 
highlight 
from 
your 
answering affidavit? 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 114 of 319 
 
ADV LE ROUX:   Chair, Mr Cockrell has informed me that 
the live stream has stopped and he is therefore no longer 
in a position to follow the evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh the technicians are usefully the first 
ones to pick that up and they normally tell us.  Well, 
anyway, it is about one o’clock, maybe we may as well 
adjourn and if there is a problem hopefully it will have 
been sorted out when we return. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Franklin, there is an evening session 
10 
that was scheduled for this evening relating to Eskom, Ms 
Daniels, but because of how things have unfolded since 
yesterday, there may be a need to talk to the evidence 
leader.  I think I will talk to him but you might wish to talk 
to him, Mr Pule Seleka, about what arrangements may 
need to be made. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, I will.  We will over the lunch 
adjournment do that and if necessary I will, with your 
permission update you on what is happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ja, no, that is fine. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, we will adjourn now and resume at 
two o’clock.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 115 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, let us continue.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC: Thank you Chair.  Mr Williams, we 
had completed the exercise where you gave your comments 
to the version that Mr Min had put up on behalf of Bain in 
the Bain application to cross-examine.  Do you recall?   
MR WILLIAMS:  I do Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Yes, that brings us to the end of your 
testimony and I just wanted to know is there anything that 
you wish to say to the commission in conclusion? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair, if I may.  This testimony and the 
10 
last 18 months of me, leading up to me coming here has 
been incredibly hard for me.  To say the things I did about 
Bain was not easy because these are my friends.  These 
are people I have known for over 25 years.  
 
They gave me my big career break.  So I in no way 
made those statements lightly if I did not believe they were 
in the interest of South Africa.  I decided to resign from 
Bain even though I had an incredible offer, incredible job at 
Bain.  
 
It became clear to me that Bain were far more 
20 
interested in managing and protecting themselves from a 
DOJ prosecution or investigation in the US than making 
amends in South Africa and I made it clear to everyone at 
Bain.  
 
They understood that that is how I saw things 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 116 of 319 
 
happening.  Chair, just one comment that sorts of wraps it 
up for me.  This attitude towards South Africa, is an email 
in my submission to you where, what the Bain Manager 
says to a Bain Partner.  
 
If you go and see Mr Moyane at SARS, tell him his 
procurement and legal people are a bunch of losers.  It is 
in my affidavit, and for me this captured the sense of these 
people in South Africa are irrelevant to us.  We will just do 
what we want.  
 
For me the SARS legal and procurement people 
10 
were 
defending 
South 
Africa, 
defending 
the 
rules, 
defending our procurement, defending our democracy and 
for a senior Bain person to say they are a bunch of losers 
because they were resisting what we were trying to do, 
captured for me what I thought was wrong with what was 
happening at Bain and that was why I had to leave.  
 
Chair, I want to add my voice to two things which 
you have already heard in the commission.  The one is this 
desperate need for protection and support of whistle-
blowers which you have said desperately needs to happen 
20 
and of course I speak about that from my own experience 
for the last 18 months, which Chair, has been an horrific 
experience.  
 
The fear I have suffered, the intimidation I have 
suffered, the legal and financial uncertainty I have had to 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 117 of 319 
 
face.  Chair, 18 months ago I had this perfect career.  I 
was a part time partner at Bain.  I was a senior lecturer at 
UCT.   
 
Today as I sit here I am unemployed and as I 
understand it I am unemployable because it appears to me 
that corporate South Africa is uninterested in people with 
integrity.  The horrific cost I have experienced is not just 
the fear of the legal, the financial cost.  
 
It has been a cost to my health and the cost to my 
family and no amount of reparation and remedy can make 
10 
up for that cost to your family.  People ask me have I got 
regrets about what I have done.  I say I have got 
absolutely no regrets for what I have done, even the high 
cost I have incurred.  
 
But I do regrets the damages done to my family and 
the stress to my family.  So to my family I apologise.  
Judge, just to add to the second thing.  The first thing I am 
going to add my voice to the appeal of protection for 
whistle-blowers.  
 
The second thing is to hold these enablers of State 
20 
Capture accountable and we know, we talk about the banks 
and the corporates and the accounting firms and of course 
we know all of these and there is a lot of efforts around 
those.  
 
I just also want to add my voice to that need, 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 118 of 319 
 
having to hold these enablers accountable.  What is 
interesting judge, I think there was some secondary 
enablers.  There is enablers we know about and then there 
are companies out there who are continuing to do business 
with these companies who are involved in State Capture, 
and I think they are also part of this web of State Capture.  
 
I mentioned to you I had my job at UCT.  I was 
teaching ethics to business leaders and public sector 
leaders.  That is what I was doing, but I blew the whistle 
and stepped forward.  UCT asked me to leave.  From the 
10 
business school because they said you are doing all these 
Zondo stuff, you are doing all these things, you are writing 
your affidavit.   
 
Chair, to write my affidavit, 700 pages, I did it 
myself.  No law firm in South Africa would offer me 
support.  Even the commission said they could offer me no 
legal support.  I wrote that sitting at my desk at home with 
Google at my side, trying to figure out what to write and 
how to do it.  
 
UCT then said well, then I am neglecting my duties 
20 
as a senior lecturer and they asked me to leave.  This is 
the experience all whistle-blowers have, where they do not 
have the support where they are.  UCT continues to do 
business with companies that are involved in state capture.  
 
So I want to hear my voice to that call for us to hold 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 119 of 319 
 
accountable these enablers.  I and that has been my call 
today and all along Chair.  All I wanted from Bain was to 
make full disclosure and then make amends for it.  That is 
what I was interested in.  
 
I launched a public campaign recently to urge Bain 
to make full disclosure and that had two and a half 
thousand signatures.  South Africans saying yes, that is 
our call.  But Chair, just in closing if I may you know, as a 
social philosopher and as a moral philosopher and I know I 
must go and finish my PHD still ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must finish it.  You must complete it.  
MR WILLIAMS:  I must finish it, I will come back to you 
when I am done.  But Chair, it strikes me that we in South 
Africa are living in an era of the bully.  You can talk about 
corruption and greed and all the rest of it, but I think we 
have got a culture where bullies dominate.  
 
Politicians bully the civil servants, civil servants 
bully citizens, corporate leaders bully their employees and 
they can bully and do this because there is lack of 
accountability and no consequences, and so I think this is 
20 
why the bullies get away with us.  
 
Bullies are [indistinct] in our society.  We see it with 
gender base violence that bullies feel they can get away 
with anything.  That gangsters feel they can get away with 
anything.  In my view we have got to stop these bullies.  
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 120 of 319 
 
 
We need to move from this era of the bully to the 
era of the brave.  Of politicians now being brave enough to 
stand up to these bullies.  Of legislators willing to go and 
institute laws to stop these bullies, because I cannot see 
us moving out of this world of corruption where we all live 
in fear.  
 
So I speak to people in companies saying you have 
seen corruption there, why do you not speak up and they 
talk about the fear they face and so we need brave people, 
brave people like our civil servants, our corporate leaders 
10 
into be acting.  
 
Brave people like our health care workers, our 
school teachers, our nurses and I think brave people like 
whistle-blowers 
who 
stand 
up 
and 
act, 
not 
just 
for 
themselves, but in the interest of our country, and Chair 
just in closing, I wrote that email to Bain in September 
2018 when I first got involved, where I said my hierarchy of 
interest is South Africa first, then myself, then Bain.   
 
I think we are beginning to move a needle in South 
Africa.  This moral infliction we are at when corporate 
20 
leaders, business leaders, lawyers, citizens are willing to 
act in a way beyond themselves but in the interest of our 
country.   
 
Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, thank you Mr Williams.  Just two or 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 121 of 319 
 
three things.  One, you mentioned that the commission 
could also not five you or offer you lawyers.  I assume that 
what you mean is that they could not say get a lawyer that 
the commission will pay for you, because otherwise 
members of the legal team, it is their job to interview 
people who want to give evidence and prepare affidavits 
for them.  
 
I was told at some stage because I think as you 
said it has been a long journey between yourself and the 
commission since we started.  Contact was made between 
10 
the commission and yourself, that you were looking for 
lawyers to assist you and I assumed maybe in Cape Town. 
 
So I just want to have clarification that whether you 
are talking about members of the legal team refusing to 
assist you or whether you are talking about you being told 
the commission cannot pay for your lawyers.  Is it the 
latter? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair, it strikes me that there is a third 
option there somehow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
20 
MR WILLIAMS:  I was lost right, I was getting calls from 
Bain people, Bain lawyers reflecting all sorts of things, and 
so I was just confused, afraid, not knowing what to do and 
so I approached the commission and said if you are asking 
me, you asked me now to write an affidavit, that was never 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 122 of 319 
 
my intention. 
 
Initially you asked me for documents, I sent you the 
documents.  Then you said write an affidavit and then I 
said how, how do I write this affidavit, and after that 
contacted the law firms who said they could not because 
they were conflicted.  
 
I still said I do not know how to write an affidavit.  
Can some legal person help me with this.  So whether it is 
a 
commission 
legal 
person 
or 
a 
legal 
person 
the 
commission pays, it was irrelevant.  It was just I needed 
10 
help to do this thing because I knew this thing was going to 
be an important document.  
 
Even now when I see Bain comment on things I said 
in my document, it is possible I have caused trouble for 
myself, because I sat down and just wrote this from what I 
knew.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I am surprised if that is the case 
because the legal team performs that task.  But sometimes, 
some people prefer to have their affidavits prepared by 
their lawyers and then their lawyers keep in touch with the 
20 
members of the legal team.   
 
But the first thing is that they would be saying that 
is the legal team, can we interview you and take the 
statement, do an affidavit for you but it is your choice if 
you say no, I have got lawyers, I will get lawyers to do that 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 123 of 319 
 
for me and then they can send it to you. 
 
You say that is not ...[intervenes]  
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair, I met with the investigators and I 
apologise, they can speak for themselves.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR 
WILLIAMS: 
 At 
no 
point 
did 
anyone 
from 
the 
commission offer to write an affidavit for me.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR WILLIAMS:  I was asked to write an affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, I will find out how that 
10 
happened 
or 
hear 
what 
they 
have 
to 
say 
and 
the 
commission will be in touch with you in regard to that, 
because as I say the idea is that members of the legal 
team are the ones, the investigators also do that.  
MR WILLIAMS:  Ja, I paid for my own travel to come here.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes.  Well, you in terms of 
your own travel the commission should be able to take care 
of that.  Was there any discussion about your travelling 
expenses?   
MR WILLIAMS:  Not this time, last time there was.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that so? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Ja, but I do not want to waste your time 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no but that is fine.  Mr Franklin is 
there, he hears what you say.  I think he will talk to his 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 124 of 319 
 
team and somebody in his team will try and find out what 
the position is, but you certainly should not have paid your 
own travelling expenses to be here and as far as I am 
concerned, the commission should refund you.  
 
But apart from that, I wanted to also ask and Mr 
Franklin might be able to say, we did not cover this but of 
course we were working within time constraints.  I thought 
there was a portion in his affidavit that dealt with items by 
Bain to I think in your words to silence you or something 
like that.   
10 
 
Was that oversight not to cover it or because he 
said, he confirmed it? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Yes, judge.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  We decided for a variety of reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Some of them time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  That it was not directly relevant to 
the extent that the remainder of the evidence was relevant.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And for that reason it was not 
covered in oral testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Of course it is still in the affidavit. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 125 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And Mr Williams has confirmed it is 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no that is fine, but other than 
that, Mr Williams I do want to re-affirm that I believe that 
we should have a strong protection for whistle-blowers in 
our country in terms of legislation.  There should be strong 
protection, because if whistle-blowers were not there, 
maybe half of the things that we know about State Capture 
and corruption in South Africa we would not know.  
10 
 
So it is very, very important.  So if you have 
suggestions or submissions you want to make, feel free to 
write 
something 
and 
send 
to 
the 
secretary 
of 
the 
commission.  I have extended [indistinct] invitation to other 
people.  
 
I think it should be, should have a strong protection 
because if we do not have a strong protection for whistle-
blowers, 
then 
our 
fights 
against 
corruption 
will 
be 
weakened in a very significant way.  But I also then take 
this opportunity to thank you for taking the time to avail 
20 
yourself to come and give evidence before the commission, 
and for the fact that also you have not been discouraged 
from coming to assist the commission. 
 
We appreciate it very much. 
MR WILLIAMS:  Thank you judge.  
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 126 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you Mr Williams for your 
testimony.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you are excused.  Do you know 
whether you would need a few minutes adjournment or we 
can go straight away? 
ADV 
FRANKLIN 
SC: 
 
I 
think 
we 
can 
commence 
immediately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You can call the next witness.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you, our next witness is Mr 
10 
Vlok Symington.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember to sanitise the file as well.   
ADV FOURIE SC: Chair, if may place myself on record 
again? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV FOURIE SC:  It is Greg Fourie from the Johannesburg 
Bar.  I appear for Mr Symington.  I am instructed by Mr 
Bernard Hotz of Werksmans Attorneys.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. Yes, Mr Franklin?   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Good afternoon Mr 
20 
Symington. 
MR SYMINGTON: Afternoon Mr Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  You should have in front of you a file 
which is marked SARS Bundle 02. 
MR SYMINGTON: Yes.  
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 127 of 319 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Could I ask you to open that file.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Before he does, let us have the oath 
administered to him or affirmation.  Registrar, have they 
taken your mic?  Well, somebody must look after the mic, 
that mic and if it is given to somebody else, they must 
make sure it is returned, otherwise we will be delayed 
because there is no mic.  
 
Okay, please stand up Mr Symington for the oath or 
affirmation.     
REGISTRAR:  Mr Symington, will you be taking the oath or 
10 
affirmation?   
WITNESS:  Yes.  Affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Okay.  Please state your full names for the 
record. 
WITNESS:  Johan Daniel Vlok ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Can you hear, could you hear Mr 
Symington?  Okay, just speak up Mr Symington. 
MR SYMINGTON: Sure, ja. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
WITNESS:  Johan Daniel Vlok Symington. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath, affirmation?  Sorry. 
WITNESS:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you affirm that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?  
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 128 of 319 
 
If so, please raise your right hand and say I truly affirm. 
WITNESS:  I affirm. 
JOHAN DANIEL VLOK SYMINGTON:  (d.s.s) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You may be seated.  Yes, Mr 
Franklin? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you Chair.  I had asked you Mr 
Symington to have available before you SARS Bundle 02.  
Do you have it? 
MR SYMINGTON: Yes, sir.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And would you please turn to page 
10 
116 
and 
can 
I 
just 
orientate 
you, 
throughout 
these 
proceedings I will ask you to turn to the page which 
appears on the top left hand side of the page, in black 
numerals.   
 
Page 116 is the commencement of an affidavit by 
yourself, is that correct?   
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Please turn to page 171.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Symington, I am sorry.  I just want to 
confirm.  When you were responding to the registrar when 
20 
she asked you to give your full names, I heard as if you 
were pronouncing your surname as Symington. 
MR SYMINGTON: Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But is it Symington, not Symington? 
MR SYMINGTON: Well, it is up to you Chair.  
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 129 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no that is alright.  I just wanted to 
make sure I use the correct pronunciation.  Okay, alright.  
Mr Franklin? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you, I need to correct myself 
as well.  Mr Symington, at page 171 it appears that you 
signed this affidavit on the 2 n d of November 2020.  Is that 
correct? 
MR SYMINGTON: Yes.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Can you confirm then that the 
document at page 116 to 171 is an affidavit without 
10 
annexures to which you attested on the 2 n d of November 
2020, and that it is truthful and accurate in all respects? 
MR SYMINGTON: Yes, Chair it is.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you.  I would like to take you 
to a number of different topics.  We will do so with 
reference to the affidavit and to the annexures which you 
have attached.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want me to admit it Mr Franklin? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Yes, please.  That should be 
admitted as Exhibit WW3.  Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you said without annexures.  It does 
not have annexures? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  No, it does.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  So the affidavit with annexures 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 130 of 319 
 
should be admitted please.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  The affidavit of Mr Johan 
Daniel Vlok Symington, which starts at page 116 will 
together with its annexures be admitted as an exhibit and 
will be marked as Exhibit WW3.  Okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Symington, 
some background facts first.  By whom are you employed? 
MR SYMINGTON: Chair, I am employed by the South 
African Revenue Service.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  In what capacity? 
10 
MR SYMINGTON: At the moment I am a senior executive of 
SARS in the executive committee of SARS.  That is where I 
am.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And since when have you been 
employed by SARS? 
MR SYMINGTON:  I have been employed by the head office 
of SARS since the 1 s t of April 1990. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  So it is for more than 30 years? 
MR SYMINGTON: Yes, Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And what field are you in at SARS?  
20 
What services do you provide for SARS? 
MR SYMINGTON: Chair, that has ranged over the years.  
On the 1 s t of April when I joined the head office of SARS, I 
was actually dumped in the deep water by having to take 
care of the matters relating to pension funds, government 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 131 of 319 
 
funds, retirement annuity funds and so forth.  
 
Over the years my career has developed into what 
we call personal income tax and that at the moment is my 
field of expertise.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And would you let the commission 
know what your qualifications are? 
MR SYMINGTON: Yes Chair, although I must mention 
having heard Mr Williams’ testimony, I am ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not so confident to mention  
yours? 
10 
MR SYMINGTON: I am hesitant but I will share with you.  ‘ 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR SYMINGTON: So I have got a BCom in financial 
management and LLB. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And is it correct that during your 
tenure at SARS you have inter alia provided legal advice to 
the organisation? 
MR SYMINGTON: Yes, Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  You mentioned earlier pensions and 
provident funds.  Do you have any particular knowledge 
20 
and experience of those? 
MR SYMINGTON: Yes, Chair.  One must understand that 
where SARS fits into that area, because it is not that 
obvious, but the hibiscus incentivize people to save for 
their retirement via a pension fund or so, and it uses the 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 132 of 319 
 
Income Tax Act to incentivise that by making sure that the 
fund itself is exempt from tax. 
 
That contributions to the fund is deductible and so 
on and that is where SARS fits into the area.  Now that of 
course allowed myself and the team that I worked with to 
engage very intimately with the retirement fund industry.  
At that time, it was the industry was represented by the 
live offices association, now it is called ASISA if I 
remember correctly, as well as the institute for retirement. 
 
Over the years we have built up a very workable 
10 
relationship, and one or two examples of that would be 
what we know today as reservation funds.  That vehicle 
was developed between myself and the LOA and the 
institute for retirement funds.  
 
Another example would be what we refer to as living 
annuities or equity linked annuities.  That again was a 
product that we release in the market together with the live 
offices association and the IRF.  so those were the, I was 
very intimately involved in that industry and as a result of 
that I was acknowledged by both inside SARS and outside, 
20 
as an expert in the field of pension law, if one can refer to 
it.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you.  Now you are called 
principally to tell the commission about the events of the 
18 t h of October 2016 but in order to give that context, I 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 133 of 319 
 
would like to go back to what you have dealt with under the 
heading broader background on page 117 of your affidavit.  
 
What you say in paragraph Symington, is this: 
 
“What follows under this heading is what I 
understand and am advised forms part of the 
public record or falls within the public domain 
and is regularly reported by the media.  I do 
not have personal knowledge of these facts, 
but they are relevant to the context in which 
this affidavit is made.” 
10 
 
Now the commission has heard great deal of 
evidence covering the issues which you have dealt with 
here, and so I am not going to lead you through it, but in 
essence what you have outlined here, is the changes in the 
Minister ’s of Finance in 2015 and 2016, where Mr Nene 
was replaced by Mr van Rooyen and then by Minister 
Gordhan. 
 
You have also referred to allegations of State 
Capture by Mr Mcebesi Jonas in January of 2016 and you 
have placed Mr Gordhan in that milieu together with other 
20 
officials in the national treasury and you have said on the 
strength of the facts that you have set out in the public 
domain that it appeared that inter alia Mr Gordhan was an 
obstacle to parties involved in State Capture.  
 
Is that an accurate summary of the background? 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 134 of 319 
 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes, it is.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Alright.  So if I could then take you to 
paragraph 16 of your affidavit.  It is also well known that 
accusations 
of 
criminal 
conduct 
were 
made 
against 
Minister Gordhan by the Directorate for Priority Crimes, 
also known as the Hawks, and you know also that during 
the early parts of 2016 it was widely reported that the 
Hawks were investigating a broad range of allegations 
against Mr Gordhan, including alleged involvement in the 
so called SARS rogue unit and other activities.  
10 
 
Is that correct? 
MR SYMINGTON: Yes, Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Then could I ask you to turn to the 
first of the annexures to your affidavit which is VS1, page 
172.  Am I correct that this is the covering letter under 
cover of which was sent to Mr Gordhan by the Hawks a list 
of what has become known as the 27 questions? 
MR SYMINGTON: Yes, Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And you have highlighted in your 
statement, questions regarding Mr Ivan Pillay and you have 
20 
identified in particular paragraphs 21 to 25 of the 27 
questions, correct? 
MR SYMINGTON: Yes, Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And those relate to Mr Ivan Pillay 
and his functions at SARS, his application for early 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 135 of 319 
 
retirement 
and 
his 
engagement 
on 
an 
independent 
contractor contract, is that correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Now that letter, as you will see, 
refers to a particular case number and you have reflected 
that 
case 
number 
in 
paragraph 
20 
and 
that 
is 
CAS427/05/15 and could you tell the Chair what that 
relates to, what alleged offenses and whether that later 
was expanded to include further offenses? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair I think I can elaborate on 
10 
that, that number is the very same number that was used to 
lay charges in in May 2015 if my recollection is correct by 
Mr Moyane against a number of names.  So that is the 
number that was used in that. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright, Mr Ivan Pillay - who is Mr 
Pillay and what was his position at the time that the events 
that we are talking about took place.  Let us go back to 
2010 to 2009, 2010.  What position did he hold at that 
time? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Chair, if my recollection is correct, and 
20 
I am speaking under a correction, he was heading up our 
enforcement area in SARS.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, just continuing with the 
various charges Mr Gordhan responded to the 27 questions 
we know, and then also, it is a matter of public record that 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 136 of 319 
 
on the 11 t h of October 2016, the while National Director of 
Public Prosecutions Advocate Sean Abraham's announced 
that various charges would be brought against Minister 
Gordhan and also Mr Oupa Magashula who was a former 
Commissioner of SARS and Mr Pillay, is that correct?  
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair it is. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And those charges related to the 
approval during 2009 of a request by Mr Pillay that he be 
allowed to take early retirement and that thereafter he be 
appointed by SARS on a fixed term contract basis, is that 
10 
correct?  
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And is it correct that, at that time 
you furnished a memorandum to the then Commissioner, in 
which you expressed various views? 
MR SYMINGTON:   That was then in March 2009, right 
Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Could I take you please to the 
document 
which 
appears 
at 
page 
202, 
is 
that 
the 
memorandum that you speak of? 
20 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair that is, yes Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And who was it addressed to, it was 
a Commissioner who was that? 
MR SYMINGTON:   It was to, the Commissioner at that 
time was Mr Gordhan. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 137 of 319 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And what gave rise to the request 
for you to provide this memorandum, what was its purpose? 
MR SYMINGTON:   But, Chair I was asked by Mr Pillay to 
write a memo to the Commissioner on these matters that I 
raise or that he raised with me and that then related to the 
application, the lawfulness of the of him wanting to go on 
early retirement and the lawfulness and the availability of 
the provisions in the Public Service Act, which allows the 
Minister to allow somebody to go on early retirement.  
And then the third item that he asked me about was 
10 
the lawfulness of being appointed after his retirement at 
SARS and that is the context of it. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright, we can read the opinion 
ourselves but what was the conclusion to which you came 
and what did you advise the Commissioner? 
MR SYMINGTON:   So my advice is very cryptic and that is 
the way that we would normally write to a Commissioner 
and in Mr Gordhan's instance, as an example, when he 
went to somebody to ask for advice, he knows where to go 
and so his never really interested in the detail, setting out 
20 
of the law, his interested in my research outcome of the 
law.  And so I advised him in broad terms that all three, 
one, two and three or one or one or two or three is lawful. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, we will return to that. And, of 
course, then could I ask you to look at the document at 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 138 of 319 
 
page 204 and following, is that a letter which is addressed 
by Mr sorry, by Commissioner Magashula dated the 12 t h of 
August 2010 to the then Minister of Finance, Mr Gordhan? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And we can read it but is it correct, 
that the Commissioner sought the Minister's approval for 
this, of these issues that you had timed on in your 
memorandum of the 17 t h of March 2009, i.e. the application 
for early retirement, the waving of the early retirement 
penalty, and the request to be appointed on contract after 
10 
his early retirement. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And then if you would look please at 
page 207 at the bottom of the page there is a date 18 
October 2010 and there is a signature EJ Gordhan, 
Minister of Finance and it is indicated as having been 
approved, you know what the Minister was approving? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair I must just mention that I 
was not involved in this letter.  So this is what we know 
that was sent to the Minister, that this would have been the 
20 
Minister approving the recommendation under six on this 
same page. That is normally how we set it out, so we ask 
the Minister or to whoever we write like the Commissioner, 
we make a recommendation and then that is what is then 
approved. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 139 of 319 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   That took place in 2010.  Now 
jumping ahead, six years later, you have explained how the 
genesis of criminal charges that were brought against 
various SARS officials.  It is also a matter of public record 
that a summons to appear in a criminal court on charges of 
fraud which was served on Mr Gordhan, Magashula and 
Pillay on or about 11 October 2016.  That prompted a letter 
from an NGO which wrote to the National Prosecuting 
Authority and essentially indicated that there was no basis 
to proceed with the prosecution and that it should be 
10 
withdrawn, is that correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And would you look please, at the 
letter from the Helen Suzman Foundation, which appears 
as annexure VS3 at page 193, you have that? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   We need not go through the full 
content of the letter but what the attorneys acting on 
behalf of the Helen Suzman Foundation do is draw to the 
attention of the National Director of Public Prosecution 
20 
certain materials which they regard as relevant in relation 
to the decision to proceed with a prosecution against these 
three individuals, is that correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Please look at paragraph 6.5 on 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 140 of 319 
 
page 196.  Now, having made an allegation on the previous 
page that the charges are unsustainable, and may in fact 
be actuated by recklessness for ulterior purpose, and the 
following is said in para 6.6: 
“The position is simply reinforced by the following 
contemporaneous documentation raised related to 
the retirement of Mr Pillay.” 
And then there are various documents which are attached. 
Please look firstly at what is attached as annexure A, 
which you will find on page 200.  That is an internal 
10 
memorandum from Mr Pillay dated the 27 t h of November 
2009 and the purpose is stated to be: 
“To explain that I have decided to take early 
retirement as well as to request you to consider to 
recommend for possible approval by the Minister 
certain related matters that will flow from my 
decision to take early retirement.” 
That is addressed to the Commissioner at the time Mr 
Magashula. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair.  
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Then going back to the Helen 
Suzman letter, there is an annexure B which is also 
accompanies the letter, and that is a legal and policy 
division memorandum dated the 17 t h of March 2009, which 
you find at page 202 to 203.  That is your memorandum, is 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 141 of 319 
 
that correct?  
MR SYMINGTON:   That is it, Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And then the third document is 
annexure C, which is a memorandum dated the 12 t h of 
August 2010, which you find at page 204 to 207, which we 
looked at earlier, which is a recommendation made by the 
Commissioner to the Minister of Finance and ultimately an 
approval by the Minister of Finance, is that correct?  
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And on the strength of these 
10 
documents, you see that the Helen Suzman Foundation 
called upon the NDPP to unconditionally withdraw the 
charges failing which they would bring proceedings, is that 
correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, I then would like to take you 
please to paragraph 29 of your affidavit, which is at page 
122.  Now you say that a Dr JP Pretorius was instructed by 
Mr Abrahams to reconsider the charges in the light of the 
allegations made in the FUL, as it is being called F-u-l, 
20 
Helen Suzman Foundation letter of the 14 t h of October 
2016, which we have looked at, who was Dr Pretorius? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Dr Pretorius is employed by the NPA 
and he was also the author of the letter that was sent to 
the Hawks that was asking me to make an affidavit on the 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 142 of 319 
 
18 t h of October 2016. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright, you call that the Pretorius 
letter and we will come to it in due course.  But the 
essence of it is that the Pretorius letter as you have called 
it contained a set of questions to you regarding your 2009 
memorandum, is that correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair, and that happened because 
of what the Evidence Leader referred to earlier the 
submissions was about the Helen Suzman Foundation and 
another one that included my memo of 2009 and I suspect 
10 
the NPA wanted to know more about this memo and so I 
received this letter with a number of questions they have 
asked me about. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright, before we get to the events 
of 18 October 2016 and subsequent to that, it is a matter 
of public record that on the 31 s t of October 2016, Mr 
Abrahams convened a further press conference in which he 
announced that all the charges against Minister Gordhan, 
Magashula and Pillay were withdrawn with immediate 
effect. 
20 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair that is correct.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   So, very shortly after having 
announced the bringing of the charges, they are withdrawn. 
Would you look please; at annexure VS4 you will find that 
at page 221. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 143 of 319 
 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes.  
ADV 
FRANKLIN 
SC: 
 
 
That 
is 
a 
written 
media 
announcement by Advocate Abrahams, dated the 31 s t of 
October 2016.  Is it your understanding that this was 
presented to the press on that day? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   It is a lengthy memorandum but I 
want to please identify certain parts of it. Please look at 
paragraph 14.4 on page 224.   
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Now, it is said there: 
“Mr Pillay first applied to go on early retirement in 
December 2008, when a vastly experienced Human 
Resource Specialist in the employ of SARS was 
requested to prepare a memorandum for the early 
retirement of Mr Pillay.” 
Do you know, who that vastly experienced person was?  
MR SYMINGTON:   Not really, sir Chair that, no. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright, then please look at the – 
over the page, at page 225 paragraph 14 the memorandum 
20 
was for the attention of the Commissioner, who is Mr 
Gordhan at the time to recommend to the then Minister to 
consider approving the early retirement of Mr Pillay in 
terms of provisions of Section 16(6)(a) and B of the Public 
Services Act.  
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 144 of 319 
 
Now, 
if 
I 
could 
take 
you 
forward 
please 
to 
paragraph 27 on page 240 and what is said here is: 
“FUL and the HFS also inter alia placed reliance on 
a memorandum from a SARS legal and policy 
division employee Mr Vlok Symington, dated the 
17 t h of March of 2009.” 
That is your memorandum that we have looked at? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Then in paragraph 28 what Mr 
Abrahams records is that: 
10 
“This document only came to the attention of the 
prosecutors 
for 
the 
first 
time 
by 
way 
of 
the 
submission by FUL and the HSF and is advised to 
the Commissioner of SARS, as a result of Mr Pillay 
having 
requested 
him 
to 
consider 
one, 
his 
application for early retirement from the GEPF, two 
his application to the Minister of Finance to waive 
early retirement penalty, and three, his request to 
be 
reappointed 
on 
contract 
after 
his 
early 
retirement from the GEPF.” 
20 
And then, in paragraph 29, the advice that you gave is set 
out and summarised, do you see that? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And then going forward to paragraph 
33 on page 245 what Mr Abraham says: 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 145 of 319 
 
“The advice of Symington appears to have largely 
influenced Mr Pillay and Mr Magashula.” 
And then he says in para 39: 
“I foresee great difficulty in proving the requisite 
animos.” 
You are a legal person; you understand him there to be 
talking about the intention to commit a crime? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, sir, yes Chair, mens rea.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Then please look at paragraph 38 to 
41, what the conclusion is by Mr Abrahams is: 
10 
“As a result, and in the absence of any other 
evidence to the contrary I am satisfied that Mr 
Magashula, Mr Pillay and Minister Gordhan did not 
have the requisite intention to act unlawfully.” 
39: 
“I am of the view that the matter could easily have 
been clarified had there been proper engagement 
and 
cooperation 
between 
the 
Hawks 
and 
Mr 
Magashula, Mr Pillay and Minister Gordhan.” 
40: 
20 
“In the circumstances, I have decided to overrule 
the 
decision 
to 
prosecute 
and 
those 
three 
gentleman on the charges listed in the summons.  
As such, I have directed the summonses to be 
withdrawn with immediate effect, and there would 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 146 of 319 
 
thus no longer be any need for Mr Magashula, Mr 
Pillay and Mr Gordhan to appear in court in respect 
to 
the 
charges 
listed 
in 
the 
aforementioned 
summonses.” 
Now have you read that, this announcement yourself in 
preparation for this hearing? 
MR SYMINGTON:   I have read it not now, but in 2016, I 
did. Mr Franklin and Mr Chair what is not very clear to me 
if one looks at 39 on page 246 where Mr Abrahams says 
that in the sorry, he says: 
10 
“I am of the view that this matter could easily have 
been clarified had there have been an engagement 
between the Hawks, Mr Magashula, Mr Pillay and 
Minister Gordhan.” 
Now that may very well be so but this memorandum of Bain 
dated March 2009 was in the hands of Mr Moyane since 
December 2014 up to about six months later, and that 
happened to be in the hands of Mr Moyane because he 
asked for Mr Pillay’s HR file.  
Well, he did not ask for it Mr Pillay we learned 
20 
asked for it but it landed ultimately not in the hands of Mr 
Pillay it landed in the hands of Mr Moyane and it was kept 
in his office under lock and key from what I understand for 
about six months.  
Now, my memorandum was in his file and I know 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 147 of 319 
 
that because HR confirmed that to me not long ago, by way 
of email.  So it was - one would have expected that in the - 
that when the Hawks had talks with Mr Moyane, that he 
could have made that memo available to the Hawks as 
well, and I just wanted to add that there.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, thank you.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am sorry, Mr Franklin, there was 
clarification provided yesterday and I think previously, in 
regard to the evidence of Mr Gordhan and Mr Moyane 
during cross examination, that in the criminal complaint 
10 
that Mr Moyane had laid with Police, he had not included 
Minister Gordhan. 
I wonder whether that may have been in relation to 
Mr Pillay’s early retirement that may have anything to do 
with the fact that he was aware of this memorandum.  You 
obviously you might not be able to say…[intervene] 
MR SYMINGTON:   I will not know that.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you would know that. 
MR SYMINGTON:   All I can say is that it was in his hands. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   On that score, Mr Symington, could I 
take a please to annexure VS20 on page 293, which is 
dated the 19 t h of October 2016.  
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Do you have that, that is before the 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 148 of 319 
 
withdrawal of the charges.  
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, sir.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And what is that letter? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Mr Chair, I did not really know what this 
letter was about, but it listed my name and Mr Lowe's name 
and then there was a Mike and Gilbert and again those last 
two I have never met.  But this letter what it looks like is 
that he is giving us permission, all these names in the 
letter permission to share information with the Hawks.  
Now why this would be relevant, on the one hand, but on 
10 
the other hand, I do not really understand why it was 
necessary for this letter. 
Normally, if we have to reveal what we refer to as 
taxpayer information or SARS information, we would have 
to get the permission of the Commissioner, when it is just 
normal SARS information in HR matters, and if it is a 
taxpayer info, then we are not allowed to share it unless 
ordered by a court.  So I am not sure what the reason is 
for this letter to have went out but it did.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, and what it says it is a letter 
20 
from the then Commissioner Mr Tom Moyane dated 19 
October 2016 to the colonel, head of organised crime, and 
the caption is CAS427/05/2015, is that the criminal case 
number that we referred to earlier? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair and if I may? 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 149 of 319 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Chair, the relevance of it, and this also 
goes back to the 27 equations that were posed to Mr 
Gordhan in February 2016, where this number was used as 
well, but it shows that somehow that matter, you know, a 
case number has morphed into something which was not 
initially there.  It may have been in the minds because 
ultimately when you look at these things, and you look at 
the way that the charges were framed one, ultimately it 
would have led to Mr Gordhan, so even though his name 
10 
was not mentioned there, there was a likelihood that 
whether it is the Rogue Unit or whether it is the pension 
fund matter it might have led ultimately, to Mr Gordhan in 
any event, but that is the relevance. 
So even on this date which was very soon after the 
incident, that we will come to later it refers to myself and 
Mr Louw, I do not know why Mr Louw but it refers to me.  
So this re-confirms that in the mind of Mr Moyane who is 
the author of this letter he was the complainant in this 
matter and he says so.   
20 
When one goes to paragraph 2 of that very same 
letter, he says in the second sentence.  Now, it reads a bit 
weird, but it says: 
“As a compliant in this matter.” 
And I assume it must read as a complainant in this matter. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 150 of 319 
 
“I have to ensure that all relevant SARS officials.” 
And then it goes on, so in his eyes he sees himself as the 
complainant in the pension fund matter because that is 
where I was involved. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   But just to clarify then the original 
complaint under this case number CAS427 related to the 
Rogue Unit, you said that then morphed, what did it morph 
into? 
MR 
SYMINGTON: 
 
 
Mr 
Chair 
it 
morphed 
into 
an 
investigation into the validity or the lawfulness of the early 
10 
retirement of Mr Ivan Pillay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And was your role in regard to that matter 
was your role acknowledged by the Hawks maybe and Mr 
Moyane as simply the memorandum then that you provided 
or was there an allegation that you played any other role in 
regard to the early retirement? 
MR SYMINGTON:  So Chair at this stage… 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you understood the position. 
MR SYMINGTON:  And I am not left behind sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja let me repeat.  I just want to know from 
20 
you what your understanding was of what it is that you were 
said to have done that was unlawful or criminal?  So in 
relation to the early retirement matter of Mr Pillay. 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you alleged to have done anything 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 151 of 319 
 
wrong other than the provision of that memorandum of the 
9t h? 
MR SYMINGTON:  No I was never – no Sir – no Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SYMINGTON:  Never. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So was your understanding that whatever 
charges they had in mind for you it was because of that 
memorandum that you provided? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Are you now referring to the aftermath – 
the disciplinary charges? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The disciplinary charges.  I see that in this 
letter at page 293 your name appears there. 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that refers to that criminal case in 
Brooklyn and I understood you to say it morphed into a 
matter relating to the early retirement. 
MR SYMINGTON:  Oh yes.  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or did you misunderstand something? 
MR SYMINGTON:  No, no, no.  So and that is also my – why 
I do not really know why this letter was you know is there.  It 
20 
happens to be a day or two after the 18t h of October when 
that incident happened at the SARS offices involving myself 
that no one ever – no one from SARS ever asked me about 
that memo of  2009 so I do not know why really he thought 
that I should have this sort of permission. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 152 of 319 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  So just to clarify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Mr Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  This is – this is – does not relate to 
any criminal charges against the four people it relates to 
permission which is granted by the Commissioner for these 
people to give information to the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I thought that the giving of information 
was related to the early retirement. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Yes but it is not as though they were 
themselves the subject of a criminal … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it was not – okay, no, no that clarifies it 
ja. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  You have dealt with this in your 
statement at paragraph 87 where you talk about this letter of 
the 19t h of October 2016 and you have explained in para 88 
that the four employees mentioned in that letter had no 
20 
knowledge, no involvement or knowledge of events relating 
to – I am sorry let me just start again.   
 
The four employees who are there are yourself, 
Louw, Paiyega and Gunn and you say Pege and Gun had no 
involvement with or knowledge of events leading up to 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 153 of 319 
 
Pillay’s retirement. 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Therefore the Hawks would presumably 
have wished to interview them in relation to the alleged 
rogue unit of which Louw and I had no involvement or no 
knowledge of.  Clearly the inference can be drawn that at the 
time Moyane signed this letter he was aware that the scope 
of the initial investigation had been expanded to include the 
Pillay retirement issue. 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Is that correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Right.  Alright could I then just take 
you back in the chronology of events and there had been the 
27 questions, there had been the Helen Suzman Foundation 
letter, the Hawks and the NDPP were taking the criminal 
charges – well they were reconsidering whether they should 
be proceeded with or not and there was a request inter alia 
to Mr Moyane as to whether or not there were any further 
representation or submissions to be made by him as to why 
20 
the charges against Gordhan et al should not be withdrawn.  
And could I take you to that letter at VS22? 
MR SYMINGTON:  On which page is that? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Page 297.  298. 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 154 of 319 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And what … 
MR SYMINGTON:  So –  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Yes perhaps you can explain it? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Chair so this letter was written by 
Advocate Abraham to Mr Moyane on the 17t h October 2016 
and the – the purpose of this letter was to give Mr Moyane 
the opportunity to make representations to the NPA about 
whether the charges here should be withdrawn against Mr 
Magashule and Pillay and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Franklin I went to 297 that is 
10 
not the page you… 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  No that is the covering email the 
action letter is 298. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I have – okay I have got it. Yes 
continue Mr Symington. 
MR SYMINGTON:  So Chair I think also if I may just Mr.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SYMINGTON:  Franklin.  Chair what is also relevant of 
this letter is that the NPA Mr Abrahams saw Mr Moyane as 
the complainant in the very same matter.  But nothing to do 
20 
with the rogue unit – so called rogue unit.  But all to do with 
the early retirement of Mr Pillay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And this is the day before the events 
which I shall get to now. 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 155 of 319 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And on that day Mr Moyane had been 
asked whether he had any representations as to whether the 
charges should be withdrawn or not. 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Alright could I then take you to the 
events of the 18t h of October 2016 which you deal with in 
your statement at paragraph 37 on page 124 and following.  
And could I ask you please to – to deal with that in your own 
words as to – as to what happened?  You have already 
sketched the background and that is that you had been 
10 
requested in a letter from Dr Pretorius to answer certain 
questions in by way of an affidavit arising from the 27 
questions and your memorandum.  Is that correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  So please can you take the Chair 
through the events of that day as you have set out in your 
statement? 
MR SYMINGTON:  So Chair I will give you an overview of it I 
think and then to the extent that you need more detail you 
will – you are also welcome to ask.   
20 
 
So Chair this day which was a Tuesday was like any 
other day.  It was a normal day I was asked in the morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this was Tuesday? 
MR SYMINGTON:  The 18t h of October. 
CHAIRPERSON:  October 2016. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 156 of 319 
 
MR SYMINGTON:  2016 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR SYMINGTON:  And I was asked by Mr Louw who was my 
direct line manager at that point.  He was also the – a Chief 
legal Officer of SARS.  I was asked by him to visit him in his 
office and there he handed me a set of documents which was 
the letter that was sent by Dr Pretorius via the Hawks to Mr 
Moyane. 
 
Mr Moyane then handed that over to Mr Louw to ask 
me to do an affidavit on the questions that was on the letter.  
10 
Now those questions related to the March 2009 memo which 
you will remember was handed in by the Helen Suzman 
Foundation just about a week or so before that I think on the 
11t h.   
 
And so I went off and Mr Louw also mentioned that 
members of the Hawks will be visiting me to – to – and I 
must hand over this affidavit which I was then writing to the 
members of the Hawks which is you know which is okay, 
which is normal.  You know nothing abnormal about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did the letter ask you to do an affidavit or 
20 
you were doing  an affidavit for the Hawks (speaking over 
one another). 
MR SYMINGTON:  No the letter asked me to do an affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SYMINGTON:  If I remember correctly we must just 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 157 of 319 
 
double check but I did an affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SYMINGTON:  So I went to my office to do the affidavit.  
The Hawks arrived there at about ten o’clock the morning 
where I met with them and we went through the letter and 
then we made arrangements for myself to go and write the 
affidavit and they would then – we also arranged that they 
would meet up with me again at about one o’clock on the 
same day.  That I thought that I should be able to do the 
affidavit between that time and that time. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Did the letter from Mr Pretorius was 
its main purpose to ask you to do the affidavit? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Continue. 
MR SYMINGTON:  So the – and I just want to pause one 
moment at the let us call it a first meeting of that morning 
which was a very good meeting.  It was just a normal 
meeting.  There were four members of the Hawks.  I 
remember the names of two one was Brigadier Xaba and the 
other was … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that Xaba? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Ja Xaba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Xaba? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Ja Xaba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is Xaba. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 158 of 319 
 
MR SYMINGTON:  Xaba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SYMINGTON:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR 
SYMINGTON:  
Chair 
and the other 
was 
Colonel 
Moluleke.  And one thing that I was interested in because the 
– the – I was alerted by somebody in my office that my – that 
memo of 2009 was actually out there since about the end of 
2014 when there was a labour dispute between Mr Pillay and 
Mr Moyane.   
10 
 
And so I was interested to know why they only now 
arrived at my office to ask me about this memorandum and 
now my recollection of who – who said what is not so but my 
recollection then is that Colonel Moluleke said no they only 
recently received it via the submission of the Helen Suzman 
Foundation.   And I said no well that is – that is interesting 
but to my knowledge this memo has been out there for a 
number of years.  Then Brigadier Xaba said no we have had 
it all along. 
 
Now at that point it you know I did not attach much 
20 
value to it and we went on.  But in hindsight that was 
actually something that one should think about because if 
they had it all along then why did the NPA not have it? 
 
So anyway let me go on to – so then I went to my 
office, I did the affidavit. I was asked to do more to do two 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 159 of 319 
 
more questions so the Hawks added two more questions to 
the letter.  I went off – now – I then asked – they then asked 
– the Hawks then asked to – to visit the offices of Mr Louw.  
And I then asked my secretary Ms Ell to accompany them 
there assuming that they do not know where this is.  And so 
she went off with them and this is about a five minute walk if 
you can call it like that.  And when they arrived at the offices 
of Mr Louw she noticed that they were not there.   
 
And then she and Mr Louw went in – went to look for 
them because they disappeared in a sense.  Only then to 
10 
find them in the boardroom of Mr Moyane and so now what 
was you know what the reason for that was I do not know but 
those are the facts. 
 
Then at about one o’clock we met again.  I was not 
yet a 100% finished with the affidavit because of those last 
two questions which was – which were added to the list. 
 
And I said to them I need about half an hour to 
complete the affidavit.  Now that was in a meeting just about 
a minute before that while I was in my office still there was a 
man in the door which asked me to hand over that letter of 
20 
the Hawks to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius’ letter? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  00:16:12 to. 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 160 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you were given by Mr Louw? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm okay. 
MR SYMINGTON:  So – and I then mentioned to the 
gentleman that you know I am not yet done I am now off to 
the meeting with the Hawks the one o’clock meeting I will 
explain to them that I need about half an hour more and I 
assumed that this man was also a member of the Hawks. 
 
Later on after the event it turned out it was the 
bodyguard of Mr Moyane.   
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  What is his name? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Mr Titi, T-i-t-i.  So when we then met in 
the room – boardroom – when I met with the Hawks again Mr 
Titi was also there.  I assumed still there was not five 
members of the Hawks and not four anymore.  You know I 
really did not know that he was Mr Moyane’s bodyguard.  I 
have never met him before. 
 
And so – and the meeting then all of a sudden was 
frosty.  It was hostile.  Brigadier Xaba asked me to – to hand 
over the Hawks – the NPA letter to him and in return he 
20 
would hand over to me his copy of the very same letter. 
 
So it did not make sense why would you want to ask 
me for this letter but hand me the letter back again? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Mr Symington just to – sorry to 
interrupt. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 161 of 319 
 
MR SYMINGTON:  Sure. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  You talking about the letter that had 
been given to you at the beginning of the day by Mr Louw.  
What you have described as the Pretorius letter? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair.  So that was the letter that 
arrived in the offices of Mr Moyane which was then handed 
by Mr Moyane’s office to Mr Louw to hand to me.   
 
It was that letter that the Hawks all of a sudden now 
wanted back but they said that I can have their copy of that 
letter in return. 
10 
 
Now to make a long story short and we can go to that 
it later turned out that I am in my copy of the letter at the 
bottom of it was attached emails – of an email.  The email 
trail that originated at the NPA, went to the Hawks then went 
to a lawyer of SARS and then went to Mr Moyane’s office.  
 
But I am there a copy of letter that email was not 
attached.  So obviously they were trying to get the emails 
out of my hand and that is why they wanted my copy of the 
letter which happened to have those emails attached and 
they would hand me back their – their letter where the emails 
20 
are then not attached. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one you had was it the original letter 
as opposed to a copy or was it also a copy? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Mine was the original one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the original. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 162 of 319 
 
MR SYMINGTON:  Well it was sent by email and it was 
printed out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
MR SYMINGTON:  So now how – how I realised that was that 
during the discussion and I must mention then that Mr Titi 
then did not allow me to exit the room.  He actually blocked 
the room and there was no way that I could exit.  I asked for 
my – yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was this at SARS offices? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or was this at Hawks office – the Hawks 
office? 
MR SYMINGTON:  No SARS office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  SARS offices. 
MR SYMINGTON:  It is my boardroom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your boardroom? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And you had – you were meeting there with 
the Hawks? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Titi joined them? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SYMINGTON:  And I thought…. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you … 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 163 of 319 
 
MR SYMINGTON:  He was another member of the Hawks but 
he was actually the bodyguard of Mr Moyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SYMINGTON:  Sent by Mr Moyane for a particular 
reason. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. And you want to leave because you 
were done with whatever business you had with them at the 
boardroom or you were – wanted to leave because of these 
demands for this letter? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair so – so it was a very unusual – 
10 
it never – you know – so for me I just simply did not 
understand what was now going on.  And I just wanted to 
terminate the meeting, exit the meeting, go and do my 
affidavit, hand that to Mr Louw rather than the Hawks and – 
but they did not want me out. 
 
So they did not let me out and they said that they will 
let me go if I hand over that letter of the NPA to them and in 
return they would hand their letter to me. 
 
As this was developing Brigadier Xaba at a point said 
but it is actually the emails that we after.  Then I realised 
20 
there is something else now going on and as it happened to 
be I was making a video of this whole thing and when he 
referred me to the set of emails I then turned to the emails 
and the video with doing it and afterwards again to make a 
long story short there was an email that was – that very 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 164 of 319 
 
clearly did the Hawks and Mr Moyane had an interest to 
retrieve. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that time when they were making this 
demand for you to return that email were you aware of what 
you have told me that at the bottom of it you could tell that 
there were other emails or you did not know that at that 
time? 
MR SYMINGTON:  It was – I only really became aware of the 
fact that there were this emails when the Brigadier said to 
me he actually wants the mails that is at the bottom. 
10 
 
But even at that point I – well I read the mails just 
sort of when he referred me to the mail.  It – I did not really 
understand what was in the mail.  It was only later when I 
went through my own videos that evening the day after that 
and so on and I actually realised here is a mail from SARS 
lawyers to Mr Moyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in your mind as you refuse to hand over 
the email what was your reason at that time?  I am asking 
because ordinarily one would think it would be easy if it was 
to say okay you giving me the same thing maybe it is not a 
20 
big deal.  Okay.  But if you have some suspicions obviously 
it could be different. 
MR SYMINGTON:  No Chair it was all about how we are 
brought up in SARS.  If a document is handed to you – to me 
as a SARS official I am the custodian of that document. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 165 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SYMINGTON:  There are secrecy laws. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SYMINGTON:  And so you do not hand… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must look after it. 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are responsible for it.  So if you – if a 
doc – a SARS doc – or if a document is given to you… 
MR SYMINGTON:  It is I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are trained to say it is your document. 
10 
MR SYMINGTON:  It is my document. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
If 
anything 
happens 
to 
it 
you 
are 
responsible. 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes.  I am accountable for that document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are accountable for it. 
MR SYMINGTON:  And now what I did know it is that Mr 
Louw said to me that that letter was handed to him by Mr 
Moyane’s office so that even makes it  
CHAIRPERSON:  More serious. 
MR SYMINGTON:  More serious so why I did – and then that 
20 
was the – actually the main reason.  The second reason was 
that I have learnt over years that if I do not understand 
something 100% I do not make a decision until I understand 
something a 100%. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 166 of 319 
 
MR SYMINGTON:  Because then I will make the wrong 
decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SYMINGTON:  And then the – a third to me was just 
handing over a letter and getting the very same letter back 
was also of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was suspicious. 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you.  You say you videoed the 
10 
document what did you use to do that? 
MR SYMINGTON:  My cell phone Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And did you video each page of the 
document? 
MR SYMINGTON:  I videoed each page of the emails yes.  
Yes Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you.  Did you at any stage call 
anyone from within the boardroom once you had been 
prevented from leaving? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair.  So there was a moment when 
20 
I really thought this is not going to turn out good.  There 
were four huge men of the Hawks and they were not letting 
me out.  And so I called the SAPS emergency number 10111 
if I remember correctly and I called them and that of course 
was a – a disaster on its own because they simply could not 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 167 of 319 
 
understand why I would be able to phone while being held 
hostage you know so – and I also called my – but before that 
I called my secretary and I also called the security of the 
building that I am in.  And I mentioned to them look you know 
I am being held here you must now help me.  So they duly 
arrived but – and they wanted to open the door but the door 
was then pulled closed again by Mr Titi.  So they were not 
left inside and I was not able to exit. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  At – eventually you did leave the 
boardroom at some point? 
10 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And can you describe what happened 
when you left the boardroom?  At that point did you still have 
the – I will call it the Pretorius letters which was the letter 
plus the annexures  - did you still have possession of that? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes Chair.  I did.  So there was a moment 
when Mr Louw – so Mr Titi was actually on the phone and 
that we learnt afterwards with Mr Moyane during the whole 
incident and at one point apparently Mr Moyane gave Mr 
Louw a call to come over to the boardroom and – and defuse 
20 
whatever is going on there. 
 
So Mr Louw arrived – he also brought along two other 
colleagues of mine and we started to have – Mr Louw then 
asked the Hawks to exit the room so that he can have you 
know – to talk to me.  And the Hawks did so they exited. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 168 of 319 
 
 
Mr Titi remained and so we had a discussion – I 
explained to Mr Louw what is going on in my mind.  I ex – 
also explained to him that you know I have not done this 
affidavit.  The NPA is now waiting for this affidavit.  And that 
I need to finish it and then Mr Louw want – well asked the 
Hawks if I can make a copy of that letter so that I can 
...[word cut] ... they can have what they want and I said:  
Yes, you are most welcome.  But then the Hawks said, no, 
they are not going to make a copy of it.  So.  And then 
there was the moment where I just thought to myself:  Well, 
10 
I am now – since the Hawks is out...   
 
Mr Titi in a way sort of moved to the side and 
suspected that would be because Mr Louw was now there.  
And so I attempted to exist the door.  But as I existed the 
room, there were the Hawks and they then physically 
grabbed me in the hand, took those documents out of my 
hand and off they went. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright.  You have explained to the 
Chair that at the time you received the Dr Pretorius letter, 
you were not particularly aware of what the annexures 
20 
were.  And you have also explained that at the point in 
time when you were told by the Hawks that they were after 
the annexure, you looked at it but it did not have any 
particular significance for you.  Is that correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 169 of 319 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Subsequently, did you have occasion 
to examine the annexure in further detail and did you 
establish why it is that there was this urgent need by the 
Hawks and Mr Titi to retrieve that document? 
MR SYMINGTON:   So, Chair, yes.  At that point we could 
read the words and understand that there is something 
there and maybe we should ...[intervenes]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, let me take you to the 
document.  It is at page 722, WS-17.  You have it? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Is that the annexure that you have 
been talking about? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   That is – there are two emails there.  
The bottom email is Brigadier Xaba to the attorney, 
Maphakela 
MR SYMINGTON:   Maphakela. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes.  There is an email address 
there.  Sorry. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And then what he says at the 
beginning.  He says: 
“Please read that request from NPA and revert 
to me.  
We 
need 
that 
statement 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 170 of 319 
 
urgency...” 
 
And 
then 
at 
the 
top 
of 
the 
page, 
David 
Maphakela writes an email to Mr Moyane and to Atobogo 
Makwela(?).  And it says the following: 
“Only find this for our urgent attention.  On 
ethical reasons, I cannot be involved in this 
one as I hold a different view to the one 
persuade by the NPA and the Hawks...” 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Now can you explain to the Chair 
10 
what you established having had an occasion to examine 
the annexure and to consider it?   
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair, that these were almost 
years apart.  So, initially, back in 2016, this was the 
wording that we could see.  We knew there was something 
there because why would a SARS lawyer say to the 
Commissioner: 
“On ethical reasons, I cannot be involved in 
this one as I hold a different view to the one 
pursued by the NPA and the Hawks...”   
20 
 
Now this matter related to the early retirement of 
Mr Aden Pillay.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright.  Could you just identify for 
the Chair?  You say a SARS lawyer who ...[intervenes]  
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, David Maphakela of M4 Mashiane 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 171 of 319 
 
Moodley Attorneys. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   A practicing attorney? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, just explain again.  I am sorry.  
You why would a SARS lawyer, when you are talking about 
a SARS lawyer.  Is he an attorney who ...[intervenes]  
MR SYMINGTON:   That he present SARS in this – in I 
think the “rogue unit” matter.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright.  Can you explain again?  I 
cut you short. 
10 
MR SYMINGTON:   No, sure.  So that is all that we knew at 
that point that there was something there Chair.  But it was 
only much later in April, around April 2018 about a month 
after Mr Moyane was suspended as the Commissioner.  And 
we had an acting Commissioner at that point, Mr Mark 
Kingon. 
 
And he and Mr Wayne Browton, who is also a 
SARS employee, had an interview with Mr Maphakela and 
Wayne 
then 
went 
about 
on, 
you 
know, 
and 
asked 
Mr Maphakela:  What is this mail all about?  Why did you 
20 
say to the Commissioner that on ethical reasons I cannot 
be involved in this one?   
 
And Mr Maphakela then revealed that he wrote a 
legal opinion to Mr Moyane in November 2014 when SARS 
wanted to know his view on the lawfulness of the early 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 172 of 319 
 
retirement of Mr Ivan Pillay. 
 
And so he wrote a lengthy memorandum on it 
and advised that there is nothing unlawful about those 
elements 
which 
I 
listed 
in 
my 
memorandum 
and 
it 
happened to be the same that they asked of him.  So.   
 
And so that was the very first time that we 
became aware of this memorandum of Mr Maphakela which 
supported the outcome of my 2009 memorandum. 
 
And the relevance of this is that not only was my 
memorandum not revealed official by SARS to the Hawks 
10 
or the NPA but this memorandum from Mr Maphakela are 
confirming the lawfulness of Mr Pillay’s early retirement 
was also not made available, apparently, to either the 
Hawks or the NPA or both.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Could I ask you, please, to look at 
VS-18, pages 278 to 291? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes.  Yes, Chair.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Do you ...[intervenes]  
MR SYMINGTON:   That is the opinion. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   That is the opinion that you have 
20 
been referring to? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   It is dated 5 November 2004. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   So you say that was rendered on 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 173 of 319 
 
that date to Mr Moyane.  That is your understanding? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And then just going back to the VS-
17 on page 277 where Mr Maphakela says: 
“On ethical reasons, I cannot be involved in 
this one as I hold a different one by the one 
pursued by the NPA and the Hawks...” 
 
Now what view do you understand him to be 
talking about? 
MR SYMINGTON:   It is this view that he expressed to in 
10 
his November 2014 legal opinion. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And when he says: 
“I hold a different one by the one pursued by 
the NPA and the Hawks...” 
 
What were the NPA and the Hawks pursuing? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Well, the NPA and the Hawks were on 
their way to charge Ivan and a number of other people and 
he, in his view, it was a lawful action that was taken by 
SARS. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And when he says:  I cannot be 
20 
involved in this one.  Do you understand what he is 
declining to become involved in? 
MR SYMINGTON:   I think it is this matter.  These are the 
so-called “rogue unit” matter.  So he was involved, is my 
understanding, representing SARS to some extent in what 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 174 of 319 
 
was referred to as the “rogue unit” matter.  And he was 
then also asked to be involved to represent SARS in this 
Ivan Pillay early retirement and I think that is what he 
means by this.  What he means by ethical, it – I – if you 
would allow me to elaborate? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes. 
MR SYMINGTON:   And this is in his words conveyed to 
Mr Kingon and Wayne Browton when they met, is that 
Mr Maphakela mentioned that he shared his view about the 
lawfulness about the early retirement.  Now not necessarily 
10 
this document that is viewed, to both the NPA and the 
Hawks in a meeting and that is his – that is my 
understanding of his explanation why he used the word 
ethical.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright.  We will come back to that 
affidavit in due course.  So this – the events of this rather 
bizarre day took place and then is it correct that you sent 
an email on the same day to Messrs Moyane and Kosie 
Louw which we find at VS-10, page 258? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And you recorded the events 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  What page Mr Franklin? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I am sorry, Chair.  It is 258. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 175 of 319 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Is this a much shortened version of 
the story that you have just old about the events of the 
18 t h  of October? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair.  And...  ja, this is a version 
I wrote on the very same day because I thought I must 
write these things down when they are in my memory still 
very, very fresh, not realising that even years after that, 
you know, it remained in my memory as if it happened a 
week ago. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And did you get any response from 
10 
Mr Moyane to that email? 
MR SYMINGTON:   No, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Now then would you look, please, at 
VS-11 which is on page 259? 
MR SYMINGTON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   That is another email by you.  It is 
on the subsequent day of the 19 t h of October 2016.  It is to 
Moyane, Louw and Maphakela and the subject is Ivan 
Pillay. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   It speaks for itself.  Could I ask you, 
that particular letter, if I could ask you to read, please, 
from...  I am sorry.  It is the one below. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Sure.  This is the one that I wrote on 
the 18 t h. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 176 of 319 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   18 t h.  No, I am sorry.   
MR SYMINGTON:   On the 19 t h? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, I am just looking at this... 
MR SYMINGTON:   Sure. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, the second paragraph.  You 
say: 
“A couple of things need to happen today...” 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes. 
“Most importantly, I need to advise the NPA to 
10 
the Pretorius from whom that NPA letter came, 
that I was prevented by the Hawks Delegation 
and 
the 
representative 
from 
the 
Commissioner ’s office from completing the 
affidavit sought by the NPA.   
I need to do this to ensure that the NPA is not 
left 
with 
an 
impression 
that 
I 
was 
uncooperative...” 
 
So you saw the need to explain why you have 
not completed your affidavit.  Is that correct? 
20 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair.  And then I went on in the 
email and asked for guidance and I mentioned that I will be 
sending this off to the NPA at about 11:15 but Mr Moyane 
or Louw or anyone...  Yes, to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just give the facts. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 177 of 319 
 
MR SYMINGTON:   ...to guide me in that...  you know, 
to...to..  And so in response to this mail, I received a call 
from Mr Louw, asking me to join him in a meeting with 
Mr Moyane but I did not get the written response on this 
one. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright.  That meeting took place on 
the 20 t h of October? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   You deal with it in paragraph 59.  
And could you explain to the Chair what transpired at that 
10 
meeting and in particular what was Mr Moyane’s reaction to 
the events that you had recorded? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, so it was actually, you know, a 
very comfortable meeting.  Mr Moyane expressed regret for 
what happened.  And so that is essentially it that happened 
during that meeting Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And you say in paragraph 60 that 
Mr Moyane gave you an explanation. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Can you please tell the Chair what 
20 
that explanation was? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Mr Moyane explained, Chair, that he 
sent his bodyguard, Mr Titi, over – together with the Hawks 
to make sure that nobody makes a copy of the NPA letter, 
Chair. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 178 of 319 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Did that explanation make sense to 
you at the time? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Not at all Chair because that is not 
what happened.  They actually wanted the document back.  
They were not – you know, it was not about preventing 
somebody to make a copy of the letter.  What actually 
happened was that they wanted this letter back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what did you understand the purpose 
of that meeting to have been, the meeting involving 
yourself, Mr Moyane and Mr Louw? 
10 
MR SYMINGTON:   Chair, that is difficult.  I assumed at 
that point, it was in reaction to the second email which I 
wrote which is this one on 259. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SYMINGTON:   At the top.  To provide the guidance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Guidance. 
MR SYMINGTON:   So when I got the call from Mr Louw, it 
was before 11:15 and then I decided, okay, I am going... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SYMINGTON:   But then, you know, things did not turn 
20 
out like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in terms of the content of the 
discussion 
at 
that 
meeting. 
 
Mr 
Moyane, 
you 
say, 
expressed a regret at what had happened.  Was that the 
previous day?  Ja, that would have been the previous day, 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 179 of 319 
 
I think. 
MR SYMINGTON:   We are talking about two days ago, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, about two days before that? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Ja, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did Mr Louw say anything?  Did you 
say 
anything 
in 
that 
meeting 
in 
connection 
with 
...[intervenes]  
MR SYMINGTON:   I just expressed my surprise and I 
expressed my views about SARS values and things like 
that because it was just a bizarre event.  It was, you 
10 
know...  And that was about it.  There was no real purpose 
for the meeting, apart from what was said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, did you get any understanding of 
who it was that Mr Moyane thought might want to make a 
copy of the affidavit, of the letter that he did not want to 
make a copy? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Well, Chair, no.  And what is somewhat 
weird about is that I had that letter since the morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Sitting on my own in my office with a 
20 
photocopy machine readily available.  So if I wanted to 
make copies of that letter and maybe the thought was that 
- oh, well, I do not know - distribution to the media or 
something like that.  You know, I could have done it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But basically his bodyguard did not say 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 180 of 319 
 
to you:  I am here to make sure that nobody makes a copy 
of the letter that is with you. 
MR SYMINGTON:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He did not say that? 
MR SYMINGTON:   No, he actually wanted the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He wanted the letter? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SYMINGTON:   And when he asked for the letter, he did 
not offer me another version or the same version in return. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR SYMINGTON:   He just wanted the letter and revert 
back to Mr Moyane’s office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  Mr Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  And at the meeting of 
the 20 t h of October with Mr Moyane, you said that he 
expressed regret.  What did he express regret about? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Well, he said about what happened to 
me.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And did he fully understand what had 
20 
happened?  In other words, did he ...[intervenes]  
MR SYMINGTON:   I do not know. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Well, did he know – did you tell him, 
apart from the two emails sent previously, did you explain 
to him what had happened i.e. you had been kept there 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 181 of 319 
 
against your will and that the documents had been taken 
from you? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair.  So.  But it was in overview 
of what happened but it was, you know, in even less detail 
of the emails that I have written to him.  So he must have 
read the emails.  That I assumed that he knew, more or 
less, what was – what sort of happened but an email which 
he wrote to me the next day, revealed something else. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But before you talk about that something 
10 
else.  Do you know whether he would have know in 
advance or given permission for the Hawks to come and 
meet with you and Mr Moyane? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Chair, yes, I think so because the 
letter, the NPA letter was delivered in his email box. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SYMINGTON:   So, and it is in that email letter that it 
is aid. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So he would have known that they 
were going to come and see you based on that letter you 
20 
say? 
MR SYMINGTON:   And so, I do not think in the letter it is 
said that the Hawks will visit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SYMINGTON:   But Mr Louw said to me that the Hawks 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 182 of 319 
 
will visit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SYMINGTON:   So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So you do not know whether he knew or 
not in advance? 
MR SYMINGTON:   I would not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And you do not know whether the 
procedure at the time that the Hawks were going to come 
and interview anybody at SARS, the Commissioner – they 
would 
consult 
the 
Commissioner 
or 
speak 
to 
the 
10 
Commissioner first?  You do not know whether there was 
such a procedure? 
MR SYMINGTON:   No, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, Mr Symington, it seems you 
were 
not 
satisfied 
following 
the 
meeting 
of 
the 
20 t h of October because you wrote a further email.  Can I 
direct your attention to page 262? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   That is an email from you on the 
20 
21 s t of October 2016 at 10:32 a.m. to Messrs Moyane and 
Louw and you thank the Commissioner for the meeting of 
yesterday.  That is your meeting on the 20 t h which you 
have described. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 183 of 319 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And you say: 
“I have again reviewed the events of Tuesday, 
this week, and the more I studied the records 
of the events, the more things simply makes 
no sense with due respect to the Officer of the 
Commissioner. 
The explanation that Mr Titi was ordered to 
ensure 
that 
copies 
are 
not 
made 
of 
the 
document containing the request by the Hawks 
to respond to the NPA’s questions, is not 
10 
aligned at all with what actually happened for 
the following reasons...” 
 
You then set out your reasons. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And did I ask you to look at point 9 
in particular? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   What you said there is: 
“And then even more bizarre.  Mr Titi and the 
Hawks proceeded to keep me in a confined 
20 
space against my will and ultimately took the 
document from me and in a manner that, at 
minimum, was utterly vicious infringing and 
endless list of statutory and common law 
provisions, not to mention my personal rights 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 184 of 319 
 
as both a human being and an employee of 
SARS...” 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Mr Moyane responded to that email? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   We see that at page 261.  At the 
bottom of the page, there is an email from Mr Moyane 
dated 21 October 2016 to you and Kosie Louw.  
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   He says in the second paragraph: 
10 
“I still reiterate that my points as per out 
discussion in the presence of Kosie, it would 
seem from your mail as if all what I had said 
does 
not 
meet 
the 
level 
of 
cordiality 
I 
expressed including an apology.   
You are entitled to the course of action you 
choose to take...” 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And then ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I am trying to look where 
20 
you are now Mr Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I am sorry, Chair.  It is 261. 
CHAIRPERSON:   261? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, it is the second email at the 
bottom of the page. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 185 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I went ahead of you.  Oh, ja, that 
is Mr Moyane’s response.  Is that correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At 261? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   [No audible reply]  
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Franklin, is ...[intervenes]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that the email you read? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, that is the response. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   So just to reiterate.  At page 262, 
was Mr Symington’s letter in which he said:   
“I have moulded over the events.  I have 
moulded over the meeting of yesterday on the 
20 t h and it still makes no sense to me at all...” 
 
And he sets out the reasons why.  And this then 
is the response from Mr Moyane to say he still reiterates 
his points as per the discussion and he says what I read as 
a slight rebuke that you are not recognising the “cordiality 
20 
that I showed to you”.  
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   What was your response to this 
mail?  Did it lay your concerns?  Did it provide any 
explanations for you? 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 186 of 319 
 
MR SYMINGTON:   Well, Chair...  Well, no.  Not at all.  So 
I responded the next day in a last response.  I think that 
was the very last one ever that we had any sort of email 
correspondence.  So at the top of that very same page 261 
is my response to his email which you will find at the 
bottom of that page. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   [No audible reply]  
MR SYMINGTON:   Ja, it was on the next... the same day, 
just a bit later.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So just to go back to a question I asked 
10 
earlier on.  The NPA letter or Dr Pretorius’ letter was 
addressed to Brigadier Xaba. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
And 
not 
to 
Mr 
Tom 
Moyane 
...[intervenes]  
MR SYMINGTON:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to SARS.  So it would have been 
mister...  It would have been Brigadier Xaba, I assume, 
who sent it to Mr Moyane? 
MR SYMINGTON:   [No audible reply]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought earlier on when you spoke...  I 
thought the NPA had written directly to Mr Moyane. 
MR SYMINGTON:   No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR SYMINGTON:   So the NPA wrote to mister – to the 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 187 of 319 
 
Hawks ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   To Brigadier Xaba ...[intervenes]  
MR SYMINGTON:   And the Hawks then asked the 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The Commissioner. 
MR SYMINGTON:   ...attorneys representing SARS to 
forward – to – well, to deliver that letter to Mr Moyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SYMINGTON:   So that I would then - can be asked to 
complete the affidavit. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   To do the affidavit.  Ja.  Okay, okay.  So 
except for the fact that this was, as I understand it an 
email or a copy, the letter actually had been meant for 
Brigadier Xaba by Dr Pretorius? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SYMINGTON:   The thing in the letter it was asked that 
– and I was mentioned by name ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR SYMINGTON:   ...that I must do the affidavit. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay Mr Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  Mr Symington, could I 
then just take you to the section of the affidavit in which 
you deal at page 139 with the apparent importance of the 
email that was attached to the Pretorius letter.  You have 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 188 of 319 
 
given your explanation to the Chair, but I would like to just 
cover this.   
MR SYMINGTON:   On page ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, what page? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Page 139, paragraph 78.  Now what 
you say is that the electronic evidence provided includes 
video footage of the documents.  And just stopping.  That 
is the... you took off the documents while you being held in 
the boardroom.  Is that correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair.  I am just not on the same 
10 
page. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Sorry, paragraph 78, page 139. 
MR SYMINGTON:   78.  Yes, Chair? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes. 
“Including 
the 
email 
trail 
indicating 
that 
instead of forwarding the email from Pretorius 
directly to SARS, rather forwarded it to an 
attorney 
in 
private 
practice 
who 
then 
forwarded it to Moyane with a high suspicious 
statement that he could not be involved any 
20 
further for ethical reasons...”   
 
So that is the document that we have looked at, 
VS-17. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And then at 79, you have said that 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 189 of 319 
 
when you received the Pretorius letter from Louw on the 
18 t h of October, you paid no attention to the single 
annexure: 
“...which, at first glance, simply looked like a 
covering 
email 
to 
which 
the 
letter 
was 
attached.   
When preparing my affidavit in response to the 
questions posed in the Pretorius letter, I 
similarly ignored the annexure...”   
 
Is that correct? 
10 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair.  And I must mention that 
this normal in a way that if you receive a letter, document 
or whatever from the office of the Commissioner there 
would always be some indication of the origin of the...  
Sometimes it an email, sometimes it is just a letter itself, 
whatever.  So Mr Louw drew my attention to the NPA letter 
and asked me to do the affidavit. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   [No audible reply]  
MR SYMINGTON:   The affidavit. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right.  You then go on in this 
20 
section 
of 
your 
affidavit 
to 
explain 
that 
you 
subsequently learnt more about the circumstances 
of VS-17 and why it had significance.  And you had 
been through to that in relation to the opinion that 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 190 of 319 
 
had been rendered sometime earlier in 2014, rather, 
by Mr Makapela to SARS. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So as you sit here today, Mr Symington,  
what would you say was the reason why the Hawks were 
insisting that you should give them in fact that letter? 
MR SYMINGTON:   So, Chair, I think it was the Hawks and 
Mr Moyane that had an interest in receiving or retrieving 
those mails because the November 2014 legal opinion was 
not known at that point in time and the second reason, in 
10 
hindsight was what Mr – what David Makela …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Makela. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Said to Mark and to Wayne was that he 
shared his view with both Hawks and the NPA.  So that is 
why I think they had an interest in making sure that no one 
sees that mail because it will lead to questions being 
asked because why would an attorney say to his client on 
ethical reason, you know? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, you have drawn a 
20 
conclusion in paragraph 91 at page 144 and you have said 
– perhaps I should go back to the first – at paragraph 89, 
page 142.   
“Earlier the inference can be drawn that the time Mr 
Moyane signed this letter he was aware that the 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 191 of 319 
 
scope of the initial investigation had been expanded 
to include the Pillay retirement issue.” 
Now that is the letter which I took you to a while ago in 
which he had given permission for you and three others to 
give information  to the Hawks.  Do you recall that? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And you have drawn conclusions as 
to the relevance of Mr Moyane being aware that the scope 
of the investigation under that case number had been 
expanded to include the Pillay retirement issue and then at 
10 
paragraph 91 you say: 
Secondly, Mr Moyane withheld critical evidence 
including exculpatory evidence from the Hawks 
and/or the NPA relating to the criminal charges 
against Gordhan, Magashule and Pillay.” 
What crucial exculpatory evidence are you talking about?  
MR SYMINGTON:   So, Chair, I am referring there to my 
memorandum of 2009 and then the legal opinion from 
David Mapakela.  And, Chair, if I may?  The reason I am 
saying that first of all is that the memorandum of 2009, my 
20 
memo was available, as I have said earlier to Mr Moyane 
on Mr Pillay’s HR file which was held in his office and Mr 
Moyane was also aware of David Mapakela’s legal opinion 
of November 2014. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, I took you earlier to the letter 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 192 of 319 
 
from the NPA to Mr Moyane in which he was invited to 
make representations as to why the charges should not be 
withdrawn – should be withdrawn, I cannot remember which 
way around.  Mr Moyane then responded to Mr Abrahams in 
VS23, page 302.  If you could turn to that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   302? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   302.  Do you see that is a letter 
dated the 19 October 2016 from Mr Moyane to Adv 
Abrahams? 
MR SYMINGTON:   This is from Advocate Abrahams to 
10 
Moyane. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Page 302? 
MR SYMINGTON:  Yes, I am on 302. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   So that is from Mr Moyane to 
Advocate Abrahams. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Been a long day.  He says: 
“I acknowledge receipt of your letter.” 
And then he says: 
“Upon perusal of its contents I have no further 
20 
submissions or representations to make on the 
matter.  I  am, however, indebted to the decisions of 
your office and the NPA.” 
So he… 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair, and this would been – well, 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 193 of 319 
 
this would have been another opportunity for Mr Moyane to 
reveal what he knows about my memorandum and about 
the legal opinion of David Mapakela of November 2014.  
Another opportunity  would have been much earlier when 
those 27 questions were given to Mr Gordhan in February 
of that year because that was why it spread news, SARS 
has a news service where the main highlights of whatever 
is reported in the media relating to SARS matters mostly, it 
would have included this one, is circulated amongst the 
executives each day.   
10 
So even if he missed it on main media streams he, 
you know, would have known about it and that would have 
been an opportunity to say to Hawks or the NPA look, here 
is information that they – that Mr Gordhan relied upon back 
in March 2009.  Well, a little   bit later but here is the 
information.   
 
So there was more – there was ample opportunity 
for Mr Moyane to hand over these views. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright, you also testified about a 
meeting which had been held between attorney Mapakela 
20 
with Mr Kingon and Mr Broughton in April of 2018. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Could you look at paragraph 95 page 
147 of your affidavit?  There you say that: 
“On that date Makapela met with Kingon and Wayne 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 194 of 319 
 
Broughton, 
a 
senior 
SARS 
legal 
official.  
He 
explained that he had provided Moyane with his 
opinion on the Pillay retirement matter in November 
2014 where he had expressed the view that Pillay’s 
request was lawful.  In the circumstances he was 
concerned about the legitimacy of the investigation 
into and proffering of charges against Gordhan et al 
in 2016.  Makapela was of the view that it would be 
unethical of him to be involved in the matter and 
this informed his comments to Moyane when he 
10 
forwarded this email to him.” 
Is that correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And where did you get this 
information from about that meeting and what was said in 
the meeting? 
MR SYMINGTON:   So, Chair, there are two supporting 
affidavits, one from Mr Mark Kingon and one from Mr 
Wayne Broughton and I hope Mr Franklin would be able to 
indicate where they are. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, I will take you to those in due 
course when I put some of the other affidavits to you. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Thank you. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Following upon this incident at 2016 
now you reported this to IPID. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 195 of 319 
 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  The Independent Police Investigative 
Directorate, is that correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And that is VS29 which is part of the 
papers.  We need not go to that.  Did you set out  full 
account of what had happened? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And what did you wish to happen as 
a consequence of your complaint? 
10 
MR SYMINGTON:   So, Chair, I wanted an investigation at 
least or charges be brought against the Hawks for, you 
know, the way that they dealt with me on that day. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes and while I see this perhaps it is 
best to deal with it now, VS27, page 308, this is a letter 
which attorney Makapela wrote to Judge Nugent during the 
Nugent Commission of Inquiry hearings dated the 16 July 
2018 and he sets out there what his various concerns were 
with the criminal investigation into the Pillay pension fund 
matter, is that right? 
20 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And in 1.1 he says firstly he had 
advised SARS through an opinion dated 5 November 2014 
that SARS acted lawfully with regard to the decision 
surrounding Pillay’s pension benefits, correct? 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 196 of 319 
 
MR SYMINGTON:   yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And then in 1.2, he talks about an 
opinion from Advocate Brassie SC, says: 
“Although Advocate Brassie SC had provided an 
opinion or memorandum dated 11 November 2014, 
that 
differed 
with 
my 
opinion, 
I 
differed 
fundamentally 
with 
Brassie 
SC’s 
opinion 
or 
memorandum on the question of Mr Pillay’s pension 
fund benefits.  To this day I still maintain my views 
expressed in my opinion dated 5 November 2014.  
10 
Therefore, it would be unethical for me to assist the 
SARS and the SARS in an investigation that has no 
legal basis even at prima facie level.   The 
important part is that since 5 November 2014 the 
Commissioner was aware of my views.” 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   You have seen that letter.    Alright, 
so apart from your reporting of the incident to IPID you 
also launched a grievance against Mr Titi. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   This is dealt with in para 118, page 
158 and following of your affidavit.  Your grievance is 
attached as VS38 and that appears at page 382, is that 
right? 
MR SYMINGTON:   382, you said?  Sorry, Mr Franklin, 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 197 of 319 
 
which page? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   382. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   That that investigation was – sorry, 
that grievance was then investigated. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And that was investigated by Mr 
Mothle, 
Mr 
Thipe 
Mothle 
of 
Mothle, 
Jooma, 
Sabdia 
Attorneys, correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And is it correct that Mr Mothle 
produced a report on the 11 May 2017? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair, the report was actually 
dated the 31 March of that year but it was I think handed to 
myself or SARS on the 11 May. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright, please would you turn to 
page 397 to page 434.  Is that the so-called first report? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   That was compiled. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Could you summarise what the 
findings of the investigation were briefly and then we will… 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair, it was – the report found 
that my grievance was valid and that Mr Titi should be – 
well, that this matter should go to a hearing.   
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 198 of 319 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And did it go to a hearing? 
MR SYMINGTON:   No, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Is it correct that an addendum report 
was subsequently produced by the same attorney and that 
addendum report is VS45 of the papers, is that correct? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   You have dealt with this in 
paragraph 131 of your statement.  You say that you heard 
nothing further on the issue until 25 July 2017 when 
Rapholo sent an email to myself and Titi to which was 
10 
attached an addendum report from Mothle. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair, that is right but what we 
should add is that – is that I also received a mail from Mr – 
what is his name at SARS, I will get to the name now, that 
said that I should not – I think it was on the day that the 
first report was handed over to me.  It was explained to me 
that the matter, you know, that there would be a meeting of 
the parties and that I should reserve any input or any 
comment that I have in relation to this first report and that 
never happened.  The next thing I heard was – a mail also 
20 
from SARS saying that the report has been referred back to 
the 
attorneys, 
back 
to 
Mr 
Mothle, 
to 
make 
final 
recommendations and which I assumed would have been 
recommendations on the charges that should be filed 
against Mr Titi.  So I did not pay much attention.  There 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 199 of 319 
 
was nothing against me in the first report at all, so I had 
no concern. 
 
And then the next email that I got in relation to this 
matter is the mail that Mr Franklin is referring to, in July, 
Mr Franklin, if I am right. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  And VS45 on page 346 
is an email from Rapholo to you and to Mr Titi dated the 25 
July 2017. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Correct. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And Ms Rapholo says the following: 
10 
“I had indicated in my mails to you that the…” 
Sorry, that: 
“Thipe 
Mothle 
of 
Mothle 
Jooma 
Sabdia 
was 
requested to provide a conclusive report on all 
findings related to the incident that gave rise to the 
grievance.  He has now concluded that exercise and 
has 
provided 
his 
addendum 
report 
with 
recommendations to the organisation.  A copy of the 
addendum is attached.  The report has been 
considered by the organisation which has elected to 
20 
accept the findings and recommendations made.  
See amongst the recommendations made was that 
charges be brought against both of you for possible 
misconduct highlighted in the report.  Due to the 
dynamics involved in this matter it has 
been 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 200 of 319 
 
decided that the disciplinary process be run by 
external parties, an external Chairperson as well as 
external initiator will be appointed to conduct the 
process.  Details of the proceedings will be shared 
with you by your HR VP once the parties are 
appointed.” 
What was your reaction to that? 
MR SYMINGTON:   So, Chair, I was very surprised to hear 
that on the very same – well, number one, that there was 
now a second report by the same investigator on the same 
10 
facts that have now not only reversed the findings on Mr 
Titi but recommended all charges, disciplinary charges, all 
of whom would have led to my immediate dismissal.  None 
of them are, you know, that you get a final letter of demand 
and so on, all of them would have led to, you know, 
immediately dismissal of me. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Could I ask you to look at paragraph 
135, page 163.  There you reach the conclusion in your 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are we back to his affidavit? 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, Chair.  It is 135 at page 163.  
You say that: 
“Clearly persons at SARS instructed Mothle to come 
up with charges against me after the first report 
exonerated me and concluded that there was merits 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 201 of 319 
 
to me grievance against Titi and that he should face 
disciplinary action.” 
Now what caused you to reach that conclusion? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Well, Chair, there was – who else at 
SARS would have gone back to Mr Mothle to ask for what 
was clearly a different outcome  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Then please look at para 146 at 
page 166.  You say that your suspicions were later 
confirmed when during about April 2018 after Mr Moyane’s 
departure Mothle was called to a meeting with SARS and 
10 
asked to explain the circumstances giving rise to his 
addendum report. 
“At the meeting attended by Kingon and others on 
behalf of SARS Mothle started that after he had 
issued the first report which exonerated me.  He 
received a visit from Mokoena and Lebelo who 
pressurised him into changing his reports so as to 
implicate me in misconduct.  Mothle duly buckled 
under pressure and issued the addendum report. 
Kingon informed me of the above facts.” 
20 
Is that something, as you say here, that Mr Kingon 
reported to you? 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes, Chair.  But, of course, as you 
know, it later turned out that it was not in April 2018 that 
the meeting took place and the meeting took place at the 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 202 of 319 
 
offices of SARS which is not the same meeting, of course. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, thank you.  Chair, I am aware 
as regards the Commission’s arrangements that an evening 
session is due to start shortly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   What I have left with Mr Symington 
we can deal with fairly shortly tomorrow morning, if that is 
in order.  There are a number of affidavits that I wish to put 
to him and I needed to [indistinct – dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Well, you still have about eight 
10 
minutes if that would be enough but you have been on your 
feet since morning and yesterday you were on your feet for 
a long time.  If you prefer that we stop here and he 
finished tomorrow that would be fine as well. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, I am assuming that that is in 
order from Mr Symington and his representatives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   From the nods, I ... 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think all of us who are seated will say 
that is in order. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I am relieved, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So you will continue with him 
tomorrow to finish off? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, that is correct and Chair, may I 
just at this juncture with an eye on tomorrow’s proceedings 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 203 of 319 
 
refer to a letter which we made available to the Chair at 
lunchtime. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   As you know we still have Mr van 
Loggerenberg to lead and the schedule was that he would 
be led today and then tomorrow Mr Moyane would present 
himself in order to because questioned.  The Commission 
received a letter today, as I understand it, following upon 
earlier indications and perhaps I can just read it to the 
Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, into the record, ja. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   It is from Mabuza Attorneys, it is 
dated Tuesday the 24 March 2021 and it is addressed to 
Professor Mosala of the Commission and the subject is T S 
Moyane. 
1. As indicated yesterday by our counsel to Adv 
Franklin SC and Adv le Roux, our client, Mr 
Moyane, is suffering from a serious illness. 
2. He will accordingly unfortunately not be in a 
position to prepare for and appear before the 
20 
Commission as previously agreed. 
3. We attached herewith a copy of a doctor ’s 
note for your attention. 
4. We look forward to hearing from you so that 
any 
alternative 
arrangements 
may 
be 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 204 of 319 
 
discussed and agreed. 
5. Kindly advise the Commission Chairperson 
and any interested parties accordingly.” 
And then a doctor ’s note is attached. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   So it appears that Mr Moyane is 
unable to appear at this point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not appear tomorrow, okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   We will make practical arrangements 
in due course but I thought had better just let that be 
10 
known at this point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, that is fine, but effectively 
your [indistinct – dropping voice] will now be to use 
tomorrow to finish off Mr Symington’s evidence as well as 
to begin and lead Mr Loggerenberg’s evidence. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, no, that is fine.  I am aware 
of the letter as you have said, you did read to me.  So Mr 
Moyane is not able to appear tomorrow.  Okay, I am going 
to adjourn the day session of the hearing.  The evidence 
20 
leader for the next work stream Eskom is here?  Okay, he 
is here.  So we will take about 15 minutes adjournment to 
enable them to set up and then Mr Symington you will be 
back tomorrow. 
MR SYMINGTON:   Yes. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 205 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will start at ten tomorrow.  I think the 
last two days we have been started at half past nine.  So 
we will be back here tomorrow at ten. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair, and I take it 
we are excused from the evening’s session which deals 
with something different. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, definitely you are excused, you 
need some rest. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn.

INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Good 
afternoon 
Mr 
Seleka, 
good 
afternoon everybody.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Good evening Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not sound vigorous Mr Seleka.  
You sound like you have been standing the whole day.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you full of oomph? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It will come, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It will come.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  I am sure it will come. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Good afternoon Ms 
Daniels. 
MS DANIELS: Good afternoon, Mr Chair.   
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 206 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you once again for availing 
yourself.  Hopefully today is the last time.   
MS DANIELS:  Yes, I hope so too. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see Mr Seleka also nods, so hopefully 
today is the last time.  Okay, alright.  How much time has 
lapsed since she was testifying? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I think about two weeks.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  I think she testified last week?   
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, not last week. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Oh, 
anyway 
okay. 
 
Registrar 
10 
...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:  I am not sure Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please administer the oath or affirmation.  
Well, it has been so many times we all cannot remember.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
WITNESS:  Suzanne Margaret Daniels. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
WITNESS:  No. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath binding on your 
conscience? 
WITNESS:  Yes.  
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that the evidence 
you will give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 207 of 319 
 
but the truth?  If so, please raise your right hand and say 
so help me God.  
WITNESS:  So help me God. 
SUSANNE MARGARET DANIELS:  (d.s.s) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You might, obviously Mr Seleka 
wish to remind the public where we are with Ms Daniels’s 
evidence and what remains to be covered? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  Thank you.  Ms Daniels is 
10 
specifically back today to cover the issue regarding the 
penalties which is the penalties claim of 2.17 billion rand 
that Eskom intended pursuing against Glenco OCM.  That 
penalty amount was ultimately settled with Tegeta after it 
had taken over OCM, at an amount that was significantly 
low, much lower than what had originally been the claim. 
 
We have dealt with other aspects of her evidence 
and we have adjourned, we could not finish the penalties.  
We adjourned today for this specific purpose.  There will 
be, so that is the main focus for today.  There will be an 
20 
aspect that she has to clarify to the Chairperson in relation 
to McKinsey. 
 
Those questions were put to her last time and she 
answered in a particular way she wishes to clarify her 
answers and we will give her the opportunity to do so at 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 208 of 319 
 
the end.  Now the last, on your appearance Ms Daniels the 
last time, well the penultimate time, so the second last 
time we traversed the issues of the penalties looking at the 
first opinion that CDH had given to Eskom.   
 
Chair, 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
reference 
we 
will 
specifically refer to Eskom Bundle 14 and her documents 
have now been moved to bracket D of Eskom Bundle 14.  
Ms Daniels, on your side you are using the soft copy, the 
documentation are not marked as in the hard copy.  So for 
your purposes, we will simply refer to the page numbers.  
10 
 
Just to recap, Chairperson let us go to that Eskom 
Bundle 14 bracket D.  The bundle contains an affidavit of 
Mr Rishaban Moodley, an attorney from Cliff Decker 
Hofmeyr.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And on page 984, page 984 was the 
first opinion memorandum dated 23 October 2013 which we 
traversed in the last, the second last appearance of Ms 
Daniels.  Ms Daniels, we were about to go to the second 
opinion of CDH. 
20 
 
Chair, what we hope to achieve with her evidence is 
for Ms Daniels to show you the various concerns that were 
raised.  When were they raised, where are they contained 
and whether the concerns were the same throughout.  
Thank you, Chair.  
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 209 of 319 
 
 
Ms Daniels? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  You can hear and see us? 
MS DANIELS:  I can hear and I can see you but I cannot 
see the Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.   
MS DANIELS:  Oh, there I can, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MS DANIELS:  Alright.  Mr Chair?   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Daniels?   
MS DANIELS:  With Mr Seleka’s permission I am going to 
do it a little differently.  I am going to start with where I got 
involved and then work backwards and show you in the 
previous opinions where they, where the themes are the 
same, if that is in order? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say work backwards.  I do not like 
working backwards generally speaking. 
MS DANIELS:  Oh, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you may not be meaning working 
20 
backwards.  As I understand it, you first want to testify 
about the role you played and then go to the opinions.  Is 
that correct, is that what you meant rather than start with 
your opinions?   
MS DANIELS:  That is correct.  So that I have a point of 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 210 of 319 
 
reference for you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ja, you see.  
MS DANIELS:  It makes it easier for me.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is not working backwards for me 
because your role, the role you played came first, not so 
and the opinions came later? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And the opinions came later or was it 
not? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes, and then we there were opinions in 
10 
existence already Mr Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  When you came ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:  That was the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  When you got involved.  
MS DANIELS:  That was the 23 r d, when I came in.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  I do not know what Mr Seleka 
has in mind, but for me you start with what you got 
involved in before we go to opinions. That is fine with me.  
If he feels differently for his plans, I am easy. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair, her timing of involvement comes 
20 
somewhere in the middle.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Quite in the middle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So you wanted to go according to what 
happened when? 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 211 of 319 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you, if opinions came before 
she got involved ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You wanted to deal with those opinions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you get to where she got 
involved, 
you 
wanted 
to 
make 
sure 
that 
that 
is 
in 
accordance with the sequence of events as they evolved at 
that time as they unfolded at that time. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have some difficulty with that Ms 
Daniels? 
MS DANIELS:  No, Mr Chair.  I will make it, I will fit in with 
that.  It is just it will make it ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might not have much to say I assume 
about opinions that were given without your involvement 
and before you got involved.  
MS DANIELS:  Well, what I can do is I can confirm for you 
that I have read them. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS DANIELS:  You know, I was provided with them when I 
did get involved.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MS DANIELS:  And I can at least from that point of view, 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 212 of 319 
 
give you insight into what they contain. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but from your point of view it would 
be much more convenient to start with what your role was 
and then look at the opinions, that is what you preferred.  
MS DANIELS:  Well, it was just from a point of reference in 
the documentation because essentially Mr Chair, the 
opinions did not change from 2013 ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS DANIELS:  To when I got involved.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
10 
MS DANIELS:  You know, from a substantive legal point of 
view.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I leave it to Mr Seleka.  You have 
heard what she would prefer but she has said she can work 
with your plan as well.  I leave it to you, up to you.  I leave 
it to the two of you.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  If we can start with her role Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  I mean, I suppose in the end we will 
have a clear picture of the sequence of events, because I 
20 
had already started leading her evidence on the first 
opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  But Ms Daniels, if you prefer to explain 
to the Chairperson first and foremost when you got 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 213 of 319 
 
involved, what is it that you did and what opinions were 
given to you at that stage and what opinions you sought 
and were able to obtain, and then maybe we can go into 
the sequence of those opinions. 
MS DANIELS:  Alright, that works.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Firstly, when did you get 
involved?  How does the matter come to you, and what 
were you expected to do?   
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chair, I took over the role of acting head 
of legal and compliance in September 2016, and at that 
10 
stage Optimum had just come out of business rescue in 
August.  It was one of those litigation matters on the list 
that Eskom had to contend with.  
 
I, my first point of call was to try and understand 
what had gone before because now that Optimum had come 
out of business rescue, we could continue with the penalty 
claim for want of a better description.  This would mean 
that we would be continuing with arbitration proceedings, 
and I wanted to understand firstly the merits of the claim 
and understand what the issues were that were involved.  
20 
 
It was on that basis that my first request, having 
seen the documentation was to ask CDH to undertake an 
assessment of the claim for me.  The reason for doing that 
was there had been a number of changes in the context.  
Obviously Optimum had now been taken over by TIGETA, 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 214 of 319 
 
as the majority shareholder.  
 
Internally Eskom the staff members who were 
involved and who would be the potential witnesses were no 
longer around and we needed to assess also the nature of 
the expert claims.  In their opinion there were once again 
three issues.   
 
It was around the contract management and it was 
around the sampling process.  The calculation of the 
penalty, the interpretation of the penalty clauses and then 
obviously the application of the penalty during the period 
10 
involved from March 2012 to 2014 and then from June 2014 
to May 2015.  
 
So in this opinion, the assessment was around how 
would, is Eskom in a position to refute that it failed to 
comply with the CSA in respect of contract management 
procedures.  Did it in fact wave its right to impose the 
penalties and the failure to calculate the penalty correctly.  
 
So if you then, this is in December 2016 when I get 
the assessment, but if you go back and like I testified last 
time, to the 2013 opinion which is in Bundle 14, my 
20 
reference page is 984 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  What page would that be Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is the same Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 984, Eskom Bundle 14(D). 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 215 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chair, we did go into a bit of detail last 
time about you will recall the, you know the factual things 
but I just wanted to point out to you that once again in 
2013, well not once again ... at the beginning of this story, 
the credibility of the sampling process was questioned, 
because of the procedure that Eskom followed.  
 
The, 
at 
this 
point 
Eskom 
was 
already 
in 
renegotiation of the sizing parameters of the coal.  So that 
meant that Eskom was already not implementing the sizing 
10 
penalty.  So there is a risk, there was also a risk 
highlighted that the penalties that Eskom was imposing 
would be in contravention of the Penalties Act.  
 
The attorneys also identified that perhaps given all 
these factors, there is a risk that Optimum would cancel 
the contract and well fundamentally there was also the 
issue that based on all these facts and the failure for 
Eskom to implement the contract manage procedure as set 
out in the contract, that it had in fact waived its right to 
impose the penalties.  
20 
 
So this was at the start and you will remember the 
last time it was about  the, at this point Eskom was going 
into detailed negotiations with Glencore to see how they 
could remedy some of the issues that were coming up in 
terms of managing and operating the coal supply to 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 216 of 319 
 
Hendrina at the time.  
 
So that was in 2013.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Ms Daniels, what we identified last 
time from this memorandum were three categories of 
issues raised by CDH or concerns raised by CDH.  The one 
on page 984 was in respect of coal quality, and then they 
gave a whole range of concerns relating to coal quality.  
 
On page 986 they dealt with sizing specification and 
lastly on page 988 they dealt with coal quantity.  In fact, 
that is the second last.  That is the penultimate.  You also 
10 
had what they referred to as a conveyor, conveyor 
availability dispute, which is on page 989.  
 
But that ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:  Yes ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  This relates to the quantity of coal that 
was required to be supplied to Eskom.   
MS DANIELS:  Well, that was in terms of, that is why I am 
saying in terms of the context at that time, remember 
Eskom was going into discussions with Optimum on the 
entire contract management and operational supply to 
20 
Hendrina from Optimum. 
 
So it covered a little bit more operation issues.  In 
respect of the quality, the penalty issues it would relate to 
the sizing and the quality parameters.  So that is what I 
highlighted.  So the credibility of the sampling process, the 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 217 of 319 
 
sizing specification and whether Eskom had the right to 
actually impose those penalties, were the key issues.  
 
The other issues are just in the context of the 
memo, you know was because of what Eskom was going 
into. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you would have been given this 
memorandum at the time when you took over this matter? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, it was part of the, it was actually part 
of the assessment of the merits.  You will see that it is 
annexed to that memo as well, so that I could get a full 
10 
picture of what the issues were.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  On quality, if you go back to page 
984.  I wonder whether you could succinctly identify just by 
way of recollection, the issues that related to coal quality.  
Because my recollection on coal quality was that Eskom 
had failed to raise an objection or notify OCM that their 
quality of coal was inferior within the timelines specified in 
the contract and as a result they would then to have been 
deemed to accept that coal that was delivered was of 
acceptable quality. 
20 
MS DANIELS:  Yes, that is correct Mr Chair.  I classified 
that as Eskom’s failure to manage the contract in terms of 
the processes and that is the detail of the process, that 
had Eskom not provided those notices in terms of quality, 
then it in effect lost its right to then claim it at a later 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 218 of 319 
 
stage.  
 
You will see from the documentation that there is 
this, at that stage there is this sort of reservation of rights, 
and I think that became a dispute because in terms of the 
actual contract management, there were no notifications 
provided to Optimum to say that you have failed to meet 
this quality specifications and therefore we can impose the 
penalty. 
 
In terms of the contract itself, if there was no 
notification that right then fell away and it was deemed, 
10 
CDH does call it a deeming provision.  It was then deemed 
that Eskom accepted the quality as was provided.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  This memorandum ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That you said we should go to 984. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is a memorandum by, is that by the 
attorneys? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is their opinion. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Does it deal with that particular issue as 
well? 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 219 of 319 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  The issue that you have just raised.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, that is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  About the failure to notify, to give notice 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of, is it Clause 16 of or is it 26 
of the coal supply agreement? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is in terms of, it is in terms of Clause 
3.6 Chair.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ja, 3.6 ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Where does it deal with that issue, this 
memo? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, I assumed that you dealt with it when 
I heard you.  Well, that is in respect of coal quantity, that 
is quantity not quality.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is, they set out let us see, in 
paragraph, paragraph 4 dealing with the penalty and 
20 
payment rejection provisions.  Paragraph 4.1 impose a 
penalty for abrasiveness.  In 4.2 impose a claim in 
reduction or adjustment in terms of Clause 3.6 for any coal 
which fail to comply with either the sizing specification, 
[indistinct] value, ash content, moisture and volatility on 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 220 of 319 
 
the following sliding scale.  
 
So 4.2 will lead us today, so it gives you what you 
should do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, 4.4 refers to Clause 3.6? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:  “The nature of the volatiles of coal is that 
should 
it 
exceed 
the 
prescribed 
range 
contemplated by Clause 4.4.1 of that rule, of 
schedule 
1 
to 
the 
CSA 
it 
is 
relatively 
incombustible and of no or little use to 
10 
Eskom.  That being the case, Eskom may 
want to consider bringing a claim for the 
rectification of the CSA and agenda in order 
to ensure that the intention of the parties is 
correctly portrayed, as the CSA with the first 
addendum as it currently stands, Eskom’s 
remedy for coal which does not meet a 
volatile quality parameter is limited to the 
payment reduction contemplated by Clause 
3.6  of the first addendum, and the other 
20 
remedies 
provided 
specific 
 
performance 
bearing, provided that Eskom has evidence of 
the people who negotiated the first addendum 
available to prove the common mistake and 
that the arbitrator shall rectify the common 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 221 of 319 
 
mistake of the parties.” 
 
What really I was looking for is whether they 
express any opinion, if they do, along the lines of what Ms 
Daniels is saying ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Namely failure to give the notification 
contemplated in Clause 3.6, results in Eskom would have 
resulted in Eskom losing any right it might have had to 
reduce payment or reduce price. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, ...[intervenes]  
10 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chairman, may I just ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MS DANIELS:  You will find it in paragraph 7.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  7.5.  
MS DANIELS:  Which is on page 988.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, yes I see: 
“Eskom has waived its rights to impose and 
[indistinct] payment reduction for certain of the 
months, OCM failed to supply and deliver coal, 
which complies with the sizing specifications 
20 
due to Eskom failure to inform OCM of the 
payment 
reduction 
and 
calculation 
thereof 
timorously 
as 
required 
by 
the 
terms 
and 
conditions of the CSA read with the agenda.” 
Yes, no that is what I was looking for, but what I 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 222 of 319 
 
want to ask is whether you are aware as a matter of fact, 
that Eskom did not during the entire relevant period, give 
such notices as are contemplated by Clause 3.6 to OCM or 
is that something you are not sure about? 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chair, from my experience and it was 
very sporadic.  I was the contract manager in primary 
energy before I rose through the ranks.  I was head of the 
contract management unit in primary energy and it was a 
problem.   
 
So there was not just on the Optimum contract, but 
10 
on all the contracts, that Eskom was sporadic in you know, 
issuing these notices.  The detail of when and how you 
know, it the reason for that is quite you know, not 
complicated, from my perspective there was always a 
change in staff.  
 
You know, the contract managers.  So you will see 
that there were periods when it was done fastidiously and 
then there were periods when you know, nothing happened 
because it was in formal relationship with the suppliers.  
So it is a problem in Eskom and in this instance, as at 
20 
2016 when you look, when one looks back, it was sporadic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, what I am talking about is if you 
look at the period to which Eskom’s claim against OCM 
related which I understand would have been from about 
2012 ...[intervenes]  
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 223 of 319 
 
MS DANIELS:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  March, March 2012 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, March 2012 ultimately I think to 
March or April or May 2015 if I am not mistaken. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  May 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   May 2015, if you look at that while you 
were at Eskom was their occasion for you to say I want to 
know as a matter of fact whether during this period we do 
have proof of such notifications as having sent to OCM and 
you got an answer that there were none or you got an 
10 
answer that there were some but not everything, not for the 
whole period?   
MS DANIELS:   There was some Mr Chair, there was some 
in the early stages. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  In the early stages of the period, 
we are talking about. 
MS DANIELS:   Of the period that we are talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, do you have a recollection of the 
sense you had whether if you – if Eskom wanted to use 
those that were available it would – they would have 
20 
covered maybe half the period, a quarter of the period or 
only a few, 25%, 10% of the entire claim or period, do you 
have a sense of how much they would cover in terms of 
how much of the claim they could – be used to prove? 
MS DANIELS:   It was – it was a small amount Mr Chair in 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 224 of 319 
 
terms of the contract management.  I would not hazard a 
guess now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, but it was a small amount. 
MS DANIELS:   You know, it was a small proportion, and 
that is why it was as big issue, you will see that it becomes 
an issue in terms of – it is always the first issue that CDH 
raises, is that our ability to prove that we had managed in 
terms of clause 3.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and I guess that in this opinion, I 
guess CDH would have asked Eskom, do you have this 
10 
proof of…[intervenes]. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, and I think Mr Moodley’s affidavit 
does actually – he mentions the occasions in which he’s 
asked. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, now this memorandum, this 
opinion is dated 23 October 2013 which is rather early in 
the period.  When Mr – this would have been less than a 
year before Mr Molefe – no, no this would have been less 
than two years before Mr Molefe came to Eskom because 
he came in April 2015, ja 2015.  Do you know whether – 
20 
that there was this problem about this claim of Eskom’s 
against OCM was brought to his attention? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, it was Mr Chair, I can confirm that I 
was in one meeting with Advocate Tsholanku who was head 
of legal at the time and Mr Moodley…[intervenes]. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 225 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Advocate who? 
MS DANIELS:   Tsholanku. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
I 
think 
give 
the 
spelling 
Mr…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Tsholanku [spelt into the record]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so you’re in a meeting with him 
and with who else? 
MS DANIELS:   With Mr Moodley from CDH, Mr Molefe and 
Mr Koko was there as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   And they were explaining to Mr Molefe and 
Mr Koko the issues that we had. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m and do you have a recollection of 
when that would have been, not necessarily the date but 
when in relation to April 2015 when Mr Molefe came to 
Eskom and would it have been 2015 or 2016 or is that 
something you are not able to remember? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, I’m not able to remember but I can 
give you context because Mr Molefe and Mr Koko were 
going into meetings with Optimum. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   And Mr – what’s his name, Mr Ephraim. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   You know, so it was round about that 
period and they were taking them through, that these are 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 226 of 319 
 
the issues involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m and what was said about Eskom’s 
claim against OCM in regard to – in that meeting? 
MS DANIELS:   There was always the issue, Mr Chair, of 
how would Eskom prove, you know, the R2.1billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And was there an answer given as to 
how Eskom would prove that? 
MS DANIELS:   Answer from who, Mr Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   From anybody in the meeting. 
MS DANIELS:   I think the issues were that we were saying 
10 
be careful – well from the legal team they were saying, be 
careful to say that Eskom, you know, has a definite claim 
of R2.1billion because of these issues that we had. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Because we are – we will not be able to 
prove R2.1billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   And the issue got – you know, the issue is, 
essentially an application of the sizing – this was a quality 
penalty issue to make it simple. So, for example, if you 
20 
included the sizing you get a claim of R1.4billion, if you 
exclude it you get a claim of R490million, you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS DANIELS:   And then you still have issues, so there’s 
already a problem with proving that the sizing parameter is 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 227 of 319 
 
actually a legitimate penalty claim because we are – we 
have started negotiating with these people. So, in terms of 
the 
contract 
once 
you 
start 
negotiating 
the 
sizing 
parameter actually does not apply so you can’t impose the 
penalty. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   And then the other issue is, you have not 
imposed the notification process in terms of the contract 
management so your ability to claim in respect of the other 
qualities also falls away, you know.  So, it was a layered 
10 
approach, so the caution at that time, both from the legal 
team and also the operations team, I think I read in Mr 
Bester ’s affidavit at the time that he had also cautioned Mr 
Molefe about, you know, using the figure of R2.1billion 
because of the problems is that, yes you can – we have 
calculated R2.1billion but these are the issues that are 
involved, you know…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Continue, I’m sorry continue. 
MS DANIELS:   At best we could claim something, but we 
need to work out what that something is. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   If, as a matter of fact, you had no proof 
as Eskom that you had issued these notices in terms of 
clause 3.6, let us say at all for the entire period, how much 
of the claim would that affect, of the R2.1billion or 
something, more or less or is that too much…[intervenes]? 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 228 of 319 
 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, may I answer it this way and 
then you can tell me if it happens.  The 577 that we 
eventually settled at, you know, knowing the totality of 
what I know now, I think we were lucky to get to that 
number. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m so your sense is that the 
failure to give notice as contemplated by clause 3.6 would 
have affected at least – not less than R1.5billion maybe 
even R1.8billion? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of the R2.1billion? 
MS DANIELS:   Of the R2.1billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so a substantial amount, much 
more than 50%? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Ms Daniels, I think 
you earlier gave a breakdown of the figures in respect of 
sizing 
and 
quality, 
maybe 
that 
might 
answer 
the 
Chairperson’s question. What figure did you give in respect 
20 
of sizing? 
MS DANIELS:   I said if you included – it was about 
R1.4billion. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   And if you exclude it, it was R490million. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 229 of 319 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, the R490million would only relate 
to quality? 
MS DANIELS:   Ja, in terms of coal language, sizing is 
also part of quality. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, sizing is also part of quality? 
MS DANIELS:   Ja, so – please forgive me but the reason 
we use sizing separately is because of the provision 
relating to sizing that was then waived…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, sizing would also be affected by 
failure to give notice under clause 3.6? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, Mr Chairman, but there was a specific 
– 
there 
was 
an 
added 
complication 
with 
the 
sizing 
parameter because it said in the contract, and I think it is 
in 3.6 but it said in the contract that, should there be a 
problem with sizing and the supplier brings it to your notice 
then the provisions – then we’d re-negotiate the sizing and 
the penalties would not apply while that re-negotiation is 
happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MS DANIELS:   So, that’s why I say, there was this added 
20 
layer of, you know, when you start with this globular figure 
of 
R2.1billion, 
when 
you 
start 
unpacking 
it, 
it 
gets 
complicated and these are the issues that CDH raises in 
2013, 2015 and 2016 and 2017. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 230 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just quickly on quality, I see – it 
seems, and you can confirm, that the operative paragraphs 
in respect of quality was, in this memo, 4.4 and paragraph 
5 and 4.4 read with 5 referred to that abolishment – they 
used the word abolishment of Eskom’s rights to an outright 
rejection of payment for coal which fails to comply with the 
volatile quality parameter and they say this may well have 
been an unintended consequence of the amendment of the 
CSA which is the supplier…[intervenes]. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    That is taken further in paragraph 5 
on page 986 where they say,  
 
“Save for the payment reduction contemplated in 
clause 3.6 of the first addendum and the reduction 
of the purchase price for the abrasiveness level of 
coal in terms of the second addendum, all other 
penalty provisions relating to the failure to meet the 
quality specification of coal in terms of the CSA 
have been abolished.  The only additional remedy 
20 
available to Eskom, should OCM fail to supply and 
deliver the correct quality of coal is the following.  
5.4 is specific performance – I mean 5.1”. 
 
Yes, so what they’re saying, you can’t impose a 
penalty, you can ask them to comply with the agreement. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 231 of 319 
 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, so the order for specific performance. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, and then 5.2 which is another 
remedy available to Eskom, they say, 
“In terms of clause 3.5 of the first addendum, 
Eskom may take steps to dry wet coal which 
exceeds the moisture content limit of 10% of OCM’s 
expense, however, OCM must stop all supply of coal 
to Eskom in the event that the hourly moisture 
content is measured at 2 hourly intervals of coal 
delivered under the clauses they mentioned, will 
10 
only continue deliveries when the moisture content, 
the 
two 
hourly 
interval 
is 
less 
than 
12% 
or 
alternative”, 
 
So, it seems from the reading of this, that Eskom’s 
right to impose a penalty in respect of quality was 
apparently in the amendment of their CSA taken away. 
MS DANIELS:   It was taken away in the sense that it 
required 
a 
far 
more 
rigorous 
contract 
management 
approach to apply than before. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja but CDH is raising this as a concern 
20 
that it seems – when you amended the CSA you took away 
your rights to impose a penalty in respect of quality. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And they say this – it may well have 
been an unintended consequence, if you go back to 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 232 of 319 
 
paragraph 4.4 but they go onto say in that paragraph, you 
will need people who negotiated that amendment to confirm 
whether that was the intention of the parties. 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct and the person – the lead 
negotiator at the time had already left Eskom I think, I was 
part of that team and the other people, I think they had 
also left Eskom it was a – there were very few people who 
would be able to testify as an expert on what – well testify 
on the intention of the parties but CDH did say that we 
would have to go to court to get a rectification of the 
10 
agreement. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but that didn’t happen? 
MS DANIELS:   No that did not happen. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That did not happen, so on my reading 
of this, tell me if I’m correct, CDH is saying, well if you are 
imposing a penalty in respect of quality it seems to me that 
you don’t have that right because you’ve taken it away.  
The only right you have is to tell OCM to comply with the 
agreement, ask for a specific performance or you dry the 
coal that has too much moisture, you bring it down to the 
20 
level that is acceptable. 
MS DANIELS:   In simple terms yes, Mr Seleka but I would 
just add that number one, what CDH was saying is, you 
need to notify them okay, if you want to apply the penalties 
you need to notify them that you’re not happy with the 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 233 of 319 
 
quality so that the penalty can apply.  You need to make 
sure that you are clear about the sizing requirements 
because right  now you are negotiating with them and 
therefore you have waived your right to impose any sizing 
issue.  In respect of the moisture, you need to dry out the 
coal and charge OCM for that drying out process and as I 
told you last time you need to fix – you know, they needed 
to fix the hammer sampler because that’s where the 
moisture testing was also being done.  So, in layman’s 
terms what CDH was telling Eskom is, you need to get your 
10 
house in order if you want to apply this penalty regime as 
it states and obviously, firstly, go to court and get the 
rectification that you require. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so that’s the first opinion you 
have quantity as well then there’s a dispute about a 
conveyor belt issue, do you have anything more to say, you 
were talking about reservation of rights at the end of the 
opinion. 
MS DANIELS:   Sorry, I’ve lost my place. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It will be page 989. 
20 
MS DANIELS:   Just, can you… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On which page are you? 
MS DANIELS:   I’m now on 989. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, under conclusion. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I’m just reading it again. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 234 of 319 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja they make certain observations 
there in conclusion. 
MS DANIELS:   Ja, they say that, you know, OCM will not 
accept, will just not accept it at face value, the risks 
identified in respect of the payment and then if Eskom 
wants to proceed with the claim it should not do a set-off 
and Eskom should rather demand the payment. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m I see paragraph 10 they say, 
“In light of the risks identified in Eskom applying 
the payment reduction for OCM’s failure to comply 
10 
with the sizing specification at this stage, we advise 
that it would be prudent to first address all the 
concerns in order to ensure that Eskom will be in a 
better position to impose the payment reduction and 
subsequently enforce any claim for the reduction of 
the purchase price due to OCM’s failure to comply 
with quality or quantity specification”, 
 
Now that sizing specification had to do with that – 
the hammer you referred to, the hammer sampler that 
Eskom was using that was misaligned and not doing proper 
20 
sampling, do you know whether that was …[intervenes]. 
MS DANIELS:   That’s correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you know whether that was ever 
corrected at the time you were there? 
MS DANIELS:   To the best of my knowledge, it was not Mr 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 235 of 319 
 
Chairman…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Say again. 
MS DANIELS:   During this time, it was not corrected. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But even if corrected would it affect 
the situation, the historic situation, would it have affected 
the historic situation? 
MS DANIELS:    No, it would not have because of the other 
issues that this memo identifies, you know, I mean the 
contract did not apply retrospectively. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so this…[intervenes]. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Sorry, the penalty regime was not 
retrospective it was actually contemporaneous. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, so this particular concern would 
have been drawn to the attention of the Executives you 
have mentioned, Mr Molefe and Mr Koko? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, you will see at the time this memo is 
addressed to Mr Johan Bester in Primary Energy so both at 
operational level and then at Executive level, people were 
aware of what the issues were. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I recall in your affidavit, you do 
20 
mention that these concerns were also drawn to the 
attention of Mr Anoj Singh. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I just can’t  recall if it was in this kind 
of detail, but I had provided the latest, you know, the ones 
that I was involved in, those memos to Mr Singh. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 236 of 319 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, do you want to take us to the 
second opinion or somewhere else? 
MS DANIELS:   I think the second opinion is in March 
2015, Mr Chairman and that is on page 992 in my bundle, 
Eskom Bundle 14. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, it is sent to you or to Eskom by 
email which is on page 991. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, the date is incorrect on this one it 
says 17 March 2014 but it’s in fact, 2015…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s interesting, why would anyone in 
10 
March write the previous year, I can understand when its 
January, people take time to get used to the new year but 
why would anyone, in March 2015 still be writing 2014 on 
the date? 
MS DANIELS:   I think you must ask Mr – who wrote this 
memo…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why do you say 2014 is wrong it should 
be 2015? 
MS DANIELS:   I’m just basing it on the fact that the memo 
is -the covering email is dated 2015 Mr Chairman and it’s 
20 
17 March 2015, so I’m just assuming I may be wrong. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair there is another way to look at – 
to resolve that issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We would have to go to – since this is 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 237 of 319 
 
an Annexure to Mr Moodley’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We’ll have to go to his affidavit which 
is…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I recently saw a document dated 
March 2020 and the question arose whether there was a 
mistake it was meant to be March 2021 and I said, well in 
March 2021 nobody would be confused about which year it 
was.  So, it looks like I may not be entirely correct, I just 
wouldn’t understand it, I mean in March you’ve been – 
10 
everyone knows it’s a quarter of the year gone yes, but you 
were saying, let’s look at the affidavit Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, on page 907. 
CHAIRPERSON:   907? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, paragraph 45.5, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, 45.5 which reads, 
“Prior to the lapsing of the corporation agreement 
CDH provided updated legal advice on the penalty 
claim and related risks on 17 March 2015 to, and 
20 
then mentions the names, Ayanda Nteta, Andrea 
Williams, Ken Pillay, and other Eskom officials, see 
items 17.2 of the Bundle”, 
 
Now that email with the attachment to it Chair, is 
that 17.2 then you will see there quoting certain portions 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 238 of 319 
 
from that email – I mean from the document itself, the 
memorandum which is dated 17 March 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you seen anything like that? 
[Laughter]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Daniels have you seen anybody who, 
in March, doesn’t know which year they are in, they are 
still thinking of the previous year? 
MS DANIELS:   Oh, Mr Chairman, I’ve – you know time has 
become such an issue these days, I’m a little bit more 
10 
forgiving. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It’s like, were they sleeping for three 
months, okay anyway. [Laughter]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In paragraph 1 Chair, ja this may well 
be conclusive, paragraph 1 of that memo reads, 
 
“We refer to the meeting held…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I’m sorry I’m at 984 I should be 
somewhere else. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m at the memo that is at 984, it goes to 
20 
another page. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Go to the one 992, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   992? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I was there and then I found 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 239 of 319 
 
myself back here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that very one with the 2014 date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Maybe…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that will help, 
 
“We refer to the meeting held on 11 March 2015”. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, very strange, okay I will assume 
that for some reason they thought it was till 2014 but it 
was 2015, okay let’s continue. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Ms Daniels, so what do we find in 
this memo? 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chairman I think here you know this – 
once again the context was that the memo – this meeting 
was asked to explain the penalty provisions in terms of the – 
you will see the people they were coal supply managers, the 
internal legal team as to the application of the penalty 
provisions in the contract once again.  And this is March 
2015.   
I think here CDH is a little bit more emphatic about 
20 
the fact that Eskom has not applied the penalty regime for 
the last three years.  So that means the period from 2012 to 
20 – well I am assuming the date of the memo 2015 but 
Eskom actually has not applied the penalty regime.   
It is here that they talk about those accrued rights 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 240 of 319 
 
but they also talk that you know what the figures are still not 
okay but they do repeat again the same issues.  The 
interpretation of the – of the Clause 3.6 so it has not been 
rectified at this stage. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  If I may Ms Daniels I think as you 
highlight the points in the memo you could do so by 
reference to the paragraph numbers.  I see paragraph 4 
deals specifically with that first point you mentioned which is 
Eskom’s 
failure 
to 
impose 
payment 
reductions 
for 
approximately three years. 
10 
MS DANIELS:  Yes.  So you know it starts off saying Eskom 
has for approximately three years not imposed any payment 
reduction.  So Mr Chairman to answer your previous question 
it 
would 
then 
seem 
that 
they 
had 
looked 
at 
the 
documentation that we had. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  You know and come to that conclusion that 
we actually had not imposed it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DANIELS:  And they also in paragraph 3 talk about this 
20 
concept of accrued rights and you will see they put it in 
inverted commas because of all the issues that they late – 
that they have identified and will continue to identify you 
know as to how one applies that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  And … 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 241 of 319 
 
MS DANIELS:  Under paragraph 3 of the memo. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
MS DANIELS:  And once again you will see that they – the 
issues are the interpretation of the Clause 3.6 and 4.1 the 
sampling process, the disputes around the sampling process.  
The negotiation around the sizing component which is in 4.3 
and then there was the hardship dispute which was raised by 
Optimum.  So there are more issues you know added. 
 
And then again is the year is – in paragraph 5 they 
go to more detail.  So it gets a little bit more what is the 
10 
word?  Emphatic at this point where they say you know we 
understand that Eskom has not imposed penalties for sizing 
for the period from March 2012.   
And then they set out the reasons why they say that.  
And then they also say in order to protect your rights this is 
what you need to do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And… 
MS DANIELS:  And that is – and that you see in I think it is 
paragraph 5.  I am reading from another screen to make it 
easier. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  And as I understand – well we 
dealing with sizing penalties.  The portion of the claim the 
R2.17 billion relating to sizing was ultimately abandoned as I 
understand from the papers. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes from the – you would see that in the – in 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 242 of 319 
 
the last memo where we calculated that was the R1.- I think 
it was R1.4 billion. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  We will – we will get to it. 
MS DANIELS:  We will get there but it was – that was the 
size because – because of this – this reason that misses in 
2015 when we – when this was pointed out. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Any other points you wish to draw 
to the Chairperson’s attention? 
MS DANIELS:  I think – Mr Chair it is the same issues again 
you know I think you just – I want you to take note that once 
10 
again it is the interpretation of the clause.  It is the disputes 
regarding the sampling process, the sizing issue you know 
these are not new issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
MS DANIELS:  So this is in 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  The – so this once again… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – I am sorry Mr Seleka.  So in 2013 
CDH gives an opinion where it raised these issues about the 
problem that Eskom did not give notice in terms of process 
3.6 in terms of quality or poor quality of coal and that 
20 
therefore it could not pursue any claim in the absence of any 
proof that it had given those notices but even after that 
opinion 2013/2014 we are now in 2015 there is another 
opinion still Eskom has not made sure that it gives the 
notices contemplated under Clause 3.6 whenever OCM did 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 243 of 319 
 
not supply coal of the required standard. Is that correct? 
MS DANIELS:  That is correct Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And hence in the 2015 opinion the same 
point is still being made.  Is that right? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes.  That is correct.  I think just as CDH is 
much more emphatic in saying we did not impose the 
penalties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  You know they – they saying it stronger than 
the earlier opinions. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  Even though they say they still extracting 
documentation they do say it much more bolder that we did 
not impose the penalties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And one would have thought that in any 
event if Eskom was serious about enforcing penalties at 
least after – or by the time of this opinion 2015 opinion one 
would have thought that Eskom would have been able if they 
if they did have proof of having given such notices that they 
would have provided those to CDH to say no now we do have 
20 
proof.  We might not have had proof prior to your 2013 
opinion but now we are wiser and we have got proof.  Is that 
right? 
MS DANIELS:  That is right Mr Chairman I would just also 
say that you must bear in mind that during 2014 there was 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 244 of 319 
 
that cooperation agreement with Glencore in place of 
Glencore/Optimum and that the parties were endeavouring to 
sort out these issues.  This is – and they come to a 
conclusion and that is then what goes to the board and the 
board says you know Mr Molefe must sort this out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But… 
MS DANIELS:  So – so that is the only for want of a better 
word mitigating factor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS DANIELS:  That give it – you know just take into 
10 
consideration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course everyone protects their 
respective positions during negotiations. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would have thought that Eskom would 
say well we are not going to have a situation where our 
negotiating position – our bargaining position is weakened.  
If you provide us with poor quality coal we will serve you 
with the notices in terms of Clause 3.6 but whether or not we 
will 
impose 
the 
penalty 
we 
will 
see 
that 
later 
after 
20 
negotiations but we cannot not issue the notices because 
failure to issue the notices means that we lose the right to 
impose the penalty.  We do not want to lose that right.  One 
would have expected Eskom to have acted on that basis.  
Would you agree? 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 245 of 319 
 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I agree with Mr Chair and just if my 
00:10:14 position in defence of Eskom at the time … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is it because… 
MS DANIELS:  I think they did … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it because you were the legal person 
you did not tell them listen… 
MS DANIELS:  No, no I was not the legal person at the time 
but I am just – I am still – something 00:10:34 has an 
allegiance to Eskom.  They did try it halfway Mr Chairman 
and I think you know that – from the documentation you can 
10 
see that that they did put the clause in the cooperation 
agreement but you are correct they ought to have done the 
second bit as well in terms of the notices given what CDH 
had said and that there had been no application for 
rectification.  So the preservation of rights clause in the 
cooperation agreement did not go that far. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay well you mention an important 
point 
because 
I 
do 
not 
recall 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
cooperation agreement.  Are you saying that that agreement 
had a clause that sought to protect Eskom’s position to the 
20 
extent 
that 
during 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
cooperation 
agreement Eskom might not issue notices? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I just cannot remember the specific 
wording so I said that covered some of what you – what you 
are asking. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 246 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS DANIELS:  But it may not have gone as far as… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It should.  Ja. 
MS DANIELS:  As it should have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS DANIELS:  But all I am just asking you to bear that in 
mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  So that would have – you know that is 
another reason why we – we found ourselves in the position 
10 
that we did in 2016/2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I think Chair they – the clause reserved 
Eskom’s right to claim for penalties but after the duration of 
the negotiations.  So you are right that we would not issue 
you but we reserve that right to do so after.  But then it 
would apply prospective. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes it would not affect the… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It would not affect the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The previous one. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is correct. 
MS DANIELS:  Well that is why I am saying it is – it did not 
go as far as one would have expected it to go. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MS DANIELS:  You know. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 247 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but – but also I guess in fairness to 
Eskom there is no way OCM would have agreed that they 
should cover – they should cover the period before the 
cooperation 
agreement 
because 
that 
would 
resuscitate 
claims that otherwise had prescribed.  So OCM would not 
have agreed to that.  So okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And they going to weaken that – that 
clause substantially I think in the next – in the next opinion 
they show that Eskom ultimately agreed to a specification 
that met the coal that was supplied by OCM.  So then you 
10 
can go back and say I am claiming. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
When 
you 
have 
lowered 
your 
specification to accept the coal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which was already supplied. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we are at ten past six so. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We will expedite it.  Yes Ms Daniels you 
are now talking about the waiver which the Chairperson 
eluded to you remember that the BTC Chairperson in fact I 
20 
think it is the meeting of the 8t h of February 2017 also said it 
means looking at this what we have gone through now 
Eskom’s failure to enforce its rights it seems that Eskom has 
waived its rights to enforce the penalties.  You remember 
that?  Do you remember that? 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 248 of 319 
 
MS DANIELS:  Ja I am not specifically but I will look at the – 
where the document – but you must if you reading from the 
document then it is there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The minutes I think is of the 7t h or the 8t h 
of February 20 – you do not have to go there now we will 
come to it.   
MS DANIELS:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  As we – as we navigate our way through 
this.   
MS DANIELS:  Ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Let us go to the – that was.. 
MS DANIELS:  It is sort of – Mr Chair just to give context so 
that the kind of detailed explanation we did at the February 
meeting as well that we are offering now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Just go to the next opinion I think 
we are on the 2 nd you say it has raised – by this time – by 
the time of this opinion March 2015 you are still not involved 
in this matter? 
MS DANIELS:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  We know that the third opinion 
20 
that is the one you asked for.  You come on board on the – I  
CHAIRPERSON:  The third opinion is – starts from where? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The third opinion Chair. 
MS DANIELS:  1042. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1042.  Okay thank you.  That is where you 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 249 of 319 
 
– that is the one you going to now? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Continue Ms Daniels. 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chair here I had asked for – I – in – at 
this point in time I – acting head of Legal and Compliance 
and Optimum was one of the issues – one of the litigation 
matters on the table and I had asked for an assessment of 
10 
the merits and just a high level overview of what the issues 
were.  And once again CDH tells Eskom the claims potential 
weakness are Eskom’s compliance with the contractual 
requirements in terms of you know its failure to manage the 
contract the rectification of Clause 3.6 once again that that 
is the entire quality penalty regime and the integrity of the 
sampling process. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  At which page? 
MS DANIELS:  And you will find that … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I think it is page 1046 Chair. 
20 
MS DANIELS:  Is yes 1046. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
MS DANIELS:  Paragraph – it is under heading See the 
Eskom Claim and its potential weaknesses. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So Ms Daniels are you saying the issues 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 250 of 319 
 
are the same? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes Mr Chair they – they have not really 
changed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I got the – the minutes of 8 February 
2017 I will quickly read to you it says: 
“The chairman opined that Eskom had by its 
actions effectively given up its rights in 
respect of sizing.  As it had decided not to…” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where are you reading from now? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That will be page 1134 Chair.  Sorry 
10 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1134? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  1134. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. Okay I was still on the opinion. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No you are right there Chair.  I just 
wanted to read to Ms Daniels. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I just want the Chairperson of the BTC 
said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is 1134. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The fourth paragraph from the top. 
“So the chairman opined that Eskom had by 
its actions effectively given up its rights in 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 251 of 319 
 
respect of sizing as it had decided not to 
enforce penalties on the sizing issue.  Mr 
Moodley which is the attorney writing this 
memoranda agreed that from a commercial 
perspective the above statement was correct.  
Dr Naidoo added that by virtue of Eskom 
continuing to accept the out of spec code it 
was effectively giving up its right to penalise 
from sizing.” 
So the BTC itself was raising this concern that Eskom 
10 
seemed to have waived its rights.  Well that it has effectively 
waived its rights we would reclaim on sizing.  You see that 
Ms Daniels? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is correct.   
ADV SELEKA SC: But it was a mis.. 
MS DANIELS:  That is why I say this Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes proceed. 
MS DANIELS:  That that was already stated you know from – 
from the beginning in 2013 when CDH started opining on 
these issues.  So the theme throughout has been Eskom you 
20 
have a problem.  You actually cannot enforce your claim. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And then Chair if we may go back to the 
opinion? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 252 of 319 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On page 1047.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before you go to 1047 at 1046. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am attracted by 3.3 which says: 
“The issues of consent relating to the claim 
has 
always 
been 
amongst 
others 
the 
following.” 
 
Ms Daniels has been saying there it was always the 
same concerns and the difference was that as time went on 
CDH was becoming more and more emphatic. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of raising these concerns. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right Ms Daniels? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is correct Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay Mr Seleka you can go to 1047. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then 1047 Ms Daniels they set out the 
potential defence that OCM has. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You have looked at those as well? 
20 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I have and they do say there is you know 
the disputes that they – they say:  
“There is no reasonable basis to justify a 
penalty of this amount which is the R2.2 
billion having regard to the history and 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 253 of 319 
 
background circumstances surrounding the 
imposition of the penalties arising out of the 
C – CSA which is Coal Supply Agreement 
and that Eskom has no reasonable prospect 
of recovering this amount in an arbitration.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Next point.  OCM. 
MS DANIELS:  And then it also says Eskom – OCM may not 
be able to settle the claim and then this specific defences 
was that the CSA included a renegotiation clause which was 
already activated.  That is in 4.1.2.  And that was in April 
10 
2013 as you see from 4.1.2.2 and the fact that Optimum had 
actually issued that notice and that the people were 
negotiating – the teams were negotiating in 2013/2014. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So in other words... 
MS DANIELS:  And then they do set out… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In other words you can impose the 
penalty – penalties when we are busy renegotiating the 
specifications of coal to be supplied. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes you will see from the agreement Mr Chair 
that it specifically says where there is an issue – because 
20 
sizing was a problem.  Where there was an issue raised in 
respect of sizing and the supplier issued the notice that the 
parties would enter into negotiations.  So from that point of 
view then the sizing specifications for effect was staid and 
they had to renegotiate a new one.  So that affected the 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 254 of 319 
 
claim that we had in respect of sizing. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Then let us go down to 4.1.2.5 I 
see there that this renegotiation process they say was 
eventually subsumed into the broader settlement discussions 
which 
culminated 
in 
the 
signing 
of 
the 
cooperation 
agreement in May 2014 which suspended all the penalties.  
During the settlement discussions there were extensive 
negotiations on this specifications with primary energy and 
the Hendrina Power Station and ultimately a specification 
was agreed in relation to sizing which matches that which 
10 
OCM delivered during the period from March 2012 – from 
2012 I beg your pardon to 2015.  If this is a specification 
that the power station was capable of accepting then clearly 
the delivery of coal meeting that size specification during 
most of 2012 to 2015 could not have caused any meaningful 
damage to the power station. 
So Eskom seems to have then agreed as I was 
alluding earlier to a specification that matched the coal that 
was ul – already supplied. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes and therefore its claim in respect of 
20 
payment reduction or penalty fell away. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Okay well those are the defences of 
OCM they carry on maybe we could go to – because we 
mainly concerned with the weaknesses that were apparent 
from the very beginning in Eskom’s claim.  Let us see the 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 255 of 319 
 
next opinion. So this opinion you requested it. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And you obtained it.  You obtained it from 
CDH ? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I did.  It was in December 2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja it is dated 2 December 2016. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes that is when it arrived. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And you were – and would you have 
followed the same process of raising these concerns with 
your executives? 
10 
MS DANIELS:  Yes this I discussed with Mr Singh and Mr 
Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And – and you do speak about Mr Koko’s 
attitude here about settlement. Can you just quickly touch on 
that for the Chairperson? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes Mr Chair Mr Koko was appointed acting 
Chief Executive on the 1s t of December 2016 and with effect 
from that date his position altered in terms of the first matter 
to the extent that he had told me that he would be happy if 
we settled this claim at around about R500 million.   
20 
At that stage I was still saying well you know we – 
how do we go from R2.1 billion to R500 million and it would 
not look good for Eskom to settle.  
At that stage I was making that statement not 
understanding the full import of what had gone before but 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 256 of 319 
 
from a perspective of we had gone out into the media, we 
had said R2.1 billion is what is owed by Eskom and we had 
paid such a – such an issue of it that we would – we could 
not just walk away. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Koko became acting Group CEO in 
December 2016 or early January 20178 is it not? 
MS DANIELS:  It was December 2016 the formal – the board 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja when Mr.. 
10 
MS DANIELS:  Approved the appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When Mr Molefe left. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but how could you have said to him – 
how could you move from R2 billion to R400 and something 
million when you knew based on these opinions as you 
indicated earlier that more than 50% of – much more than 
50% of this claim would be defeated by the fact that Eskom 
had not issued notices in terms of Clause 3.6? 
MS DANIELS:  So what I am saying Mr Chair when the 
20 
conversation started that was my position not having read all 
the detail yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you knew… 
MS DANIELS:  As I came to know of what was actually 
involved. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 257 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  When – when did you get involved in the – 
in the issue of the penalties?  I thought you got involved 
much earlier than December 2016. 
MS DANIELS:  I cannot remember when it exactly I – I took 
over in September and during that period we – we started 
evaluating all the – there was about 278 litigation matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But.. 
MS DANIELS:  Live litigation matters so that we were going 
through them.  What I had asked CDH to do was do an 
assessment for me and that assessment is dated the 2 n d of 
10 
December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  So from that we started working through it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but.. 
MS DANIELS:  So I had not yet had the opportunity like the 
detail that I am giving you now you will see that the memo 
for 2 December has all of these opinion attached to it.  So 
when I started the conversation with Mr Koko it was not to – 
it was not having had full insight into all of this.  My insight 
was based on we had from a – from a company perspective 
20 
we had gone out and said we are claiming R2.1 billion how 
do you get to R500 million?   
 
You know not from a – not from having read all of 
this.  I then started going through all of this when I 
received it. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 258 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   When did you become Head of the Legal 
Department? 
MS 
DANIELS: 
 
 
In... 
I 
took 
over 
from 
Mr Selanka/Selanko(?) in September. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In September 2016? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So are you saying that as in 
December before you actually got this advice or opinion of 
2 December 2016 until you have had a chance to read it 
and see the previous opinions, you were not aware of the 
10 
previous opinions? 
MS DANIELS:   No, I was not  They were all attached to 
this December 2016 opinion that I got. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
I 
would 
have 
thought 
that 
your 
predecessor would have made sure that such important 
documents were made available to you when you came in.  
You say that was not the case? 
MS DANIELS:   It was actually not the case Mr Chair.  I 
would have thought too but it was actually not the case.  It 
was only when I got this...  You will see from the memo in 
20 
the bundle that all of these memos were attached to the 
December 2016 assessment and it was at that point that I 
could then read through all of those memos ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   ...including the technical reports. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 259 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I thought that you said earlier on, 
you were present at a meeting involving somebody from 
CDH where Mr Molefe was present and where he was 
cautioned about talking about that claim for R 2.1 billion 
because there was a problem with the fact that Eskom had 
not given notices in terms of Clause 3.6? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chair, I was present at the meeting.  I 
did not have the documentation.  All I know is, from what I 
recall from that meeting, he was made aware of the issues 
relating to the claim. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but if he was made aware, he was 
made aware in your presence and if you were not one of 
the people who were making him aware, it means at least, 
you 
became 
aware 
that 
this 
R 2.1 billion 
claim 
was 
problematic 
because 
you 
were 
there 
when 
he 
was 
cautioned.   
 
And that would, obviously, have been some time 
– or that would have been before Mr Koko took over before 
your discussion with Mr Koko. 
 
So by the time you had the discussion with 
20 
Mr Koko, even if you may not have read this latest opinion 
that you obtained, you would have known that there was 
this caution that was given. 
 
And I would have thought that once you were 
told about – you were aware of the caution, you would 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 260 of 319 
 
have known that the caution was based on opinions and 
you would have wanted to see those opinions if you had 
not already seen them.  And how could you not have seen 
them before they were attached to this opinion? 
MS DANIELS:   I was not in a legal capacity in that stage 
Mr Chairman.  So I always knew that there was an issue 
from that stage but I did not know the exact – what is the 
word? – ambits of the issues and that is why I asked for 
the assessment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I mean, what position were you 
10 
– did you occupy at the time of that meeting involving 
somebody from CDH, yourself and Mr Molefe? What was 
the position ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   At that stage I was still in Group 
Commercial.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Group Commercial.  That would have 
been 2015 or 2016.  Do you – are you able to say? 
MS DANIELS:   It probably would have been roundabout 
2015 
because 
I 
became 
Company 
Secretary 
in 
October 2015. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you see, I may have difficulty 
with the idea that you are present at such a meeting where 
Mr Molefe is cautioned the way you said he was cautioned 
about this claim but when you become Head of Legal, 
nothing says to you:  But I must see those opinions 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 261 of 319 
 
because this is a very big claim.  It is quite an important 
claim.   
MS DANIELS:   But that is why I asked for the assessment 
Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  I understand asking for that but 
before you asked for it, I would have thought you would 
have wanted to see the opinions that were in existence 
already that that caution was based on.  In other words you 
say:  You know, I remember that meeting.  This was the 
caution given and let me see those opinions first.  Because 
10 
those opinions ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Well, that is what ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...could have an answer for you.  Then 
you do not have to pay for another legal advice when there 
are opinions that give you the legal advice. 
MS DANIELS:   But they were all attached to this ... 
opinion, anyway. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but what I am saying is.  If you 
remembered that this claim – it was in regard to this claim 
that at the meeting that you attended, Mr Molefe was 
20 
cautioned and told that do not be too strong on this 
R 2.1 billion claim because it is problematic because there 
was no – there were no notices issued by Eskom.   
 
It seems to me that probably that you ought to 
remember that when you are Head of Legal that this claim, 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 262 of 319 
 
I remember we told Mr Molefe there is a problem.  And to 
the extent that in that meeting you would have been aware 
that there were legal opinions that already been furnished.  
I would have expect you to want to find those opinions 
even before you could ask for another.   
 
Because why would you want to pay for another 
opinion if you have opinions that already give you the 
answer that you are looking for? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, I just want to maybe correct 
the opinion.  This was not in isolation.  I did have these 
10 
conversation with Mr Moodley.  And that is why I asked him 
for an overall assessment, you see, not just an opinion.  
And that is why he attached all those opinions to the 
assessment that he gave me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Now did you engage with 
Mr Bester having regard to this opinions, Ms Daniels?  
Because I saw the first one was addressed to him. 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Bester was not at that time Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, he had already left? 
20 
MS DANIELS:   He had already left. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
And 
Mr Selanka/Selanko(?) 
or 
Advocate Solanka.   
MS DANIELS:   We did not get a chance to talk about the 
Optimum arbitration in this detail.  And basically what I had 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 263 of 319 
 
to do was, you know, ask...  CDH was the Primary Energy 
advisor and I had to ask them.  The legal advisor that was 
involved in the matter had also left Eskom.  So it was 
having to go back and ask the external advisor to provide 
me with the issues and then compare it to what we had.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you were saying Mr Koko was 
expressing the view that a settlement – he will be happy 
with a settlement of R 500 million.  Did you, apart from 
saying:  Well, we have already made a song and dance 
about R 2.1 billion, did you have any specific amount in 
10 
mind? 
MS DANIELS:   No, not at that stage.  I, as I said, I have 
not read all the opinions yet and I have not familiarised 
with the depths of the issue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MS DANIELS:   My issue were more from a corporate 
perspective that we had gone out, we had said we were 
going to do this and you know, this about-turn, you know, it 
just want not good from a corporate perspective. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was this the first time that he 
20 
expressed a view of a settlement at R 500 million? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, this was the first time that he had 
expressed it to me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Are you able to move onto the 
fifth or the fourth opinion?  We know that ...[intervenes]  
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 264 of 319 
 
MS DANIELS:   So ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   We know that you, ultimately, 
approaches BTC, that meeting I referred you to on the 
8 t h of February 2017.  Mr Moodley was also there.  Is it you 
and him or just him who took the BTC through the issues 
that had been raised in their memo? 
MS DANIELS:   I was at the meeting, Mr Joubert.  But I 
had asked him specifically to come because of his 
involvement in the matter as Eskom’s legal representative.  
By that time, I had now the opportunity to go through all 
10 
the issues, discussed it with him.  The arbitration, I think 
had – we had initiated it again.   
 
But given all these issues – and I like I said that 
I was not, you know, I was not comfortable going ahead.  
We know had – we did not have any witnesses, physical 
witnesses at this point in time.   
 
You know, the proof of the claim was now here.  
How do we prove this?  And we had a change in attitude by 
the executives and you know I was not comfortable making 
that decision on my own.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What was the decision? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, to settle the matter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  So that was discussed at this 
BTC meeting on the 8 t h of February 2017? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I wanted a specific mandate, if that 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 265 of 319 
 
was to be the case, to then settle.  Because the settlement 
– 
I 
think 
the 
attorneys 
for 
Optimum 
did 
initiate 
a 
settlement. 
 
And 
when 
they 
got 
to 
the 
settlement 
discussions and when we got to the arbitration, the 
arbitrator also asked as a standard practice with the 
parties concerning to settling the matter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  Was BTC the right committee in 
regard to this issue?  Because BTC was kind of pushing 
you back, saying this is not a procurement matter.  It is a 
litigation matter.  Why are you asking for our approval? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are at twenty to seven Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I just want you to be aware.  I think 
we have been on penalties for, what, close to two hours? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair.  It is the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but do what you need to do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As long as you are aware of the time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Let us beat the seven o’clock 
time, Ms Daniels.  [laughs] 
20 
MS DANIELS:   [laughs]  We are almost done Mr Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, we are almost done. 
MS DANIELS:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’, h’m.  [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So just ...[intervenes]  
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 266 of 319 
 
MS DANIELS:   Uhm ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Seleka, in my experience in Eskom, 
whenever we had issues relating to contractual matters, 
you know, that is the committee that we went to.  I know 
you have asked me this question and one would have to 
look at it but in my – in the practise in Eskom that is the 
committee that I went – that we went to and that is why I 
said that we should go there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is a last opinion which is dated 
10 
10 March 2017.  Was that opinion given as a result of what 
was discussed at BTC?  It is on page 1074. 
MS DANIELS:   1074, ja.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   And that would be the last opinion 
...[indistinct]  
MS DANIELS:   Yes.  At the BTC meeting, I was given the 
mandate to settle and they also added that no less than 
R 500 million.  And what this opinion that I asked for, was 
a consolidation of – and you will see it is written for the 
purposes of settlement because I wanted one point of 
20 
reference with the issues in terms of we had now gone 
through a series of discussions with Optimum.   
 
There were a couple of issues that they raised in 
terms of the calculation of the penalties which had caused 
a to-and-fro Mr Chairman.  And also, in that calculation, 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 267 of 319 
 
Eskom picked up further errors that it made.  So, you 
know, that was another issue.   
 
But the fundamentals were still the same when it 
came to the issues.  Eskom only had to comply with the 
contractual provisions in terms of notices, still at this 
point.  We still needed to rectify Clause 3.6 and we still 
had the issue of the integrity of the sampling process.   
 
So the issues, really, had not changed.  In 
addition to the financial calculations, we then put together 
all of that information into one document and this is the 
10 
combination of that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And there is another aspect I see from 
there which I do not know whether you have mentioned.  
The 
double 
charging 
of 
R 158 million 
for 
the 
period 
...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Oh, yes.  Yes.  My apology.  That was in 
terms of the financial calculations.  This R 158 million had 
already been deducted in 2012.  In the first period, 2012 to 
2014. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  So the amount at which a 
20 
settlement 
was 
arrived 
at 
was 
actually 
less 
than 
R 577 million. 
 
It 
became 
R 419 million 
with 
further 
deductions to that amount and we got – you dropped it 
down to R 255 million.  Chair, you will find that on page 
1080 and 1081 of this last opinion.   
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 268 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   1080 and 1081.  And even of the 
R 255 million, Tegeta did not pay the full amount.  You 
...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   That I have to know... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
MS DANIELS:   ...did not pay the full amount.  [Speaker 
not clear.] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   ...the main interactions to the Commission. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You came to know when? 
MS DANIELS:   With my interactions with the Commission 
because I was not aware that they did not pay the full 
amount. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Alright.  You ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   The R 255 million.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   I was – I, effectively, left Eskom in 
October 2017. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  You were part of the Settlement 
20 
Team, Ms Daniels ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...within Eskom.  I see from the 
settlement that Tegeta was given 20-months to make this 
payment of R 255 million.  Why was that – why was that 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 269 of 319 
 
leniency afforded to them? 
MS DANIELS:   I think it was over the period of the 
contract Mr Chairman.  There was also the additional 
hardship claim that they were instituting and I think there 
was another – there was another issue outside of the 
arbitration. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, I do not understand when you 
say that period of repayment was in relation to the 
agreement.  What do you mean? 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because the settlement stood on its 
own.  It is an agreement on its own.  Why could they not 
pay this amount in two months? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, they had instituted a hardship claim 
at the same time, separate from the arbitration. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, which is separate from that. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So...  I also do not understand.  Why do 
you give them so much time after you have reduced the 
amount, the claim so much?  Why do you give them almost 
20 
two years? 
MS DANIELS:   So Mr Chairman, I am actually not sure.  I 
must be honest.  I am not sure.  I cannot... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 270 of 319 
 
MS DANIELS:   I could not find the reason in the 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean, that is ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   ...the documentation that I have.  I must 
be...  I...  
CHAIRPERSON:   It is quite strange ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   To be quite honest. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have a situation where, as far as 
this claim was concerned, when the claim was against OCM 
under Glencore, there was a very rigid attitude to say:  We 
10 
are pursuing this claim.  You have to pay.  And Mr Molefe 
has admitted here that that was his attitude. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then now, when the claim is against 
OCM under Tegeta, suddenly the attitude is:  We can 
reduce the claim from R 2.1 billion up to – is it two-
hundred and something million? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   R 255 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   R 255 million.  Even that R 255 million, 
we give you close to two years to pay.  It is such a 
20 
different 
attitude 
compared 
to 
the 
attitude 
displayed 
towards Glencore.  I guess you accept that? 
MS DANIELS:   No, I agree with you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS DANIELS:   And that is why...  I mean, you know, this 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 271 of 319 
 
was – if you look at all this history objectively, we ought to 
have settled way back, whether – even with Glencore. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   You know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...what reason would you advance why 
you did not settle with Glencore? 
MS DANIELS:   It was the... the tone of the executives at 
the time, Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was because of the executives? 
MS DANIELS:   Ja.  This is, ultimately, an executive 
10 
decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay ...[intervenes]  
MS 
DANIELS: 
 
 
Notwithstanding 
the 
legal 
advice 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But was the ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...was the legal advice the same 
...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   ...receiving the claim.  [Distortion present 
in transmission – speaker unclear.] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was the legal advice the same under 
both periods, the period – the Glencore period and the 
Tegeta period?  Was the legal advice to the executives the 
same? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 272 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Namely ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   You will see, that is why we went through 
the opinions.  The same themes, the – you know, the 
issues just got a little bit more crystallised ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   ...as time went by but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, I see ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   ...but quite fundamentally the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I see the external legal advice.  I am 
talking about the internal legal advice.  Do you know what 
10 
the internal legal advice was from the legal people within 
Eskom to the executives? 
MS DANIELS:   I am not sure ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to this case? 
MS DANIELS:   The bulk of that one meeting where I was 
present with Mr Selanka/Selanko(?)  You would have to ask 
him about how he dealt with it.  My reliance was on the 
external advice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS DANIELS:   Because that had been the only consistent 
20 
presence throughout this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS DANIELS:   In find the energy to staff change.  You 
know, in the legal department the staff changed.  So the – 
but the constant for this period under discussion was Cliff 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 273 of 319 
 
Decker Hofmeyr.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Apart from the Group CEO at the time 
when the Group CEO was Mr Brian Molefe, which other 
executives were involved in this matter and would have 
been aware of the external legal advice and would have 
been – would have had an influence on what attitude 
should be adopted by Eskom? 
MS DANIELS:   During the period 2013 to twenty...  Well, 
10 
up until 2016, Mr Koko was Head of Group Technology and 
Commercial. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS DANIELS:   And miss...  Primary Energy fell under his 
watch.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   So he would have been aware.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS DANIELS:   There actually was..   CDH actually 
addressed such an opinion to him on, you know, the 
20 
implications of business rescue on the Optimum contract.  
So he would have been aware.   
 
And in my time, there was a Head of Primary 
Energy, 
Mr 
Chair, 
during 
2013/2014 
and 
that 
was 
Ms Carrim Maraj but she would have reported to Mr Koko. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 274 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
MS DANIELS:   In 2015, he was still in charge and then he 
became Head of Generation.  Coal issues would have been 
important to him because he would have been the recipient 
of the coal as the power station side of things  So he was 
the constant there.  In – when I took over, I was – my 
direct report – I had to report directly to Mr Singh as the 
Chief Financial Officer and then also to Mr Koko as the 
acting Group Chief Executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Daniels...  
Chair, I am going...  I think we have covered the penalties.  
You know, they end up with that settlement, the payment 
which is listed under the settlement amount.  Tegeta has 
still been given a temporary relief where the penalties are 
waived for a period of over 12-months until they go into 
business rescue in February 2018. 
 
Ms Daniels, the – I want to turn my attention to 
that issue of McKinsey and Trillian.  Chair, it relates to the 
meeting – the legal review which was required to be 
20 
obtained pursuant to that Oliver Wyman report.  They said 
you can pay this amount but, really, I am not given you a 
legal opinion.  You must ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I remember that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  You must obtain your own legal 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 275 of 319 
 
review. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Daniels and Mr Prish Naidoo - 
Govender.  Prish Govender were engaging CDH to get that 
legal 
review 
but 
they 
came 
to 
the 
BTC 
on 
the 
13 t h of December 2016 without having obtained that legal 
review.  But the submission to BTC, Ms Daniels, had a 
paragraph that conveyed the message that CDH had been 
retained to essentially provide the legal review and that it 
had advised that you could settle the matter and pay 
10 
McKinsey and Trillian, and at that stage it was specifically 
Trillian, the R 134 million.   
 
Now Mr Moodley said, by that stage, he had not 
given the legal review.  And the question to you was 
whether, did you tell the BTC that you had not obtained a 
legal review?   
 
Now your answer to me was in the affirmative, 
that you did tell the BTC you have not obtained the legal 
review but I have listened to the audio of that meeting and 
it shows otherwise.  It show that you, in fact, told the BTC 
20 
that you have obtained the legal review.   
 
Your comment on that?  I have also made you 
listened to that audio. 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chair, I do have correct my response to 
Mr Seleka.  Mr Seleka, is correct.  He had me listened to 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 276 of 319 
 
that tape.  I was obviously wrong in my recollection of the 
events of that day.  What I did say and it is clear from the 
audio that the legal opinion was to be obtained in respect 
of future payments. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...in respect of the 134 million.  Well, 
in respect …[intervenes] 
MS DANIELS:   Not in respect of the 134 million. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, in respect of the 134 million you 
told them that you have received a legal review from CDH 
which was incorrect. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   I was incorrect, that is what it sounds like 
but that was not the intended message but I accept having 
listened to it with Mr Seleka that that is how it sounds, so I 
do have to correct that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Chair …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I did not listen to the audio.  Did you say 
to – is it the BTC? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   BTC, yes. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say to the BTC you had obtained 
20 
an opinion, a legal opinion in circumstances where you had 
not obtained any such opinion? 
MS DANIELS:   Well, my intention was actually to say that 
I had briefed the attorneys but from the language that was 
used and I listened to it a number of times, it does sound, 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 277 of 319 
 
like I said, I have the legal opinion and that is why I am 
saying it was incorrect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you cannot make that mistake, 
can you?  If you want to say you have instructed attorneys 
or you briefed lawyers to obtain an opinion, you cannot say 
I have obtained an opinion.  You cannot make that mistake, 
is it not? 
MS DANIELS:   I did not use the word I have obtained, Mr 
Chair, I said I got but listening to it, that is what – listening 
to it now and objectively listening to it …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what did you say?  Just tell me what 
you said? 
MS DANIELS:   I got the attorneys to do an opinion but 
that does not – that is not clear at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I am sorry, if you said you got 
attorneys to do an opinion, it depends what else you said.  
Did you create the impression to say the least to the BTC 
that an opinion had been provided to you, when you listen 
to the …[intervenes] 
MS DANIELS:   When I listen to …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   …to the tape, is that what you in effect 
say to the BTC? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, Mr Chair, and that is why I am saying 
that was not what I was intending to but if you listen to the 
tape that is what it sounds like and I have to …[intervenes] 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 278 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it what it sounds like or it is what you 
said, what you say in the tape? 
MS DANIELS:   It is what I said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but my question is, how can you 
make that mistake?  I mean, if you ask for an opinion from 
lawyers and you have not received it, there is no way you 
can say you have got it because if you have got it you 
probably have read it and you would know what it says.  If 
you say you have got it and you do not have it, it must 
mean you intended to misrepresent the position. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, I cannot – I will say that I did 
not intend to misrepresent. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But how did it come about? 
MS DANIELS:   But if I listen to it now that you could draw 
that conclusion and that is why I am saying, you know, I 
made a mistake there.  It was not how I intended to convey 
it.  But, you know, it is in the past and I can only say I am 
sorry, you know, it did – and from – if I listen to it 
objectively now, it creates the gap for that payment but 
that was not my intention at the time, you know, there was 
20 
not a deliberate intention to misrepresent. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What as the context of that statement in 
terms of the discussion?  What was the context, why was it 
necessary to tell the BTC about the opinion? 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 279 of 319 
 
MS DANIELS:   We were talking about the audit opinions, 
Oliver Wyman opinion and the legal opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Continue?  Just tell me the context of 
the statement?  Somebody said something and somebody 
said something until it came to a point where you made 
that point.  That is what I would like to hear. 
MS DANIELS:   Okay.  So the discussion was around the – 
I think it was Mr – the Chairman of the BTC made certain 
comments about a settlement agreement, etcetera, at the 
stage of …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   What did you say about it because I take 
it you listened to – you recently listened to the audio, so 
you – have got it there? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I am sorry, I think Mr Seleka 
wants to play it for me.  Okay? 
RECORDING PLAYED TO THE COMMISSION 
CHAIRPERSON:   I cannot hear properly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I can email – let me email it to them, 
Chair.  There is the sound issue. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, then they will play it from there?  
Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  But maybe Ms Daniels can 
explain the context in the meantime. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 280 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, while they are sorting it out.  Are you 
able to tell me the context, Ms Daniels? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chair, what the Chairman was talking 
about, he was giving the history of McKinsey and I cannot 
– there is a – he then asked – I cannot remember what the 
question was, you will hear it from the tape, but what I said 
was, there was an audit opinion, there was the Hon Wyman 
opinion and I had got an opinion from CDH. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did you tell them what the opinion 
was about and what it said? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   And then I said that there was – the 
opinion was going to be on the future payments.  In 
respect of the 134 million – I must just look at my notes.  I 
think I used – you will have to listen to the tape but it was 
around the 134 million and then I said that the CDH 
opinion would be in respect of the future payments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did you tell the BTC what the opinion 
was saying about the – is the 34 million? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   134. 
MS DANIELS:   The 134 million. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, did you tell the BTC what your legal 
opinion said that you said you had obtained or received or 
got? 
MS DANIELS:   I do not think I said it out – you can hear 
on the tape, I think it was – I said it was payable but I do 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 281 of 319 
 
not think it was in respect of legal opinion, I just need to 
listen to it again.  We listened to it, I think it was 
yesterday, Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka, what is your 
recollection of what emerges from the audio, from the tape 
in terms of… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What she said about the opinion, about 
the 134 million? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Ms Daniels did not specify what 
10 
the opinion says.  What she says is – Oliver Wyman did the 
financial assessment so in respect of the claim that 
McKinsey and Trillian has.  Oliver Wyman did the financial 
assessment, an internal audit was done by Molefe and 
Company and then I got – she says: 
“I got Cliffe Dekker to give us legal review.” 
Then she says something – it is not clear what she is 
saying but effectively in respect of the payment sought to 
be approved and she goes on to say: 
“And for the remainder…” 
20 
Which is the remainder of the amount. 
“…we will get a legal opinion on how we deal with 
that to protect ourselves.” 
But the details of the opinion are not given.  But the 
paragraph 
in 
the 
submission, 
Chair, 
drives 
the 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 282 of 319 
 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the submission that was given to the 
BTC. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The BTC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There it is very clear that what is 
conveyed is that Cliffe Dekker have been retained to give 
advice that Eskom can settle with McKinsey and Trillian 
and pay the settlement amount and it will avoid further 
claims.  So this becomes the basis on which BTC approves 
10 
the payment of 134 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Is there anything that was said 
about the legal opinion that may have influenced BTC to 
settle in terms of the context of the discussion? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That submission …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, in terms of the submission and/or 
the discussion in the tape. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, what  - you hear Mr Zethembe 
20 
Khoza saying we have obtain external legal opinion, they 
have checked the contract, Delloites have looked at the 
figure, Deloitte have recommended payment now of a 
figure and payment in the future of another figure.  So, you 
know, that says, okay, the lawyers have looked it, the 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 283 of 319 
 
accountants have looked at it and this is the figure we 
have to pay now, other figures will be paid in the future. 
 
The closest you get what the lawyers are allegedly 
saying, it is in the submission, paragraph 8 in the 
submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and that says? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That says that they essentially they 
are advising that you settle with McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Pay them the amounts so that you 
10 
avoid future claims. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
yes, 
yes. 
 
Okay 
and 
that 
submission had been prepared by Ms Daniels or by 
somebody else? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Daniels, who prepared the 
submission? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you recall? 
MS 
DANIELS: 
 
 
Mr 
Prish 
Govender 
prepared 
the 
submission, Mr Chairman.  As I had indicated at the 
previous occasion, that was done in anticipation that it 
20 
would have been completed but by the time we got to the 
meeting is was not completed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  But wait, he did not – is this is not 
the submission that you also signed? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I did sign it. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 284 of 319 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is this the very submission that Mr 
Koko says he refused to sign? 
MS DANIELS:   Oh, no, no, no, sorry, those are two 
different things, Mr Seleka, Mr Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, but let us concentrate on this 
one. 
MS DANIELS:   Those are two different things. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let us concentrate on this one.  Who 
signed this one? 
MS DANIELS:   This was signed by Mr Govender and I 
10 
think Mr Singh and Mr Mabalane. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, you did not sign it? 
MS DANIELS:   No, I did not sign this one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So you were mistaken earlier when you 
said you signed it or were talking about …[intervenes] 
MS DANIELS:   No, I was talking about …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The other one. 
MS DANIELS:   The letter that we spoke about, Mr 
Chairman. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MS DANIELS:   But in terms of this December submission I 
did not sign it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you have any input in it even if you 
did not sign it? 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 285 of 319 
 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, as I said that that clause in respect of 
the legal review, as I testified earlier, that was done in 
anticipation that it would be completed but it was not 
completed by the time we got to the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is the clause that says what? 
MS DANIELS:   Is it okay if you can just give the page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is quoted in Mr Moodley’s affidavit, 
Chair.  I recall he quoted because he complains about that 
aspect.  It is page 943 of the same Eskom bundle 14(d). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, just go ahead and read. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It reads under paragraph 96, he 
quotes, 8: 
“External legal review” 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, you said 9…? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   943. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   943 says: 
“Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr…” 
This is clause 8. 
“Was retained to conduct a review and a conclusion 
20 
is that Eskom needs to enter into a termination 
agreement with the parties to bring the matter to 
finality.  This will absolve Eskom from any further 
liability once the termination agreement is in place.” 
It is quote under paragraph 96. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 286 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Yes, okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the [indistinct – dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And this was provided on the 12 
December 2016, this external legal review. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The review, Chair, the review was not 
granted. 
MS DANIELS:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was not given at that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, that is when – okay, no, I can see. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, what Mr Moodley is saying here is 
10 
they are busy drafting the submission internally in Eskom, 
he gets the submission on the 12 December and he sees 
this paragraph 8 inserted in the draft document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And it should not be there because he 
has not given a legal review or legal opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So he says then he raised the 
issue with Ms Daniels that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, this is the clause that you said 
20 
makes it clear in the submission. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, certainly, Ms Daniels, here this 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 287 of 319 
 
clause was saying that Cliffe Dekker has given an opinion 
to the effect that Eskom should enter into a termination 
agreement to bring the matter to finality and that was 
factually not correct, is that right? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct, Mr Chairman, and that is 
why I said, you know, the last time that I had done that in 
contemplation that it would be completed but it was not by 
the time we got to the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But how would you have known what 
conclusion Cliffe Dekker would reach?  You ask Cliffe 
10 
Dekker to give you an opinion, if you have not received the 
opinion you cannot know what conclusion they will reach, 
is it not? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and therefore you cannot say to the 
BTC what their conclusion is going to be on the basis that 
you expected or you cannot – your explanation cannot be 
that I expected that their opinion would have arrived 
because even if you expected their opinion would have 
arrived by the time of the BTC you would not know what 
20 
their opinion would be.  So you could not start telling – 
preparing a memo that says what the opinion is.  If you 
wanted to say anything, you might say I have asked for an 
opinion, I have not got it, but my view is that it is likely to 
say blah, blah, blah, blah but you cannot begin to say what 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 288 of 319 
 
that 
conclusion 
will 
be 
and 
here 
you 
say 
and 
the 
conclusion is that Eskom needs to enter into a termination 
agreement.   
 
So, in other words, what I am putting to you is 
when you say to me that you put in this clause in the 
submission on the basis that you thought by the time the 
BTC said the opinion from Cliffe Dekker would have 
arrived, I am saying that that is not convincing to me 
because you have asked them for an opinion but you do 
not know what opinion they will give you therefore you 
10 
cannot tell the BTC what the opinion says or will say.  
What do you say to that? 
MS DANIELS:   I accept that, Mr Chairman, I should have 
made it – I should have said it differently. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it goes beyond that – it gives the 
impression 
that 
you 
may 
be 
deliberately 
sought 
to 
misrepresent the position to the BTC because for the 
reason that I have just been giving you that if I asked you 
for an opinion, until I get that opinion, I do not know what 
you would say and therefore I cannot start telling -  I 
20 
cannot say to Mr Seleka you have reached this conclusion, 
I cannot say before I get it what you will say, I will have 
wait until then.  Ca you - you understand? 
MS DANIELS:   I understand what you are saying Mr 
Chairman and I do accept it.  I mean now looking at it in 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 289 of 319 
 
the cold, hard, objective light, I do realise that it was not – 
it did not come across as I had intended it to and I do 
accept responsibility for that and I do apologise for that.  
There was no deliberate intention in my part to mislead 
anybody.  You know, I – but having listened to both the 
audio, you know, and also reading it and your questioning 
now and Mr Seleka’s questioning, I do accept that and I do 
apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You see, Dr Khoza who comes before 
10 
Ms Daniels in the audio talks along the same lines, Ms 
Daniels, about the legal review or a legal opinion being 
obtained.  Well, let me say this also because your 
statement to the BTC went further to say that in regard to 
the remainder we will get a legal opinion.  But you know 
the remainder which is the amount that was yet to be paid, 
those amounts were paid even again before the legal 
opinion was obtained.  That legal opinion was received on 
the 17 April 2017 and finally on the 28 t h – did I say April?  
Sorry, February. 
20 
MS DANIELS:   February. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then the final one on the 28 
February, payments to Trillian and McKinsey had already 
been paid, payment. 
MS DANIELS:   But you will remember that that instruction 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 290 of 319 
 
was provided to – settle by Mr Govender directly to CDH to 
settle and the – I think the invoices were signed off by Mr 
Govender and Mr Mabalane around about the 14 t h, so they 
did not wait for the legal opinion to come in. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, that is another problem is it not? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, it is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So Mr Salim Essa’s company was paid 
without Eskom having obtained a legal opinion that it 
should not pay which is what the opinion ultimately alluded 
to. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct and he – well, the opinion 
went further than that and said that Eskom should not have 
paid in its entirety. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Ms Daniels, this clause and what 
your evidence is about, how it came about, troubles me.  
As we speak, is your position that with the questioning that 
has happened you will still maintain that you did not intend 
to say to the BTC Cliffe Dekker had concluded in the way 
that the clause says or do you accept that you did intend to 
convey that to the BTC?   
20 
 
I ask that because you did say earlier on your take 
responsibility, I think, for the clause and I did say earlier 
on that it seems to difficult for me to accept that you could 
say – you could write that Cliffe Dekker had concluded that 
Eskom needed to enter into a termination agreement 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 291 of 319 
 
without intending to convey that to BTC, the BTC.   
 
So I just want to let you tell me once again where 
you stand about it.  Do you still say you did not intend to 
convey that or do you say look, I accept that that is what I 
intended? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, I think I want to answer it 
this way.  I accept I should not have said that, okay?  I 
accept that it is – on the – as it says there, it is deliberate.  
All I am saying to you is from my perspective there was no 
intention to mislead.  I should have looked at it more 
10 
closer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, thank you, I have reached the end. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I know Ms Daniels wanted to give you 
evidence and on certain things but we are now nearly at 
half past seven. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I wanted to finish with her 
evidence today.  What were the other matters?  I know 
there is the issue of the pre-suspension letters. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, she wants to address you on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, was there – is there something else 
other than that?  From your side you are done, it is just 
that she wants to? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 292 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or did you not want to – okay, let us talk 
about those pre-suspension letters, Ms Daniels. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think Mr Khoza, Mr Zethembe Khoza 
when he testified before the Commission said that those 
pre-suspension letters had properties which suggested that 
they were in your computer on the 10 March 2015 as well 
as in Mr Salim Essa’s computer on the same day.  I am 
sure you heard about that, that part of his evidence.  What 
do you say about that? 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, I just want to repeat that it 
was – it was a template that was created by me, not the 
suspension letters but it was an Eskom letterhead template 
and that was to generate those letters.  I do not accept, I 
reject what Mr Khoza says in terms of the fact that I 
worked with Mr Essa on those letters.  At the time of the 
creation of those letters, I was actually in Pretoria, in the 
face to face discussion at my home with Mr Marokane.  
 
Telling him what had happened on the, earlier that 
afternoon.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The, those suspension letters that Mr 
Khoza was referring to, do we have them in one of the 
bundles here or not?   
ADV SELEKA SC:  The ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  The ones he was talking about. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 293 of 319 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because if they are, if we have got them 
I would like to see them, because I want to see whether 
they are just templates or they have got information 
relating to the individuals who were suspended on the 11 t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The pre-suspension letters? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, that Mr Khoza refers to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  They have the, they are individualised.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  They have Mr Mathona and Mr 
10 
Maropane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  And they have information pertaining to 
them.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is the metadata ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which then shows who is the author 
20 
and who is the last [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  I do not, I know we have 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 294 of 319 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Put those questions here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But I do not think we have a file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no I do not need to see them 
because what you have told me, is enough. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Now, so you say Ms Daniels, you know 
when they were created, those letters and at the time that 
they were created, you were not at Eskom, you were rather 
you said you were in Pretoria.  Okay.  Now no, I am I do 
10 
not know a lot about technology, but in terms of when they 
were created, is that what you see from the letters 
themselves, properties, the metadata, or whatever?   
MS DANIELS:  Yes, Mr Chairman and that is why I can tell 
you because I think it says, I do not remember exactly the 
time, but it said 16H38 PM, and this is from the metadata.  
Like you I have learnt a lot about, only learnt about it 
through this process.  
 
It says and also when you create a template, the 
creator would also be myself.  That could also be when I 
20 
created the template, you would see it is created by 
Susanne Daniels and you know, then people can change it, 
but I looked at the timing of the creation of those letters 
and at that time, I was speaking to Mr Marokane face to 
face.   
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 295 of 319 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  They have been created from your 
desktop and not from your laptop? 
MS DANIELS:  When I created those letterhead templates, 
they were stored on my Eskom computer.  So at that stage 
I think I had a laptop.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but what I am suggesting is if they 
were created in your laptop, the fact you say you were in 
Pretoria with somebody might not have any significance, 
because you could have created them where ever you were 
if it was a laptop, but if they were created on the desktop 
10 
and you say you were not at Eskom at that time, that might 
have prudence.  
MS DANIELS:  Well, what I am saying to you Mr Chairman, 
is that I could not possibly have been on my laptop either 
at that time because I was face to face with, in a 
conversation with Mr Marokane and that conversation 
lasted quite a while. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About how long?  An hour, two hours? 
MS DANIELS:  He was, I think he was at my house for 
about an hour or more. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and the time when they were 
created fell within that period? 
MS DANIELS:  Within that period, Mr Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but in terms of whether it was, they 
were created in the laptop or on the desktop, is there 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 296 of 319 
 
clarity on that? 
MS DANIELS:  I do not think you, I do not think you can 
get that from the documentation.  I you know, do not have 
them and from what I can see from the forensic, Mr Seleka 
gave me Ms Stein’s affidavit as well, and her forensic 
investigators 
confirm 
that 
it 
was 
from 
a 
letterhead 
template.   
 
So you know, that is the best.  I am not a forensic 
scientist, so ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MS DANIELS:  We will have to wait for that, but from what 
I am saying to you is at the time of the creation of those 
letters, from what I see, I was not physically with Mr Essa 
or working with him because I was actually talking, relaying 
the events to Mr Marokane face to face at my house.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you say the time was half past 
six on the 10 t h of March? 
MS DANIELS:  I think it was, it says 16H38 or 16H40 on 
those letters and that was the time that Mr Marokane and I 
were in conversation. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is PM? 
MS DANIELS:  PM, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and you say you would have had, so 
you are not, is the position that what is important is that 
you were busy with somebody as opposed to being away 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 297 of 319 
 
from Eskom?  That is important.  
MS DANIELS:  Yes, I think just, you know I mean as we 
know these documents can be done anywhere.  What I am 
saying is physically I was face to face with Mr Marokane, 
and he can tell you that at no stage did I step out to go 
and do something.  
 
I was telling him what had happened that day.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, is that when according to your 
evidence you told him about your meeting with Mr Koko 
and with Mr Salim Essa? 
10 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Essa, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS DANIELS:  So I could not be drafting suspension 
letters or pre-suspension letters with Mr Essa when I am 
talking to Mr Marokane about what happened earlier that 
day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Now Mr Seleka, is there 
anything else about these suspension letters that you think 
needs to be clarified?  I know that more investigation must 
be done.   
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  That is right and we are nearly at the 
end Chair of that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  So it may be that she might be asked in 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 298 of 319 
 
due course to comment once the investigation has been 
completed? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay alright.  Can I go back to the 
issue of your meeting with Mr Koko and Mr Salim Essa, 
which is your version on the 10 t h of March.  On that day 
was it your first occasion to go to those offices where you 
met Mr Koko and Mr Salim Essa? 
WITNESS:  Yes, Mr Chairman that was the first time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you subsequently ever go to those 
10 
offices after 10 March at any stage before ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:  Not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you gave evidence before the 
commission? 
MS DANIELS:  Not at those offices.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Not to, but to the even if the company 
had left, but to that spot.  Did you ever go there 
...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:  No, not to that spot.  The Trillian offices 
then moved ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS DANIELS:  About a block ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, now ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:  Forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is your evidence that therefore maybe 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 299 of 319 
 
between 10 March, before 10 March you say you had never 
been to those offices?   
MS DANIELS:  No, I have not been to those offices.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And since then and during the time when 
you have been giving evidence from time to time to the 
commission, have you gone there again to identify where 
the offices were where you met them or have you not? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes, I have Mr Chairman.  I have been with 
the investigating team to show them where it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, have you signed an affidavit after 
10 
that to say what happened when you went there to identify 
the place or not yet? 
MS DANIELS:  I have not been asked to do that, but I am 
happy to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But were you able to remember where the 
offices were where that meeting was held when you sent 
again? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, are there any features that 
made you remember?   
20 
MS DANIELS:  Hm ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Or anything that made you remember I 
mean so many years after, if you did not go there again in 
2015, 2016, 2017. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, but she, sorry ...[intervenes]  
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 300 of 319 
 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chairman, that the offices are fairly 
standard from the outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MS DANIELS:  The feature was that it was quite close to 
the entrance and you know, I could remember that.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MS DANIELS:  And I mean, that was such a what is the 
word? 
CHAIRPERSON:  And, so ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:  It was such a life changing moment, you 
10 
know ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MS DANIELS:  In the course of the last couple of years.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you recognise ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:  That it is actually very difficult to forget. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you recognise the place where the 
offices were in the building without anybody’s assistance? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes.  I did.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Seleka, you wanted to say 
something?   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Ms Daniels I remember from your 
affidavit that there was another occasion  you say Mr Koko 
drove with you to these offices.  He went into a board room 
with Mr Salim Essa and left you at the reception area.  Was 
that before or after the 10 t h of March 2015? 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 301 of 319 
 
MS DANIELS:  That was after the 10 t h of March Mr 
Chairman, but then they had moved to another office.  That 
is why I am saying that office was a block away.  I 
understood Mr Chairman asking me had I been back to 
that, the 10 t h of March office.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, so the occasion that Mr Seleka refers 
to which is a different occasion from the occasion of the 
10 t h of March, you went with Mr Koko to different offices, 
but where he went to see Mr Salim Essa. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes, that is correct Mr Chair and it was still 
10 
at Melrose Arch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, in the same building or a different 
building? 
MS DANIELS:  A different building. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  And then there was on a Saturday when 
Mr Essa gave you a telephone call and asked you to come 
and meet with him at Melrose Arch.  Was that meeting at a 
different place in Melrose Arch or the same place? 
MS DANIELS:  That was at a different place.  We met at 
20 
the African Pride Hotel, the reception there and then we 
walked to what, it was an apartment block. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the, is that the one where there 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 302 of 319 
 
were other people? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes Mr Chair, that is where I saw Mr AJ 
Gupta and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS DANIELS:  And Ms Duduzeni Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MS DANIELS:  And ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I remember you testifying about that.  
MS DANIELS:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  The, I know the pre-suspension 
10 
letters we had touched on that on I think the second or the 
third occasion when she appeared.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But I did want to, I did want to come 
back to it once we have the expert affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no that is fine.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which we will in any event have to 
come back to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I guess depending on what the 
expert says, ja.  Okay, alright.  Other than what you have 
20 
been able to say now Ms Daniels in response to my 
questions about the issue of the, excuse me ... pre-
suspension letters.  
 
Was there something else you wanted to say about 
them? 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 303 of 319 
 
MS DANIELS:  Not specifically Mr Chair.  I think I have 
covered them in my affidavits on my previous testimony.  I 
just wanted to highlight you know, that the new information 
because I checked with Mr Marokane on the times that we 
met.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS DANIELS:  The ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, well we are going to adjourn and 
as I understand the position from Mr Seleka, he is done 
with your evidence except in so far as the first, further 
10 
investigation about the pre-suspension letters might make 
it necessary to call you back or ask for your comment, 
arising out of whatever the further investigation  may 
reveal. 
 
He is done, therefore unless there is something 
else you want to say, I am ready to thank you and then to 
adjourn.  
MS DANIELS:  There was just one other issue that I 
wanted to bring to your attention Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
20 
MS DANIELS:  It is in my affidavit, but I just wanted to 
raise it with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MS DANIELS:  Or just you know, highlight it to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 304 of 319 
 
MS DANIELS:  I have been provided with the affidavit of 
Mr Khoma, Khulani Qoma who was the board spokesperson 
at the time during the tenure.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that Qoma ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:  And ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that Qoma? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright, what is his name? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Khulani. 
10 
MS DANIELS:  That is correct.  That is ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Khulani. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay ja Khulani Khoma, yes.  Khoma 
will be Qoma, is that right? 
MS DANIELS:  And ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, just for the transcribers, yes.  
MS DANIELS:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Continue.  
MS DANIELS:  Okay, so in his affidavit he talks about Mr 
20 
Khoza bragging about he stopped Mr Koko’s suspension.  
This is the suspension in 2017, March 2017.  I just wanted 
to give you context.  That, the event that led to that was 
Minister Brown provided information to Dr Ngobane and I 
go into detail so I am not going to go into it, in my 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 305 of 319 
 
affidavit.  
 
So I am not going to go into too much detail here, 
unless you, you know ask me questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DANIELS:  Minister Brown asked Dr Ngobane to 
investigate a number of companies.  One of them was a 
company that had gotten a tender for two hundred and 
something million and then it had grown to over a billion.  
In that investigation it ended up that was the company that 
Mr Koko’s step daughter then owned and the board 
10 
subsequently instituted an investigation. 
 
At this point in time there were other, in March 2017 
there were other complaints about Mr Koko.  It was 
discussed at a meeting of the people and governance 
committee, and it the committee decided to issue a notice 
to Mr Koko to explain the allegations and give him, you 
know follow a sort of pre-suspension process and in that 
case, in that  instance I did draft the notice of pre-
suspension for Mr Koko.  
 
It was the 1 s t of March 2017.  The meeting 
20 
happened, was scheduled to take place at six o’clock that 
evening.  Members of the board were there, so I drafted 
the notice and we attached the memorandum.  Dr Ngobane, 
the meeting took place.  
 
A long story short, Mr Koko was not suspended at 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 306 of 319 
 
that meeting.  Mr Khoza and this was in Mr Qoma’s 
affidavit.  Mr Khoza explained to Mr Khomo that he stepped 
out of that meeting and phoned  one of the G brothers, 
which we know ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  One of the G brothers? 
MS DANIELS:  One of the G brothers.  This is one of the 
Gupta brothers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who are the G brothers? 
MS DANIELS:  Excuse me? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who are the G brothers? 
10 
MS DANIELS:  The Gupta brothers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that how you call them?   
MS DANIELS:  Well, Mr Khoza called them, he said he 
called one of the G brothers ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, that is what he said?   
MS DANIELS:  That is what he said.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not what you say.   
MS DANIELS:  First of all ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MS DANIELS:  So ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS DANIELS:  So he said he had called one of the G 
brothers.  One of those G brothers called ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or rather that is what Mr Qoma says Mr 
Khoza said? 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 307 of 319 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
MS DANIELS:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS DANIELS:  Sorry for the complication. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MS DANIELS:  But I will, you will understand why I say so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MS DANIELS:  So then one of those G brothers then called 
Minister Brown.  Minister Brown then called Dr Ngobane 
and stopped the suspension on that day.  That is then 
10 
consistent with what happened because Dr Ngobane came 
out of that meeting, handed me back the suspension letter, 
the notice of suspension that I had drafted and said that he 
would explain to me later what needed to happen. 
 
So this was in March 2017.  So you will know that 
Dr Ngobane resigned in June 2017 as Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MS DANIELS:  Mr Khoma and I met with Dr Ngobane, 
because we did not actually, we were for all intents and 
purposes in his office, you know as the company secretary 
20 
and the board spokesperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Both of you? 
MS DANIELS:  And then we met with him to have lunch, 
and Mr Khoma then relayed to him what Mr Khoza had told 
him in my presence.  So it was at that point that Dr 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 308 of 319 
 
Ngobane burst out laughing and said that is exactly what 
happened in the meeting.  
 
He could confirm that Mr Khoza had stepped out of 
the meeting, he had come back.  Dr Ngobane then did get 
a call from Minister Brown and that is why Mr Koko was not 
suspended on that day, because he was instructed to halt 
the suspension.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you ...[intervenes] 
MS DANIELS:  So I just wanted to confirm that what he 
said was actually how he relayed it.  Dr Ngobane did not 
10 
you know, did not express any ... he was just saying yes, 
that is how it happened.  He did not express an opinion on 
that Khoza called the Gupta brothers.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you say in your affidavit you deal 
with what Mr Koko was supposed to be suspended for.  
MS DANIELS:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And well, I assume Mr Koko has been 
giving you affidavits.  So what was he supposed to be 
suspended for?  Why was he supposed to be suspended? 
MS DANIELS:  There were complaints, he had to answer 
20 
about tender manipulation, work place bullying.  He was 
undermining the various tender committees operations, and 
things like that.  There was a detailed memo that was 
attached to the notice of the suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do we have that memo by any chance Mr 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 309 of 319 
 
Seleka, in the bundles? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not in the bundles Chair, it is a matter 
that I do not think the investigators have investigated.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is a matter that deals with the 
intended suspension of Mr Koko in 2017.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well, the only reason I am 
interested in is that you remember that in 2015 Mr Koko 
was the only executive who returned from suspension. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The other executives did not return and 
that seemed to give him the [indistinct] to the extent that 
the others might not have referred to leave, and I am 
wondering 
if 
when 
there 
was 
cause 
for 
him 
to 
be 
suspended, there was intervention.  
 
You see, if the position is that in 2017 he was 
suspended, when he was supposed to be suspended, part 
of the reason why or the reason why he was not suspended 
is because either a Gupta brother intervened or the 
minister intervened, in circumstances where the board 
20 
should have suspended him.  
 
It might have a bearing ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  On whether his return in 2015 might be 
because of any relationship he might have with, he might 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 310 of 319 
 
have had with the Gupta associates, such as Mr Solomon 
is alleged to have been because Mr Abraham Masongo 
have said he called them separate occasions to a meeting 
with himself and Mr Solomon Essa at Melrose Arch on the 
10 t h of March, where they talked about the suspension. 
 
They told him about the suspension, that is Mr 
Salim Essa and Koko.  Told them about the suspensions of 
the executives that were yet to happen and that maybe 
some members of the board did not know anything about it.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now of course he has denied that.  he 
has denied that such meetings took place, but if after I 
have heard all the evidence, if I were to conclude that 
indeed those two meetings did take place, in turn it may ... 
the expression would be did that relationship influence 
anything, how he was treated and so on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So ...[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We can ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  It may be important to collect at least the 
20 
basic facts.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  In relation to that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So but what you were saying Ms Daniels, 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 311 of 319 
 
is you were present at a lunch at which Mr Qoma and Dr 
Ngobane were present, where Mr Qoma mentioned this 
issue which he has dealt with in his affidavit about Mr 
September Khoza, and Dr Ngobane did not deny or 
question that, and instead confirmed that that is what 
happened.  
MS DANIELS:  Yes, that is correct Mr Chair, and I do put 
more 
detail 
in 
my 
affidavit 
but 
that 
is 
the 
correct 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say indeed the board did not 
10 
suspend Mr Koko despite the fact that documents had been 
placed before it which indicated that he should have been 
suspended, is that correct?  Is that what you say? 
MS DANIELS:  That is correct, Mr Chair and I would also 
go further.  There was a unanimous decision by the people 
in governance committees ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MS DANIELS:  To proceed on that day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That he should be suspended.  
MS DANIELS:  That he should be, that suspension 
20 
proceedings should start and that is why I prepared you 
know, the notice to ... the first one is: 
 
“We intend you to suspend you.  You have 48 
hours to respond to these allegations.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I guess there ought to be minutes of 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 312 of 319 
 
that people and governance committee ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   Yes, there are minutes.  There are minutes 
and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MS DANIELS:  The recording is also available.  
CHAIRPERSON:  There is also the recording.  Now you 
said after the meeting Dr Ngobane returned the memo or 
documentation back to you that had been given to him that 
related to the proposed suspension.  Is that right? 
MS DANIELS:  That is correct, Mr Chair.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not attend that board meeting, 
did you? 
MS DANIELS:  No, I was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You had [indistinct] 
MS DANIELS:  I was asked to be on standby but I was not 
asked to record it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MS DANIELS:  But I was not present.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Who would have been the company 
secretary at that time? 
20 
MS DANIELS:  I was the company secretary.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.   
MS DANIELS:  This was just ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Does the company secretary not always 
attend? 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 313 of 319 
 
MS DANIELS:  A meeting of the board members. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, it was an in committee, is it called in 
committee? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes.  Well, ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  When they want to exclude you.  When 
they want to exclude you. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, they just excluded because I was told 
to be there for the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But does there ...[intervenes]  
MS DANIELS:   ...then they told me no. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Isn’t there a legal provision that says 
the Company Secretary should always be there in a Board 
meeting? 
MS DANIELS:   It is not a legal provision Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what is it? 
MS DANIELS:   You know it is not binding ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   What is it? 
MS DANIELS:   It is best practice that you know, that the 
company Secretary should be present. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I have seen something I just do 
20 
not know whether it is a law or an MOI Memorandum of 
Incorporation and I do not know whether it was in regard to 
Eskom or in regard to Transnet or in regard to Denel but I 
seem to think I have seen something that is to the effect 
that the company Secretary should attend or is entitled to 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 314 of 319 
 
attend Board meetings. 
MS DANIELS:   Yeah, I was asked to not attend. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MS DANIELS:   I was asked by Dr Ngubane to be on 
standby but I was not in attendance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you ever see the minutes of that 
meeting afterwards, that Board meeting? 
MS DANIELS:   There were really no Board minutes of that 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or when the company secretary is not 
10 
there, they do not take them, they do not take minutes. 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chair, that became a chat with Mr Koko 
if the evidence of the Board members, you know, they did 
testify 
about 
it 
the 
at 
the 
Parliamentary 
Committee 
because, but it was not then a formal meeting.  They just - 
they gave it to Mr – they did give the memo to Mr Koko to 
then comment on.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But – so you said Dr Ngubane told you 
that he would tell you later what - why they did not 
suspend or did not act in accordance with the memorandum 
20 
that you had given them. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct but he did not get a 
chance, I think circumstances overtook. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he left before he could tell you? 
MS DANIELS:   Yeah, he did not tell me the full but at that 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 315 of 319 
 
lunch, he then confirmed that this is how the events 
unfolded at that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and you left in October 2017, you 
said? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So by the time you left had that matter, 
or had those allegations been further investigated at 
Eskom had anything happened, or nothing ever happened 
on those allegations? 
MS DANIELS:   Mr Chairman, some of the allegations were 
10 
investigated, I am not sure what the outcome what the 
outcome was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, you do not know whether the Board 
might have said, well we are not sure that this issue has 
been looked at properly before we reach this stage of 
asking him, that is Mr Koko to make recommendations why 
he should not be suspended.   
You do not know whether they might have said that 
but based on what Dr Ngubane said at the lunch when Mr 
Gama was there you say the position seems to be that Mr 
20 
Koko was not suspended or that notification was not given 
to him because of the intervention by either the Minister or 
somebody from the Gupta brothers. 
MS DANIELS:   At that point, yes Mr Chair. What did 
happen was the Board did investigate the matter of the 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 316 of 319 
 
impulse, you know, the impulse, that one was investigated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that one of the issues? 
MS DANIELS:  But that was not one of the issues on the 
memo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yeah, okay.  But just to remind me did 
Mr Gama at that lunch meeting, during that lunch did he 
say Mr Zithembe Khoza said he had phoned one Gupta 
brothers about this proposed cause of action against Mr 
Koko and that Gupta brother had phoned the Minister and 
the Minister had phoned Dr Ngubane or did he say Mr 
10 
Khoza said he phoned the Minister and the Minister phoned 
Dr Ngubane? 
MS DANIELS:   No, what he said was at the meeting of the 
2 n d of March, Mr Khoza said to him, this is what - he was in 
the meeting of the 2 n d of March, with the Board members 
and Mr Koko.  Mr Khoza said that he left that meeting, he 
stepped out of that meeting and he called one of the G-
brothers.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MS DANIELS:   To tell them what was happening.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MS DANIELS:   He then came back into the meeting.  It 
was one of those G-brothers who phoned Minister Brown 
and Minister Brown phoned Dr Ngubane in the meeting and 
told him to stop the suspension. 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367

CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright that is fine, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair I wanted to find out from Ms 
Daniels, because I heard her mention there are minutes 
and the audio is available.  So, but here lately, she was 
saying there are no minutes of the Board.  So which 
minutes did you say are available and the audio? 
MS DANIELS:   The minutes of the of the meeting where 
the decision to suspend Mr Koko is available. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, so the meeting to execute the 
decision is the one which does not have minutes. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, it is the minutes of the P&G 
Committee that you say are there, are available which said 
Mr Koko should be suspended.  It is the minutes of the 
meeting of the full Board that you say are not there, is that 
correct? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, Mr Chair the P&G took place at – 
round about lunchtime that day.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DANIELS:   The meeting with Mr Koko took place in the 
20 
evening of the same day.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, it is an evening meeting. 
MS DANIELS:    I have the minutes of the meeting of the 
lunchtime meeting for want of a better word.  I just cannot 
remember what time it was where it was a unanimous 
24 MARCH 2021 – DAY 367 
 
Page 318 of 319 
 
decision to initiate suspension proceedings against Mr 
Koko. 
The meeting of the 6 t h was not a full Board meeting 
of the 6 t h of the – at 6PM that evening but that meeting 
was not minuted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say it was a Board meeting? 
MS DANIELS:   It was Board members, I am not sure how 
many Board members attended that meeting but it was 
definitely Dr Ngubane, Mr Khoza and Ms Klein was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  You say you do have the 
10 
minutes of the P&G meeting, lunch meeting?  
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I do.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You do, okay so, Mr Seleka can get 
those from you.  Okay, no, that is fine, then.  Thank you 
very much, Ms Daniels for availing yourself quite a number 
of times.  We appreciate it.  So as I said, it may be that 
you might still be asked to deal with something arising out 
of the further investigation relating to the pre-suspension 
letters, but other than that, thank you very much. 
MS DANIELS:   You are welcome Mr Chairman. 
20
