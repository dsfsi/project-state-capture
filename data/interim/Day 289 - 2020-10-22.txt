PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 22 OCTOBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON: 
  
Good 
morning 
Mr 
Myburgh, 
good 
morning everybody. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes we are.  Mr Laher is back with us 
this morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV MYBURGH:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Good morning Mr Laher. 
10 
MR LAHER:  Morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
The 
oath 
you 
took 
yesterday 
or 
affirmation will continue to apply today.  You understand? 
MR LAHER:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Good morning Mr Laher. 
MR LAHER:  Morning. 
ADV MYBURGH:  I want to start off by asking you a few 
general questions.  You were a member of the negotiation 
team in relation to both of the transactions involving the 
20 
1064 locomotives and the 100 locomotives.  What did you 
consider your role to be within these negotiating teams? 
MR LAHER:  Chair my role was a support role.  In essence 
we would provide financial support to the chairpersons 
during the negotiations.  We would keep record of the 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 4 of 89 
 
pricing as the different pricing updates were received from 
the bidders over that period of time.  We would provide 
information to the legal team in terms of their contract 
drafting process and to contribute to the negotiations on 
financial related aspects.  The role did not involve making 
any decisions.  We did not have a delegation to make any 
decisions. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Well did you consider yourself simply to 
be a resource to Mr Singh? 
MR LAHER:  Well we were a resource to the negotiating 
10 
team. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Did you consider yourself simply to be a 
resource to Mr Singh? 
MR LAHER:  I would think so ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  You consider that you did not have to 
exercise any judgment? 
MR LAHER:  I would have had to exercise some judgment. 
ADV 
MYBURGH: 
 You 
would 
have 
had 
to 
exercise 
judgment? 
MR LAHER:  Ja. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH:  And act in the best interests of your 
employer? 
MR LAHER:  Correct – correct. 
ADV MYBURGH:  You were not just sitting there with your 
eyes and ears closed? 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 5 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:  No. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So let us then redefine your role. 
MR LAHER:  Right. 
ADV MYBURGH:  What was it? 
MR LAHER:  So to provide financial support and provide 
input throughout the negotiation process.  I think I have 
spelt it out in my statement. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes. 
MR LAHER:  Somewhere. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And if you had concerns to raise them. 
10 
MR LAHER:  Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So when you say you did not make any 
decision 
you 
were 
still 
obliged 
if 
you 
came 
across 
something that did not look right to raise the issue? 
MR LAHER:  Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Which you did. 
MR LAHER:  Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And you were also under an obligation to 
ensure that any query that you had was properly satisfied 
in your mind? 
20 
MR LAHER:  Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH:  That was your role? 
MR LAHER:  Correct ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Did you ever suspect that the award of 
these two tenders was corrupt in any way? 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 6 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:  At that period of time no.  I had no suspicion 
of anything untoward happening. Maybe it was because we 
were so involved in the detail.  Maybe it was because we 
were so involved with – under pressure. I mean it was a 
very 
pressurising 
environment 
we 
were 
dealing 
with 
multiple issues at the same time.  But at that point in time 
no I had no suspicions. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Not the slightest suspicion? 
MR LAHER:  Not that I can recall. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Not the slightest suspicion of any 
10 
irregularities at play? 
MR LAHER:  Not that I can recall. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Despite all the queries that you raised? 
MR LAHER:  Correct.  So no suspicions. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Are you certain about that? 
MR LAHER:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So for example and we will come to the 
detail in a moment.  You were involved in negotiations 
where you had done a reasonable miscalculation of R41 
million. 
20 
MR LAHER:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  You go into the negotiations and offer is 
made of below that – three days later you told Mr Molefe 
has reached an agreement outside of the negotiations at a 
much increased figure.  You did not think that was irregular 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 7 of 89 
 
in any way? 
MR LAHER:  I questioned it as I gave evidence yesterday.  
I did question it with Mr Singh.  So I did the calculation.  
My calculation… 
ADV MYBURGH:  Mr Laher please answer my question?  
Did you think that was irregular or not? 
MR LAHER:  No. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Not? 
MR LAHER:  I received an adequate response from Mr 
Singh. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH:  Well in fact you did not even ask him.  
We will come to your statement in a moment.  You did not 
ask him about that issue.  About the fact that Mr Molefe 
had done a deal outside of the negotiating team. 
MR LAHER:  Well Mr Molefe was part of the steering 
committee and they were the ones making the decisions. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes.  But you did not question that? 
MR LAHER:  Well I questioned why the price was higher 
than the price I calculated which is what is in my 
statement.  And that question was asked to Mr Singh and 
20 
Mr Singh provided an adequate response to me at that 
point in time. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Well we will come to your statement.  
Now with the benefit of hindsight what is your view on 
irregularities? 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 8 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:  So from what I have heard and what I have 
seen in the media and what I have seen happening at the 
commission I mean there have been witnesses that have 
said some startling things and obviously with that evidence 
a mind it does seem like there was something untoward 
happening in the background. 
ADV MYBURGH:  You do not think you could have done 
more Mr Laher? 
MR LAHER:  I think I did the best that I could at that point 
in time.  I raised a number of issues as per the evidence I 
10 
gave yesterday.  I raised the issues through emails.  I 
raised the issues through the reports that I submitted.  I 
raised the issues verbally.  I raised the issues with bidders 
directly.  I raised the issues with my principle who was Mr 
Singh.  I raised the issues with many people in the same 
room not only Mr Singh.  So when I raised the issues 
Transnet internal audit were there.  When I raised the – the 
written issues I addressed the issues to the CFET through 
to the board and Transnet steering committee.  Whist in 
negotiations people that were in the room when I raised 
20 
the issues would include the head of legal.  The issues I 
raised around the Durban move including emails sent to 
the Group Chief Procurement Officer as well as the Head 
of Legal as well as the Chief Financial Officer of the 
organisation. 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 9 of 89 
 
ADV MYBURGH:  Could you have done more yes or no? 
MR LAHER:  I do not think I could have done more. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So even now reflecting on the position 
you still believe you could have done no more? 
MR LAHER:  At that point in time I did as much as I could. 
ADV MYBURGH:  You could not have been any more 
vigilant? 
MR LAHER:  My fear if I was any more vigilant I would 
have been insubordinate. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes.  But we will come to that.  So you 
10 
stopped short of being more vigilant because you did not 
want to be insubordinate, is that what you saying? 
MR LAHER:  No.  I am saying… 
ADV MYBURGH:  That is precisely what you say. 
MR LAHER:  I said I raised as much as I could. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes.  No that is not what you saying.  
You saying that I did not raise anything more for fear of 
being insubordinate. 
MR LAHER:  Ja – so I raised as much as I could. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So if you bear with me.  It follows from 
20 
that that perhaps you could have raised more but it was 
through fear that you did not.  Is that as I understand your 
evidence? 
MR LAHER:  In my view at that point I raised as much as I 
could. 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 10 of 89 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Laher. 
MR LAHER:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just listen to the question carefully.  I 
understood you to be saying you raised as – you raised 
questions as much as you could without – unless you were 
going to be insubordinate.  In other words you did not want 
to go beyond a certain point in raising issues. 
MR LAHER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you thought that going beyond a 
certain point would be insubordinate, you accept that? 
10 
MR LAHER:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you mean? 
MR LAHER:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So My Myburgh do you want to … 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I hope that has helped? 
MR LAHER:  And the explanations I received obviously to 
my satisfaction when I did raise those questions. 
ADV MYBURGH:  You cannot run those two lines together.  
So let me from the commission’s point of view put my cards 
20 
on the table.  One of things that this commission is going 
to have to consider in the final analysis is how did all of 
these procurement irregularities actually happen.  And 
what the commission is going to have to look at is people 
like you obviously well educated, intelligent people why did 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 11 of 89 
 
they not report any irregularities?  How did it happen?  So 
you are not on trial here.  This is not a disciplinary 
hearing.  But I am asking you to take the commission into 
your confidence and what you need to deal with is this.  
When you got the answer from Mr Singh is it that you 
trusted his answer as being correct or is it that you were 
fearful of interrogating any further and therefore you 
stopped.  Those are two different things.  You understand 
that? 
MR LAHER:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH:  So which of it then was it – trust or fear? 
MR LAHER:  Trust – I trusted his answers. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So where does the fear then enter the 
equation? 
MR LAHER:  This was just something at the back of your 
head.  It is something – it is always there. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Mr Laher let me give you an example.  
We will come to it in a moment.  During the negotiations 
you identified that CSR was using the incorrect exchange 
rate to – counted for almost R3 million of their price.  You 
20 
told Mr Singh that and he said to you, do not worry 
negotiations are all about the final price.  And you 
accepted that. 
MR LAHER:  It is a…. 
ADV MYBURGH:  You accepted that? 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 12 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Negotiations are all about the final price 
they are not about the constituent components.  You 
accepted that? 
MR LAHER:  I accepted it and he did say more. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Now you are a chartered accountant.  I 
take it you do not – you would not agree with that at all 
that negotiations are not just about the final price.  
Negotiations are about the constituent component surely 
making up the final price that is what you were doing.  Yes 
10 
when Mr Singh told you that you just let it go and accepted 
it. 
MR LAHER:  Well he explained it.  He explained further 
than just it is about the final price.  He explained it is a 
process of negotiation which is a process of give and take.  
And you got to consider the risk that the bidders were 
willing to accept.  So he provided a rational explanation to 
me.  I mean when you do any type of negotiation it is 
always a give and take. 
ADV MYBURGH:  But Mr Laher negotiations are not – you 
20 
know just about the final price.  Correct? 
MR LAHER:  Well it is about the process that happens to 
get to the final price. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes you agree with me it is not just about 
the final price.  I mean when you go into negotiations I 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 13 of 89 
 
hope this is not what happens of this sort.  You do not just 
say well put up your final price.  You interrogate how you 
get to the price that is what it is all about correct? 
MR LAHER:  Yes.  Ja that is what I did. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So when Mr Singh told you a chartered 
accountant do not worry about that R3 million it is all about 
the final price.  You just accepted that. 
MR LAHER:  Well he did not just say do not worry about 
the – he had said it but he said [00:11:40] the things which 
justify it what he was saying. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH:  Well we are going to come to that.  
Because there is a line in your statement you write I am 
interested to see what it – what it means.  So where do we 
end here?  Was there any fear?  Was there a degree of 
fear that stopped you from interrogating some of these 
answers further?  Yes or no? 
MR LAHER:  If there was it was to a very small degree. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Sorry yes or no? 
MR LAHER:  Very small degree. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So the answer is yes? 
20 
MR LAHER:  Ja but a very small degree.  It was more 
about trust what he was saying. 
ADV MYBURGH:  But you told the Chairperson that you did 
not press the issue any further for fear of insubordination.  
Correct 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 14 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:  Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And you say that is only a very small 
issue. 
MR LAHER:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So that is how I understand your 
evidence. 
MR LAHER:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Now why would you be insubordinate?  
That is another thing I do not understand.  And it is 
another thing that the commission is going to have to look 
10 
at because many employees in your position would say 
that.  But why are insubordinate if you are a member or a 
negotiating team – you are not just a calculator – you not a 
stenographer?  You there to exercise judgment.  Why you 
insubordinate if you ask more than one or two questions 
about 
an 
issue? 
 
How 
does 
that 
translate 
into 
insubordination? 
MR LAHER:  So as I said it was a very small element.  I 
trusted his answer that he gave me.  I raised the issues 
that were necessary to be raised and the answer was – 
20 
was… 
ADV MYBURGH:  You not answering my question?  Why if 
you interrogate things further in a courteous way why 
would that constitute insubordination?  Do you know what 
insubordination is? 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 15 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  It is the refusal to obey typically a lawful 
and reasonable instruction.  If you a member of a 
negotiating team and you have a robust debate with Mr 
Singh surely that does not constitute insubordination? 
MR LAHER:  Correct so that robust debate did happen. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Well we do not see that.  I mean from 
your statement you raise a concern you get an answer and 
you accept it.  There does not seem to be a robust debate. 
MR LAHER:  Well there was a debate about it obviously.  It 
10 
is not going to be – I say something he gives me an answer 
immediately and I accept it. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Well in fact in your statement there is no 
reflection of any debate. 
MR LAHER:  I am clarifying that now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well why would you have considered that 
it 
would 
be 
insubordination 
– 
it 
would 
have 
been 
insubordination to raise legitimate issues which you were 
entitled to raise? 
MR LAHER:  So Chair I did raise the legitimate issues and 
20 
we did have the debate.  So I mean during the debate I 
would have debated with him my views and I suppose at 
the back of my mind there was a little fear that if I debated 
it too vigorously then it is – I mean I am basically telling 
him he does not know what he is talking about.  And he 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 16 of 89 
 
was a respected individual.  I mean highly experienced – 
highly intelligent and he was my senior – he was my 
principle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But were you not there at least in part to 
advise him and the others? 
MR LAHER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So?  So why would – why would you have 
thought that giving him your honest advise would be 
insubordination?  Would constitute insubordination? 
MR LAHER:  So I gave him my honest advice and we had 
10 
the debate to the extent that debate became vigorous and I 
continued along that line.  It could have resulted in 
insubordination but that was a very small fear at the back 
of my head.  I mean the explanations he was giving to me 
at that point in time seemed reasonable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so what is your answer to my 
question?  Why would you have thought that if you gave 
him what was your honest advice that would be regarded 
as insubordination? 
MR LAHER:  Chair I suppose there is always that little fear 
20 
when you dealing with someone higher than you – someone 
that is more senior.  There is always that little fear that you 
got to treat them with respect and you know just a little 
fear at the back of your head. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But respect does not mean you are – you 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 17 of 89 
 
agree with something he says if you do not generally agree 
with it – it is not?  You can have a – can raise issues and 
you have a debate – you do not agree with him; he does 
not agree with you. 
MR LAHER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If he has the power to make a decision 
he makes his decision he can follow your advice or not 
follow advice but you have – you have given him your 
honest 
advice 
so 
why 
would 
doing 
that 
have 
been 
insubordination in your mind? 
10 
MR LAHER:  Chair as I said I – I gave him – I gave him my 
honest opinion.  I gave him the – what I wanted to get him 
and we had the debate about it.  The response he gave me 
was – was adequate.  So I mean as I said earlier it was – it 
was a very small fear of insubordination at the back of my 
mind but it was not really insubordination that was the 
issue it was that I trusted what he told me.  I had no 
reason to believe that he told me anything that was 
untoward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you still think that as you sit there do 
20 
you still think that you should have had that fear? 
MR LAHER:  With hindsight and seeing what is being 
presented at the commission ja maybe I should have – 
should have just – ja been insubordinate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 18 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:  Maybe I should have gone down the road of 
being insubordinate with hindsight and seeing what we 
have seen happening at the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well there would have been nothing 
insubordinate Mr Laher about you honestly putting your – 
your views.  There would have been nothing insubordinate 
about that.  Do you not agree? 
MR LAHER:  Yes.  But Chair I think the principle is I did 
put my views across and I did have the debate so it was 
not like I did not do it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR LAHER:  I did put my views across and I did have the 
debate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no we accept – we accept that but 
you – you have suggested that you did not go – you 
stopped at a certain point because you thought going 
beyond that point would be insubordination.  Do you accept 
now that there would have been no insubordination if you 
had not stopped?  As long as you put your views in a 
normal way, in a collegial way but you do not – you put 
20 
them. 
MR LAHER:  Chair I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you accept that now that there would 
have been no insubordination? 
MR LAHER:  Chair I do not know about that.  I mean I do 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 19 of 89 
 
not know how Mr Singh would have taken me not agreeing 
with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Myburgh just gave you a 
definition of insubordination.  Remember he just gave you 
a definition of insubordination.  A refusal to obey a lawful 
and reasonable instruction.   
MR LAHER:  Ja… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that have been insubordination? 
MR LAHER:  Chair shoo I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also you have not said anything that 
10 
suggests that Mr Singh was known to you to have done 
certain things to junior members of staff if they stood up to 
him on certain points.  You have not suggested that.  I take 
it that there was no history of him acting like that that was 
known to you? 
MR LAHER:  Look he was known to raise his voice and 
have a temper so he was I mean up and down.  He could 
be calm at one stage and then suddenly you know lose it.  
So I mean he was known to be something like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that was not something that was in 
20 
your mind? 
MR LAHER:  Obviously there is that little fear at the back 
of your head that you know it could happen to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Myburgh. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Thank you.  By the time of these 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 20 of 89 
 
negotiations in 2014 how long had you been employed at 
Transnet? 
MR LAHER:  For I think it was about nine years then. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes.  And you were a chartered 
accountant? 
MR LAHER:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And are a chartered accountant? 
MR LAHER:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And you accept that you bound by the – 
your professional rules? 
10 
MR LAHER:  Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Let us deal then with the increase in the 
ETC of the 100 locomotives.  So you accept that there was 
a considerable increase in the ETC from R3.8 billion to 
R4.8 billion?  Correct? 
MR LAHER:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And that was in a very short space of 
time.  The business case or we can go to the documents if 
need be was agreed in January of 2014 and by May 2014 
they 
– 
the 
recommendation 
that 
was 
made 
in 
the 
20 
memorandum that you prepared for Mr Singh was accepted.  
Correct? 
MR LAHER:  Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So there – this very big change an 
increase came about in a short space of time.  Correct? 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 21 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:  Yes to space and parameters. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Just Mr Laher you accept it came about 
in a short space of time? 
MR LAHER:  No.  No. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Not.  Alright.  Between January and 
May? 
MR LAHER:  No. 
ADV MYBURGH:  You say that is an extended period? 
MR LAHER:  There was an extended period. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Now – well let me ask you this.  You 
10 
accept that in January of 2014 the business case number 
was accepted. 
MR LAHER:  It was approved in January – I think it was 
approved in January ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes would – this comes from your own 
documents I will take you there.  And then we know in May 
the increase number was accepted. 
MR LAHER:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Alright.  Now you had done a reason – a 
so called reasonability calculation. 
20 
MR LAHER:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  For Mr Singh that worked out at R4.1 
billion really.  R41 million per locomotive.  And let us go to 
your – your statement.  This is at Bundle 4[a] page 504.  
So you do and I direct your attention to paragraph 27.  You 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 22 of 89 
 
had done your reasonability calculation of R41 million that 
you deal with in paragraph 26. 
“During the negotiations Mr Singh I take it 
pitched a priced at R38.5.” 
MR LAHER:  Mr Jiyane. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Would that – who would that person have 
been? 
MR LAHER:  Mr Jiyane. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Mr Jiyane.  Alright so that accorded 
essentially with the business case number. 
10 
MR LAHER:  I do not know why he pitched R3.5. 
ADV MYBURGH:  That accorded with the business case 
number. 
MR LAHER:  Ja the business case was R3.8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Myburgh.  You said Bundle 
4[a] and what page? 
ADV MYBURGH:  We at page 508. 
CHAIRPERSON:  508.  No I do not have 508 on Bundle [a]. 
ADV MYBURGH:  I am sorry – I beg your pardon then we 
are in Bundle [b] the small file.  I am sorry. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.   
ADV MYBURGH:  So at paragraph 26 you talk about your 
reasonability calculation. 
MR LAHER:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Then at 27 you have confirmed that the 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 23 of 89 
 
chairperson as you say was Mr Jiyane who pitches the 
price 3.5.  CSR they wanted 49 and they refused to come 
down. 
MR LAHER:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And then you go on to say well you never 
accepted that etcetera.  But what I am interested in is 
paragraph 28.  So you were present at the negotiations 
where the 38.5 offer is made and where CSR wanted 49. 
MR LAHER:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Which on the face of it was highly 
10 
inflated obviously. 
MR LAHER:  Hm. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Correct. 
MR LAHER:  Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH:  You were there. 
MR LAHER:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And then at 28 you say: 
“A day or two later Mr Singh tells us that Mr 
Molefe has agreed upon the payment terms 
and a price of R44 million.” 
20 
Is that right? 
MR LAHER:  Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH:  That is before any board approval, is 
that right? 
MR LAHER:  Yes. 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 24 of 89 
 
ADV MYBURGH:  That is outside of the negotiations. 
MR LAHER:  Yes.  Outside of the negotiations we were 
involved in.  Remember we were not appointed into those 
negotiations we were just told to go and assist. 
ADV MYBURGH:  I beg your pardon. 
MR LAHER:  We were not appointed into the negotiations. 
ADV 
MYBURGH: 
 
Yes 
but 
you 
were 
party 
to 
the 
negotiations. 
MR LAHER:  We were there – ja we were there. 
ADV MYBURGH:  You cannot distance yourself from this 
10 
Mr Laher. 
MR LAHER:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  This is a formal process is that not so? 
MR LAHER:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  It was held – just remind us where it was 
held? 
MR LAHER:  It was at Webber Wentzel’s offices. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Yes. 
MR LAHER:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So there was not another negotiation 
20 
between the one you speak to at paragraph 27 and 28, 
correct?  There was no – another meeting? 
MR LAHER:  Not that I was involved in no. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So this must have come as a bit of a 
surprise to you? 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 25 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  More particularly because – and I 
suppose the term itself is important.  Your reasonability 
calculation was R3 million per locomotive less. 
MR LAHER:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Whereas you had that work. 
MR LAHER:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Were you very surprised by this? 
MR LAHER:  I was surprised but I – that is why I raised the 
question to Mr Singh. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH:  Let us just deal with one thing at a time 
if you do not mind.  Were you surprised? 
MR LAHER:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Ja.  Were you perhaps shocked? 
MR LAHER:  I do not think I was shocked. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Well Mr Laher let us just look at what 
happens.  You in a negotiation where 38.5 is offered.  You 
have done a reasonability calculation of 41.  CSR want an 
inflated 49 and two days later you told literally out of the 
blue that the Chief Executive has agreed on 44.  That must 
20 
have shocked you presumably or was that how things 
worked at Transnet? 
MR LAHER:  That was a process so we – as I say in the 
negotiation sessions we were in the prices were never 
agreed.  It was always they would come back to us and tell 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 26 of 89 
 
us [talking over one another]. 
ADV MYBURGH:  You remember my question?  It is really 
quite simple.  I know – we know what your case is I am 
asking you specific questions.  Were you shocked by that? 
MR LAHER:  I do not think I was shocked. 
ADV MYBURGH:  But you were at least surprised? 
MR LAHER:  Surprised ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Okay well let us leave it at that.  So 
when you say at paragraph 29: 
“That I pointed out to Mr Singh that the 
10 
Mitsui quote was cheaper.” 
When did you do that? 
MR LAHER:  When we received the notification that that 
was going to be the final. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So how did it work?  You had a 
negotiating meeting a day or two before.  Then you were 
told of Mr Molefe’s decision. 
MR LAHER:  ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Was that then at a – at this meeting or 
discussion you had a day or two… 
20 
MR LAHER:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  After the last negotiation. 
MR LAHER:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  So you said to him, well but that is more 
expensive than Mitsui. 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 27 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:  Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH:  And was it? 
MR LAHER:  It was. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Substantially? 
MR LAHER:  I cannot recall what the Mitsui quote was but 
ja and the Mitsui quote from a year before that. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Was it substantially more? 
MR LAHER:  It was more but I do not think it was 
substantial. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Well we relying on you; you are a 
10 
chartered accountant. 
MR LAHER:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  You were involved in these negotiations.  
You put up all these documents in this hearing.  Can you 
tell us – I mean presumably if it was just a little bit more 
you would not have raised it? 
MR LAHER:  Ja.  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Was it a significant increase – yes or 
no? 
MR LAHER:  I do not think so no. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH:  Then why did you say Mitsui is cheaper if 
it was not significant? 
MR LAHER:  It was cheaper because the price was 
cheaper.  I will have to go and check the numbers again I 
cannot recall at this point in time. 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 28 of 89 
 
ADV MYBURGH:  But on the face of it it would have been 
significant because that is why you made the point.  I mean 
we are not talking about R50 here. 
MR LAHER:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Correct? 
MR LAHER:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  On the face of it. 
MR LAHER:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  Right.  And you say: 
“I was told by Mr Singh that the decision to 
10 
go to CRS had already been approved by 
the 
board 
for 
reasons 
explained 
in 
a 
memorandum.” 
MR LAHER:  Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH:  But that of course does not answer the 
price question does it?  I mean the problem was that this 
was too much, and he says to you but we have already 
decided to go to CSR.  That hardly answers your concern 
about it being too expensive.  Correct? 
MR LAHER:   Yes, but it was a different locomotive. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, but the point that I make is, it 
does not answer the question.  It does not answer the 
concern.  In other words, you – and you must correct me if I 
am wrong.   
 
You come to learn of this which is substantially in 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 29 of 89 
 
access of your reason-ability calculation.  You say you are 
surprised.   
 
You say to Singh.  But this is more than Mitsui.  He 
says:  Yes, but we have agreed to go to CSR.  It does not 
answer the question about the price being too much in your 
mind.  Correct? 
MR LAHER:   Yes.  CSR had a different locomotive. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just answer my question.  You said to 
him.  You compared it to Mitsui.  You said this is too 
expensive or ...[intervenes] 
10 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Or it is beyond what they had offered.  
He said we have already agreed to go CSR.  That does not 
answer the question, does it? 
MR LAHER:   No, but ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay. 
MR LAHER:   I mean, it is for that ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see. 
MR LAHER:   ...it is for the discussion afterwards. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, you see there is an example of 
20 
Mr Singh just blowing you off.  Did you think you were going 
to be insubordinate if you said to him:  But Mr Singh, that 
does not answer my question.   
 
I accept that you might have agreed to go to CSR but 
this price is too high.  You do not do that.  He says:  Well, 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 30 of 89 
 
we have agreed to go to CSR.  So you just leave it, right? 
MR LAHER:   Ja, well there is reasons therefore and that is 
what he explained.  I mean, he explained, it is a different 
locomotive.  The locomotive is a different specification which 
means that the price will be higher because the different 
specification requires more steel, et cetera, et cetera.  And 
that pushes the price higher to a different locomotive. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR LAHER:   And I mean, if you go through the memo, it 
justifies the memo that requested this to go through to CSR. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR LAHER:   It justifies why it goes to CSR and there is an 
explanation putting there in the memo. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You know the history about Mitsui? 
MR LAHER:   Yes.  Well, I cannot say I know the history. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But did you know it at the time? 
MR LAHER:   No, I did not know... 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You have come to known of it? 
MR LAHER:   Recently, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  So you raise your concern.  
20 
He tells you:  We have agreed to go to CSR.  Okay.  Now, 
just let me understand how these negotiations worked.  You 
say you made up the negotiating team and then the team 
reports into... is that the sub-committee, the Locomotive 
Sub-Committee? 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 31 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:   The team reports into the chairpersons.  The 
chairpersons report into the sub-committee. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, the chairperson is part of a 
team. 
MR LAHER:   Ja, he is part of the team.  But we reported 
into the chairpersons.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, but I mean, he is part of the 
meeting.  Correct? 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right.  So there you are.  The co-
10 
chairperson is here. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Is that right? 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Jiyane and Singh. 
MR LAHER:   Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay.  And do that... the two of them 
report into the sub-committee? 
MR LAHER:   Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And that sub-committee comprises the 
20 
two of them and Mr Molefe? 
MR LAHER:   No, it comprises Mr Singh, Mr Molefe and Mr 
Gama. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ah!  Okay.  So Mr Singh does not tell 
you that the sub-committee has agreed to the R 44 million?  
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 32 of 89 
 
He just tells you that Molefe has agreed to the R 44 million. 
MR LAHER:   Yes, probably.  It is part of mine... it is part of 
the sub-committee meeting that they held.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Laher, he does not tell you that we 
as the sub-committee have agreed on R 44 million.  He tells 
you – and you must understand.  Your evidence is important 
for other ...[intervenes] 
MR LAHER:   Ja, sure. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...parts of this inquiry. 
MR LAHER:   Sure. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It is not just a matter of exonerating 
yourself. 
MR LAHER:   Sure, sure, sure. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   He tells you that Mr Molefe had 
agreed. 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now that must have been strange to 
you? 
MR LAHER:   My understanding is, they would have met with 
the sub-committee.  Mr Molefe being the most senior person 
20 
in the sub-committee would be the one that makes the final 
decision.  My understanding of how a committee works.  
Because normally, the most senior person in the committee 
would ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you did not think this was strange? 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 33 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you thought... you were surprised 
only by the price? 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  At paragraph 30, where you 
say: 
“During the negotiations I raised concerns about the 
high price.” 
 
And then you go on to say at 31 that you also raised 
these concerns with Mr Singh.  Correct? 
10 
MR LAHER:   Ja 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And this is where the accounting team 
quite correctly identified that CSR was using the wrong 
exchange rate. 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Correct? 
MR LAHER:   Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now that was your job. 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   To identify things like that. 
20 
MR LAHER:   Yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You came up with this point. 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And this is when you say, four lines 
from the bottom: 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 34 of 89 
 
“His response was to advise me that it is a 
negotiation process on final process and in the 
context of negotiations, it was the final overall price 
that is important.” 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Were you persuaded by that? 
MR LAHER:   May we read further? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Just... I am asking you Mr Laher.  
Please, do not get ahead of yourself.  I well aware of the 
next sentence and you know that I am going to take you 
10 
there.   
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Could we concentrate on my question, 
if you do not mind? 
MR LAHER:   Sure. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You raise a line item with him.  It is 
the accountant in you coming out. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is why you are there. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
“His response was to advise me that it is a 
negotiation process on final price and on the context 
of negotiation, it is the overall final price that is 
important.” 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 35 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:   I think it is important to read it with the next 
sentence. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Were you persuaded by that? 
MR LAHER:   No, I was persuaded with what he said as far 
as the next sentence ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
“He explained that the pricing was acceptable in 
light of the rigorous negotiation process and the 
risk.” 
 
It is... we are going to come to that but let me deal with 
10 
this theory.  Because, just bearing in mind, you say this in 
many other parts of your affidavit. 
 
That is why I do not know why you are hesitant. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In fact, I think, it appears three times, 
does it not? 
MR LAHER:   H’m. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Where you say:  My principles... we 
are worried of the overall price. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It is your own testimony before this 
Commission. 
MR LAHER:   Sure, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But that is wrong.  That you need to 
interrogate the constituent parts. 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 36 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you want me to take you to those 
places? 
MR LAHER:   Yes, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You know of them. 
MR LAHER:   Ja, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So here, when he told you it is all 
about the final price, you knew that in your mind not to be 
right.  
MR LAHER:   Acceptable in terms of the risk, the bidders 
10 
were not ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am asking you.  Your own evidence 
before this Commission.  Is it wrong, as far as you are 
concerned, to focus on the overall price.  You must look at 
the constituent components.  In fact, you are critical of Singh 
and Jiyane on that basis, correct? 
MR LAHER:   Ja, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right.  So you were not persuaded 
when he said look at the overall price, correct? 
MR LAHER:   I was persuaded with the next sentence 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But how could you have been 
persuaded when those passages in your affidavit say this is 
the very mistake my principles made? 
MR LAHER:   It was the mistake they made but I mean, the 
explanation they provided were ...[intervenes]  
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 37 of 89 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then it was not a mistake Mr Laher.  I 
mean, you cannot have it both ways here.  
MR LAHER:   So the explanation that was provided was 
reasonable at that point in time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That in the next sentence? 
MR LAHER:   In the next sentence, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But you would accept that taken in 
isolation, this idea that negotiations were all about the final 
price.  That does not record with your own view of life, does 
it? 
10 
MR LAHER:   Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   As an accountant? 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In fact, it is nonsense, is it not? 
MR LAHER:   It does not accord with my view, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  Okay.  But why you were 
persuaded is.  He said he explained that the pricing was 
acceptable in the light of the rigorous negotiation.  You have 
been involved in the negotiation process. 
MR LAHER:   Yes, correct. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I mean, you knew that rigour or 
otherwise.  And the risk that the bidders were prepared to 
accept. 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So what?  They were still using the 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 38 of 89 
 
wrong exchange rate. 
MR LAHER:   Right. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You could have potentially say 
R 2.4 million.  Correct? 
MR LAHER:   Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But somehow, you were just 
persuaded by this answer. 
MR LAHER:   So, I mean, it is not only about the exchange 
rate.  It is also about the rest of the negotiations.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja but ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR LAHER:   There is also about what the bidders were 
willing to accept.  So, I mean, when you do a negotiation for 
anything, it is not only about one element.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, but you did not test this with 
them.  You see that is the problem.  I mean, I understand 
what you say.  But you were in the negotiations.  You have 
not described them as particularly rigorous.  Did you 
...[intervenes]  
MR LAHER:   It was. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Why did you not go to them and say:  
20 
By the way, you are using the wrong exchange rate.  We 
want you to reduce your price about R 2.4 million.  How do 
you know what they would have said? 
MR LAHER:   I did.  I did do that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You did that? 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 39 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:   I did that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, that does not seem to appear 
here. 
MR LAHER:   But that was part of the negotiation sessions.  
I mean, I raised it directly with the bidders to say, this is the 
wrong percentage(?). 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You do not raise that in your 
statement here.   
MR LAHER:   But I did do it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You understand how that might be 
10 
seen as a bit opportunistic because so far we are testing 
...[intervenes]  
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   ...you going to Mr Singh. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And Mr Singh giving you answers that 
plicate you.  Now you say that you actually raised this issue 
with Mr Singh, does not agree with during the negotiations. 
MR LAHER:   Sorry, say that again? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you raise this issue during 
20 
negotiations?  Because remember, Mr Singh does not agree 
with this. 
MR LAHER:   I have raised it with the bidders during 
negotiations. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see.  So there is no issue then of 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 40 of 89 
 
subordination? 
MR LAHER:   But I raised it with him as well. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  My question is.  Why do you not 
say you raised this in the negotiations? 
MR LAHER:   I think I raised in point 30 or I raised my 
concerns of the high costs directly with the bidders. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay.  Perhaps I have missed that.  I 
am talking really about the R 2.4 million. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And the foreign exchange fluctuations. 
10 
MR LAHER:   That is when I am referring to when I talk 
about that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  Did you raise that? 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay.  Now let us go back to 
Mr Singh.  Are you seriously suggesting that you were 
persuaded by his answer? 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, you have accepted that 
negotiations about overall price.  Were you persuaded that 
20 
these negotiations are so rigorous and they have assumed 
so much risk that they will not entertain using the correct 
foreign exchange? 
MR LAHER:   Well, the risk relates to other elements, not 
...[intervenes] 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 41 of 89 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Please, just answer my question.  I 
mean, were you at such a breaking point that you could not 
push this issue?  Is that what you say? 
MR LAHER:   No, I do not think I said that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But then why did not... why was this 
not raised?  Why was the point not taken further? 
MR LAHER:   So it was.  As I said, these matters were 
debated with Mr Singh as I said earlier.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am asking you.  Why was this not 
pressed in the negotiations? 
10 
MR LAHER:   It was pressed in the negotiations. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see.   
CHAIRPERSON:   When you say in paragraph 32: 
“In light of the seniority, expertise, experience and 
ability of Mr Singh, I deferred to his explanations 
and judgment on the issue that I had raised.” 
 
That sounds like you are saying, even if you were not 
convinced 
that 
he 
was 
right 
with 
his 
responses 
or 
explanations, you let go because of his seniority, expertise, 
experience and ability? 
20 
MR LAHER:   Ja, Chair.  The explanations ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that correct? 
MR LAHER:   The explanations provided was reasonable at 
that point in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 42 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:   The explanation provided was reasonable at 
that point in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if the explanation was reasonable, 
why would you need to defer to him? 
MR LAHER:   I suppose ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You mean... do you mean, it was 
reasonable but not correct? 
MR LAHER:   It was reasonable and it made sense at that 
point in time.  So accepted what he was telling me.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
then 
the 
seniority, 
expertise, 
10 
experience and ability should not come in, should it? 
MR LAHER:   Ja.  And you respected that he had experience 
and you knew what he was talking about.  And he spoke with 
authority.  So you accepted it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   My Myburgh.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you.  Explain to me the 
concerns you have articulated in your statements about the 
chairpersons having, as you put it, focussed incorrectly on 
the overall price instead of the constituent parts because 
this really goes to that.  Explain that criticism to the

Chairperson. 
MR LAHER:   Ja, so Chair.  As a finance person, obviously, 
you want to focus on the individual parts but during the 
negotiations the chairpersons were much focussed on the 
overall price and that is just the impression I got during the 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 43 of 89 
 
negotiations. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Why did you consider that to be 
wrong?  Why are you critical of the chairpersons? 
MR LAHER:   I would have liked for us to focus more on the 
individual elements that made up the price because then you 
could, you know, take things a bit further and you know 
going with a more with the bidders. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, you would have preferred that. 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That would have been the correct way 
10 
to do it, presumable, from your point of view. 
MR LAHER:   From my point of view. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  So that is... you understand why 
I questioned you in relation to this particular issue?  
Because this went to the very criticism that you have of how 
the chairpersons ran the negotiations. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But you get this answer from Mr Singh 
and you just leave it.   
MR LAHER:   Debate to that.  I did not leave it.  Debated it. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But you were not persuaded because 
you believed that you needed to look at each of the 
components of price.  That is your own case.  Do you want 
me to read that to you? 
MR LAHER:   Ja, so the components are one section.   
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 44 of 89 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja. 
MR LAHER:   The overall price is another section. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR LAHER:   And the risk related to overall price is another 
section.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja.  So you say in your main 
statement: 
“The impression I gained during the negotiations 
was that the chairperson’s negotiations tactic was 
very much focussed on the overall price.” 
10 
 
Correct? 
MR LAHER:   Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
“The 
effect 
of 
this 
was 
that 
much 
of 
these 
components was self-standing components of the 
negotiations.  In the end, it was the overall price 
that they focussed on.” 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And negotiating in that way has its 
dangers, does it not? 
20 
MR LAHER:   Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Perhaps you could articulate those 
dangers to the Chairperson. 
MR LAHER:   I suppose there should be more rigour in 
discussing the detailed elements that make it up and in that 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 45 of 89 
 
way you can... you can get to the bottom of each of the 
elements. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  Well, I assumed what you were 
going to is, because you came in that way artificially 
increased prices.  Correct?  If you do not, as you correctly 
put it, rigorously interrogate each of these things, you can 
hide R 5 million here or R 10 million there.  Correct? 
MR LAHER:   Possible. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is the danger of not negotiating 
in a way that you describe. 
10 
MR LAHER:   Ja.  Possible, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  That is why it is very important 
to press these types of issues, is it not? 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And Mr Singh persuaded you on the 
basis that you have explained. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Correct? 
MR LAHER:   Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see.  Now did you ever say to Mr 
20 
Singh, 
because 
this 
is 
your 
central 
criticism 
of 
the 
chairpersons.   
 
What you have not already told the Chairperson is that 
at a certain point in time, that you met with the chairpersons 
and said, with all respect, the way that you are negotiating is 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 46 of 89 
 
wrong.  It does not rest well with me.  We are not 
interrogating the constituent components of this offer.   
 
Now we know that is what you believed. 
MR LAHER:   H’m. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you say that to them? 
MR LAHER:   I cannot recall saying that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What do you mean you cannot recall 
Mr Laher?  Did... I mean, this was your central problem that 
you had.  As I understand it.   
 
You sat there from an accounting perspective and you 
10 
looked at what was going on and you looked comfortable 
because they were not interrogating the components.   
 
Now, surely, you would remember as to whether or not 
you took this leap of addressing them on this issue. 
MR LAHER:   H’m, h’m.  I cannot recall if I said that 
...[intervenes]   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, the I assume you did not. 
MR LAHER:   Ja, what I probably did was try to raise it as 
much as I could during the negotiations.  So even though 
they were focussing on overall price, I would have, you 
20 
know, butted in to say but what about this, what about that.  
Just to make sure that it is being addressed. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is the most you would have done.  
Why did you not tackle this?  Because what you explain in 
your affidavit is that it seems to me that a fundamental 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 47 of 89 
 
difficulty with the manner in which these negotiations were 
being run.  Why did you not tackle it head on? 
MR LAHER:   I thought I was doing a good enough job by 
just trying to raise the issues myself. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But we know that... I mean, I have 
made a list of your concerns.  There is six of them. 
MR LAHER:   H’m. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   None of them involved this material 
issue.  I mean, this is central to the whole in which you were 
conducting your job.  I mean, you were there as an 
10 
accountant.  That was your job, presumable.   
MR LAHER:   J. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   To interrogate the lineout. 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right? 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now the chairpersons were not 
conducting the negotiations in that way.  You have told the 
DCJ, the Chairperson of this inquiry that it is wrong to do 
that and that that potentially can lead to price inflation.  This 
20 
is a big issue for you as a chartered accountant, correct? 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yet, you do not say, with all respect, I 
must put my foot down.  You do not do that. 
MR LAHER:   Not that I can recall but I mean I can go back 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 48 of 89 
 
and check what ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But Mr Laher, you just told the 
Chairperson at the outset that you did not want to push 
things too far because you were scared of insubordination.  
Did you put your foot down, yes or no, in relation to this? 
MR LAHER:   No, I do not think I put my foot down. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No.  Okay so then, why did you not?  
Because this is what you were doing there.  The whole 
modus operandi on your evidence was wrong.  Why did you 
not put your foot down? 
10 
MR LAHER:   So as I said, I would have raised the issues 
myself directly to say that we have got to focus on 
escalations directly with the bidders.  And I would say 
escalation during the negotiation sessions.   
 
The same with all the different elements, I would have 
raised directly with the bidders to say we got to focus on 
this, we got to focus on that and see what responses we got 
from the bidders.  And that is what I did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Now at paragraph 32.  Here 
we are dealing with the exchange fluctuations.  And it is 
20 
important.  And you have pointed out something to me which 
I did not or might have forgotten.  Of course, we are dealing 
here with you believe that the cost was too high. 
MR LAHER:   Paragraph three, two? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja, 30, 31, 32. 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 49 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:   Ja.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you knew it was too high because 
you had done your own reasonability calculation. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But... So you are coming from that 
perspective, really, when you learn of the R 44 million.  As I 
understand, it was just a matter of a short time before you 
had done your own accounting sum. 
MR LAHER:   Right. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And it would come to R 41 million. 
10 
MR LAHER:   Right. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you were better placed than 
anyone to know that this actually was too high. 
MR LAHER:   Without building risk into it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You know that? 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay.  So at 32: 
“In the light of seniority expertise and experience an 
20 
ability, I deferred to his explanation.” 
 
So that explanation, would you know, is wrong at least in 
part, fundamentally.  That negotiations are all about the final 
price.  You deferred to him. 
MR LAHER:   Ja, that is the explanation I gave to the Chair 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 50 of 89 
 
a few minutes ago. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You deferred to him, telling you that 
negotiations are all about the final price because of his 
expertise, experience and ability. 
MR LAHER:   And because he said that there is risk involved 
and there is... you have to pay a price for the risk. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  But look, Mr Laher.  I do not 
want to be uncharitable to you but you also had skills.  You 
also 
had 
seniority, 
experience, 
expertise 
and 
ability.  
Correct?  And all those things took you to say to him that the 
10 
price is too high. 
MR LAHER:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is why I am struggling to 
understand and I think the Chairperson has touched on it 
and I am not going to belabour it but it is not a case where 
this is not your field.   
 
This is your field.  You had done the accounting.  You 
had got to R 41 million.  You were no really surprised that Mr 
Molefe had agreed to R 44 million.   
 
But you land up, on the basis of this answer, just 
20 
deferring to him. 
MR LAHER:   With rigorous debate that happened before 
that. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Laher, there is no reference here 
you rigorous debate.  Please.  You draft... I mean, this is an 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 51 of 89 
 
important statement that has been drafted. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You do not even talk about, let alone 
rigorous, you say nothing about debate.   
MR LAHER:   So that is why I am saying now that is what 
happened.  To clarify. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You are now saying here you had a 
rigorous debate with Mr Singh. 
MR LAHER:   It was a debate ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   When you started out your evidence 
10 
this morning, the record will show that you adopted the 
position that you actually did not want to have a rigorous 
debate 
with 
Mr 
Singh 
because 
you 
think 
you 
might 
insubordinate yourself.   
MR LAHER:   At the back of your mind, but I mean 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So where are we then? 
MR LAHER:   So the debate was held.  I mean ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   A rigorous debate was held despite no 
reference being made here. 
20 
MR LAHER:   Let me stop you with the word rigorous but the 
debate was out.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Debate was... 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You did not have concerns about 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 52 of 89 
 
insubordination? 
MR LAHER:   At the back of your mind, as I have said, it is 
always there.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So tell us then.  Let us explain the 
debate.  Let us go through it.   
MR LAHER:   So go though it with Mr Sing.  So approach 
him and say that my believe is that my calculation is a 
certain number and this is a number.  They are using the 
wrong numbers in the calculation.  And then asking why are 
the prices higher.  Why would it be to a higher number?   
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR LAHER:   And his explanation would have been, as I said 
there, he believed it was a rigorous negotiation process.  
And it was a rigorous negotiation process where it was up 
and down over a period. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Carry on. 
MR LAHER:   And based there upon, the bidders were willing 
to only... and we were not there when the final price... we 
only agreed to that because there was risk involved.   
 
And they were only willing to accept that price because 
20 
there was risk involved and because of that risk, they wanted 
a higher price.   
 
And that was the additional element of risk that pushed 
it up to R 44 million ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you described that as a debate? 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 53 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:   Well, he would have come back to me and I 
mean, I would have said ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You see, Mr Laher.  Even on your own 
version, you raised a concern and he gave the answer in 
these two lines and you were placated.  I mean, you have 
basically 
repeated 
what 
you 
have 
in 
your 
statement.  
Correct? 
MR LAHER:   Effectively, I would have said:  Does that... 
You know, I would have said:  Okay but in my view it is 
...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see.  Well, let us carry on.  Now 
what happens is that you become in part the author of what 
we can refer to as the Singh memorandum.  Correct? 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now you, if I recall your evidence 
correctly, you were very surprised... [voice trails off]  You 
were surprised that Mr Singh choice you to perform this task. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Is that right? 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And presumable must have trusted 
you. 
MR LAHER:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Correct? 
MR LAHER:   Possible, ja. 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 54 of 89 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Were there lots of other people that 
he could have asked. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But he choice you. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right? 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now, I understand entirely the edits 
that were made.  I have looked carefully at the notes at 
Annexure YL15.  But I mean, there seems to be to be 
10 
substantial parts of that memorandum that you would have 
authored yourself.   
MR LAHER:   What you see in the notes are only a few 
pages. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja.  Sorry, can you just answer my 
question?  Are there substantial parts of the memorandum 
that you have authored yourself? 
MR LAHER:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  So you given a draft and you 
work it up and key then amends(?). 
20 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What we need to know which is 
important 
is, 
do 
you 
take 
ownership 
then 
of 
that 
memorandum?  Do you accept that you were ultimately the 
author with the input of Mr Singh? 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 55 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay what are you saying?  That you 
performed simply a secretarial function? 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But then why ...[intervenes]  
MR LAHER:   And chased up whatever information he wanted 
me to chase up. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  Yes but are you saying, you 
authored none of that memorandum? 
MR 
LAHER: 
 
 
I 
would 
have 
captured 
his 
wording 
10 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you performed – and it is 
important.  We just need to know. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You performed simply a secretarial 
function? 
MR LAHER:   Ja.  Except for Table 1 where he explained to 
me how to put the table ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  We are going to come to Table 1.   
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So apart from – because of course, 
Table 1 is the critical thing, is it not? 
MR LAHER:   Ja, it is a record of the ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 56 of 89 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is really what I wanted to get at. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Table 1 is critical. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   As for the rest, you were playing the 
role of a secretary. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay.  Now you knew that what you... 
what Mr Singh was trying to do, was to provide really an 
expo facto explanation for the increase to R 44 million per 
10 
locomotive. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Correct? 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And what is important is that that 
memorandum took a substantial amount of time to draft, did 
it not?  Or to finalise. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In fact, it seems, it is closer to two 
months and one month.  Would you agree? 
20 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So there is... the picture that you paint 
is that there is a backwards and forwarding between you and 
Mr Singh for up to two months.   
MR LAHER:   Possible, ja. 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 57 of 89 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   There is a gathering of information.  
There is an exercise of the mind in relation to Table A. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So I take it then, the Chairperson can 
accept that Mr Molefe and the sub-committee did not have 
that information on tab at the time that the R 44 million was 
agreed to?  They did not have on tab, did they? 
MR LAHER:   I do not know what the sub ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, you do know.  Because if they had 
on tab, then you would have been given the information and 
10 
you could have just drafted Table A and the memorandum 
could have been immediately.  Correct? 
MR LAHER:   You are talking about the information in the 
table? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR LAHER:   Well, they would have had a quote because 
that information came from the quote.  So they would have 
had it with them. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  But the point is that it was an 
expo facto justification.  Correct? 
20 
MR LAHER:   It was the calculation or a reconciliation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, the point is.  You now have to 
justify an explain a decision that had already been made.  
That is perhaps a more accurate way of putting it, correct? 
MR LAHER:   That was the objective and the memo was to 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 58 of 89 
 
request ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR LAHER:   ...permission to ...[intervenes]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You accept that I say? 
MR LAHER:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You were trying to justify the 
increased to 44 which had already been agreed. 
MR LAHER:   I was not justifying anything.  Mr Singh was 
preparing the memo. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, but you knew that was Mr Singh 
10 
was doing. 
MR LAHER:   That is what Mr Singh was doing. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right.  And did that not make you... do 
you not feel uneasy about being involved in this process?  I 
mean, already you were concerned about the price.   
MR LAHER:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Were you not concerned about 
involvement with this memorandum? 
MR LAHER:   I do not think so.  I mean, where I did not know 
what was happening in the memo, he would have... he got 
20 
inputs and he would provide instruction to the other sections 
of the memo which needed to come from other areas. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is not my question.  I mean, you 
yourself say you are surprised that he choice you. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 59 of 89 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Were you not a little bit wary about 
this task? 
MR LAHER:   Look, obviously I did not work in that 
department.  I did not work for him.  I was working at Freight 
Rail.  I was working in another office in Park Town. They 
were working in Carlton Centre.   
 
I got called to come and do these edits and to chase 
people up to get information for the memo.  I suppose it was 
just... it felt like it was just a job that I needed to do based 
on the instruction of my superior. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you feel... and again Mr Laher, 
you have done everything but answer my question. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Were you not wary about engaging in 
this task?  You do not even tell us about the Carlton Centre, 
to answer that question. 
MR LAHER:   No.  I do not recall being wary. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Well, then that is the answer.   
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You were not wary. 
20 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You were surprised though that he 
choice you. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay.  Then the memorandum is 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 60 of 89 
 
produced.  Let us then go to... it is Table 1.  I am sorry.  I am 
wrong when I referred you to A, Table 1 is at 553, is that 
right? 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So that is how one gets to the 44 
million. 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And for example what you would find 
at A, that is the column next to the rand. 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That deals with the exchange rate. 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And we know these are the 
constituent parts that caused the increase, right? 
MR LAHER:   Right. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you say that in the process of 
putting together the memorandum and table 1 that Mr 
Singh asked you to do a so-called walk forward. 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now if I could ask you please to go 
20 
page 510 and paragraph 36, the fourth line: 
“Mr Singh told me to prepare a walk forward 
calculation from the business case price to the final 
contracted price.” 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 61 of 89 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   “The walk forward would entail  
taking the price as reflected in the business case of 
34 million and adding or subtracting any elements 
that impact the price to that price in order to end up 
at the final contracted price.” 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   that is what you had to do. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You had to go from 34 million to 44 
million. 
10 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You had to ensure that. 
MR LAHER:   Those were the two parameters, yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes.  But because, of course, Mr 
Molefe had already agreed on that. 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   It might have been two months 
before. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is what you had to do.  You had 
20 
to balance the books. 
MR LAHER:   That was the parameters, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, precisely.  So let us then go; 
and have a look at what Mr Callard had to say.  You have 
considered his transcript, I have provided you with there. 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 62 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You know that he has given evidence 
already in relation to your Rule 3.4 statement and Mr 
Callard’s transcript or transcript of his evidence you find – 
if you go to page 791 of bundle 4B.  You find it directly 
after that, it starts at 791.1.  Are you there? 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   There is just one or two passages 
that I want to take you to.  Let us go please to page 
791.30.  I want to take you just to three parts and he is 
10 
dealing here with table 1.  Mr Callard says at line 18: 
“There is nothing which adds to the table or enables 
a 
further 
determination 
of 
the 
table 
in 
a 
deterministic manner of a walk forward which I was 
mentioning. 
 
None 
of 
those, 
that 
data 
or 
methodology for a calculation of that walk forward 
is provided.  It is covered as I, in my reading of 
this, under the guidance of Mr Singh who provided 
those elements but it does not elucidate or add to 
an understanding of how the final 44 million was 
20 
derived at other than these figures.  We have no 
understanding how these figures were derived at in 
a deterministic or traceable manner.” 
Do you want to comment on that? 
MR LAHER:   So yes, we do know how the figures were 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 63 of 89 
 
arrived at.  I mean, if you go to table 1 the elements are 
explained in terms of the foreign exchange was arrived at, 
would be changing the EN rate and that was a 10.7% 
increase in EN rate, so that is 10.7 increase from the 
business case to the point in time when the contract was 
signed. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR LAHER:   Same would be for the escalation.  It would 
be the escalation relating to indices over that point in time. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But all of those were controversial 
10 
decisions made during the course of negotiation. 
MR LAHER:   Why do you say controversial?   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, I mean, we have touched on 
the exchange rate already. 
MR LAHER:   Ja but this is – these exchange rates are a 
given.  So, I mean, you have it in the business case and 
you have the exchange rate at the date of [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you do not agree with what Mr 
Callard said? 
20 
MR LAHER:   I disagree. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then let us have a look at page 
791.32 at paragraph or line 12. 
“I have not come across that methodology in the 
past.” 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 64 of 89 
 
He is talking about the walk forward.   
“It is most unusual, highly unusual.  In fact I would 
go so far as to say irregular because we are now 
trying to justify a price which has been given as he 
mentioned in his statement earlier, that he was 
given the price.  He is now trying to justify the price 
as in a walk forward.” 
I think you have accepted that your walk forward had to get 
you from 34 to 44. 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So he is saying well, you are just 
simply trying to justify, you knew where you had to go to. 
MR LAHER:   Well, it is not a justification, it is a 
calculation and it is standard way of doing a walk forward.  
So it is not something that is new, it is standard financial 
way of doing things. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But the point is it was being done ex 
post facto, you had to get to 44. 
MR LAHER:   And you would normally do that always. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I see.  Then if we go please to page 
20 
791.35.  At 21 Mr Callard says: 
“Mr 
Chair, 
I 
think 
you 
have 
summarised 
it 
beautifully, a walk forward would be prior to the 
event to determine the price.  Post event would be 
a walk backwards to justify.  I think you have 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 65 of 89 
 
summarised it beautifully.” 
In other words, what he was saying is really you are going 
backwards to justify a price.  Do you want to comment on 
that? 
MR LAHER:   Mr Callard is not a financial expert, so I 
mean we do walk forwards in this way, we call it a walk 
forward, at the end of the day it is semantics, walk 
forward, walk backwards and I explained yesterday how a 
walk forward is done and that is a standard way you do a 
walk forward. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  Then let us please go back 
to your statement.  And I am going to deal with the next 
thing that Mr Callard deals with and that is the forex issue. 
MR LAHER:   Alright, page? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And this you deal with at page 510 in 
paragraph 36, it is quite a lengthy paragraph, as you know.  
I think it is that part of the paragraph that you find at page 
511.  Are you there? 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you say at the top: 
20 
“Singh explained that the assumptions used in the 
business case was the rand/yen rate and that the 
base price in the business case was based upon a 
price obtained from Mitsui.  Singh explained that 
the business case was based in yen.” 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 66 of 89 
 
And so it goes on. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   A few lines down you say: 
“I pointed out that there would be more than one 
currency involved.” 
What did you mean by that?  What were the other 
currencies? 
MR LAHER:   So that would be like the US dollar rate 
example. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, when you say there were other 
10 
currencies involved, what did you mean?  Were you saying 
well, I said to him look, we should be using the US dollar? 
MR LAHER:   No, no, no, no. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What did you say? 
MR LAHER:   I am saying could have been or could other 
currencies involved and he is saying the business case is 
based in yen. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Ja. 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But is this an – why did you not say 
20 
to why are we not using the US dollar? 
MR LAHER:   I cannot – I mean, the business case was 
based in yen, it is fait accompli [intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry, can you just answer my 
question?  Did you say to him why are we not using the US 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 67 of 89 
 
dollar? 
MR LAHER:   The contract was meant to be done in rands. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Okay. 
MR LAHER:   So – and that is what was finally agreed 
upon, in rands. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Right.  So when you say I pointed 
out that there would be other – sorry, more than one 
currency involved did you mean rand and something else?  
Or did you mean...? 
MR LAHER:   So the initial price, when I was doing my 
10 
calculation, my reasonability was based on the CSR price 
which would have had a dollar element and you will see it 
in my calculation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, I saw it. 
MR LAHER:   And that is why I asked that question. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So when you did your re-stability 
calculation that is where you used US dollar. 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you raise with Mr Singh the 
prospect of rather using a US dollar in this context or not? 
20 
MR LAHER:   No, I did not. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then he says: 
“Well, the business case is based on yen so that is 
what we are going to use.” 
And you accepted. 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 68 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:   That is not unreasonable. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   When you did your re-stability 
calculation why did you use US dollar and not yen? 
MR LAHER:   Because the price of the 20E was based in 
US dollar. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So CSR is a Chinese company? 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Not a Japanese company. 
MR LAHER:   Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:  And their prices are based on US 
10 
dollar, as I understand, from what you say.  
MR LAHER:   Yes.  Ja, and a few other currencies. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes but in this instance we were 
using the US dollar. 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In your mind. 
MR LAHER:   US Dollar as well as rand, portion. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, that I...  So using the US – 
sorry, using the yen as the rand/yen rate we know that that 
came at something of a price.  I think we have already 
20 
looked at table 1. 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   How much was it? 
MR LAHER:   10.7% increase. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And that translated into how much in 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 69 of 89 
 
rand? 
MR LAHER:   I will go to table 1 to see what it is.  On what 
page is table 1?  R3.6 million.  I think 3.6 [indistinct – 
dropping voice] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Sorry? 
MR LAHER:   R3.6 million rounded. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   3.6 million per locomotive? 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So that was quite a large part of the 
increase from 34 to 44. 
10 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you ever do a calculation as to 
what the difference would have been if you used the 
rand/US dollar rate? 
MR LAHER:   I did not do that calculation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you know whether it would have 
been offhand more or less? 
MR LAHER:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright.  So let us just then go to Mr 
Callard again please and I will ask you to go to page 
20 
791.37.  This is where he deals with this issue and perhaps 
I can take you forward to page 44. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say 791 point? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   791.44, Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   44. 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 70 of 89 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   At line 13.  Mr Callard says: 
“But what I fail to understand is this is I have a 
price for a locomotive, I am now buying a dollar-
based locomotive into the future, why should I now 
be using yen into the future in justification or 
determining a dollar-based locomotive?  I still do 
not understand that anomaly.  I still have nothing in 
here to address that anomaly other than the first 
line.” 
Do you want to address that? 
10 
MR LAHER:   The standard way of doing a walk forward is 
to, as I explained yesterday, was to work on what you were 
given.  So you were given the rand/yen rate, which was 
included in the business case which is fait accompli, as I 
said in my statement yesterday as well.  I was not involved 
in the business case, so I cannot explain why the business 
case was based in yen but from a financial principle 
perspective you start with what you are given and the 
rand/yen rate was what was given and that is why you used 
the rand/yen rate. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But there was no reason why you 
could not use the rand/dollar rate if you chose to. 
MR LAHER:   It would just complicate …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But you could. 
MR LAHER:   You could, ja, but it expose the calculation to 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 71 of 89 
 
miscalculation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But you could do the calculation. 
MR LAHER:   You could do the calculation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That is why they had smart people 
like you there. 
MR LAHER:   Ja, you could do the calculations but 
…[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes and then you could trace it into 
the future using the correct currency. 
MR LAHER:   Not necessarily, I mean, we cannot say it is 
10 
the correct currency.  As I say, when you do a walk forward 
you work with what was given. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes. 
MR LAHER:   So it is more correct to use what you were 
given rather than to make assumptions and use something 
that you are not given. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yet when you did your calculations 
you used the dollar. 
MR LAHER:   That is a separate calculation completely.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But your answer is yes. 
20 
MR LAHER:   Correct, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:    Alright.  Then the next page 791.45, 
line 19. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What he says is …[intervenes] 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 72 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:   Sorry, I do not have lines in my… 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Line 19. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The number on the margins. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   On the left hand side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When it says line 19, there is 10, 20. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You do have them, I can see them 
from here, Mr …[intervenes] 
MR LAHER:   I see 10 and 20 – oh, you mean... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   20, so it is the line above. 
10 
“Secondly, in that explanation I can pick up from Mr 
Laher ’s statement for the continued use of the yen 
was that Mr Singh explained the assumption and I 
take that as guidance from Mr Singh.” 
So you took guidance from him there. 
MR LAHER:   Ja but it is a financial principle which I agree 
with. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Let us then deal with the advanced 
payments which is the next thing that Mr Callard deals 
with.  Now Mr Callard says that he was shocked when he 
20 
came 
to 
learn 
of 
amongst 
others 
a 
30% 
advanced 
guaranteed payment to CSR.  Were you shocked when you 
came to learn of that? 
MR LAHER:   I do not know if I was shocked.  I do not 
think I was shocked. 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 73 of 89 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, let me just take you to the 
extent of it and we can break for tea.  Could you please go 
to the transcript 791.57.  At the foot of the page .57, he 
says when he came to learn of this he then sent an SMS to 
finance people. 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Did you get this SMS? 
MR LAHER:   No. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And the SMS read – over the page: 
“My giddy hat, we are shocked at these figures.  
10 
These guys are cowboys, what are they playing at?” 
Do you see that? 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You were not shocked, were you 
surprised? 
MR LAHER:   That was the offer that was put on the table 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No, I am asking you were you 
surprised that it was agreed to? 
MR LAHER:   No. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Chairperson, could we break for 
tea? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us take the tea adjournment, we will 
resume at half past eleven.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 74 of 89 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Laher, 
we are dealing with the advance payments.  Could I ask 
you please to go to page 501 of bundle 4B?  At paragraph 
40 you say that you were not involved in the management 
of Transnet’s cash or funding, 512. 
MR LAHER:   Sorry, 512?   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then it says: 
“During the 1 064 and 100 locomotive transaction 
10 
Mr Singh told the negotiating team that Transnet 
had the funding available and that the advanced 
payments were affordable.” 
I just wanted to clarify, I take it that the issue of advanced 
payments, was that part and parcel of the negotiations or 
is it something that Mr Singh told you about outside of 
that? 
MR LAHER:   It is party, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So you sat there and there was a 
negotiation around these advanced payments? 
20 
MR LAHER:   Ja, when bidders provide their pricing they 
provide a payment profile as well. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So could I take you please to 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, what was that answer? 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 75 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:   When bidders provide pricing they provide a 
payment profile as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was part of the negotiations? 
MR LAHER:   It was part of the submission by the bidders 
per negotiations, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now I want to take you to Mr 
Callard’s statement that was attached to the 3.3 notice, 
that is right at the beginning of the file and could I ask you 
please to turn to page 503.37.  Perhaps we can start at 
10 
503.38.  Do you see at 147 there is a table, the table 
below is compiled from annexure 17 and if you look at the 
column headed CSR you will see: 
“Total advance payment, 30%” 
Do you see that? 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Then at 148: 
“From the above table the advance payments before 
a locomotive is delivered for all bidders increased 
from their initial bids.  Bombadier was slightly 
20 
increased from a high base and CSR, having the 
highest increase, followed by CNR and GE.” 
Now in order to make sense of that one must go the table 
at 144 at page 503.37.  Do you see that? 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 76 of 89 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So there we know that CSR was 
bidder 2 and there it reflects: 
“Total payments before acceptance for bidder 2, the 
initial proposal was 1.62%.” 
Do you see that? 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And that then increased, did it not? 
MR LAHER:   Correct. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   To a whopping 30%.  
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And at 149 Mr Callard says: 
“The increase begs the question as to how the final 
negotiations were conducted.” 
Perhaps if you can just explain to the Chairperson, how 
does one get from 1.62% to 30%?   Bearing in mind that 
these are people – oh, yes, so carry on? 
MR LAHER:   As part of the negotiation process, Chair, 
you started off at a point obviously and then bidders would 
submit proposals over a point of time.  When we started 
the negotiations remember there were many issues we had 
20 
to deal with.  Those issues related to the reduction of the 
batch increase in cost per escalation, the forex portion, the 
use of TE, etcetera.  That pricing was not part of the 
evaluation and was only provided during the negotiation 
phase, correctly or incorrectly. 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 77 of 89 
 
 
Now when they submitted their proposals as part of 
the negotiation phase, they would have submitted proposal 
with revised pricing now for inclusion of those elements as 
well as payment terms related to those proposals over a 
period of time and as part of the negotiation process.  They 
would negotiated different payment terms with different 
payment terms with different prices, so it was a part of a 
negotiation. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But I think my question is, how does 
one get to a situation where the advanced payment was 
10 
twenty times more than what they initially asked for? 
MR LAHER:   My understanding is the locomotives were 
meant to be delivered over a shorter period of time and the 
initial evaluation was much longer period of time.  So 
because it was a shorter period of time they needed higher 
advanced payment to set up the infrastructure. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Twenty times more? 
MR LAHER:   That is the basis upon which they provided. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And you know that that – what was 
the cost then to Transnet?  It was then paid out, was it 
20 
some R7 billion or something?  You would know. 
MR LAHER:   Total advance payments for all these – all 
the different bidders …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   7 billion. 
MR LAHER:   I cannot remember the exact number but 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 78 of 89 
 
possibly …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Without anything being delivered on 
a contract? 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now Mr Callard who has, as you 
know, has been around this industry for a long time, was 
truly shocked when he came to learn of this amount.  Do 
you want to comment on that? 
MR LAHER:   I guess he was not part of the negotiations, 
he did not know the process that was done in order to get 
10 
there.  As I say, it was a process of give and take and this 
is what they were proposing, if you want us to deliver 
quicker, you have got to give us bigger advance payments 
that we can bring our infrastructure here a bit quicker. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Laher, it gives one impression 
that it may give is that no proper – either no proper 
homework had been done when 1,62 percent was – thought 
was the right percentage and when somebody else who had 
done his or her proper homework came up, showed that 
20 
this 1.62% was really – had no foundation.  Either that or 
the people who came up with 1.62 had done their 
homework but there is some other reason why they agreed 
to 30%, that is difficult to understand because whatever 
was put on the table must be the kind of factors or things 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 79 of 89 
 
that would have been taken into account at arriving at 
1.62. 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it not? 
MR LAHER:   Ja.  Mr Chair, the 1.62% was based on the 
initial bid proposals that we came to as part of the tender 
process that were evaluated right up front, so this was part 
of the 2013 proposal that came through.  
 
The final 30% was post the negotiation process.  So 
through the negotiation process the bidders wanted more 
10 
upfront 
advance 
payments 
in 
order 
to 
set 
up 
their 
manufacturing facility. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I do not think the percentage should 
change, is it not, because if you say – if you say if you had 
put in a figure as opposed to a percentage and you had 
said, for example, it must be R1 million that is advance 
payment and then later on you agreed to R30 million and 
you say there was a change in the price, you know, the 
percentage might have remained the same. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  But if you put the percentage, 
one would have thought that you are taken into account 
everything and the percentage would remain the same or if 
there is a change, it would not be as drastic a change as 
this.  That is what one would have thought. 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 80 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:   Yes, Chair, so upfront it would have been a 
percentage of the bigger batch.  So, remember, it was – in 
the valuations it was a full batch of 599.  When we were 
doing the negotiations it is half a batch so therefore, there  
is that portion to take care of as well as well as the 
negotiations in terms of because you want a quicker 
delivery we need more cash upfront so that we can setup 
our manufacturing facilities quicker and that was the 
negotiations. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No but if it is half a batch, why 
10 
would you need fifteen times more advance payment?  
Surely it works the other way around? 
MR LAHER:   You need a  – I mean, it is a bigger 
percentage, it is a bigger …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Why?  It is half the batch. 
MR LAHER:   So mathematically, I suppose, and I am just 
trying to work this out in my head, 1% of a million is a 
certain amount …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am not ask you that.  Why would 
you need fifteen times more because you are delivering 
20 
half a batch? 
MR LAHER:   You would need more upfront.  
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Why? 
MR LAHER:   To setup the production facilities upfront and 
also just part – I think maybe it was part of a …[intervenes] 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 81 of 89 
 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But you would need a bigger 
production facility and you would need more cash if you 
were producing double batch. 
MR LAHER:   It would be probably the same production 
facility. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, precisely. 
MR LAHER:   It is the time period over which you are doing 
it. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So now it is down to time? 
MR LAHER:   Ja because now the batch is cut and the time 
10 
period for delivery is also cut. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But still, why do you need fifteen 
times more advance payment?  I mean, we are not talking 
about double. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   We are talking about potentially 
fifteen times more.  How is that possible? 
MR LAHER:   As I say, it was part of the negotiation 
process …[intervenes] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, no, we of course know that that 
20 
does not answer the question.  You style yourself as an 
eyewitness, you were there. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   So tell us what happened in these 
negotiations 
that 
caused 
someone 
to 
agree 
to 
30%

advance payment that causes Mr Callard to be shocked, 
someone who has been around this industry, who sees this 
as an outlier.   
MR LAHER:   So part of the process – and that is the 
explanation that was given to us by the bidders, that we 
need further amount upfront so that we can setup our 
production facility and also, if you give us more upfront, 
there is a discount in the price as part of the negotiation 
process.  So that is what they would have told us when we 
did the negotiations. 
10 
 
At the end of the day it was not me that accepted 
the proposal, it was obviously the steering committee that 
accepted the proposal that came from the bidders.  It was 
still something we were negotiating. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am not sure that I follow the 
explanation, Mr Laher.  It is quite strange, to say the least, 
but maybe you have said what you are able to say.  Mr 
Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, thank you.  Then I just want to 
deal with two other things.  The spreadsheets – let me just 
20 
take you perhaps directly to what Mr Callard’s criticism of 
your answer is so we can short circuit some of this.  Could 
you go back to the transcript please at page 791.83? 
CHAIRPERSON:   791 point? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   83. 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 83 of 89 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   83. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What Mr Callard says at line 16, is 
he says: 
“I highlighted numerous considerable anomalies in 
the spreadsheet.  This does not address any of the 
anomalies in the spreadsheet except for Mr Laher ’s 
statement 
that 
the 
recorded 
what 
the 
bidders 
provided.” 
And then he goes on at the foot of the page: 
“He got it from the bidders’ submissions and just 
10 
recorded it and I have not gone through poor 
statements 
like 
that. 
 
My 
statement 
on 
the 
spreadsheet is that they - stands that the anomalies 
in the spreadsheet still pertain if Mr Singh just – Mr 
Laher just recorded them, that is what he says, but 
it does not explain any of the anomalies.” 
So what he is saying, and you would have read this.  He 
says look, I understand what you say but I pointed out 
anomalies and you have done no more than say that you 
recorded what the bidders said.  What is your response to 
20 
that? 
MR LAHER:   So yes, it was recordal but I also pointed out 
anomalies.  As per my evidence yesterday, I pointed out a 
number of anomalies as part of the negotiation process 
and I raised those anomalies, as I said yesterday, with the 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 84 of 89 
 
batch pricing.  I raised the issue the manner it was in that 
and I raised the issue that we need to go back and 
evaluate because then we have a more market-related 
issue around the best pricing.  I raised the issue around 
the escalation so yes, I also raised these anomalies during 
the process, the spreadsheets for the outcome of the final 
pricing. 
ADV 
MYBURGH 
SC: 
 
 
You 
see, 
I 
think 
you 
mis…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not sure but I thought Mr Myburgh’s 
10 
question was more about what do you say to Mr Callard’s 
statement that all you could say was you were recording 
what 
the 
bidders 
said 
and 
you 
provided 
no 
further 
explanation.  Am I right, Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, that is correct, perhaps if I can 
pursue that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Let me take you to Mr Callard’s 
statement that is attached to the 3.3 notice.  At the 
beginning of the file, page 503.57.  Now we know that Mr 
20 
Callard deals with this at paragraph 208 but let me just 
give you two examples. 
 
208.4 Mr Callard says – and here he is dealing with 
the spreadsheets: 
“The foreign exchange components amounts…” 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 85 of 89 
 
Now we know you listed them and you get them from the 
bidders. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   But that is not the point, he says: 
“...used in the final negotiation spreadsheet would 
cause some of the locomotives not to meet local 
content requirement.” 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   He says well, you do not address 
that. 
10 
MR LAHER:   I do. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You simply say – well, this is what 
he is saying. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am giving you an opportunity. 
MR LAHER:   Yes, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   He saying the best answer you have 
is you simply record what the bidders said. 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And he says in so doing you are not 
20 
answering or dealing with the anomaly. 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What is your response to that? 
MR LAHER:   Right, I do deal with the anomaly in my 
statement, so specifically we look at 28.4, I did raise the 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 86 of 89 
 
issue about local content directly with Mr Jayne and Ms 
Maltese and I made it known to them that based on the 
pricing that has been offered, these bidders are not going 
to meet the local content requirements. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes but you – you again, Mr 
Callard’s point, he says in your answers to my concerns 
about the spreadsheet, all you say in relation to this is you 
record what the bidders said, but I pointed out an anomaly, 
which you have not dealt with. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Do you accept that you did not deal 
with the anomaly nor are you saying you did? 
MR LAHER:   I am saying I did in my statement.  I do not 
think we covered it yesterday but it was in [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   In dealing with paragraph 208.4? 
MR LAHER:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, we will come to that.  And then 
at paragraph …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you say you dealt with it you are 
20 
not saying your raised it because Mr Callard is concerned 
about you not providing an explanation. 
MR LAHER:   Right, right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you saying you did provide an 
explanation? 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 87 of 89 
 
MR LAHER:   I did provide an explanation in my statement 
and I raised the issue.  I think it is in one of the 
paragraphs in my statement. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Alright and then let us go, for 
example, to 208.6.   
“The 
diesel 
negotiated 
price 
recon 
worksheet 
contains inexplicable discounts on exchange rate 
impact and escalation.”  
What do you say to that? 
MR LAHER:   Well, as per my statement yesterday you will 
10 
see that that particular sheet meant nothing, it was an 
illustrative calculation and it did not go anywhere.  It was 
purely illustrative calculation to see where we started and 
where we ended, so that sheet meant nothing. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   And then last thing that I want to just 
deal with is the reconciliation of the business case and this 
is the paragraph where Mr Callard states that he did not 
think you were forthcoming with the information. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Now you would have read the 
20 
transcript.  Perhaps I can again just take you directly to 
what Mr Callard’s concern ultimately seems to have been.  
If you go to page 791.81.  He says at line 7: 
“Insofar as the process goes I stand by my point, if 
Mr Laher had knowledge of the spreadsheets and 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 88 of 89 
 
detailed information, that he was bound by the 
confidentiality agreement but could have highlighted 
that to the evaluation group that we could then 
either had access to that and proceeded on a more 
informed basis with our evaluation.” 
So you would have seen what his complaint was ultimately. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   What do you say to that? 
MR LAHER:   In my statement I said I did tell them I was 
bound by a confidentiality agreement. 
10 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   No.  Okay, well I mean, his point is 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did tell him? 
MR LAHER:   That I was bound by a confidentiality 
agreement. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You told Mr Callard that? 
MR LAHER:   Ja, I think I did say that in my statement, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Well, he seems to indicate from his 
perspective – and I must just put his version to you. 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
20 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   That you did not do that. 
MR LAHER:   And I say I did. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   You disagree? 
MR LAHER:   Ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Chairperson, we have no further 
22 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 289 
 
Page 89 of 89 
 
questions, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you.  Thank you, Mr Laher, 
for coming.  If we need you again we will ask you to come 
back but thank you very much, you are now excused. 
MR LAHER:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Myburgh? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Yes, Chairperson, I had asked that 
we adjourn now and then reconvene tomorrow to hear the 
evidence of Mr Mahlangu. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Mr Mahlangu is available at nine 
10 
o’clock if you would prefer to get an earlier start, it being a 
Friday, but we are entirely in your hands. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, that is fine, I think let us 
start the usual time, ten o’clock, ja. 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   Thank you, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We – you do not have an idea how long 
he might be, hey?  Maybe two hours? 
ADV MYBURGH SC:   I am confident that he will – we 
should be completed with his evidence by lunchtime. 
CHAIRPERSON:   By lunchtime, ja.  Okay, alright.  Thank 
20 
you, we will adjourn for the day.  We adjourn.
