PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 28 JANUARY 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Pretorius, good 
morning everybody. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Good morning Chair.  Our apologies 
for the late start.  We had to deal in chambers with a 
particular matter that required immediate attention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is fine. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And it will be dealt with again in 
due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Good morning Ms K are you 
10 
there?  Ms K are you there? 
MS K:  Yes Chair yes.  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can you hear me? 
MS K:  Good morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay good morning.  The oath you took 
yesterday will continue to apply today you understand? 
MS K:  Yes I do understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you; you may proceed Mr 
Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Just to – I have been asked to 
20 
place on housekeeping matter on record.  Chair yesterday 
Counsel for a witness addressed you and was referred to 
as Counsel for SSA that particular Counsel represented a 
witness who is unnamed but not SSA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  No I apologise – I apologise.  
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 4 of 163 
 
There are many Counsel and I am not able to keep their 
names – all of them at the same time.  But thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am – we apologise for that error.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Ms K you have before you your 
statement Exhibit YY9 and we had reached paragraph 5.16 
MS K:  Was it my statement or Mr Y’s statement? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes of Mr Y’s statement annexed to 
your statement. 
MS K:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If you go to paragraph… 
MS K:  I have it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  If you go to paragraph 
5.16 I do not intend to make you responsible for the maths 
of Mr Y but the statement is made there: 
“That it is highly likely that this project and 
it is the Protection of the Presidential 
aircraft that has been referred to was not 
catered for in the CDIS Chief Directorate 
for Internal Security budget owing to the 
20 
fact 
that 
protection 
of 
the 
Presidential 
aircraft did not fall within the SSA’s duly 
authorised mandate.” 
 
Do you accept the correctness of that proposition? 
MS K:  Yes I do.  I do. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 5 of 163 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It continues to read: 
“At 
an 
organisational 
level 
the 
CDIS 
incurred 
approximately 
R1.5 
million 
per 
month in unplanned expenditure.  Given 
that the entire CDIS operational budget for 
25 – 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 financial 
years was R48 million and R38 million 
respectively this means that almost 40% of 
the CDIS budget was redirected from other 
operational activities in order to meet the 
10 
requirement of this project for the alleged 
protection of the Presidential aircraft.” 
 
We have done our own calculations for one year it 
would have been below 40% and for the next year above 
40% but generally speaking what do you say about those 
allegations in paragraph 5.16? 
MS K:  I – I agree in – with what is contained in that 
paragraph even with in terms of the amounts because that 
was obtained directly from a report that was compiled by 
Johan. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Okay thank you.   
MS K:  In response to our questions.  Yes so I can – I have 
no problems to question that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Let us go then to 
paragraph 5.17.   
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 6 of 163 
 
MS K:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  The affidavit of Mr Y states: 
“Rather 
than 
fulfilling 
its 
function 
of 
protecting the Agency from internal threats 
the 
CDIS 
during 
Johan’s 
tenure 
was 
weakened and the integrity of its vetting 
process was eroded.  CDIS members were 
wittingly 
or 
unwittingly 
complicit 
in 
facilitating the abuse of SSA resources.  
This 
included 
enabling 
CDSO 
members’ 
10 
illegal access to firearms, the transport of 
cash, the transportation of cash for CDSO 
operations and involvement in a parallel 
vetting structure.” 
 
What is your comment in relation to that part of 
paragraph 5.17 Ms K? 
MS K:  I agree with it 100% there is also accounts on 
statements and everything.  So that has happened; that 
has been the impact. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  And the last sentence 
20 
reads: 
“CDIS members were also implicated in the 
robbery of R17 million from a safe inside 
the SSA complex at Masanda in December 
2015.” 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 7 of 163 
 
 
Your comment in relation to that? 
MS K:  Yes it did happen and we did get input from Johan 
himself on this in detail and this was confirmed by him as 
well that the people were – are within his unit but those 
people remain there currently. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes and that has already been dealt 
with to a limited extent in other evidence and perhaps will 
be dealt with further. 
 
Under the head A shift in Intelligence Philosophy 
the affidavit of Mr Y continues in paragraph 5.18.  I will 
10 
read the conclusion in 5.18 and then ask you to comment 
Ms K.   
“In conclusion the constitution together with 
legislative and policy prescripts including 
the Presidential handbook clearly set out 
the mandates of the various security cluster 
stakeholders. The extension of the mandate 
of the SSA through internal reconfiguring of 
the CDSO and the external usurpation of 
the functions of the South African Military 
20 
and Health Services and the SAPS – SAPS 
Presidential Protection Unit breached this 
architecture.  The irregular establishment 
and implementation of Presidential Security 
Support Services this Toxicology Unit and a 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 8 of 163 
 
Static Security Force for the protection of 
the 
Presidential 
aircraft 
disrupted 
the 
reporting lines for duly assigned functions 
and thereby undermined accountability.” 
 
Do you have a comment in relation to that Ms K? 
MS K:  I agree with the conclusion.  Ja that is all I am 
saying for now. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  Paragraph 5.9 reads: 
“The 
directive 
for 
Presidential 
Security 
Support 
became 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
10 
consumers of SSA resources.  Members of 
the Chief Directorate Special Operations 
and the so called co-workers who were 
irregularly recruited and trained by CDSO 
travelled extensively using valuable state 
resources without providing any intelligence 
or information back to the SSA in support of 
its sanctioned mandate.  Project Veza or 
the Project Veza investigation has found no 
discernable benefit to the SSA or the Nation 
20 
from these activities.” 
 
Your comment in relation to that paragraph? 
MS K:  My comment is that I agree with everything that is 
00:09:20 in that paragraph particularly if you consider that 
the people that were tasked with leading these various 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 9 of 163 
 
projects were especially SSA members they were actually 
in junior positions that made to act in positions that are 
four levels higher.  So there were benefitting in terms of 
acting allowance and then further than – furthermore there 
was 
then 
the 
travel 
allowance 
and 
everything 
that 
pertained to travelling all around wherever the President 
and the Deputy President were.  So it is – I do agree with 
that – that the – it was the greatest consumer because if 
you look at the schedule of those the two number 1 and 
number 2 of the country it would translate into a whole lot 
10 
of expenditure. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  Then in 5.20 several 
further observations are made and again I will read them to 
you.   
“The cost of this increase in security not 
only 
lies 
in 
the 
actual 
rand 
value 
expenditure but also the cost of weakened 
state 
functioning 
with 
the 
eroding 
of 
legitimate structures.  The duplication of 
services 
strained 
relations 
between 
20 
stakeholders and inadvertently led to a 
paralysis of the legitimate functionaries 
whose responsibility the security of the 
President actually is.  This duplication also 
led 
to 
a 
disabling 
of 
legitimate 
SSA 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 10 of 163 
 
resources 
by 
under 
capacitating 
crucial 
functions within the Agency where the SSA 
does have a role to play in the protection of 
the President such as irregular – such as 
regular 
intelligence 
assessments 
these 
were functions that would ordinarily be 
carried out by legitimate SSA operational 
arms such as the Special Events Unit, 
Operational Support, the Chief Directorate 
Intelligence Management and the Foreign 
10 
branch.” 
 
Do you have any comment on the observations 
made in that paragraph? 
MS K:  I agree with the observations. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Do I understand it correctly in order 
to clarify not only did the SANDF and the SAPS have 
security functions and capacity for Protection Services of 
the nature that you have dealt with or have been dealt with 
but also the State Security Agency itself had units that 
could have dealt with some or all of these security 
20 
functions that the CDSO dealt with? 
MS K:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 5.21 makes a further and 
quite different observation.  It reads: 
“The greatest risk however is that unskilled, 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 11 of 163 
 
unvetted persons were deployed within the 
inner perimeter of Presidential security.  
The principle client, the President was 
guided by individuals with no coherent 
approach to intelligence or competence to 
assist with proper policy making.  There 
was at best a haphazard approach to the 
work undertaken by CDSO a stark contrast 
to the way in which the legitimate activities 
of the SSA are carried out.  Intelligence is a 
10 
deliberate effort yet there is no indication 
that any of the CDSO’s work was informed 
by thorough planning and scanning efforts 
for intelligence assessments.  Moreover the 
Agency was aware of this and nothing was 
done to curb this risk from within.  On the 
contrary those entrusted with responsibility 
for protecting the integrity of the SSA’s 
internal 
security 
such 
as 
the 
Chief 
Directorate Internal Security CDIS appeared 
20 
to have been complicit in the CDSO’s 
bypassing 
of 
official 
accountability 
structures.” 
 
Do you have any comment in relation to that? 
MS K:  I agree fully with the paragraph in as far as it goes 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 12 of 163 
 
to intelligence assessments that 00:14:13 that line but 
where it says the Agency was aware of this and nothing 
was done to clamp the risk from within I would like to 
disagree with that because looking at the documentation I 
have seen that there were efforts by among others 
Ambassador Kudjoe to get the – the CFO’s to exercise 
more controls in terms of the spending.  They were also 
attempts by other senior managers to get CDSO to 
account. 
 
I 
saw 
a 
whole 
lot 
of 
numerous 
budget 
management committee minutes which indicated how many 
10 
times the issue of CDSO not even having an APP. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  What is an APP? 
MS K:  Was raised and the issue of – so based on that the 
– I could go – I could cite other examples.  I cannot say 
that nothing was done to curb the risk from within.  There 
were instances I just want to make one last example on 
this.  There was an 00:15:36 yesterday we talked about 
Khusela where a person was withdrawing R1.8 million a 
month.  In this instance one individual from CDSO was 
taking this money every month but they were not settling 
20 
that – those TA’s; they kept taking the money.  An official, 
a senior official from Finance wrote in red pen – in red ink 
on the TA that this member must not be given another TA 
until they settle. It was I think it was the 4 t h of whatever 
month and year.  On the 5 t h the CFO overrode that and 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 13 of 163 
 
approved that the person takes the money.  So there were 
efforts but there were also an egress in this – in this 
respect. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  What is an APP? 
MS K:  It is an Annual Performance Plan. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Of course if one looks at 
the deployment of the persons who were deployed for 
security purposes for the then President and others.  If 
their role was to defend and protect the comments made in 
paragraph 5.21 you say – well it may be argued are 
10 
appropriate. But if they had another role what one might 
term an offensive or activist role would your comment be 
the same? 
MS K:  Could you please repeat the last part of your 
question? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  One understands the comments 
made in paragraph 5.21 where one assesses the functions 
of the CDSO in terms. 
MS K:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Defending or protecting the persons 
20 
they were directed to defend or protect.  But is the role 
was different – if the role of those who were deployed 
under the CDSO was an offensive or aggressive or a 
different type of activist role would your comment be the 
same? 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 14 of 163 
 
MS K:  Yes either way whether – in which whatever way 
you work if you were working in a regulated environment so 
my comments would still be the same.  Maybe I should also 
make an example in terms of the first line where we talk 
about unskilled, unvetted persons in relation to the co-
workers.  What I can say is that I have seen several CV’s 
of some of the co-workers and most of those people – 
some of those people actually do not even have matric but 
they were getting R40 000.00 a month cash.  And the 
unvetted part is linked to the parallel vetting structure that 
10 
Mr Dlomo established in his office as the – the DDG 
Counter Intelligence and in this process there are several 
– the co-workers were vetted including some senior 
managers and irregularly so and they were issued with fake 
security clearance certificates which were signed by Mr 
Dlomo.  So based on all of that I do agree with that part 
that they were working in a haphazard way.  All of the 
acting senior managers that I have – in terms of the 
implicated individuals that the team has interviewed none 
of them could point me to an Annual Performance Plan.  So 
20 
without an Annual Performance Plan how is the budget 
then allocated to CDSO?  How is CDSO able to expend all 
of the money – the millions that they have expended 
without an APP and a loaded budget?  So I actually align 
myself with all that.  The only issue that I have in that 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 15 of 163 
 
paragraph is what I already covered in terms of nothing 
was done. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Can we just confirm and I 
know it is very difficult for you because you are asked 
questions in relation to your confirmation of allegations but 
any additional allegations. 
MS K:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If we could leave those for your 
supplementary affidavit.  If we could just exercise some 
caution there. 
10 
MS K:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  But … 
MS K:  Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps we should confirmed that 
earlier.  Paragraph 5.22: 
“The 
over 
reach 
of 
the 
SSA’s 
duly 
authorised mandate by the CDSO and the 
Presidential Security Support Service in 
particular reflects a shift in intelligence 
philosophy during this period.” 
20 
 
I think that has been said several times.  We need 
not go to that observation for the moment.   
“But the deployment of improperly vetted 
and 
trained 
individuals 
with 
exclusive 
reporting lines to Ambassador Dlomo and 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 16 of 163 
 
thereafter to the former President resulted 
in the creation of a personal force at the 
disposal of Ambassador Dlomo with State 
resources.” 
 
You agree with that? 
MS K:  Yes I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  It continues. 
MS K:  I agree with that Sir. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you.  It continues: 
“During this period the focus of the Security 
10 
Cluster shifted from the security of all the 
people in South Africa to the security and 
kenner (it reads) of one individual former 
President Zuma.” 
 
Do you agree with that? 
MS K:  I would not agree with the part of the security 
cluster.  I do not have information that would confirm that 
the security cluster was – they shifted their focus to that.  
But I could say that the SSA resources were reallocated 
sort of because just for the benefit of President Zuma.  But 
20 
in as far as it extends to the security cluster I will not align 
myself with that statement. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  That is a fair comment insofar as 
the security cluster deals with a range of organisations or 
entities including SANDF, SAPS and the like. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 17 of 163 
 
MS K:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Perhaps if .. 
MS K:  Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  And I – what I understand you to 
say that if though security cluster was replaced by SSA you 
would have more comfort with that statement, am I correct? 
MS K:  I would not want to say the SSA because it is not 
the entire SSA that was doing this.  It is elements within 
the SSA.  So I would rather say of the SSA some of the 
SSA resources were redirected or CDSO clearly. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right thank you for that. 
MS K:  But I cannot say it is the entire SSA. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you for that clarification.  
The paragraph continues: 
“The fact that the services were stopped 
when President Ramaphosa entered office 
demonstrates 
that 
these 
services 
were 
indeed established and operated for the 
sole protection of former President Zuma.” 
 
Given the qualification that you have made to these 
20 
services the CDSO and some SSA services and subject to 
that qualification what do you say about that observation? 
MS K:  I think it is – it is true.  It is an accurate 
observation because it is drawn from an actual interview 
with one of the people that was involved in one of – in 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 18 of 163 
 
some of these activities who indicated that when – after 
Nazrec their submissions were not approved for guarding 
the Presidential plane and when they asked for reasons 
they were told that it is because President Zuma is no 
longer President.  So based on that statement which is on 
record elsewhere I would align myself with this conclusion. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Right.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms K did you say that 
somebody said the CDSO after Nazrec did not – was not 
allocated money or budget, is that what you said? 
10 
MS K:  No that is not what I said Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please repeat what you said? 
MS K:  The CDSO was – maybe a bit of background if I am 
allowed Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS K:  By the CDSO was “closed” in 2016 when Mr Arthur 
Fraser arrived.  But the projects continued. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry … 
MS K:  Continued to run. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When 00:26:77 arrived? 
20 
MS K:  So there was still money… 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry I –  
MS K:  Mr Arthur Fraser. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Ms K.  You say the CDSO was 
closed in 2016 when something or somebody arrived.  I did 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 19 of 163 
 
not hear what you said would you repeat that? 
MS K:  When DG – former DG Fraser arrived. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS K:  He closed down CDSO.  It was said that he closed 
down CDSO however some of the functions that were under 
CDSO continued including the guarding of the Presidential 
plane and the protection side to a limited extent I think.  
But on the fire – the aircraft issue the individuals that we 
interviewed 
indicated 
that 
they 
wanted 
– 
they 
were 
applying as usual.  They submitted a submission for 
10 
approval for travel as usual and that was turned down and 
when they asked because it fell under IS the project when 
they asked whoever was responsible for IS at the time they 
were told that there is now – it is now a new President; 
President Zuma has left office.  So that is when the project 
ended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the individuals you are talking about 
were they individuals who were members of CDIS or what 
unit were they members of? 
MS K:  It is members of the CDIS. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you were… 
MS K:  Because you remember Chair there is a paragraph 
that – remember Chair there is a paragraph that – 5.16 that 
talks about the funding of the project of the – of guarding 
the Presidential plane from the CDIS. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 20 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS K:  Budget.  So it was a member from CDIS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS K:   Who was doing that.  So at some point there was 
collaboration between CDIS and CDSO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS K:  On certain matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright .  So this member said that I 
guess he or she and others in CDIS when they requested 
money for travelling or other such monies in order to do 
10 
what they believed was their work they were not given or 
those requests were not approved and when they asked 
why they were told that it was because Mr Jacob Zuma was 
no longer President.  Is that what you were told? 
MS K:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  After the CDSO had been closed 
in 2016 may I find out whether its activities continued 
under some other unit or did they cease in regarding of the 
aeroplane, of the Presidential Aircraft? 
MS K:   Well, we are told by some of the implicated 
20 
individuals and members of CDSO that they were – when 
they were closed down, they were instructed to hand over all 
of their documents to Mr Arthur Fraser’s office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS K:   I think that these are the documents that we have 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 21 of 163 
 
managed to find now.  However, the projects continued 
running because there was still money expended in the 
2017/2018 under CDSO’s budget.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But now when these activities continued 
after the CDSO had been closed, under what unit were they 
being continued?  Do you know? 
MS K:   It was under the DG’s office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS K:   That is the impression I got.  They were now 
reporting to the DG’s office.  In fact, a lot of the – said she 
10 
was sort of like a representative for CDSO in that office.  But 
the person who was running the guarding of the Presidential 
plane said they had explained the project to Mr Fraser but he 
then said they must report to him on that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS K:   So that continued. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Thank you.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms K, paragraph 
5.2.3 reads: 
“The 
High-Level 
Review 
Panel 
on 
the 
SSA 
20 
recommended that the broad interpretation of the 
SSA mandate should be reviewed. 
This is a sentiment that is echoed by the Project 
Veza Investigation Team in light of the impunity with 
which individuals acted at the cost of National 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 22 of 163 
 
Security.” 
 
That is an observation of a general nature.  Do you have 
any comment? 
MS K:   I have no comment. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you agree with it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   [Indistinct]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
MS K:   I have a challenge with the issue of the – as the 
same mandate.  I do not know whether the mandate needs to 
10 
be reviewed or its – what needs to be reviewed is how they 
uphold that mandate and how to execute that mandate. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MS K:   So I am finding myself in a difficult position where, if 
you say in broad interpretation it must be reviewed.  I guess 
they base that on something but for me I think the mandate 
is clear.  It is about how not to abuse it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   That is my understanding. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I understand.  You are saying that 
20 
the mandate is there.  It is in law.  It is in the policies and 
procedures.  It is what is done within the SSA that you would 
focus on it.  Do I understand you correctly? 
MS K:   Yes, sir. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us then move to a different topic 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 23 of 163 
 
and that is the particular operations of the CDSO that was 
the 
subject 
or 
that 
were 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
Veza 
Investigation.  Before we get to the particular topics, the 
affidavit deals with a number of a general matters and I will 
put these to you from paragraph 6.1 onwards. 
 
Paragraph 6.1 reads: 
“During 
the 
period 
2012 
to 
2018, 
the 
CDSO 
undertook a number of counterintelligence projects 
and operations. 
The Project Veza Team has evaluated these projects 
10 
and operations from a number of aspects, including 
their 
alignment 
with 
the 
SSA 
and/or 
CDSO’s 
mandate. 
Their 
compliance 
with 
policy 
prescripts 
and 
processes for establishment. 
The controls supplied to the disbursement of funds. 
And 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
operational 
activities 
purportedly carried out.” 
 
Is 
that 
a 
fair 
summary 
of 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
investigations under Project Veza? 
20 
MS K:   Yes, it is.  It is Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  And there follow in paragraph 
6.2 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Ms K, I take it that you would 
not agree completely paragraph 6.1, particularly the first line 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 24 of 163 
 
insofar as it suggests that CDSO continued beyond 2016 
because it says: 
““During the 
period 
2012 to 
2018, the 
CDSO 
undertook a number of counterintelligence projects 
and operations.” 
 
Whereas you just told me that in 2016, CDSO was 
closed down by Mr Fraser. 
MS K:   I also did indicate Chair that those operations still 
continued although CDSO purportedly closed.  Some of the 
operations continues.  Hence there were funds expended in 
10 
the 2017/2018 financial year.  So and this is also the period 
within which we, the project, the scope of the project was 
focussing.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but what I am suggesting to you is 
that. If you are correct in saying CDSO was closed down in 
2016, it cannot be correct to say in 2017/2018 CDSO 
continued to undertake projects.  It could be that after it was 
closed down it was individuals who used to fall under CDSO 
who continued those projects or another unit or office took 
over the activities of CDSO.  Would you agree with that? 
20 
MS K:   Yes, I do agree Chair.  That is actually accurate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS K:   That is accurate.  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Paragraph 6.2.   
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 25 of 163 
 
MS K:   [Indistinct] [Break in transmission] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you wish to add anything Ms K? 
MS K:   Yes, on the issue that Judge just raised which I 
agree with.  I just wanted to indicate that some of the 
submissions to which cash for projects like that may be 
used, that happened after the closure of CDSO.   
 
Actually, when we received the submission, they still 
quote CDSO in the motivation and background.  And some of 
these projects were then moved to CSU because the Cover 
Support Unit when Mr Fraser arrived, established the Cover 
10 
Support Unit in his office which then took over these 
projects.  I just wanted to clarify that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you say which took over the 
projects, you mean which took over the CDSO projects? 
MS K:   Yes.  Some.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us get that clear.  Are you saying 
that this unit...  What did you call it?  Cover Unit? 
MS K:   The Cover Support Unit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the Cover Support Unit, as you say, 
was created.  Are you saying it took – it basically took over 
20 
the work that was done by CDSO or are you saying over 
some of the projects that CDSO had been carry on or 
carrying out? 
MS K:   I think for accuracy purposes Chair.  I should just 
say that.  Remember when we dealt with the architecture 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 26 of 163 
 
yesterday? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS K:   Is that it appears she was moved into ESCO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS K:   So with the closure of ESCO and the arrival of 
Mr Fraser, he then established CSU in his office.  So they 
were reporting to him.  So I cannot CDSO was fully 
continuing with all the work because some of the admin staff 
in that office was involved in the same operation.  So it was 
under that umbrella, DG’s office, CSU that some of the 
10 
projects of CDSO still continued.  I do not know if I am clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no.  I understand.  You are 
saying the CSU which means – which refers to the Cover 
Support Unit that you say was established after Mr Fraser’s 
arrival, took over some of the projects that had been under 
CDSO but you are not able to say he took over all of them.  
Is that right? 
MS K:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Pretorius. 
MS K:   Yes, sir. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you Mr Pretorius.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms K, if we can 
go to paragraph 6.2. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Which contains at least four general 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 27 of 163 
 
observations about the CDSO’s operational activities.  These 
are general conclusions which will be detailed in due course.   
 
6.2.1: 
“...is 
the 
documentary 
motivation 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
projects 
was 
entirely 
inadequate.  
 The establishment documents for these projects 
contained only a generic or encapsulating reference 
to the SSA’s counterintelligence mandate.” 
 
It is a general statement and perhaps an absolute 
10 
statement but do you have a comment? 
MS K:   I do not have a comment except to say I accept that 
observation. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
MS K:   I agree with it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  6.2.2.2 reads: 
“No or limited detail was disclosed regarding the 
proposed plans and outcomes of these operational 
activities and there are conflicting accounts of the 
projects “deliverables””. 
20 
 
Do you have a comment? 
MS K:   That is true. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   6.2. ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   6.2.2 is accurate. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am sorry.  I interrupted you.  You 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 28 of 163 
 
said Ms K? 
MS K:   No, I was just saying 6.2.2. is accurate.  I agree with 
it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   6.2.3 reads: 
“There is no record of how or when or what 
intelligence was provided to the client if any as a 
result of these activities.” 
MS K:   That is true. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   6.3.4 reads: 
“The operational activities undertaken exceeded the 
10 
mandate of the SSA and at times constituted 
conduct that undermined the very core of the 
Constitution, was manifestly unlawful and involved 
criminality.” 
 
Your comment? 
MS K:   I agree with that statement. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 6.3. reads: 
“The SSA has policy prescripts setting out the 
regular 
procedures 
to 
be 
followed 
for 
the 
establishments of all projects including the deep 
20 
cover projects. 
In comparing the policy and regulatory prescript with 
the establishment and management of the CDSO 
projects 
identified 
below, 
the 
Project 
Veza 
Investigation Team found that the majority, if not all 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 29 of 163 
 
of these projects, were established in breach of 
these regulations.” 
 
That part of paragraph 6.3, what is your comment? 
MS K:   I agree with that.  That that was our finding. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 6.3.3 continues: 
“Further, the grounds provided for the establishment 
of these projects make generic references to the 
counterintelligence mandate to the SSA. 
This deliberate vagueness emerges as a trend 
across CDSO projects. 
10 
The attempts to comply or at least appeared to 
comply with policy prescripts increasingly appeared 
to 
be 
aimed 
at 
meeting 
only 
the 
minimum 
requirements for gaining authorisation to access 
funds.” 
 
Your comments in that regard? 
MS K:   That is also accurate. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Could I ask this in clarification of 
what is said here?  The real purpose of the project was that 
stated in the motivation always or sometimes or never? 
20 
MS K:   It was sometimes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
MS K:   No such submissions actually required or requested 
that the projects be established.  We were being basically 
given generic kind of statements, you know, referring to that 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 30 of 163 
 
counterintelligence mandate.   
 
It is only in certain instances where maybe there is an 
operational plan that is attached or just a one-liner in the 
submission itself that indicates somehow what that project is 
about.  Note that it for these kind of projects it is not 
necessarily required that you give all of the detail but at 
least in the operational plan as it is – you have to also justify 
whatever expenditure, you know.  There needs to be some 
moment in it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us then deal with paragraph 6.4 
10 
which gives an example of what you are testifying about and 
what Mr Y has stated in the affidavit.   
 
6.4 reads: 
“By way of example, the submissions motivating for 
the establishment of Project Construção, Project 
Mayibuye and Project Wave discussed below all 
contained the same wording, were all authorised by 
the same individuals and were all approved on the 
same day, 23 January 2015.” 
 
These submissions for the establishment of Project 
20 
Construção, 
Project 
Mayibuye 
and 
Project 
Wave 
are 
contained in the SSA bundle at the reference given and I 
would like to ask you to go there, please.   
MS K:   Yes, sir.  I am there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Annexure CO appears in SSA-01 at 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 31 of 163 
 
page 248.   
MS K:   Yes.  I have got it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   On page 249 is a declassified 
document dated 12 December 2014.  What is this document? 
MS K:   It is a request - it is a submission and a request for 
authorisation of the establishment of the Cover Project and 
payment of the later expenses for Project Construção.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Just go to paragraph 2.1 on that 
page.  Well, what is this document, firstly? 
MS K:   It is a submission requesting establishment of Cover 
10 
Project which is Project Construção.  But what I do not 
understand is, it talks about payment of related expenses but 
I think that is not here not there.  So when – in terms of our 
operational directives.   
 
You are supposed to have an operational claim which is 
attached here as you will see on page 253.  But that 
document should then go through the – with its budget.   
 
Go through the CFO first for certification.  And then once 
that is done the strategic under the submission for a project 
to be established will then be compiled and with the 
20 
operational claim attached.  So this is the submission for 
that purpose.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  I just – I do not want to go 
into too much detail but if you look at paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2 
which appear to contain the motivation for the establishment 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 32 of 163 
 
of the projects. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Those are general statements which 
deal with the Special Operations mandate or activities.  Do 
you see that? 
MS K:   I see that.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In other words ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   But also ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MS K:   Yes? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, please answer. 
MS K:   No, continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There is no specific ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   Now let me listen first. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay good.  There is no specific 
reference in paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2 to exactly what it is 
intended the project to do.  Is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And 2.1 and 2.2 are statements of a 
high-level and general nature.  Is that correct? 
20 
MS K:   Yes.  Yes, sir. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So in this motivation, do you see 
anywhere an explanation to those who are asked to approve 
the project to exactly what the project is going to do?  You 
have described what the project entailed? 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 33 of 163 
 
MS K:   Well ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Does that appear here? 
MS K:   On 2.2 I think the second paragraph it starts with: 
“The covert nature of the project is intended to 
protect identification of personnel, resources and 
intelligence gathering as such early environmental 
scaling exercise would be undertaken by CDSO 
operatives into the intended location as of the 13t h 
of December.   
Full swing operations around the project are to 
10 
begin 
from 
the 
1s t of January 2015 
to 
the 
31 s t  of January 2016.”   
 
So that does not tell me exactly what these people would 
be doing in any case.  An environmental scaling is done at 
the SSA anyway.  You do not need Cover Project for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That sentence Ms K, the sentence starting 
with the covert nature of the project... 
“The covert nature of the project is intended to 
protect identification of personnel, resources and 
intelligence gathering...” 
20 
 
I am not sure I understand what it means but maybe you 
do.  I would ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   Neither do I Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I would have thought that it is the 
activities that will be engaged that dictate whether the 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 34 of 163 
 
project should be a covert one or not and not that it will be 
the protection of the identities.  Do you understand what I 
am saying? 
MS K:   Chair, I can hardly hear you.  I apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not hear me? 
MS K:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I am saying.  I would have thought 
that what determines whether a project will be a covert one, 
would be the activities that will be undertaken rather than – 
the sentence seems to say, we have made this project, a 
10 
covert project in order to protect the identities of personnel 
and so on.  Do I misunderstand how these things work? 
MS K:   Chair, I do not even understand what the intent is 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS K:   So these are the kinds of motivations that would be 
given. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS K:   And when you look at the activities that were 
disclosed to us by several members of CDSO, including the 
20 
project manager of this project, it is more like it was training.  
It ends up being portrayed as a training exercise.   
 
But how do you train people for a whole entire year?  
And if it gives about training on – in terms of gathering 
whatever.  Then it should have been done maybe – we do 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 35 of 163 
 
have an academy that could have done that, I think.   
 
So this is what we were saying.  In terms of those 
observations that we read out, the pictures give a general 
thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the reason why I am attracted to it 
because I do not understand what it says or I am not sure 
that I follow its reasoning.   
 
And I am linking that with the point – with a point which 
maybe is a point that may be made from what you have said, 
namely that when they sought to establish the certain 
10 
projects, the motivation would be very vague and so on.   
 
And I wonder whether the motivation here might well 
reflect maybe a certain lack of understanding of certain 
issues.  But you said you also do not understand it.  Is that 
right? 
MS K:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Do you struggle to hear me Ms K? 
MS K:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms K? 
MS K:   Excuse me Chair? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you struggle to hear me when I am 
speaking? 
MS K:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MS K:   Yes, Chairperson. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 36 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I am going to ask the technicians to 
try and do something about it and maybe during the tea 
break so that you can hear me clearly when I am speaking.  
Thank you.  Continue Mr Pretorius  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  In your answers 
to the Chair, Ms K.  You highlighted an aspect of the 
evidence of Mr Y and your comments in relation thereto, in 
relation to these motivations that we are dealing with now.  
And you mentioned that, if you look at the motivation and 
you compare it to your knowledge of what the project 
10 
actually entailed, there seems to be a gap.  Is that correct? 
MS K:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In other words.  Let me put the 
question in another way. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you take into account what you 
learnt 
what 
Project 
Construção 
actually 
did, 
provided 
security to named individuals as the evidence has been.  Is 
that anywhere made clear in this motivation? 
MS K:   No, it is not.  Not in my view. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And by way of a further example.  If 
you go to page 356.   
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is Annexure MO referred to in 
the paragraph. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 37 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   356 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of Bundle 1? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Bundle 1, yes.  Apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   356? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  356.    
MS K:   Yes, I am there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is a motivation for the 
establishment of a covert project and payment of expenses 
for Project Mayibuye.  Do you see that? 
10 
MS K:   Yes.  Yes, I see that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is dated the 20t h of January 2015.  
There are similar general ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...statements made in paragraph 2.1 
and 2.2.  In part, word for word the same, in fact, as those in 
the previous document that we referred to in relation to 
Project Construção.  Do you see that? 
MS K:   Yes, I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Given what you know of the 
20 
activities of Project Mayibuye.  Are these projects and the 
nature of these projects clearly set out in this motivation? 
MS K:   I think partly.  If you look at 2.2.  It says: 
“The 
above 
approved 
projects 
is 
in 
line 
with 
continuing strengthening of the operations within 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 38 of 163 
 
South 
African 
borders 
with 
an 
aim 
gathering, 
influencing, penetrating and neutralising any form or 
potential 
threat 
capable 
of 
destabilising 
the 
democratic rule of the Republic of South Africa.  The 
covert nature of the project intended to strengthen 
State Authority in light of recent incidents that seek 
to undermine government, stakeholders and national 
key points.” 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The detail of ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   So this is – this is a bit different from what they 
10 
wrote in ...[indistinct]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    Yes, in part it is the same, in part it 
is different, correct?   
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    The detailed nature of the projects 
conducted under the Project Mayibuye is that set out or are 
those set out clearly in this motivation for the establishment 
of the project? 
MS K:   No, they are not Chair and I must also point out that 
it can be common practice not to go into detail in the 
20 
submission itself because the submission to – for a covert 
project to be established will also be seen by maybe people 
in Finance, you know throughout the chain of command so 
that is why there is that part of the operational plan that it is 
supposed to maybe get more linked in terms of what the 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 39 of 163 
 
project aims to do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    Do you know if ...[intervenes]     
MS K:   But in this case ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I’m sorry. 
MS K:   Pardon? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I’m sorry, I interrupted you, you said 
but in this case? 
MS K:   In this case when they looked at the operational plan 
in page 316 for Mayibuye in terms of the aims it says in 1.2  
...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, page 316 operational plan for 
Project Mayibuye, paragraph 1.2? 
MS K:   Yes.  It reads: 
“The plan is in support of proposed projects which 
seeks to consume the strengthening of operations 
between 
South 
Africa’s 
democratic 
environment 
against 
any 
gathering 
influencing, 
penetrating, 
neutralise any form of threat or potential threat 
capable of destabilising the democratic environment 
of the Republic of South Africa.  The covert nature of 
20 
the 
project 
is 
intended 
to 
protect 
...[indistinct] 
personnel, resources and intelligence gathering.” 
So now you see we look at that, that is similar, to what they 
wrote in Construcao. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, and it talks of intelligence 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 40 of 163 
 
gathering ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   In the submission ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, just for the record your first 
reference to democratic I heard you correctly Ms K, it should 
have been domestic environment in the second line of 1.2, 
so just for the transcribers, okay, continue Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Again the detailed nature of the 
project that was actually carried out under the head “Project 
Mayibuye” is that specified in this operational plan, let’s 
leave aside the motivation for a moment. 
10 
MS K:    No it is not, but what I am trying to point out is the 
word for word, it is a copy and paste of this line it is what 
Judge was asking about whether I understand, intended to 
protect identification of personnel, resources, in terms of 
gathering any environmental scanning.   This is now written  
under Mayibuye. 
 
On the other hand in the submission of Mayibuye that 
is not carried, instead the same wording is contained in 
Project ...[indistinct] on the submission, that is the point I am 
trying to make. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    Yes thank you.  
MS K:    Just to point out how it – this it actually supports 
what we are saying that they will show, they will purport to 
be complying, they will do certain things to give an 
impression that they are complying to the OD, yet they 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 41 of 163 
 
weren’t.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    Well that observation ...[intervenes]    
MS K:    ...[Indistinct – parties talking over one another] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry Mr Pretorius I think we should take 
the tea break, it is just after quarter past. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will take the tea break and we will 
resume at twenty to. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
10 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS   
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you may proceed, Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 6.5, Ms K. 
MS K:   Yes, sir? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Reads: 
“Notwithstanding the vague and generic motivations 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
these 
projects, 
the 
operational 
activities 
that 
were 
purportedly 
20 
undertaken are in clear breach of the constitutional 
prohibition 
against 
partisan 
and 
politicised 
intelligence.” 
We will come to detail later but do you agree with that 
general statement? 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 42 of 163 
 
MS K:   Yes but it does not apply to all the projects in 
terms of the motivations that are advanced. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, thank you for that 
qualification.  The commentary continues in paragraph 6.5, 
it reads: 
“This politicisation of the CDSO can be traced back 
to 
the 
restructuring 
of 
the 
SSA’s 
counter 
intelligence 
capacity 
which 
shifted 
focus 
and 
resources to countering perceived threats to the 
personal and political security of former President 
10 
Zuma.” 
Do you have an observation in relation to that statement? 
MS K:   Yes, I support that statement. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The last statement in paragraph 
6.5 reads: 
“The 
operations 
run 
by 
the 
CDSO 
under 
Ambassador Dlomo...” 
Is that Thulani Dlomo? 
“…are the 
concrete result of these politicised 
intelligence priorities.” 
20 
Do you agree with that? 
MS K:   Yes I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 6.6 …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you go to the next paragraph, Mr 
Pretorius.  Ms K, in the two letters that Mr Pretorius 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 43 of 163 
 
referred you to before the tea break which motivated for 
certain projects, I realise that although they were written 
prior to 2016 there is a reference or there are references 
to them to the cover support unit.  I may have been wrong, 
I thought that you were saying – you had said the cover 
support unit was established after Mr Faizal’s arrival in 
2016 but I may have been wrong.  I just want you to clarify. 
MS 
K:   
No, sir, yesterday when 
we 
covered the 
restructuring before Mr Zuma arrived we indicated that 
CSU was moved and it existed then and it was moved to 
10 
fall under CDSO.  So when – in 2016 when CDSO was 
closed, the CSU was “moved” or re-established within the 
office of the DG. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the CSU cover support unit existed 
before 2016 as a unit under …[intervenes] 
MS K:   Within SO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Within CDSO, is that right? 
MS K:   Yes, Judge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you say when CDSO was 
closed in 2016 the support – the cover support unit was 
20 
moved or retained but then it fell under the office of the 
Director General, is that right? 
MS K:   Yes with the new appointed person to lead it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but it was still referred as the CSU. 
MS K:   Yes, sir. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 44 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And, as far as you know, it was still 
doing the same – performing the same function as it had 
performed before 2016 or is that something you are not 
sure about? 
MS K:   I would like to maybe reserve on comment on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS K:   Because I do believe that in this affidavit further 
down that is dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MS K:   So I do not want to now testify on it currently. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine, that is fine.  Thank you.  
Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 6.6, Ms K, reads: 
“The extent of this politicisation is further illustrated 
by the executive interference in the operational 
activities which occurred during this period.  Of 
particular concern the considerable evidence of 
Minister David Mahlobo’s direct involvement in 
operational activities including his alleged handling 
of large amounts of cash that were drawn under 
20 
CDSO projects.  Indeed there is evidence that in 
seeking 
budgetary 
approval 
for 
projects 
in 
November 2015 provision was made for a large 
portion of retained funds for what were described as 
the Minister ’s projects or projects approved by the 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 45 of 163 
 
Minister.” 
This submission is contained in file 1 of the SSA bundle 
and is marked as annexure C.  The general observations 
and the particular observations in paragraph 6.6, do you 
have any comment? 
MS K:   It is accurate.  It is accurate presented there, so I 
agree with what – with the paragraph. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Yes.  You have told the 
Chair that the investigations were informed by access to 
documentary information and evidence as well as what you 
10 
were told by persons you interviewed, am I correct? 
MS K:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the statement in the last – the 
penultimate and final sentences of paragraph 6.6, if you 
would look at page 30 of bundle SSA1 please?  Is that the 
document on which those statements in paragraph 6..6 or 
is that the documents which you rely on for making or the 
deponent relies on for making the statements in paragraph 
6.6? 
MS K:   Which document?  Annexure C? 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Annexure C and it is at page 30. 
MS K:   Yes, it is a document like that.  There is more than 
one of these, but this is definitely an example of [inaudible 
– speaking simultaneously] practices. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, I do not want to go through 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 46 of 163 
 
the whole document but if you go over the page to page 
31? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You see the table that appears in 
the middle of the page.  You will see under the sub 
programme Ministry: 
“Projects approved by the Minister.” 
Do you see that? 
MS K:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  If we go then to paragraph 6.7, a 
10 
general observation is made here which I think has been 
the subject matter of other evidence already given but, for 
the record, let us deal with it. 
“This evidence of executive overreach underscores 
the importance of maintaining a balance between 
political authority and operational authority in the 
security services.  Without political restraint and 
operational independence, there is a risk that the 
intelligence services will be pressured to provide 
intelligence 
that 
serves 
the 
narrow 
political 
20 
interests of the political authority rather than the 
national security interests of the country.” 
That sentiment or view has been expressed earlier, it is 
here expressed by Mr Y.  Do you have any comment? 
MS K:   I agree with his sentiment and [inaudible – 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 47 of 163 
 
speaking simultaneously] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  Paragraph point 8 
reads: 
“Finally, it should be noted that pervasive financial 
irregularities and weak financial controls make it 
difficult 
to 
ascertain 
the 
full 
extent 
of 
the 
operational 
expenditure 
incurred 
under 
these 
projects.  The outlay of funds was fast and loose 
and mostly in cash.  There was a frequent blurring 
of lines between projects with the CDSO structure 
10 
utilising projects ostensibly created for one purpose 
to facilitate funding for another.” 
Thus far in that paragraph do you have any comment?  Do 
you agree with those observations or conclusions, rather?   
MS K:   I agree, I just do not understand that part of to 
facilitate funding for another.  Maybe it is my English. 
“Blurring of lines between projects…” 
That is true. 
 “…CDSO 
structure 
utilising 
projects 
ostensibly 
created for one purpose to facilitate funding for 
20 
another.” 
That is true.  I agree with that statement. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  The paragraph 6.8 
continues, it reads: 
“There was also frequent “double-dipping” of funds 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 48 of 163 
 
as illustrated by Project Khusela, deal with below, 
in relation to the toxicology unit.” 
Is that a fair comment? 
MS K:   Yes, I think we could maybe add suspected double-
dipping. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right: 
“Frequent suspected double-dipping” 
Thank you for that qualification. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The paragraph continues: 
10 
“The abuse of the temporary advance system with 
cash being disbursed to CDSO members without 
subsequent 
reconciliation 
against 
expenditure 
means that the actual use and final destination of 
these cash payments are difficult to verify.” 
Do you agree with that statement? 
MS K:   Yes, I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then paragraph 6.9 gives an 
example.   
“A 
representative 
example 
of 
the 
irregularities 
20 
referenced above is a submission dated 22 March 
2016 requesting authorisation for the “payment” of 
related expenses as per the approved project[s] 
Mayibuye, Wave and Construcao.  This submission 
sets out the estimated financial implications for the 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 49 of 163 
 
various CDSO projects and operations totalling 9.9 
million.  This submission is contained in file 2 of the 
SSA bundle and is marked as annexure C8.” 
Would you go there please?  It is at page …[intervenes] 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   I am sorry, may I just point to the 
record because otherwise if I leave it, it will be injustice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   I know that I have been engaging 
with a contact person from there but I need to raise this 
first.  On the notice that we have been provided and 
10 
consciously 
as 
I 
have 
also 
warned 
yesterday, 
the 
paragraphs that my learned colleague has referred to and 
the witness to an extent confirms to be accurate, in 
reference paragraphs 27, 28 and 29, that mentions – 
detailing 
my 
client 
administers 
the 
project 
were 
not 
provided in the notice that I have received.  Just for noting 
of the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Were you not provided with the 
whole statement?  You were provided with …[intervenes] 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Extracts. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   With extracts. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That were deemed to refer to your client. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   That is correct and …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And these were not one of the – these 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 50 of 163 
 
were not some of them. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   That is correct, Chair, you have it 
right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, if may just make the 
observation, we can check what was provided and what 
was not provided because several Rule 3.3s were issued 
and we are still uncertain and we have asked for come 
10 
cooperation from the representatives of Minister Mahlobo 
as to exactly what was received and what was not 
received, there appears to have been certain 3.3 notices 
that were sent but were not received, certain notices that 
were sent and were received and we are still trying to 
establish the precise position there because it also affects 
a further witness who has to come.  We might have to 
redact a large amount of a witness’ statement for that very 
same reason.  So I trust my learned friend will cooperate in 
giving us the information that we require in that regard. 
20 
 
The second point I would like to make is that the 
paragraph 6.6 does in fact directly mention Minister 
Mahlobo.  The latter part is a more generic reference to the 
position of Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I think what Mr Pretorius is saying 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 51 of 163 
 
is that they will need to ascertain exactly what was sent 
and what was not sent.  In other words, they might not at 
this stage be able to say it is true, it was not sent and 
extend an apology but they will investigate and they will 
talk to you and at a certain stage I am sure I will be told 
what the position is. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  Chair, if I may just comment?  
A number of Rule 3.3 notices were sent but – a number of 
Rule 3.3 notices were sent.  We are uncertain as to how 
many were received and it is that information that we are 
10 
trying to establish.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, but as I understand it, as you 
stand there you are not able to say one of those 3.3 
notices that was sent, or one or more, included this 
paragraph. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am not – we would have to check 
that and respond, Chair, but I trust my learned friend and 
any other representative that we approach will cooperate in 
20 
giving us the information of what was actually received. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Despite being sent and what was 
not received despite being sent. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I guess that counsel for Mr Mahlobo 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 52 of 163 
 
will accept that it would not have been a deliberate 
decision to say let us not show him this …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, no, certainly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I would imagine that would have been 
an oversight, if indeed it was not sent.  But they will talk to 
you and at some stage I will be informed also as to what it 
was …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, within a short space of time, 
Chair, over a …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on, hang on, I think 
10 
counsel might still want to say something. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Chair, I think there is to an agree 
an acceptance of my correctness insofar as placing this on 
record and what – and I note what my learned colleague is 
saying and that will [indistinct – dropping voice] but I 
needed to place that on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, nobody has an issue with 
you placing it on record, I think.  It is just that he is not 
able to answer definitively. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And whether these particular paragraphs 
were sent as part of the 3.3 notice.  They will investigate 
and they will come back. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Yes. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 53 of 163 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  I must make it clear that the 
legal team and the investigating team with the assistance 
of the secretariat in a short space of time sent out, as I 
understood it, well over a hundred Rule 3.3s. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And the intention and the 
instruction was always that every allegation implicating a 
person should be dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
There 
was 
no 
deliberate 
10 
concealment of any… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And, in fact, the passage there is 
contained – or the issues raised in paragraph 6.6 are 
contained in other 3.3s.  So they are repeated in the 
evidence of other persons in respect of which 3.3s would 
have been given.  So the Minister would have been alerted 
to the fact that that allegation was made even if it is 
correct that paragraph 6.6 was not placed before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but obviously the point is if these 
20 
paragraphs were contained in 3.3 notices that relate to 
other notices, his point would be they were not notified 
that this witness, Mr Y, would also make the same 
…[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And they should have been. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 54 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There is no doubt about it, they 
should have been. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But we will check as to whether 
they were on not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I think counsel wants to say 
something? 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Definitely, Chair.  I think it is an 
easy thing to resolve, we should not really be wasting time 
10 
on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, do not give suggestions about 
how we should resolve, they will sort it out. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Chair, let me just …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is going to waste our time. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   No …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got something else or is it the 
same?  If it is the same thing please sit down, do not give 
us a …[intervenes] 
UNKNOWN 
COUNSEL: 
 
 
Chair, 
can 
I 
be 
allowed 
20 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, not on this one.  It is his matter 
and ja, we have dealt with it, he has no further complaints, 
you will wait for the process. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 55 of 163 
 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Chair, the reality is that at some 
point my client was mentioned.  And we kept quiet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if you raise a point about your 
client and not the same point about his client then you can 
raise [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Well, it is not about his client but 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, what is your point about your client? 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Well, Chair, it is actually a 
suggestion of resolving this matter.  The reality is that 
10 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which matter?  Which matter? 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Where certain people will be 
mentioned 
when 
the 
notices 
at 
least 
at 
this 
point 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, please sit down, let us proceed, 
let us proceed.  Mr Pretorius, continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair.  We were at 7  
We were at paragraph 6.9 which reads: 
“A 
representative 
example 
of 
the 
irregularities 
20 
referenced above is a submission dated 22 March 
2016 requesting authorisation for the payment of 
related expenses as per the approved projects  
Mayibuye, Wave and Construcao.  This submission 
sets out the estimated financial implications for 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 56 of 163 
 
various CDSO projects and operations totalling 9.9 
million.” 
I am instructed that that is a typographical error and that 
that figure should read 8.9.  But if you would go please to 
page 307 of SSA1, Ms K. 
MS K:   I am there, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   This is a document where names 
have been redacted …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, let me get there Mr Pretorius.  
307? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you would go to the document – 
and we only need refer to page 307 and 308. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Particularly the table at page 308, 
paragraph 3.1.  Do you see that? 
MS K:   Yes, I see.  I see that, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   This is a document that seeks to 
justify the payment of a total of R8 900 000.  What does 
20 
this document illustrate as set out in paragraph 6.9? 
MS K:   Firstly it illustrates a breach of financial prescripts 
in the sense that yes, it says nature of expense, it is 
Project Mayibuye and then there are operations under 
Project Mayibuye or it says Operation Justice, Operation 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 57 of 163 
 
Law, Operation Siskona(?), Operation Safe Return.   
So when you look at the estimate amount it does 
not give a breakdown of the money that is being requested 
here.  For example, if you look at Project Mayibuye, it says 
estimated amount 2.5 million, Operation Justice 1.8 million, 
Operation 
Law 
200 000, 
Operation 
Siskona 
100 000, 
Operation Safe Return, 300 000. 
Now if you are requesting money to – even if the 
TA, there on the submission, that 2.5 million should have 
been broken down into line items as to how it is going to 
10 
be 
expended. 
 
So 
instead 
of 
having 
global 
figures 
appearing like that and it also says Project Wave, which is 
R2 million and Project Construcao, R2 million.   
So because there was – I think this was – okay, 
maybe I should not add my thoughts on that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, let me put this to you 
because this is said in paragraph 6.9 where reference is 
made to the irregularities referenced above, is this type of 
reporting sufficient firstly to comply with the prescripts in 
the SSA and secondly, to allow proper control of the 
20 
expenditure of funds? 
MS K:   It is not, Chair.  It is not because it starts with the 
– some – I do not whether I should say, it is the route or it 
is the fruit of the poison tree.  Firstly, if there is no APP 
and the budget cannot be loaded against that unit and for 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 58 of 163 
 
all of these projects, how are you going to justify these line 
items and actually the cost allocation, the code because 
global figures are written there.  I think the financial 
people will be better placed to discuss and clarify that. 
 
So if you have one submission that just outlines – 
just gives – that just telling different projects and just as 
global amount and you do not know how that is going to 
work because the other thing is, they take this - for 
instance, this submission, you find that sometimes it skips 
the  - what – the budget controller because if the budget 
10 
controller is there they would have demanded that that be 
broken down but there was this tendency of bypassing 
budget controllers. 
 
So I think we will deal with financial irregularities 
further down because I do not want to add the other aspect 
they were able to keep on drawing money without having 
had even an APP. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
MS K:   Another – yes, Chair? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No, no, I am sorry to interrupt, 
20 
please continue. 
MS K:   I think if you page to 309, if you look at the 
recommendations by Mathhew …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Matthew is a pseudonym, but 
continue. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 59 of 163 
 
MS K:   It says - the condition that he is writing there, it 
says: 
“Budget 
to 
be 
sourced 
from 
under 
spending 
structures, 
note 
comments 
by 
management 
accounting." 
Something like that.  So this, for me, shows how monies 
will be taken from – although CDSO was overspending, not 
adhering to all the financial prescripts, even having – not 
settling TAs, not like – they still had to make sure that 
there is money for these projects even if it meant taking 
10 
money from other structures within the SSA. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  Let us move to 6.10, 
the following statements are made in that paragraph: 
“notwithstanding the challenges that arise from poor 
recordkeeping, 
the 
investigation 
team 
has 
calculated that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Pretorius.  Do you have 
an idea how regularly you will be referring to SSA Bundle 
01 will it be regular? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes it will be Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It will be, okay so I cannot say they must 
take it away. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Afraid not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The red stickers in my bundle 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 60 of 163 
 
proliferate from now on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that is alright. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you Chair.   Paragraph 6.10 
reads: 
“Notwithstanding the challenges that arise from 
poor 
recordkeeping 
the 
investigation 
team 
has 
calculated that on a conservative estimate a total of 
R1billion was expended on these CDSO projects 
during the period 2012 to 2018.” 
Do you agree with that comment? 
10 
MS K:   Yes I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It continues ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, paragraph 6.10 Ms K says on 
a conservative estimate, a total of R1billion was expended 
on these CDSO projects during the period 2012 to 2018.  
Are you happy to be that conservative or would you put it 
the minimum higher than that? 
MS K:   Chair when we looked at the official financial 
records of the SSA in terms of a budget and expenditure, 
when we looked at the period that is covered there, and 
20 
CDSO on its own as a chief directorate spent just below a 
billion, 
it 
was 
900 
and 
something. 
 
I 
cannot 
even 
pronounce that number because ja, I would rather say just 
under a billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is per year or over the period? 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 61 of 163 
 
MS K:   Over the period, but this is one - it has to be seen 
in the context of it's a chief directorate it is not higher, it is 
a chief directorate - I do not know how to explain it.  It is 
not even the counter intelligence in its entirety, it is just 
one element under them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS K:   You know, just one unit spending that amount of 
money on and the cost driver was the covert projects, the 
contract payments and all of that and without proper 
accounting. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so I guess the answer to my 
question 
is 
that 
you 
would 
rather 
stay 
with 
that 
conservative estimate of R1Billion from 2012 to 1218.? 
MS K:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MS K:   Yes, Judge.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us continue then in paragraph 
6.10 continues to read: 
“Not only were these projects unlawful in their 
20 
establishment purpose and operation, but they were 
in any event very little benefit to the SSA.  Instead, 
these projects were used to channel SSA funds to 
the 
parallel 
intelligence 
structure 
engaged 
in 
unlawful operations that appear to have been 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 62 of 163 
 
primarily undertaken for the personal and political 
benefit of President Zuma and other high ranking 
officials.”  
What do you say about those sentences? 
MS K:   I agree with the sentences. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We move now to the particular 
projects and what these projects involve.  We have seen 
some examples of the motivations for some of the projects 
that we now go to actually what was done, much of what 
you say here is contained in evidence already given, 
10 
although there are one or two additions.  
Let us start with Project Construcao which is dealt 
with in paragraph 6.11 and following, 6.11 says: 
“According 
to 
the 
request 
for 
authorisation 
to 
establish Project Construcao this cover project had 
an aim of gathering, influencing, penetrating and 
neutralising any form of threats or potential threats, 
capable of destabilising the democratic rule of the 
Republic of South Africa.  Although this proposal 
dated 12 December 2014 stated that operatives 
20 
would begin work as early as 17 December 2014, 
official approval for the project was only given on 
23 
January 
2015. 
 The 
project 
manager 
was 
pseudonym 
Frank, 
who 
reported 
directly 
to 
Ambassador Dlomo then Deputy Director Counter 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 63 of 163 
 
Intelligence.” 
The submission, will this submission for the establishment 
of Project Construcao is included in file two of the SSA 
bundle, and is marked Annexure CO.  What is your 
comment on the contents of this paragraph? 
MS K:   I agree with what the paragraph is communicating 
and we have already gone through this annexure but I think 
when we get to the issue of contracts, it will make sense 
why we are highlighting these dates in this in this 
paragraph but for now, I am fine with the paragraph as it 
10 
is, I agree. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You must just bear with me a 
moment Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I just want to be careful about what 
documentary evidence we place before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If I could ask you to go to page 
251, please of SSA1. 
MS K:   Yes, Chair I am there. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will just have to make sure, Mr 
Pretorius, that we are consistent how we refer to Bundle 1, 
otherwise, somebody's reading the transcript later will 
think it is a different document where it is a bundle, SSA 
Bundle 1, and what page? 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 64 of 163 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   251.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   This is a declassified document; it 
is a request for authorisation for Project Construcao.  So 
you see that on a 249 of SSA1. 
MS K:   Yes, I see it Judge. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If one goes over the page in that 
document to paragraph 3.1.  
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You will see there the financial 
10 
implications as reflected below are estimated and might 
vary.  Nature of expense Project Construcao, estimated 
amount R30million and then there is a cost allocation.  Do 
you have any comment on the sufficiency of the detail 
contained in that paragraph? 
MS K:   My comment is similar to what I had earlier on 
Mayibuye that you cannot have a global amount in this way 
when you are talking about financial implications, because 
that R30million that would have been broken down into 
whether there is travel, whether there is operational 
20 
expenses and other expenditures.  So if you request – or 
because this one is for the establishment it would be, I do 
not know if it would be appropriate to make it like this 
because they have had a breakdown in the operational 
plan. But if it was a submission to withdraw funds from the 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 65 of 163 
 
budget that is allocated, then they would still need to have 
the line items for it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right if you go to page 253 you will 
see there, there is indeed an operational plan for Project 
Construcao, do you see that?  
MS K:   Yes.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I have looked at this operational 
plan and I am subject to correction but it does not seem to 
me that there is a description of what we have learnt was 
exactly part of Project Construcao activities, namely the 
10 
provision of personal security to a number of named 
individuals.  Can you comment? 
MS K:   As a person who has seen and gone through most 
of the documentation during this investigation and analyse 
the info and including whatever we got from finance, and 
having interviewed the individuals involved I still cannot sit 
here and claim that I know, what was the full extent of the 
activities that were undertaken.  
Maybe VIP Protection was part of it and the training 
was part of it, but there is no full disclosure as yet in my 
20 
view, in terms of the full extent of the activities of those 
individuals.  For instance, if I can make an example of -  
there is a submission where there is motivation for getting, 
retaining funds for Construcao and Wave and whatever and 
I think it amounts to R54million under Mayibuye and the 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 66 of 163 
 
other projects as well.  In that when they say what the 
purpose of the projects are, they indicated that the same 
officials that would be co-workers or resources that would 
be used in Construcao will also be used in Project Wave.  
So - but when we asked the project manager of both 
those projects, what was happening in May?  He said, no 
we did nothing the entire year but money was expended.  
So based on that, I cannot - I do not think there has been 
full disclosure on the part of members of CDSO on what 
exactly were the activities. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, so the first thing you say is 
that your investigation was unable to establish the precise 
nature and scope of the activities conducted under any 
particular project head.  Is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes, we could not confirm with the individuals.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And if you…[intervene] 
MS K:   Especially if when they start, when their 
submissions are general and broad, when you talk to the 
person it is still actually it is not clear, but money was 
expended. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And you also indicate in your most 
recent answer, that you could not establish precisely what 
activities were conducted under a particular project head in 
a particular financial period, despite learning that funds 
were expended, is that correct? 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 67 of 163 
 
MS K:   Yes, funds they expended and people went over 
budget.  For instance, for Construcao the budget was 
R30million in its entirety, for the financial year or for a 
period of a year and of that R30million, only R5million was 
allocated for operational expenses.   
However, 
when 
the 
project 
was 
approved 
in 
January, at the end of January by April, the money for that 
whole project the entire R30million had been withdrawn 
and all of it for operational expenses.  So you would 
wonder how one approved - maybe for the first withdrawal 
10 
of the funds from the project budget.  
If 
the 
person 
withdraws 
R10million, 
a 
budget 
Construcao was going to pick up that no actually for 
operational expenses you only have R5million for the year, 
yet it was allowed for people to take R10million and then 
R7million, automatically R30million is gone and then they 
want more money.  And then they keep spending and they 
say extend, extend, extend when money is finished, and 
then it goes back into rotate to keep the projects going. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Let us go to paragraph 
20 
6.12. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    
“Project Construcao involved the further recruitment 
and training of co-workers for the CDSO.  This 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 68 of 163 
 
should not be confused with the earlier recruitment 
and training of individuals at Ambassador Dlomo’s 
direction 
in 
2008/2009 
who 
were 
subsequently 
deployed into personal protection units, and the 
Directorate for Presidential Security support in 
particular.” 
 Do you agree with those two statements? 
MS K:   I do but I would like to maybe indicate that the 
entire 6.12 is basically based on information on the 
account of the project manager, what they told us the 
10 
project was about. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  
MS K:   And yes there is proof that the people went for 
training, but it does not necessarily tie in with what was in 
the operational plan.  So, I cannot…[intervene] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am sorry. 
MS K:   …say that this is exactly what was done so that is 
what I am trying to say. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, you raised the issue as to 
whether it was consistent with the operational plan, that 
20 
can be established by looking at the documents in Exhibit 
SSA1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry Mr Pretorius, I think you might 
have to repeat that for quite some time the two of you are 
talking at the same time. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 69 of 163 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think that transcribers will have a 
problem transcribing.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So maybe repeat that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let me take a step back Ms K, do 
you want to finish your answer and I will ask the question? 
MS K:   I think I finished my answer for now.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Let me then ask the first 
two sentences in paragraph 6.12.  Do you agree with 
10 
those, or the content of those? 
MS K:   Yes, I do agree, yes I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, you stress that this is what 
you were told, by amongst others the project manager or 
by the project manager and this is what is being related 
here.  You do make the point that what you were told of the 
activities of the project was not consistent with the 
documentation, justifying or motivating the project and 
motivating withdrawals of money for the project.  Do I 
understand you correctly? 
20 
MS K:   Yes, and one of the things if I may just it is 
fundamental, what is more confusing is that when you look 
at Construcao and the receipts of moneys withdrawn or 
dispersed and the supporting documentation there in terms 
of invoices.  They were actually procuring VIP Protection 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 70 of 163 
 
services from companies.  So the team was confused as to 
if you have changed these people for VIP Protection, and 
you are already funding that through Construcao.  How, 
why, what would necessitate you getting a private security 
company for VIP Protection again, and then withdrawing 
funds for that.  That is why I am saying we do not know the 
full extent of what exactly was being done here. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But you say you were told or you 
received evidence that under the head of this project, 
private security entities were employed.  Am I correct? 
10 
MS K:   Yes, that was at the final interview.  However, we 
had seen documents that showed that there are private 
companies, security companies that were, whose services 
were procured for VIP Protection and those, those people 
were paid. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If we continue in paragraph 6.12 it 
reads: 
“Under 
Project 
Construcao 
22 
people 
were 
recruited, 18 of whom were sent for overseas 
training 
during 
the 
latter 
half of 
2015. 
 The 
20 
operatives were trained in two groups, eight were 
trained in VIP Protection and 10 were trained in 
counter intelligence tradecraft.  It is a concern that 
this 
VIP 
training 
was 
conducted 
outside 
the 
available 
diplomatic 
channels 
provided 
by 
the 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 71 of 163 
 
agreement on training that was in place at the time 
with the foreign based trainers apparently under the 
impression they were training is SAPS members, 
rather than new intelligence recruits.” 
Are those statements correct? 
MS K:   Yes, that is what we were told.  In a…[intervene] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
MS K:   It was actually information that was gathered 
during momentum.  Remember that period from June 2018 
to 22 December when this was established. So all of that 
10 
information had already been gathered from the various 
people.  So that is what we were told. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It continues to say, that is 
paragraph 6.12.  
“During the graduation ceremony of the recruits, 
they 
were 
allegedly 
instructed 
by 
Ambassador 
Dlomo – and I take it that is Thulani Dlomo, that 
upon return to South Africa, they would report only 
to him.” 
Is that what the investigation was told? 
20 
MS K:   On this one, there was actually a statement by one 
of the co-workers who indicated that but I cannot remember 
if that statement was signed, because we did not obtain 
that statement from the individual.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 72 of 163 
 
MS K:   But that is what was indicated but what I can 
confirm is that during momentum time, the investigating 
team, did go to the country where these people went, 
particularly went for training and they actually confirmed 
according to them, that they spoke to the head of station, 
from SSA, and those people were not even aware that 
there was such training being provided there.  
So that is why we say it was outside the available 
diplomatic channels.  But we cannot, we could not - they 
could not obtain a statement from the Police attaché there 
10 
in terms of whether they knew, but that is the information 
that we were working with, as you would understand this 
investigation was still ongoing before we got here.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, thank you. Paragraph 6.13 
gives further detail of the project it reads: 
“Most of these individuals were drawn from Kwazulu 
Natal, although it is unclear what criteria were 
followed in recruitment, none were vetted by the 
SSA.” 
Are those statements correct? 
20 
MS K:   I would align myself with that yes, because there 
was a parallel vetting unit. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, according to and there is a 
pseudonym Lily, and I am not going to ask you, well I am 
going to ask you not to deal with a position there.   
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 73 of 163 
 
“According to Lily, one of the reasons for launching 
the project was that former President Zuma wanted 
younger VIP protectors to be trained.” 
Is that the correct statement or were you told that by lily? 
MS K:   No.  This is one of the statements that we obtained 
before – it predated, they were obtained during momentum. 
In fact, I have never met Lily, because ja I do not want to 
say what happened.  So I have not interviewed her in this 
regard. So I cannot say that statement is correct or 
inaccurate. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, the paragraph continues: 
“In his interview with our investigation, team Frank 
also a pseudonym confirmed that this project was 
linked to the VIP Protection that was offered to high 
ranking officials such as Mr Dumeyeni. But these 
co-workers were also deployed by Ambassador 
Dlomo to work on other CDSO operations, like 
Project Lock dealt with below.” 
Is 
that 
information 
that 
was 
obtained 
by 
the 
Veza 
investigation? 
20 
MS K:   Yes, this one ja, we interviewed him and that is 
what he said and then so I can confirm that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Finally, in paragraph 6.13: 
“Should further be noted that Ambassador Dlomo 
himself benefited from personal protection services 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 74 of 163 
 
using the resources of the SSA.” 
Is that a correct statement as far as you are concerned? 
MS K:   It is a correct statement, but I do not know what 
would be wrong with that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, we can erase that. 
MS K:   Maybe it is because of my limits, maybe it is 
because of my limited knowledge of the environment, but I 
thought in IS we do have VIP Protection there you know, 
but it is for the senior managers of SSA.  So I think, 
Ambassador Thulani Dlomo was entitled to that. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, so I am going to raise with 
you the issue surely senior officials within the SSA are 
entitled, as a matter of course to protection using the 
resources of the SSA. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The question might be which 
resources, is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes, so I cannot tell from this, because if there are 
resources that are meant for that then it cannot be 
anything irregular. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, then paragraph 6.14 reads: 
“An initial operational budget of R30million was 
approved 
for 
Project 
Construcao 
which 
was 
expected to run until 31 January 2016.” 
That we know we have looked at the document. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 75 of 163 
 
“In July 2016 a later approval was given for the 
renewal of Project Construcao for the period 1 April 
2016 to 31 March 2017 and a further R24million in 
operational expenditure.” 
And then references made to the document, which contains 
the submission for the renewal and further funding of the 
project.  Are you familiar with the contents of that 
document, you want to look at it? 
MS K:   I can look at it if you have questions on it.  But I 
do align myself with this paragraph, we did look at that. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In that document, let me just ask 
you at a general level.  If you want to look at it, it is at 
page 320 of SSA1.  Is there a sufficiently detailed 
description of the activities that were being funded by the 
grant of a further R24million that enables proper controls 
to be implemented? 
MS K:   What page is that again, Sir?  What page are we 
referring to? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   320. 
MS K:   320, What is the question Sir, again, sorry. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is there sufficient description of 
the activities, justifying the expenditure or allocation of a 
further R24million to enable proper financial controls to be 
implemented?  If you cannot comment…[intervene] 
MS K:   No, I do not think proper financial controls were 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 76 of 163 
 
implemented here because under financial implications 
paragraph 5, it just says: 
“In order to achieve its set objectives, Project 
Construcao required R24million to cover source 
remuneration 
travel 
related 
expenses, 
cover 
operational expenses, covert action expenses and 
rental of offices.” 
That is not how financial implications are captured. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms K. 
MS K:   We – you know – so that was in contravention of 
10 
the prescripts.  And then I also – okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms K, if one were to go to motivations or 
projects done by other units within SSA, let us say the 
official structures, are you saying that we will find that 
there is much more information they would put in their own 
request for funding than was being done by the Special 
Operations Unit?   
MS K:   I have not look at …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, you cannot criticise 
these 
for 
not 
including 
enough 
information 
in 
their 
20 
motivations if that is what the official structures in other 
units of SSA were doing, it was a practice, everybody was 
not putting in a lot of information in the letters maybe 
because of the sensitivity of the projects.  
So, my question is, if we were to go to letters 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 77 of 163 
 
motivating for funding done by official structures or units of 
SSA, are we going to find that they normally provided much 
more information than these? 
MS K:   Chair, I did not catch that last part but I will try to 
answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me repeat so that you can answer 
knowing exactly what the question is.  If we were to go to 
SSA and say give us motivation letters that are normally 
written by different units, official units of SAA, official 
structures whenever they request funding for projects, are 
10 
we 
going 
to 
find 
that 
they 
normally 
provide 
more 
information than was being done by these units? 
MS K:   My answer to that would be that I cannot say in the 
sense that based on the fact that I have not looked at other 
units and how they have compiled their submissions but I 
doubt that they would have too much detail in terms of 
what the covert operation is but in the operational plan you 
would have found at least a bit of more detail, so that will 
be attached to the submission.  But what I am definitely 
sure of is the issue of the financial implications and how 
20 
the budgets are outlined because even when you travel 
there is a standard way of how the financial implications 
can be – I do not know, delineated in the submissions.  So 
those are just the standard practices.  I have not looked at 
other units’ project plan because we are still busy with 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 78 of 163 
 
CDSO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, thank you.  I think, Mr Pretorius it 
would help if one got an idea as to how motivation letters 
are done by the official structures just so that we know 
whether these ones were not following what everyone 
does. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes.  That would have to be 
accompanied by suitable redactions because one of the 
motivations for the declassification of these documents is 
the rule that – or the law that classification cannot be used 
10 
to conceal irregularities. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So that is but one of the 
motivations for declassification and that is why we can see 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   To produce documents of regular 
operations, 
it 
would 
involve 
a 
different 
set 
of 
considerations but we will try and answer that question in a 
way which does not compromise certain …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, that is fine, you do your 
best and see what happens.  I get – I got the impression or 
I get the impression that the Acting DG wants to operate 
and 
help 
the 
Commission 
as 
much 
as 
possible 
but 
obviously he will not want to – and he should not act in 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 79 of 163 
 
breach of the law but …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, we will explore that issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And deal with it.  We have put 
before you, Chair, motivational documents and project 
plans and the witness has commented on the detail 
contained in those documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the ones that I saw this morning, if 
those are the ones you are talking about, I was under the 
impression that they fall under either CDSO or some of the 
10 
units that are said to have operated outside the normal 
structures of SSA. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what I would very much like to see, if 
possible, is motivation letters that were done by official 
structures of SSA. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, yes.  No, point taken, Chair.  
We will look. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Another example of the financial 
20 
detail is contained in paragraph 6.15 and reference is 
made here to three invoices issued by the pseudonym, 
Carrot Export Company during February and March 2015 
totalling R20 million, thus using almost all the allocated 
budget within three months of the project’s establishment.  
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 80 of 163 
 
And these invoices, if I can refer you to the invoices, 
please? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you go to page 266 of EXHIBIT 
SSA01. 
MS K:   Annexure C? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is annexure C1 but I am asking, 
if you look at the invoice …[intervenes] 
MS K:   I cannot find it, Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   At page 266. 
10 
MS K:   Page? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   266. 
MS K:   366? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   266. 
MS K:   266. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Remember to look at the black numbers, 
Ms K, not the red numbers. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, black numbers, top left hand 
corner, Ms K. 
MS K:   Okay, yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You will see there an invoice 
issued by – and the name of the company has been 
redacted. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC:   And the description if for 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 81 of 163 
 
“professional services rendered” and the amount is R4.1 
million.  Do you see that? 
MS K:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Another invoice in similar terms 
appears at page 272 of SSA01.  Do you see that? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is for R8 200 000. 
MS K:   Yes, excluding VAT. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, where is the second invoice 
that is for R8 million? 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   272. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let get there.  272. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   272, it is annexure C2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes, thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes in fact you point out that the 
invoice is actually for R10 million. 
MS K:   Yes, it is for R10 million.  The first one we went 
through is actually 5 million when you include VAT, total. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MS K:   And the second one is 10 million. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   R10 million and if you go to the 
third one, annexure C3, page 274. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You will see a rounded figure of R5 
million including VAT. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 82 of 163 
 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Leave aside the coincidence in 
relation to the amounts charged by what appears to be a 
service provider.  These three invoices reflect a total 
expenditure during the period February to March 2015, an 
amount of R20 million, is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The description of the services 
rendered, in your view would that allow financial controls 
of an adequate nature to be implemented? 
10 
MS K:   No.  It would not because apart from the fact that 
is it called just professional fees and it is just an invoice, it 
would be – if this is a deep cover project as Construcao, 
and the invoice is issued for Constructao from this service 
provider it would not be addressed to State Security 
Agency if you look at that invoice and also seeing that the 
acknowledgement of receipt of the – dated the – I think it 
is page 271, it is dated 23 February 2015, it is actually a 
disbursement of funds, the entire R10 million given to – I 
do not know. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Ms K, I thought you said 
dated 23 r d, I see 28.  Maybe you said 28 February 2015 at 
page 271. 
MS K:   Yes, Chair, could you repeat that?  I think the 
weather is affecting… 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 83 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is the weather creating a problem 
…[intervenes] 
MS K:   I did not hear what the question was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you cannot hear me well again? 
MS K:   Yes, now I can hear you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I am saying that I thought when 
you referred to the date that appears at page 271, I 
thought you said 23 February or 23 r d.  I seem to see 28 but 
I do not know, maybe you did say 28.  I just want to make 
10 
…[intervenes] 
MS K:   I think it is my glasses, I am sorry, it is 28. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I just wanted to make sure we are 
looking at the same document. 
MS K:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MS K:   Yes, that is a – so for me that would not suffice as 
sufficient documentation to justify settlement of this claim. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  In fact you raise another 
point related to what is contained in paragraph 6.15 but I 
20 
think it is fair to go there because we are no implicating 
anybody further or anybody else but if you look at page 
271, this is receipt of money presumably pursuant to the 
invoice or one of the invoices that we have just referred o. 
MS K:   Yes. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 84 of 163 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And it talks about R10 million 
received by a pseudonym Addo, who may give evidence. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That R10 million was received for 
the purpose of ops Construcao on the 28 February and no 
further information is given and presumably would that 
have been R10 million in cash? 
MS K:   Yes, that is it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    Right, now I know that it is 
necessary sometimes to use cash as we have been told so 
10 
that it cannot be traced but what do you say about the 
reporting adequacy and the financial control adequacy of 
this documentation. 
MS K:   If you look at page 269 – okay, page 268 and page 
269, in 268 the subject of the submission is withdrawals on 
Project Construcao for payments of operational expenses 
for the project and then obviously it talks about – it gives 
some kind of motivation but when you get to the final 
implication it just says operational expenses, 10 million, 
and that is it.   
20 
 
So another concern with this submission – so it 
does not say how the R10 million will be expended and the 
invoice itself does not also assist to say what this was for 
and if you look at the compilation of this – if you look at 
the compiler, is Lilly and Lilly …[intervenes] 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 85 of 163 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Pseudonym Lilly. 
MS K:   And Lilly is the compiler and the recommender.  
Another thing that is apparent here is that then Themba 
signs and the ultimate signatory on this is Ambassador 
Dlomo and this is above the MPD limitation.  A DDG can 
never be able to sign off on a R10 million submission and 
just withdrawal of funds. 
 
So if you look at the individuals that are featured 
here they were all within SO and that one should not be 
completed in that way and then they would bring the green 
10 
forms to HQ, get the R10 million cash and create this 
acknowledge of receipt as proof that that money was 
expended for the intended purpose. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, I understand Ms K that in 
order to give a full answer to questions, both placed before 
by myself and the Chair, you have to give a full description 
of what you see, particularly in relation to documents 
placed before you but if we can just try and adhere to the 
principle that if you name a person, that person’s name 
should appear in the document. Okay?  If we can 
20 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on.  Did you understand that, Ms 
K? 
MS K:   Yes I did. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thanks, Ms K. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 86 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Before Mr Pretorius moves 
further, I just want to ask you this question.  You know 
when 
you 
look 
at these 
motivation 
letters, 
the 
last 
paragraph I think under Regulatory Compliance… 
MS K:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Seems always to point out to the person 
who 
is 
required 
to 
approve 
the 
– 
or 
to 
make 
the 
authorisation.  It always out that that person has got power 
under some ministerial delegation of powers and direction 
of payment to approve such an expense or something like 
10 
that.  Now what it does not do, almost invariably, is to 
indicate what the requirements are that the approving 
authority should satisfy himself or herself about before he 
or she can approve.  Do you know whether the instruments 
to which these letters refers, the ministerial delegation of 
powers and direction of payment of 2013, for example, I am 
looking at the one at page 269, do you know whether there 
is prescribed requirements to say if before you can 
approve or authorise an expense for a project, this is what 
you must satisfy yourself about and the request must 
20 
contain the following information so that we know whether 
such requirements were complied with or not. 
MS K:   Chair, I think that is why most of the submissions 
are accompanied by an attached MPD.  In the bundle – I do 
not know if I am authorised to be calling bundles. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 87 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS K:   In that as I say bundle, annexure B.  I do not know 
because it is has been evidence leader so I was thinking I 
do not want to take over his job. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You think you need to be a lawyer to say 
bundle.  Bundle 1 is the one that we have going to 
whenever we needed to see these motivational letters. 
MS K:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The other one is think is bundle 2 that 
has got your affidavit and Mr Y’s affidavit.  
10 
MS K:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which one do you want us to go to? 
MS K:   As I say, bundle 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS K:   I feel like an evidence leader now.  SSA bundle 1 
and …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what page? 
MS K:   What is this?  A? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Look at the black numbers at the top left 
if you want to tell us what page. 
20 
MS K:   It is page 21, 021. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS K:   So if you look at  - that is the MPD and if you look 
at cover structures on 5.2, that is the section that deals 
with the work of – mostly of CDSO, they are always covert 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 88 of 163 
 
projects.  So it does indicate the delegation and limits in 
terms of what people can approve. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, but apart from the limitation with 
regard to up to how much the maximum a particular person 
may approve. 
MS K:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does it have any other requirements? 
MS K:   Pardon, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does it prescribe any other requirements 
such as how much the person who must authorise must be 
10 
told about how the money will be used?  In other words 
…[intervenes] 
MS K:   That is what …[intervenes]3 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, Ms K, you have been 
saying in regard to these motivation letters that they are 
vague and they do not have adequate information that 
should be included. 
MS K:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If the request were to be approved 
properly. 
20 
MS K:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So my question is, is there somewhere 
where we can go where we will be told these are the 
requirements that a motivation letter should cover or that 
or let us say or the DG or Deputy DG to approve funds for 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 89 of 163 
 
a project, he or she must be satisfied, for example, that 
what they are going to be used for is a matter that falls 
within the mandate of SSA, what they are, the actual 
activities are lawful or something like that and that they 
will be – after the funds have been used, there will be a 
reconciliation to try to show how the funds were used.  Do 
you know whether there is an instrument that sets out like 
that so that we are able to say the official position at SSA 
is that if a leader of a project asks for the authorisation of 
funds for a project, this is what the motivation should 
10 
disclose about the project and these ones did not meet that 
requirement or is it discretionary to the leader of a project 
as to how much they disclose in their motivation letter? 
MS K:   I will try to answer to the best of my ability, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS K:   I think we must draw a distinction between a 
submission to establish a cover project because that one 
would probably give a timeframe, maybe of a year, and it 
will also have an overall budget accompanies by an 
operational plan with a breakdown of how the money – you 
20 
know, 
the 
budget 
for 
that 
project. 
 And 
then 
that 
operational plan usually has more detail, so – and it is 
attached to the submission which could not – in certain 
instances I do not think it did cover project it would be 
divulging everything there but at least the accounting 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 90 of 163 
 
officer who is going to ultimately sign off on that project, 
should 
have 
signed 
off 
that 
operational 
plan 
and 
understand.  That is my view. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS K:   And then there is a submission – once that is 
approved, there is a submission that people write just to 
withdraw funds from that approved project budget.  So 
what we were looking at on that company and that invoice 
was a transaction to withdraw funds from an already 
approved project budget.  But when you withdrew funds, 
10 
when you look at the MPD, as I have said in page 23, you 
will see on site 3.2 that says: 
“Payments of subsistence-related expenses, agent, 
co-worker or occasional contact conditions, subject 
to approval of trip in accordance with delegation.” 
Blah, blah, blah.  And even there, if you look at the DDG, 
domestic branch, the limit is 50 000, for a branch the limit 
is 200 000.  So it does not matter how one looks at it, 
there was no – Mr Dlomo at the - Ambassador Dlomo did 
not have authority to even sign off on this 10 million and 
20 
this repeats itself in every project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS K:   That is the point that we are trying to make.  I do 
not know if I am answering sufficiently. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is fine, thank you.  I think it 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 91 of 163 
 
is a convenient time to take the lunch break, Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are at five past  one.  We are going 
to take the lunch break and we will resume at five past 
two.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  We are starting a bit later.  
There was some urgent matter that I needed to attend to. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  Noted Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  Let us continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now Ms K, are you with us? 
MS K:   Yes, I am sir. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  Ms K, I would like to go 
back a little to evidence given this morning just before the 
long adjournment and yesterday to try and clarify the extent 
to 
which 
the 
regulatory 
instruments 
governing 
the 
management of projects, both in their execution and their 
motivation, are dealt with. 
 
Quickly go back to page 369 of SSA-02.  Well, perhaps 
20 
first, before that.  We should go to page 351, paragraph 
3.7.2.  And perhaps even earlier, to paragraph 3.7 on page 
350. 
 
Let us start at paragraph 3.7 at page 350. 
MS K:   350?   
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 92 of 163 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Three, five, o of SSA-02.  That is Mr 
Y’s statement at para 3.7.   
MS K:   I am there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  This is by way of 
background to the questions which will follow. 
 
3.7 reads: 
“In addition to the constitutional and legislative 
framework governing the SSA’s governance and 
operations, 
the 
SSA 
has 
its 
own 
regulatory 
prescripts. 
10 
Two are particularly important for the purposes of 
assessing the pervasive and serious irregularities in 
the 
SSA 
Chief 
Directorate 
Specials 
Operations 
between 2012 and 2018.” 
The first prescript referred to is the Ministerial Delegation of 
Powers and Direction of Payment which deals with the 
powers that various levels of management within the SSA 
have in relation to authorisation of payments.  Is that 
correct? 
MS K:   Yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We will come back to that in a 
moment. 
 
We 
looked 
at 
that 
just 
before 
the 
long 
adjournment.  Then let us go to the paragraph 3.7.2.  It 
reads as follows: 
“The 
SSA’s 
operational 
directives 
constitute 
a 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 93 of 163 
 
vigorous and comprehensive regulatory framework 
governing its operational activities including deep 
cover operations. 
These OD’s not only align with the Constitution 
imperative that National Security must be perceive 
in compliance with the law but also recognise that 
the need for accountability is greater in the context 
of covert operations where there is a risk that 
secrecy while a necessary component of intelligence 
may be abused to conceal unlawful activities.” 
10 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now this statement has been cleared 
by the SSA and to the extent that the operational directives 
broadly cover a number of topics.  We can put that before 
the Chair in paragraph 3.7.2.  But I understand that the 
SSA’s operational directives are classified.  Is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes, they are classified. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And for the purposes of the evidence 
of Mr Y and accordingly for your purposes as well, they have 
not been declassified.  So we cannot place their detail 
20 
before the Chair.  Is that correct? 
MS K:   I guess so because it follows the ...[indistinct] 
[00:04:56] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, it does.  So while we can look – 
while we can draw some general conclusions, as you do, 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 94 of 163 
 
about whether the documentation placed before the Veza 
Inquiry, 
shows 
sufficient 
detail to 
enable management 
controls to take place.  What we cannot do is compare those 
documents to the detailed provisions of the operational 
directives.  Is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What we can do, we can ask the 
Director-General, the acting Director-General to provide an 
affidavit or intend to give evidence if necessary but to 
provide an affidavit to the Chair dealing with these issues 
10 
under whatever rubric may be advisable, whether an in-
camera affidavit or an open affidavit but that is a matter for 
further consideration.  Do you understand that? 
MS K:   Yes, I understand. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But insofar as the ministerial 
delegation of powers and direction of payment is concerned, 
we can look at that.  Safe that sections of that too have been 
redacted for security reasons and have not been declassified 
to the extent that they can be disclosed in the public.   
MS K:   Correct. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Similarly to the extent that what 
actually happened in relation to the detail of each project, its 
execution and financing should be rather dealt with in an 
affidavit provided by SSA by or under the authority of the 
Director-General.  Do you follow that? 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 95 of 163 
 
MS K:   Yes, I do follow. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So for the moment I will confine my 
questions to you to general observations which you have 
already made, rather than go to the detail of the prescripts 
that clearly would interest and concern the Chair which we 
will deal with in due course.  If that is permissible Chair?  I 
do not want to put this in a position where ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...she has to stray into ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  That is fine. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...territory which she may not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You do, however, make certain 
general observations.  If you look at SSA-1 at page 22. 
MS K:   Yes, sir. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   This is a page of the Ministerial 
Delegation of Powers and Direction of Payment, the MPD, 
which has been declassified only to a certain extent. 
MS K:   Chair, I think I am lost.  Okay I got it now. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So have you got page 21 which is 
20 
the title page, cover page?  Do you see that? 
MS K:   Yes.  Yes, I am there now. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is the Ministerial Delegation of 
Powers and Direction of Payment.  It deals with the authority 
at various levels of management within the SSA who 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 96 of 163 
 
authorise that payments be made and certain categories of 
activity.  Am I correct? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you go to paragraph 5.2 which 
appears on page SSA-1, page 22.  You will see paragraph 
5.2.   
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It refers to cover structures.   
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It deals with the establishment of 
10 
and closure of a cover structure/cover project and the 
amounts under that head, paragraph 5.2.1 have been 
redacted.  Do you see that? 
MS K:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   They do not appear there. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   No amounts appear there and there 
is no reference to any other document. 
MS K:   No, it is not redacted. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, then you have an unredacted 
20 
version.  We do not have. 
MS K:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, while Mr Pretorius is conferring with 
a member of his team.  I note that in – at page 22, Ms K.  
That it looks like the DG is not restricted to any amount 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 97 of 163 
 
when he enters things, a member of the Foreign Intelligent 
Service whereas other officials are restricted to R 100 000,0, 
R 30 000,00, R 20 000,00 and so on.  Am I understanding 
this document correctly? 
MS K:   Yes, you are Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   May I ask what paragraph you are 
referring to Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   At page 22. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, the DG’s restricted. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, can you see that? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, let us put it this way.  Whether 
it was redacted by hand or redacted in the version set out 
before us or simply is not contained in this document, there 
is no information that we have as to the limitation under 
5.2.1, 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
enclosure 
of 
cover 
structure/cover project.  Do you see that?   
MS K:   Yes, I can. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Whether it has been hand redacted, 
it is just not there. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And in relation to ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   It is that ...[intervenes]  
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 98 of 163 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am sorry? 
MS K:   It is just has ...[indistinct] [00:11:44] all across all of 
the levels. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, yes.  So we do not have that 
information. 
MS K:   Apart from the DG’s one. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, yes.  Which has a Y there. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And if one goes over the page.  
There are certain categories of payment authorised which 
10 
are included but most of them that deal with amounts up to 
R 2 million.  I do not see any amount here in the region of 
R 10 million for example.  If one goes through the whole 
document.  Do you see that/ 
MS K:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In any event, I do not think it is 
entirely fair on you in those circumstances to deal in much 
more detail with the allegations in the paragraphs.  Safe to 
confirm the allegations you have made already which fall into 
two categories.   
20 
 
Firstly, 
you 
said 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
motivation 
for 
documents, as I understand your evidence, even in regard to 
operational plans, insufficient information was given to 
enable proper controls.  Do you stand by that evidence? 
MS K:   Yes.  Yes, I do. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 99 of 163 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And secondly, in regard to finances.  
As the DG, Mr Jafta said, the paper trail and the control 
documents 
contained 
insufficient 
information 
to 
ensure 
proper financial controls being implemented in relation to 
projects within the CDSO.  Would you agree with that 
proposition? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What is clear and perhaps you can 
assist the Chair in this regard.  The Project Veza which has 
conducted this investigation about which you testifying, has 
10 
been in existence for approximately two years. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Has the team worked continuously 
on its investigations during this period? 
MS K:   Yes, we have.  A dedicated team working full time on 
this project. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  And if you would please just 
give the Chair an estimate of the burden and scope of your 
investigation project.  Approximately how many persons 
would you have interviewed? 
20 
MS K:   I do not have that offhand but ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   A rough estimate. 
MS K:   I will have to consult on that because the transcript 
will assist me. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 100 of 163 
 
MS K:   [Indistinct]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So you would not interview 
...[intervenes]  
MS K:   [Indistinct]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is it in the hundreds? 
MS K:   No, I am saying.  I will ask a colleague of mine just 
to check the transcripts because all of the interviews were 
recorded.  So if we can just count the number of transcripts I 
10 
will be able to give you, even an estimation.  I do not have 
an estimation now.  An estimate figure. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Would it be more than 50? 
MS K:   Definitely? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   More than a hundred? 
MS K:   I do not know. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Maybe I am being unfair 
now.  And ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   My profuse apologies Ms K.  And in 
20 
relation to the documents, to be even more unfair, I suppose 
it would be quite unfair of us to ask you as to the volume of 
documentation that you had to deal with? 
MS K:   If you look at a walk-in safe in a room, you can just 
imagine boxes and boxes that it would be like three quarters 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 101 of 163 
 
of that room.  It is boxes of this information that we got. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Something like the study of the 
Chair. 
MS K:   [laughs] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  That is classified information 
Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MS K:   [laughs] 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Which are neatly piled up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Ms K, what I would just remark onto 
you and what we would say to the Judge in due course is 
that for a complete and proper investigation to be done into 
the affairs of the CDSO in the period under review.   
 
You would require a considerable capacity to complete 
the work.  And I am talking about manpower.   
 
You 
would 
require 
unlimited 
access 
to 
classified 
documents and you would require the cooperation of persons 
20 
and perhaps the opportunity to compel persons from the 
lowest operative level or the operative level right through to 
the most senior personnel including ministers.  Is that a fair 
assumption? 
MS K:   Yes. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 102 of 163 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In your investigation, did you have 
powers of compulsion? 
MS K:   No.  We do not have any powers of compulsion. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Good.  Well, not good.  I understand.  
If we can go then please back to the statement of Mr Y? 
MS K:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   At paragraph 6.16.  There reference 
is made to additional invoices submitted under Project 
Construção by external companies, PR(?) Cedemans, Napa 
and Squash [00:18:39] who provided invoices totalling at 
10 
least over R 24 million for “services rendered”.  Am I 
correct? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Again, did these invoices to your 
recollection, to your knowledge adequately reflect the nature 
of the services rendered and work done to enable proper 
controls to be implemented? 
MS K:   No.  In fact, the invoices looked – at face value 
when you look at them, when we analysed them.  It is the 
same paper and both invoices from the different companies 
20 
basically said payment in accordance to existing contract.  
So it was insufficient in that regard.   
 
And the other thing that I remember is that the – that 
Squash was a foreign company that was providing whatever 
services.   
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 103 of 163 
 
 
But it was – it would not be something that would 
...[indistinct] [00:20:05] the master or the, you know, the 
credibility check if you looked at it.   
 
And 
the 
invoices 
were 
usually 
addressed 
to, 
consistently, to two individuals.  Ja, and then that will just be 
proof.  The invoice and the acknowledgement of receipt of 
cash would be what is attached to the TA. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Now that will be the sum total of – or 
not the sum total.  That will be the documentation which 
would be used to justify, firstly, payment and secondly 
10 
receipt of cash.  Am I correct? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  If we can go then paragraph 
6.1.7?  It reads: 
“In December 2016, a submission as compiled to 
request the DG, then Mr Arthur Fraser, who waived 
the advertising and the appointment processes in 
respect 
of 
33 
people 
attached 
to 
Project 
Construção.” 
 
This submission is contained in File 2 of SSA Bundle 
20 
and is marked or as is marked as Annexure C12.  I just want 
to look at it if you would give me a moment Ms K to see if it 
is necessary to disclose it before the Chair. 
MS K:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I think it is important to summarise 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 104 of 163 
 
below and if you have a need to look at the document to 
support what is said below, please just say so Ms K.  It 
reads: 
“The 
urgency 
of 
the 
proposed 
waiver(?) 
was 
motivated on the basis that the project would soon 
end as it had been decided by the principle client 
and the SSA executive to call for a termination of 
the project when the term allocated expires at the 
end of March 2017.” 
 
So it seems that certain work had to be done on an 
10 
urgent basis because the project was about to come to an 
end.  Do I understand your correctly? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   There is reference there to the 
principle client. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I do not want to ask you who that 
client was but is that client an individual or an institution or 
do you not know? 
MS K:   I do not know whether – I do not know who they 
20 
were referring to ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
MS K:   ...with regards to – ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Perhaps we can get other evidence 
to that effect.   
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 105 of 163 
 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The paragraph continues: 
“However, Project Construção was extended several 
times after the Cover Support Unit took over 
operational expenses for the project in September 
2017 and final payments to the remaining co-
workers were only made in September 2018.” 
 
Is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Let us go on to deal with 
10 
Project Mayibuye.  As I understand it and it appears from 
what is set out below, Project Mayibuye was a collective 
name for several projects.  Am I correct? 
MS K:   It was a project with operations within that project. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Okay.   
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   7.18 says: 
“Project Mayibuye was initiated by Mr Thulani Dlomo 
and was initially approved by Ambassador Kudjoe in 
January 2015 at the same time as other CDSO 
20 
projects were approved. 
This submission for the establishment of Project 
Mayibuye is contained in the SSA Bundle and is 
marked Annexure MO.   
It was renewed and continued after the departure of 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 106 of 163 
 
Ambassador Kudjoe and the subsequent arrival of 
Mr Fraser as DG in September 2016.” 
 
Is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 6.19 quotes from the 
motivation for the establishment of the project and says: 
“According to the motivation put forward in seeking 
approval for the Project Mayibuye it was established 
“to provide counterintelligence support that would 
enable to step up state authority and its organs of 
10 
governance 
(justice, 
parliament, 
provincial 
legislatures) against hostile behaviour or radical 
intend and the undermining of law and governance 
in general”. 
Minister 
Mahlobo 
continuously 
approved 
the 
utilisation 
of 
retained 
earnings 
to 
fund 
these 
operations despite advise that the retained earnings 
(unexpended funds) should be saved and utilised for 
infrastructure 
development 
to 
develop 
the 
intelligence capabilities of the SSA.” 
20 
 
Who decide the sentence that I have just read about the 
use of retained earnings?  But can you confirm that the 
motivation was couched in the terms you have set out – 
sorry, not what you have set out, what Mr Y set out in 
paragraph 6.1.9.   
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 107 of 163 
 
MS K:   I cannot confirm ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   ...the motivation. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
...it 
is 
there 
in 
annexure 
...[intervenes]  
MS K:   But because it is quoted, I am assuming it comes 
from the original documents. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, it does and ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   Because it is a deportation.  So I cannot oppose 
that. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  It is there for anybody 
...[intervenes]  
MS K:   But...  Yes.  And then the part of the approval of 
...[indistinct] [00:26:33] of retained earnings.  I agree with 
that.  We have seen the documentation.  I am not sure about 
the advise that it should be saved and utilised.  I was – I do 
not have any evidence that shows anyone giving advice.  So 
ja, that is where I would end it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 6.2.0 reads: 
“A submission dated 31 May 2016, authorisation was 
20 
given for the renewal of Project Mayibuye and 
payment 
to 
belated 
expenditure 
between 
1 April 2016 
and 
31 March 2017 
approving 
the 
budget of R 54.1 million, the submission for renewal 
and further funding of Project Mayibuye is contained 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 108 of 163 
 
in the SSA Bundle as Annexure M25.” 
 
I am not going to go to either of those documents for the 
moment.  They may become relevant later.    
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But let us go to paragraph 6.2.1.  It 
reads: 
“By way of an example as to how operational funds 
would be withdrawn for Project Mayibuye, this 
approval is attached as support for a temporary 
advance dated 30 June 2016 for R 4.4 million with 
10 
the accompanying certificate bearing the signature 
of those who took receipt of the cash for various 
operations under Project Mayibuye.   
This TA or temporary advance is included in File 2 of 
Bundle SSA Bundle and is marked as Annexure 
M15.” 
 
Let us just have a look at that if we may? 
MS K:   Yes.  M15.   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   M15 is at page ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   Yes, I am... 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   ...453 of SSA-1. 
MS K:   453? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes. 
MS K:   Yes, I am there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   [No audible reply]  
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 109 of 163 
 
MS K:   I have got it Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct] [Microphone muted] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you just bear with me a moment 
Ms K. 
MS K:   [No audible reply]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you could go then to page 458. 
MS K:   Page? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   458. 
MS K:   458.  Okay.  Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, perhaps we should – a lot of 
that is illegible, perhaps we should go to the certificate of 
receiving cash on page 464.  That is the type of document 
that Mr Jafta referred to as a raising concern.  453 and 454 
are certificates of receiving cash.  Do you see that? 
MS K:   Yes, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So let us look at the invoice which 
gave rise to that. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is on page 462 of SSA1.  Do you 
20 
see that? 
MS K:   Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Repeat that page, Mr Pretorius?   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat the page number? 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 110 of 163 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Page 462, SSA1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It says in an invoice: 
“Professional fees as per the approved contract.” 
That is a piece of evidence that you have just given. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Quantity 1, unit price R4.4 million, 
amount R4.4 million.  Do you see that? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And that is all that is said and then 
10 
in relation to the receipt of cash there are several 
certificates. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But each of them says underneath 
the head: 
“Reasons for giving cash, Project Mayibuye, Ops 
Gustus.” 
Is one of them at 464.  Do you see that?  For 1.4 million. 
MS K:   Yes.  Yes, I see that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And over the page 1.4 million 
20 
again, all that is said is Ops Gustus as the reason for 
giving cash.  Do you see that? 
MS K:   Yes and Mayibuye in brackets. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Mayibuye in brackets. 
MS K:   Yes. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 111 of 163 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That again by way of example you 
have 
made 
the 
general 
conclusions 
in 
relation 
to 
documents of that nature and as has DG Jafta.  Paragraph 
6.22 says: 
“Based on the TAs…” 
That is the temporary advances. 
“…which 
have 
been 
located 
during 
our 
investigation, the total paid in respect of Project 
Mayibuye amounts to R84.79 million.  This includes 
eight invoices totalling 38.88 million which was 
10 
submitted by an unnamed company and one invoice 
for R6.9 million submitted by another company or 
service provider.” 
Is that what the investigation came to find? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And that is based on what you 
could locate, is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is it necessarily the full amount? 
MS K:   I do not think so, sir.  I do not think so. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then if one goes to 6.23, it 
reads: 
“Project Mayibuye comprised several operations 
including 
Operation 
Commitment, 
Operation 
Justice/Simunye, Operation Lock and Operation 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 112 of 163 
 
Sesikona 
which 
are 
detailed 
separately 
below.  
Reference is also made in submissions for Project 
Mayibuye to Operation Safe Return and Operation 
Platinum but little is known about these operations.” 
Do you have any comment on that general statement? 
MS K:   Yes.  I do agree with the paragraph as it stands. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us deal then with Operation 
Commitment which is an operation, as you have said, 
under Project Mayibuye.  6.24 reads: 
“Operation 
Commitment 
involved 
monthly 
10 
withdrawals of cash by, among others, Frank, Darryl 
and Dorothy.” 
Those are all pseudonyms. 
“…which 
were 
delivered 
on 
more 
than 
one 
occasion...” 
MS K:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Pretorius.  Should there 
be an amendment here? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, there will have to be and that 
will be made in due course, as soon as we can. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whoever uses the pseudonym of Sharon 
[indistinct – dropping voice] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, ignore that name. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Not involved. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 113 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But there will – I am sorry, I should 
have made it clear before getting to that paragraph that 
after discussions with a particular counsel a particular 
name – I hope I am being vague enough. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is fine.  It is just important that I 
want to see if what – whether I have the same document as 
you have. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So when you read something that is 
10 
different from what I have, that is why I want to check. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I will alert you to it beforehand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It reads: 
““Operation 
Commitment 
involved 
monthly 
withdrawals of cash by, among others, Frank, Darryl 
and Dorothy which were delivered on more than one 
occasion to the Minister during the period when Mr 
Mahlobo was Minister of State Security.” 
Do know of that?  Can you confirm that? 
20 
MS K:   Yes.  Yes, I can. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The paragraph continues: 
“The allegation made to the investigation team was 
that these funds were intended for onward delivery 
by Minister Mahlobo to President Zuma.” 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 114 of 163 
 
Can you confirm that that is what you learnt in the 
investigation or were told at least? 
MS K:   Yes, that is what we were told. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   
“In his interview with our investigation team, Frank 
confirmed that he dropped off monthly withdrawals 
of R2.5 million to Minister Mahlobo’s office under 
Operation Commitment and indicated he had heard 
that these payments were going to “the project of 
the President” but could not confirm that this was 
10 
indeed the case.  It should be noted that the Project 
Veza investigation team has not found any proof 
that 
President 
Zuma 
in 
fact 
received 
these 
payments nor is there any acknowledgement of such 
receipt by him.” 
Is that the correct position? 
MS K:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you happen to ask Minister 
Mahlobo about these allegations? 
MS K:   There was an intent to ask.  When he was still 
20 
member of parliament before he was appointed Deputy 
Minister Water Affairs, we were engaging with Minister – 
form Minister Letsatsi-Dube’s office and we crafted letters 
with certain questions and we asked that via the Minister ’s 
office this be disseminated because this – it was not just 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 115 of 163 
 
him, it also included another former Minister and other 
senior officials that had left the organisation. 
 
Now we thought that the ministry would the process 
that …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, perhaps we should not go 
any further that because we are dealing with a specific 
individual, so let me not take that any further, all we know 
is that the investigation team made an effort.  Evidence 
regarding the conduct of Minister Mahlobo will be dealt 
with elsewhere.  Hopefully we will have an opportunity to 
10 
speak to him.  So can – is that okay? 
MS K:   I get that but I have to point out that ultimately the 
letter was delivered back to the team to be delivered to 
Minister Mahlobo and when he was contacted he actually 
scolded a member of the team and said the member of the 
team must tell the former Minister that he will expose her. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, let us …[intervenes] 
MS K:   That is where it ended. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, let us leave that there for the 
moment, Ms K, if we may.  Paragraph 6.25 – well, let me 
20 
put it this way.  Leave Mr – Minister Mahlobo out of the 
equation for the moment. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Has the investigation team 
attempted to investigate fully by reference to all implicated 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 116 of 163 
 
and concerned whether these amounts actually reached 
President Zuma as appears to have been intended by the 
project? 
MS K:   We did not have the capacity to investigate fully.  
When we hear allegations and we see that people in terms 
of the TAs, the financial system, we can see that people 
withdrew money for that project and they indicated that we 
delivered it wherever.  We did not get an opportunity to – if 
we – had we engaged him, I think we would have tried to – 
that was our effort to try and establish if indeed he did 
10 
receive and whether – because we were going to put these 
allegations to him. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, so what you know is that an 
operation 
was 
conceived, 
the 
operation 
involved 
the 
withdrawals of cash on a monthly basis.  You were told that 
these amounts were delivered or amounts were delivered 
on more than one occasion to Minister Mahlobo and you 
cannot take it any further insofar as your investigations 
have gone despite an effort to investigate further.   
MS K:   Yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is that a fair summary/ 
MS K:   Yes, yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Paragraph 6.25 reads: 
“According 
to 
Lilly, 
these 
monthly 
payments 
amounted to…” 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 117 of 163 
 
And Lilly is a pseudonym. 
“…these monthly payments amounted to about R24 
million 
in 
the 
2015/2016 
financial 
year 
and 
increased to R54.1 million in the 2016/2017 year.” 
Is that what Lilly informed the investigation team? 
MS K:   That is what I am told, Chair.  I have never met 
Lilly and by the time the Veza team started, I think she was 
interviewed and submitted a statement before I joined the 
team. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  The next sentence reads: 
10 
“Frank…” 
Also a pseudonym. 
“…reported that he received firm instructions from 
Minister Mahlobo that these amounts must be made 
available notwithstanding challenges in accessing 
these funds.” 
Is that what Frank reported to the investigation? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us deal with the next operation, 
Operation Justice and Simunye.  6.26 reads? 
20 
“Operation 
Justice 
concerned 
the 
alleged 
influencing, recruiting and handling of sources 
within the judiciary.” 
We have learnt from previous evidence that sources there 
meant member of the judiciary, am I correct? 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 118 of 163 
 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The second sentence reads: 
“The purported aim was to ensure harmony between 
the State and the Justice fraternity and allegedly 
included efforts to influence the outcome of cases.” 
Was that what the investigation was told or established? 
MS K:   That is what we were told, that is why we say 
purported aim.  I cannot remember whether we were told – 
ja, we asked questions, we sent written questions to 
certain individuals and that is the response that we got and 
10 
apart from that I think it will also be addressed in 6.27. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Did you ask these questions of 
persons involved in execution of the project? 
MS K:   Yes, specifically those who had taken TAs for 
Mayibuye because in Mayibuye you had all of these 
operations, so we had to pose that question in writing and 
we got written responses where before we even had a face-
to-face interview with some.  So that was – we did get 
written responses that were explaining what this was 
about. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
MS K:   From certain implicated individuals. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   These written responses, the 
documentary evidence and the recorded oral evidence are 
a matter of record, is that correct? 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 119 of 163 
 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 6.27 reads: 
“From a submission dated 20 July 2015 requesting 
authorisation for the renewal and funding of Project 
Mayibuye it appears that Operation Justice was the 
continuation of an earlier project called Simunye.” 
Is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   This submission is included in file 
2 of the SSA bundle and is marked as annexure M4.  File 2 
10 
is the subdivision, Chair.  I hope your file has been 
subdivided into the three files. 
MS K:   Yes, it is. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But SSA1 is the file that we need 
to look at for annexure M4. 
MS K:   Page? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let me get it for you, hold on, 
please? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius did you say my file has 
already been subdivided? 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC: I cannot say [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, it is fine if it has not, I just wanted 
to make sure that I heard you correctly because I did not 
think it has been …[intervenes]

ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Is it not there? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, does not look like.  I have got 
some pink dividers that have been put in but there is 
nothing written on them to indicate this is supposed to 
represent file 1 or what. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   My apologies, I will see to that 
personally after the adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and there are two of them and not 
three, so I do not know. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you would go to page 380 of 
10 
SSA1. 
MS K:   Yes, I am there. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That is annexure M4.  It is a letter 
addressed to the Director General SSA dated 20 July 2015, 
it has been declassified. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And it is a letter whose purpose is 
to renew and fund a cover project and payment of related 
expenses for Project Mayibuye.  Do you see that? 
MS K:   Yes. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you would just bear with me for a 
moment, Chair?  And paragraph 2.4 on page 381 reads: 
“Project Simunye was intended to intensify and 
strengthen 
state 
authority 
within 
the 
judiciary 
system under which contact and relevant assets 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 121 of 163 
 
were to be acquired, utilised for the purpose of 
positive influencing state power and control of the 
judiciary.” 
Do you see that? 
MS K:   Yes, I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that in writing is the motivation for 
the renewal and funding of cover project under Project 
Mayibuye in that letter date 20 July 2015. 
MS K:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In case it makes any difference, Mr 
10 
Pretorius, where you said control of the judiciary, it says 
control over. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Control over the judiciary, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, on the letter. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   My apologies, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That statement that the project was 
intended to influence state power and exercise control over 
the judiciary, is that consistent with your knowledge of 
what you were told about Project Justice which later 
20 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MS K:   No.  No, not verbally, we were not told that.  We 
just discovered it in the submissions, the documentation. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Can I just – sorry? 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 122 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   This might assist me on the 
following, Chair, there is documents that were given to us 
as annexures referencing with these particular paragraphs 
and as I have been following evidence, this implicate my 
client, 
then 
they 
were 
given 
to 
us 
as 
declassified 
annexures to be used in particular for this notice 3.3. in 
respect of my client. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   I just want to check with the 
10 
counsel for the Commission because I have annexure M 
and I thought he was introducing and then he was referring 
to M4.  To me it was just MM, marked as M, maybe I am 
just confusing and I do not have M4 or it was not intended 
to be given to me.  If I may complete, M refers annexure 
something different.  Just for clarity, so that I do not 
confuse… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, this letter is annexure M4 
according to what is written here and it is a letter date 20 
July 2015, it has got State Security letterheads and does 
20 
that indicate the same thing that you have or not? 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   No, Chair, hence I am trying to 
clarify. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you at page 380? 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Chair, Chair will remember that 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 123 of 163 
 
we do not have the bundle as you are [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you were only given …[intervenes] 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   We would have been extracts of 
certain things and in between. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   So now hence I am also looking at 
this annexure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Because these annexures were 
10 
give to me in an attempt to reference certain notice that we 
were given. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   So that is why I am trying to 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Pretorius can address that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, I do not have sight of 
precisely at this stage what was given.  In fact we can – I 
can arrange to have one of the members of the legal team 
to speak to counsel in due course. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am in no position to answer the 
question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  If – well, I do not know what the 
guiding principles were in terms of who was given what but 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 124 of 163 
 
maybe since it is declassified, maybe if one of your team 
members has got a spare copy they could give it to him. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, no problem with that. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Without really disrupting, I know 
my learned colleague yesterday said he will only progress 
when the right(?) is not disturbing him.  I had no intention 
waking up this morning to disruptive. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   However, I am sitting here with a 
headache because – and you can imagine me having a 
10 
headache with this big head.  So …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, what you have raised seems 
to be a legitimate issue so …[intervenes] 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Yes.  So I have always been, 
Chair, with the direction of the Chair being told that no, we 
will stop, please stop disrupting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   But I think this pervasive of an 
injustice if I may use those words. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Because I am not really following 
and these are declassified information that were intended 
to be given to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   If we are – do then continue under 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 125 of 163 
 
that vein, I will always be left in the dark and I will always 
intervene as if I am being disruptive to the proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  No, no, no, it is important that if 
there is something that relates to your client you should 
have it.  Mr Pretorius, I …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, the one option would be to 
hand the whole bundle over to my learned friend. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But I do not want to do it at this 
stage until it is placed on record and until I am convinced 
10 
or satisfied that all the necessary redactions have been 
made. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And I am not satisfied on that 
score at the moment.  We have been told by the legal 
representatives at the SSA that we may put this whole 
before the witnesses but there are still aspects about 
which I am not satisfied and ultimately we take the 
responsibility not the SSA for what we place before you.   
So there are a number of issues arising, and I am 
20 
still coming across them, that require further redactions as 
a precaution and they are being – that is being done.  
Once that has been done then we can hand the whole file 
over to my learned friend. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the concern which he raised, and I 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 126 of 163 
 
think it is legitimate, is that he is sitting there but it is no 
use him sitting there if he cannot follow the evidence 
because he does not have certain documents.  That is the 
concern.  Should I adjourn for ten minutes to see 
…[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well, Chair, let me put it this way. 
Where a statement implicates a person directly or perhaps 
even indirectly, that information is placed before the 
person by way of 3.3 notice.  To say that everything that a 
witness says in relation to a particular project must also be 
10 
placed is task which is just not capable of reasonable 
execution. 
 
If a problem is raised, however, we can meet that 
problem and I am happy to do so.  So what we can do, on 
your suggestion, is give that document, which has been 
declassified to my learned friend and he can read it and 
follow the evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but the question is whether it can be 
given to him immediately or …[intervenes] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes it can. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay, so that will be given to him 
then. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   But maybe my learned colleague 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 127 of 163 
 
is misunderstanding my argument. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   And I have not by any chance said 
that I be given everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   And I am quite aware of evidence 
is presented here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   What I am raising today of, and I 
have been consistent since Monday, is what has been 
10 
disclosed to me purporting to be a particular document in 
reference to an annexure on a paragraph that has been 
disclosed to me, so these are documents that I am already 
in possession either when they were given with a 3.3 or as 
they were declassified progressively to me and disclosed. 
 
Now I am sitting with a document here that refers to 
M. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   And in reference to a particular 
paragraph that now he is tendering evidence on. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but do not repeat the point, you 
have made the point. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Okay, thank you, Chair.  I 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have made the point, ja.  They will 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 128 of 163 
 
give you a copy of the document. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, let us proceed. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us got to the document referred 
to in paragraph 6.29 please. 
MS K:   Yes? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is annexure M15. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you done with the document at 
page 380? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MS K:   Yes, I am at M15. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page is M15? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, 6.29, I am just getting the 
page.  Page 453.  If you go to page 454, a description of 
Project Mayibuye and particularly Project Justice and 
Operation 
Sesikona, 
Operation 
Justice 
and 
Operation 
Sesikona is dealt with.  Would you go there please?   
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It is in paragraph A of 2.4. 
20 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It reads: 
“Achievements…” 
That should be placed in context – let me take a step back 
– of the purpose of the communication dated 31 May 2016, 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 129 of 163 
 
a declassified document addressed to the Director General 
of SSA, it is headed: 
“Request for authorisation, renewal of cover Project 
Mayibuye and payment to the expenditure related to 
Project Mayibuye from 1 April 2016 to 31 March 
2017.” 
And you have told the Chair Operation Justice was part of 
Project Mayibuye. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   If you look at the following page 
10 
454, para 2.4[a] it is headed achievements: 
“Amongst other operation through Project Mayibuye 
Chief Directorate Special Operations managed to 
gain access and interaction with the Justice [Ops 
Justice] system through what was becoming an 
alarming concern over the friction that existed 
between the State and the justice utility.” 
That should read “justice fraternity”, and I presume the pun 
was unintended.     
MS K:   [laughing] 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    
“In the same breath CDSO contributed largely to 
the rise in confidence in the justice by the public 
through its influential role in the media reporting, 
utilising well placed media personnel.  Operation 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 130 of 163 
 
Sesikhona is another of such success here the 
project 
aimed 
at 
stabilising 
the 
nature 
public 
practice by the group in Cape Town, but also ensure 
that the nature of protests do not undermine the 
integrity of the State, nor do they cause a negative 
impression to investors.”   
Apparently, the influence of the CDSO operations has 
forced the organisation to adopt a much more moderate 
approach in the form of protest.  We will come to that in 
due course. But do you confirm that that extract that I have 
10 
just read to you is contained in an official declassified SSA 
document? 
MS K:   Yes, I can confirm that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We go to paragraph 8.30 please, 
sorry, 6.30.  It reads: 
“Amounts of between and 4.5 million Rand were 
regularly taken from the SSA and allegedly and 
delivered to Minister Mahlobo, who is reported to be 
the person directly making onward payments as part 
of 
Operation 
Justice. 
One 
of 
the 
implicated 
20 
individuals 
confirmed 
that 
she 
had 
personally 
delivered R4.5 million to Minister Mahlobo’s office 
on at least three occasions.” 
What do you say about that paragraph? 
MS K:   I can confirm that that what was said. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 131 of 163 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Said to the investigation team 
during the course of its investigations? 
MS K:   Yes, also in writing from the implicated individual. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, paragraph 6.31 reads: 
“Mr Frank pseudonym confirmed to the investigation 
team that he was instructed to deliver money 
regularly to Minister Mahlobo for Project Justice 
starting at R1.3million but extending upward to 
R21.8million.  He asserted that he was not aware of 
the details of Operation Justice beyond the general 
10 
context that, “there was a complaint that the Judges 
were colluding to overthrow the government. So and 
operation was established”, and his deliveries of 
cash to the Minister's office were, “to deal with the 
issue of Judges.” 
Was that information given to the Veza Investigation as 
part of its investigation? 
MS K:   Yes, we had a – it was through an interview with 
Frank.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, and then paragraph 6.32: 
20 
“Needless to say, the very existence and stated 
purpose 
of 
Operation 
Justice, 
irrespective 
of 
whether it was indeed implemented, constitutes a 
fundamental breach of the separation of powers and 
an 
unconstitutional 
attempt 
to 
compromise 
the 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 132 of 163 
 
independence of the judiciary.” 
What do you say about that statement? 
MS K:   I agree with that statement fully. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   DG Jafta gave evidence that the 
investigations were ongoing.  Do you know of that? 
MS K:   Pardon? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Director General Jafta or Acting 
Director General Jafta, gave evidence this week. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That the investigations into 
10 
Operation Justice were continuing.  Is that correct, can you 
confirm that as part of the investigation team? 
MS K:   The investigation is ongoing.  However, I think I 
have to postpone my response to this and include that in 
my statement. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, thank you for that caution. Let 
us go on then to deal with Operation Lock.  If you could 
just bear with me a moment, please.  There is another 
document that I would wish to show you in relation to 
Operation Justice, we are just looking for it.   
20 
But let us move on to paragraph 8.33, Operation 
Lock, 8.33 I am sorry 6.33. Operation Lock, says the 
paragraph: 
“Involved 
the 
provision 
of 
a 
safe 
house 
and 
protection to Mr Eugene de Kock, after he was 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 133 of 163 
 
released from prison.” 
Apparently on the basis of a memorandum of understanding 
with the Department of Correctional Services.   
“Lilly pseudonym indicated that Operation Lock was 
allocated around R100 000 to R200 000 per month, 
which included the lease of a safe house, living 
expenses and a salary of around R40 000 to Mr De 
Kock 
for 
which 
he 
signed 
acknowledgement 
receipts.” 
Did you come to be told that during the course of your 
10 
investigation? 
MS K:   No, Sir. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   How did you establish that or how 
was that established, do you know or can you confirm this 
at all? 
MS K:   I can confirm that I saw her affidavit that was 
stating this.  No, I think it was in the report that was 
written 
by 
another, 
the 
previous 
project 
manager 
of 
momentum.  So I am not certain of this because I did not 
have 
an 
opportunity 
to 
send 
questions 
to 
Lily 
or 
20 
interviewed Lily because she had left the organisation 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
Alright, 
being 
an 
internal 
investigation 
was 
the 
Veza 
Investigation, 
limited 
to 
inquiries 
and 
information 
obtained 
from 
within 
the 
organisation. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 134 of 163 
 
MS K:   It was in terms of people that were implicated. 
However, it was also possible for us to request information 
from other law enforcement agencies, for instance, when 
we cited to lifestyle audience, we would involve the FIC.   
So - but mostly, the investigation team did not have 
powers to be going beyond the people that remained 
members of SSA, unless you went through maybe the 
Ministry or something.  So that is one of the hurdles. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you if you just bear with me 
a moment. 
10 
MS K:   But…[intervene] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am sorry, I interrupted you. 
MS K:   I do not know if I should add what we tried to do in 
terms of Lily.  We wrote, DJ wrote a letter to the current 
employer to indicate that there is this issue and can he be 
alerted, but we never got a response that was a year ago. 
And then what we could do is just to include her in the list 
of implicated individuals in the A1 statement that was 
submitted to the DPCI. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you. If you look then at 
20 
paragraph 6.34, can you…[intervene] 
MS K:   Yes, Sir. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Can you comment on paragraph 
6.34, still under Operation Lock? 
MS K:   Yes. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 135 of 163 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Can you make any comment in 
relation to the contents of that paragraph? 
MS K:   I can only make comments in relation to the last 
part, the latter part there, Frank informed the investigation 
team, because that is when we had the interview.  The 
other part I cannot.  But I have to underline that Mr Y and I 
have different responsibilities and access to information. 
So 
because 
his 
position 
he 
would 
have 
had 
more 
information on some of these operations compared to what 
we had, because what we had was basically, we were 
10 
relying on what the documents that we found and whether - 
how a person responds to written questions or verbal 
questions. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, well as a precaution and 
because certain names are mentioned there, let us just 
move on to Operation Sesikhona, can we do that?   
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 6.35.  Paragraph 6.35 
reads as follows: 
“Operation Sesikhona was purportedly aimed at 
20 
stabilising the nature of public protest by a Cape 
Town 
based 
group 
of 
homeless 
activists 
who 
demonstrated and spilled human waste on the 
streets, and at national key points, such as Cape 
Town International Airport.  The cause of concern 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 136 of 163 
 
for the CDSO was that the nature of these projects 
could undermine the integrity of the State and 
create a negative impression to investors.  In a 
request 
for 
the 
renewal 
of 
Project 
Mayibuye 
Operation Sesikhona was singled out, along with 
Operation Justice for its achievements.” 
This submission is included in file 2 of SAS Bundle and it 
is marked as Annexure M15.  We have put on record some 
of that document, we need not to go any further, we can go 
to paragraph 6.36 but before we do so, do you have any 
10 
comment on what the investigation discovered in relation 
to the matters set out in paragraph 6.35? 
MS K:   Let me just say, paragraph 3.6.5 and paragraph 
6.36 up to 6.36.3, I cannot comment on those because I do 
not have direct knowledge of that information. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well in paragraph 6.36 it refers to 
interviews with former members of the CDSO outlining or 
outlined their activities and Operations Sesikhona as 
covering the following. 
UNKOWN COUNSEL:   I would need to object, it cannot be 
20 
correct, my learned colleague what he is attempting to do.  
The witness becomes specific and we must consciously 
remember that this witness is…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, sorry please start afresh. 
UNKOWN COUNSEL:   Okay.  I must object to what my 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 137 of 163 
 
learned colleague is trying to and attempting to do.  More 
specifically 
relating 
to 
this 
paragraph, 
this 
witness 
becomes very specific and direct my learned colleague and 
say 6.35 and 3.6 I cannot comment because I was not 
direct, I do not even have this personal knowledge.  
More so she has filed almost a disclaimer again 
before that and said remember me and Mr Y are not 
familiarised in the same or we are not vested with the 
same powers.  He might have had more information than I  
have and we must also cautiously thread with her evidence 
10 
because she is supposed to be a confirmatory affidavit if 
one can use it colloquially.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well…[intervene] 
UNKOWN COUNSEL:   Now…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on. Just remind me what the 
question is which you are objecting? 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   No, my learned…[intervene] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Well I have not finished my 
question Chair, so my learned colleague does not know 
what I am going to ask, really Chair this is really 
20 
unacceptable Chair to be interrupted in the middle of the 
question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why do you not let him finish the 
question then we can address your concern if you do have 
any properly.  
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 138 of 163 
 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Yes, Chair hence I stood and say 
cautiously before I attempted to address it.  Chair, it could 
not be correct that you will want to attempt to read a 
paragraph…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I do not know what he wants to 
say. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am not going to read the 
paragraph here.  Chair it is really interesting…[intervene] 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   How would…[intervene] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am talking now.  No Chair I am 
10 
sorry that I must draw the line somewhere.  There have 
been continual attempts to interfere with the leading of 
evidence and the presentation of evidence throughout the 
last few days. It is really objectionable when a colleague 
professional colleague gets up to interrupt a question 
before the question is finished.  He does not know what 
question I am going to ask.  
I respect and I know what the witness has said, and 
I am not attempting to undermine that at all.  My question 
is directed at an entirely different object, and would render 
20 
quite 
unnecessary 
the 
quite 
uncalled 
for, 
and 
rude 
interruption by my learned friend. 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   I have avoided to get into a battle 
with my learned colleague on personalities and with 
respect Chair I was not rude about this.  Let me tell you 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 139 of 163 
 
what indications gave me because he was saying to the 
witness…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no…[intervene] 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Can I just finish my…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, let us just not proceed, you have 
withdrawn the objection…[intervene] 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Maybe on that basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Pretorius has made his points, let 
him continue. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   In paragraph 6.3.6 there is mention 
10 
of interviews with former members of the CDSO.  Do you 
know who conducted these interviews? 
MS K:   These interviews were conducted by investigators 
who are part of the team of the Project Veza team. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right and I take it from your 
previous 
answers 
that 
you 
were 
not 
one 
of 
those 
investigators? 
MS K:   No, I was not present and I think if you check 6.37 
it does say a feedback report was provided on the 
operations undertaken.   
20 
So all of that, from 6.35, 6.36 and all of that, that is 
under Sesikhona and whatever happened up to it I did not -
up to 6.36.3, we do not have first-hand and confirmed 
information on that except that report that they compiled. 
Unfortunately, when there was no sworn statement.  I 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 140 of 163 
 
cannot say that I can confirm what is expressed here. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That report in 6.37 to the extent 
that it deals with further activities, and the above activities 
we are attempting to obtain Annexure O is not in the 
bundle and it should read Annexure N I am instructed not 
Annexure O. 
MS K:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, let us then move on if we 
may.  Chair if I was a little harsh and direct to my learned 
friend, apologies. 
10 
UNKNOWN COUNSEL:   Apology accepted. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you, so we are not best of 
friends but once more best of colleagues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As we should be Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is true.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   As colleagues we should never 
raise our voices against one another and I apologise.  
Project Hollywood is dealt with in paragraph 6.38. Project 
Hollywood, are you able to comment on this? 
20 
MS K:   Yes, I am able to comment on it. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right, let us just deal with it.   
“Project 
Hollywood 
was 
established 
on 
16 
November 
2015 
to 
commence 
in 
April 
2016 
renewable every three months.” 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 141 of 163 
 
This admission for the establishment of Project Hollywood 
is included as Annexure HO, we will get there if we need 
to. 
“The stated objective of the project was conducting 
surveillance and monitoring, and involved the illegal 
interception of high profile politically prominent or 
connected 
individuals 
and 
government 
officials. 
Monthly withdrawals of R800 000,00 cash were 
made to pay - and there is a name of a company, 
which I do not want to put on record as yet, 
10 
purportedly for the provision of intelligence and 
security services, including the remuneration of 
operatives, 
surveillance, 
platform 
setting 
and 
encrypted communication hire.” 
These invoices are reflected in the index to Project 
Hollywood, contained in file three.  What do you say about 
the contents of that paragraph, and let us not mention the 
company for the present? 
MS K:   It is accurate. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   6.39 goes on to say: 
20 
“However, the details provided by the service 
provider 
were 
found 
to 
be 
fictitious, 
and 
no 
evidence of a contract between that company and 
the SSA could be found in the course of our 
investigations.  In any event, this arrangement 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 142 of 163 
 
irrespective of whether the purported services were 
in 
fact 
rendered, 
constitutes 
an 
unlawful 
outsourcing 
of 
the 
SSA 
counter 
intelligence 
mandate and the creation of a parallel intelligence 
network.” 
Do you have any comments to make in that regard? 
MS K:   Just on the first sentence where it says, it is the 
details provided by the service provider.  I do not think we 
could say provided by them, we could just say, details 
contained on the invoice of the service provider. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, because service providers did 
not exist or did the service provider exist? 
MS K:   It does not exist really, we checked.  So there is 
no way they could - maybe they provided I do not know but 
they do not exist, according to our records.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right. 
MS K:   So apart from that, I agree with everything that is 
in there. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 Alright 
but 
it 
a 
bit 
of 
a 
contradiction too say…[intervene] 
20 
MS K:   And I also…[intervene] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That the service provider did not 
exist, and you had to refer to details provided by the 
service provider.  But for the moment, let us leave the 
name be. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 143 of 163 
 
MS K:   No, that is why I was saying details are not that 
were on the invoice that we saw…[intervene] 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   That purported to come from a 
service provider. 
MS K:   Yes, from that service provider.  That is what I am 
trying to communicate. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you.  Alright, let us move on 
then to Project Lungisa.  Paragraph 6.4.0: 
“Similar to Project Hollywood, Project Lungisa was 
established on 29 December 2015, renewable every 
10 
three months.” 
The submission for the establishment of Project Lungisa is 
included in file three of the SSA bundle, as is marked as 
Annexure LO.  
“The 
stated 
objective 
of 
the 
project 
was 
to 
neutralise and counter activities of individual’s 
intent on undermining the authorities.  Monthly 
withdrawals of R500 000,00 cash were used to pay 
an entity called – well let us leave them out for the 
moment, purportedly for the provision of economic 
20 
services, including data collection and analysis, the 
collection 
of 
financial 
statements 
from 
banks 
company and ownership analysis, the interviewing 
of assets and compiling of reports.” 
Is there anything wrong with the stated object of that 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 144 of 163 
 
project? 
MS K:   There is nothing wrong if it is done by SSA, you 
cannot outsource that just collecting financial statements 
from banks and company ownership analysis that can be 
done internally compiling reports.  So those services are 
not something that we needed to outsource. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is interviewing of, what is the 
interviewing of assets, what does that refer to? 
MS K:   Assets, where is this? 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is on paragraph 6.40 last sentence, 
10 
or second line from the bottom.  It is part of what that 
company…[intervene] 
MS K:   Assets could be…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Ms K do not speak while I am 
speaking.  
MS K:   Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is part of what that paragraph says the 
company mentioned there was paid for doing.  So I am 
asking what does that refer to, interviewing of assets? I 
have to ask because you said there was nothing wrong with 
20 
what they were doing but SSA could do the same so maybe 
you know, what is. 
MS K:   Assets could be a sources, agents whatever. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No I know what assets are I want to find 
out what are they talking about when they say interviewing 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 145 of 163 
 
of assets.  Unless the word assets…[intervene] 
MS K:   I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   …has a particular meaning within SSA. 
You did not know what this refers to? 
MS K:   I do not know, because let me say I do not know 
what they are referring to but what is reflected here is 
exactly what is reflected on the invoices.  So it is taken 
verbatim, from the invoices. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Presumably assets that would 
mean people capable of being interviewed who might 
10 
provide useful information.  Am I correct or not? 
MS K:   That is what I concluded was meant. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   We cannot be talking about fixed 
assets. 
MS K:   No. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Because although strange things 
happen in security, that clearly would not happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, we have to keep, you have to 
remain alive for a situation where what some of this 
entities might have been paid for us doing things that 
20 
nobody can explain. So we need to understand exactly 
what is that they do with taxpayer ’s money and whether it 
something.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you have any comment 
following what the Chair has just said, Ms K? 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 146 of 163 
 
MS K:   No, I have no comments, Sir. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 6.41 reads: 
“However, as in the case of Project Hollywood, the 
details provided by the service provider appeared to 
be fictitious, and no evidence of a contract between 
a 
SSA 
and 
the 
service 
provider 
has 
been 
established 
so 
far. 
 
In 
addition, 
there 
is 
no 
correlation between the stated objectives of Project 
Lungisa as per its approved submission, and the 
services that were purportedly provided.  In any 
10 
event, 
these 
purported 
services 
constitute 
an 
unlawful outsourcing of the SSA’s mandate and 
duplicate the services of the Financial Intelligence 
Centre.” 
Do you have any comment in that regard? 
MS K:   I agree with the paragraph? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 6.4.2 says: 
“The 
key 
persons 
implicated 
in 
both 
Project 
Hollywood and Project Lungisa are Ambassador 
Dlomo as Deputy Director Counter Intelligence, 
20 
Darrell, Lilly and Mandy, all pseudonyms.” 
Do you agree with that? 
MS K:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that a yes? 
MS K:   Yes, it is. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 147 of 163 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Chair, I just need consult briefly 
about the next section if you would bear with me a minute. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Let us move on Ms K to paragraph 
6.43 
where 
the 
statement 
deals 
with 
Project 
Accurate/Crescella.  It reads: 
“Project Crescella was a CDSO project run by 
Dr Mandisa Makwena, a non-SSA member but its 
activities overlapped with those of the Toxicology 
10 
Unit in established in 2012 as part of the Directorate 
for Presidential Security Support.” 
 
That project was approved on 30 April 2015 and the 
reference in the documentation is there.  It goes on to read: 
“Project Crescella was purportedly established to 
substitute Project Accurate with the 2013 Project 
Accurate operational plan without a budget, did not 
relied onto a plain approval for the establishment of 
Project Crescella in April 2015. 
The SSA’s operational directives do not permit 
20 
substitution 
but 
in 
any 
even 
Project Accurate 
continued to run parallel to Project Crescella.” 
 
What do you have to say if anything Ms K about 
paragraph 6.4.3 and 6.4.4? 
MS K:   I can confirm both paragraphs. 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 148 of 163 
 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  You confirm the contents of 
that paragraph.  Is that correct?   
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 6.4.5: 
“The 
irregularities 
extended 
to 
the 
monthly 
payments of R 1.8 million for Project Crescella as in 
certain instances submissions of Project Mayibuye 
were attached as the basis of the withdrawals. 
These 
withdrawals 
listed 
to 
Project 
Crescella 
included two invoices totalling R 9.5 million from a 
10 
company whose invoices are reflected in the index 
new Project Crescella.” 
 
Is that correct?  I am not sure I understand it totally.  
Perhaps you could explain? 
MS K:   Yes, it is correct Chair. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Is it just the incorrect 
allocation of expenditure between projects? 
MS K:   Yes.  One cannot withdraw money for one project 
when they are using a submission for a different project. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Let us go ...[intervenes]  
20 
MS K:   So Project Crescella submission – if it is a 
submission to withdraw R 1.8 million what is attached in 
terms of the operational plan, it cannot be Project Mayibuye 
Operational Plan.  So that is what is meant in general. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   6.4.6 reads: 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 149 of 163 
 
“The status objectives of Project Crescella also 
differed from submission to submission ranking from 
bioterrorism 
threats 
and 
threats 
to 
economic 
security to subversive acts and sabotage directed at 
strategic interest relations and national key-points.” 
 
Whatever the difference, I take it, no one can take issue 
with those objectives? 
MS K:   No. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It goes on to say ...[intervenes]  
MS K:   Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes, thank you. 
“These discrepancies are borne out in the accounts 
of those involved in the project.” 
 
The following sentence perhaps is important.  It reads: 
“Dr 
Makwena 
has 
stated 
under 
oath 
that 
all 
intelligence products were submitted directly to 
President Zuma, such that it cannot be confirmed 
whether the content of the professed intelligence 
project met the different objectives of the project. 
Moreover, this direct reporting line operated outside 
20 
the formal SSA intelligence clearance channels thus 
constituting 
a 
parallel 
information 
management 
process.” 
 
Do you have any comments on those observations? 
MS K:   Yes, I would just like to confirm that I have seen 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 150 of 163 
 
these – the affidavits that she deposed to.  So I agree with 
what is reflected there and the conclusion drawn. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  And 6.4.7 repeats what we 
have dealt with earlier particularly in relation to the failure of 
the Toxicology Unit and the operational expenditure of 
Project Crescella and its implementation failing to detect the 
alleged poisoning of the former President.  Those remarks 
are made in that paragraph.  Do you agree with them? 
MS K:   Yes, I do. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 6.8 deals with Project Tin 
10 
Roof.  You will be aware of the evidence that is given in this 
regard.  It involves the provision of a safe house and 
monies, maintenance monies to the wife MaNthuli of the 
former President Zuma.   
 
I am not sure that there is anything here that requires 
repetition.  Safe to confirm what was said by acting Director-
General Jafta in the last two sentences of paragraph 6.4.8 
where it reads: 
“In light of MaNthuli’s recent media interview, she 
describes this period as a detention where none of 
20 
her 
constitutional 
rights 
were 
observed 
or 
respected. 
The so-called “protection” desisted when MaNthuli 
sought the intervention of her legal counsel.” 
 
Can you confirm that? 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 151 of 163 
 
MS K:   Yes, I can confirm that I guess.  There is nothing 
that I can change about that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  And prior to that but perhaps 
we should put the whole paragraph on record so that we do 
not omit anything.  The paragraph begins as follows: 
“Project Tin Roof related to an investigation into the 
alleged poisoning of former President Zuma by his 
wife, MaNthuli. 
According to media reports, the diagnoses of former 
President Zuma’s poisoning occurred during his trip 
10 
to the United States in August 2014 and was 
subsequently confirmed in a foreign country.” 
The name of the country is deleted. 
“Project Tin Roof was established in December 2014 
at the instance of former Minister Mahlobo who had 
MaNthuli removed from Nkandla as a subject and 
given “protection and maintenance” by the SSA until 
the investigation was finalised.” 
 
And then the passages that we referred to earlier follow 
including the passage that says that protection desisted 
20 
when MaNthuli sought the intervention of her own legal 
counsel. 
 
Do you have knowledge of those allegations as part of 
the investigations? 
MS K:   In terms of the investigation, we actually interviewed 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 152 of 163 
 
the project leader of this end what really – I could add 
because I do not want to refer to media reports and I do not 
want to quantify the media reports but I know for sure is that 
the person involved in the project indicated that they were 
just called to stand by Ms MaNthuli Zuma.   
 
So and then they were involved in this project but he – I 
did ask – put the question to the President whether the 
intention of keeping MaNthuli in different safe houses, it was 
not just one because it - we incurred a lot of costs because 
of the moving around and VIP protection.   
10 
 
I asked whether that was a – that was she under 
protection or was – had she been detained.  And I could say 
that she ended up almost, although not verbatim by coming 
out clearly, that the person was detained.   
 
But when the facts were put to her in terms of the 
conditions, it seems – I do not know whether – she did not 
outright say yes she was detained but did admit that 
MaNthuli was kept in different safe houses and there was – 
the case on – there was no SAP forensics – Forensics was 
not involved in the investigation.   
20 
 
It was various SSA members involved.  And that is all I 
can say on this.  But what is there in terms of seeking legal 
counsel and former Minister Mahlobo, I cannot comment on 
that one.  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  Well, let us just highlight a 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 153 of 163 
 
few aspects of the project that perhaps raised concern.  The 
first is in paragraph 6.4.9.   
“The Project Tin Roof entailed approximately 40 
persons drawn from different directorate within the 
SSA as well externally in the following fields, 
Administration and Investigation, Vetting, Polygraph 
Testing, 
Surveillance, 
Counter 
Espionage, 
Toxicology and Physical Security.” 
 
Do you know of that? 
MS K:   Yes, that is what we were told by the individual 
10 
involved. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright. 
“It is alleged that investigations were conducted and 
some arrests were even affected but the main 
perpetrator is alleged to have fled the country.” 
 
Do you know – is that what you were told? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV 
PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
 
But 
you 
do 
note 
that 
the 
Investigation Team has not found any SSA documentary 
evidence supporting these assertions.  Is that also correct? 
20 
MS K:   Yes.  Yes, that is correct. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You do say in paragraph...  Oh, sorry 
you do not say it.  It is said in paragraph 6.5.0 by Mr Y: 
“Like the establishment of the Toxicology Unit, 
Project Tin Roof entailed an overreach of the SSA’s 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 154 of 163 
 
duly authorised mandate.” 
 
Do you have any comment to make on that statement? 
MS K:   Yes, I agree with that statement. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Right.  Let us move on to paragraph 
6.5.1 which reads: 
“Monthly withdrawals of approximately R 800 000,00 
were made under Project Tin Roof. 
Operational expenditure including the leasing and 
maintenance 
of 
safe 
houses, 
the 
provision 
of 
security service and leasing of high-end motor 
10 
vehicles for surveillance.” 
 
Is that what you discovered or were told? 
MS K:   Yes, that is what we were told by the person who 
was involved. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   It goes on to read at paragraph 
6.5.1: 
“Internally, Felicity and Lilly appeared to have used 
Project Tin Roof as a fund for renting further safe 
houses, 
hiring 
VIP 
protectors 
and 
conducting 
renovations 
and 
maintenance 
on 
the 
leased 
20 
properties. 
Preliminary investigations and simple profiling, it 
revealed that irregularities with the registration 
numbers 
provides 
on 
invoices 
including 
PSIRA 
registration 
numbers 
and the case of 
security 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 155 of 163 
 
companies suggesting that payments were made 
with fictitious entities.” 
 
Do you have any knowledge of that aspects of the 
investigations? 
MS K:   Yes, we did the analysis of all of those – the 
invoices.  So I can confirm that. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And then paragraph 6.25 and 
following deal with Project Academia, again evidence has 
been given in this regard.  Paragraph 6.52 reads: 
“In 2015 Murray, pseudonym, a former SAA member 
10 
was recruited by Minister Mhlobo to mitigate and 
resolve the fees must fall protests, which had 
erupted across universities in South Africa.  The 
immediate 
aim 
of 
Project 
Academia 
was 
to 
neutralise 
the 
fees 
must 
fall 
protest 
but 
the 
mandate 
extended 
to 
developing 
short 
term 
mitigation strategies and long-term solutions to 
prevent the recurrence of these protests.” 
Do you have any comment to make in that regard? 
MS K:   No I don’t have any comment. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Do you know of that? 
MS K:   This is ...[intervenes]  
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   I am sorry? 
MS K:   Pardon? 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   When you say you don’t have any 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 156 of 163 
 
comment do you confirm that that’s what the investigation 
learnt, or are you saying you don’t have any knowledge of 
it? 
MS K:   I don’t want to comment on this project because it 
is going to lead me to actually end up testifying more on t 
things that should be in my statement, so I can confirm to 
a certain extent these issues but I feel that it is not 
extensive, it is not sufficient to actually describe this 
project. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright, as I understand it while 
10 
you could confirm what is said here it is not useful because 
the full extent of the project could only be presented to the 
Commission 
on 
full 
evidence, 
do 
I 
understand 
you 
correctly? 
MS K:   Yes, which we have collated and collected, so that 
is a separate, ja, so I would rather no cover that project. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Let us leave it then to a 
later statement on – for a later stage, but as I understand 
it the basis for the issues you now raise is not that you 
don’t know anything about the project, but you know more 
20 
than what is here, is that correct? 
MS K:   Yes, yes sir. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.  Well I think then it is fair 
to ask you what of this – these two paragraphs you can 
confirm and I am not going to direct you to any particular 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 157 of 163 
 
paragraph, what facts can you confirm here, if you feel that 
you cannot confirm them without being misleading then you 
please tell me and we won’t go any further. 
MS K:   I request that I don’t get into the detail and 
comment and ja, I will give that full account in a separate 
statement. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you for that offer.   Let us 
go on then to paragraph 6.54, Operation EThekwini, are 
you able to comment on these two paragraphs under this 
heading?  
10 
MS K:   No I cannot comment on it, it is the same situation, 
it was contained in the same report that the investigators 
compiled, as I indicated under this corner or something, so 
it is the same situation where I don’t have the actual 
documentation and the team did not really get statements 
from these people, as much as they have met with them, so 
I don’t want to – I cannot confirm or deny but I can say this 
was contained in a investigate feedback report. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The information contained in 
paragraph 6.54 and 6.55 are you saying that that is 
20 
contained in a report but you haven’t seen – have you seen 
that report? 
MS K:   Yes, it was submitted to me. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But then I don’t understand why 
you can’t testify to it, you have testified throughout to 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 158 of 163 
 
reports that you have received, what is different about 
this? 
MS K:   What is different is that on this one we don’t have 
– I was not present in that interview.  We have not 
transcribed the interview as much as it was, although it 
was recorded because of capacity issues.  Thirdly we 
didn’t get sworn affidavits and fourthly I didn’t see any 
documentary evidence of what is alleged in this so that is 
why I would opt not to confirm or deny something that I 
don’t know, because a report from the investigators from 
10 
what some people say to them I cannot vouch for it, if it is 
not supported and corroborated by other – through other 
means.    
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Are you saying that all the 
evidence that you have placed before the Chair qualifies 
under all those conditions that you have just enumerated 
and this one does not? 
MS K:   Yes, yes, everything that I can speak on with 
authority those projects we actually went through the 
documentation and I can – that is why we can say – refer 
20 
to whatever annexure, so I would rather support things that 
I have seen in evidence and not just rumours, especially 
because I am trying ...[indistinct - distorted] the safety for 
the country when you want them to commit. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   So the reports referred to in 6.54 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 159 of 163 
 
and 6.55 are they in possession of members of the 
investigation team, the Veza Investigation Team? 
MS K:   Yes they are members of the investigation team. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   And those members of the 
investigation team or other members would they have 
interviewed the persons who gave the report, or the 
reports? 
MS K:   Please repeat that sir. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You have told us that there had 
been reports about the matters in 6.54 and 6.55, made to 
10 
members of the investigation team. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Correct? 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   You have seen those reports, am I 
correct, but you don’t have corroborating evidence? 
MS K:   Yes it is only one report and it contains the various 
projects that you were talking about. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   What I want to understand to assist 
our investigators in relation to this matter is whether you 
20 
know that interviews have been conducted in relation to 
these matters. 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   They have? 
MS K:   Yes.

ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Alright.   Let’s move on then to 
Project Wave.   
MS K:   Yes sir. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 6.56 reads: 
“As noted earlier Project Wave was established at 
the same time as Project Construcao and Project 
Mayibuye in January 2015 and was based on the 
same template written by Frank and approved by 
the same individuals.” 
We know that and we have dealt with that. 
10 
MS K:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    Paragraph 6.57 reads: 
“The stated aim of Project Wave was to penetrate 
an established operational ground with an identified 
continental, regional and global territories utilising 
deep 
cover 
members 
with 
an 
intended 
commencement date of 1 March 2015.  However 
Frank 
explained 
in 
his 
interview 
with 
our 
investigation team that this initial plan bore no 
resemblance to the activities later carried out under 
20 
Project Wave which related to the media.” 
Are you able to comment on that? 
MS K:   Yes, we conducted the interview and that is what 
he indicated so I can confirm that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...[Indistinct – microphone faulty] let’s 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 161 of 163 
 
talk 
about 
the 
way 
forward 
...[indistinct] 
sit 
longer 
...[indistinct]   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:    Chair we have three witnesses 
potentially to come for this week. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   But it appears that there is some 
more work to be done whether it is by way of affidavit or 
otherwise arising out of questions and answers today at 
least. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   The issues related to tomorrow’s 
evidence that we had planned a particular witness, 33’s 
were sent out and on the face of it were not received and 
that was an issue I raised this morning for clarification, I 
personally have not yet received that clarification but if 
that witness was to be called tomorrow it would require his 
affidavit or his evidence to be truncated, it is not really 
desirable. 
 
The 
other 
two 
witnesses 
would 
require 
applications to be placed before you for protected identity 
evidence, which we would submit would be dealt with in 
20 
accordance with the way they have been dealt with before 
but they haven’t yet been done.    
 
We are at page 45 of 77 pages, although it will go 
quicker tomorrow I would respectfully suggest that we 
adjourn 
and 
conclude 
the 
evidence 
of 
this 
witness 
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 162 of 163 
 
tomorrow, but if you wish we can continue and arrange for 
a witness to come tomorrow on the reduced basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well obviously we want to use as 
much time as possible and if it means going beyond four 
o’clock I am happy to do that, but there is no point in doing 
that if tomorrow is unlikely and would not end up being 
used fully because certain issues have to be sorted out 
[indistinct – mic off] so if it looks like there is no 
...[indistinct] sitting longer today ...[indistinct]   
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Yes Chair and I think we are at the 
10 
stage of the day, I think the stage of the week that I don’t 
want to bite the head off any of my colleagues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Subject to certain matters there may be 
a possibility from my side to sit for some hours on 
Saturdays if we need to use Saturdays and going forward I 
am of the view that there may be quite a few Saturdays 
that we might use because we need to use as much time as 
possible, but obviously sometimes ...[indistinct] for using a 
Saturday needs a bit more time, but I am mentioning that 
so that you can take that into account. 
20 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thank you Chair, that may assist 
us at – after a certain interval to wrap up on expeditious 
basis whatever evidence we have in this stream. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay we will then adjourn now 
because it looks like tomorrow the witness will continue.   
28 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 333 
 
Page 163 of 163 
 
...[Indistinct – mic off].   Okay we are going to adjourn for 
the day and we will start normal time tomorrow. 
ADV PRETORIUS SC:   Thanks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 29 JANUARY 2021
