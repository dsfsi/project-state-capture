08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 5 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you Chair.  Chair this morning we are 
dealing with the evidence related to mining.  That is the 
mining stream and the evidence specifically deals with 
Alexkor and irregularities that relate to Alexkor which is a 
state owned entity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you explain the evidence that will be 
led just take into account that members of the public. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Might not even know what Alexkor is.  
Explain what Alexkor is and what is involved in the 
10 
evidence that we will be looking at so that as the evidence 
is given they will follow. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you Chair.  Alexkor is a state owned 
entity that is – that deals in the mining of diamonds in 
South Africa.  It reports to the Department of Public 
Enterprises and the name derives from the area where the 
mining of diamonds was meant to be taking place and that 
is in Alexander Bay.  So Alexkor derives from that. 
 
The evidence that we will be dealing with came 
about when there was a whistle blower that came to the 
20 
commission and indicated with some allegations in relation 
to the capture of Alexkor and the nature of the – the 
capture that he indicated was that there was capture in two 
ways. 
 
There was the capture in the form of getting hold of 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 6 of 223 
 
the produce of the mines which is diamonds.  So getting 
access to that produce and the other capture that was 
indicated was in redirecting the purposes of – of Alexkor 
from its main mandate of mining diamonds into mining 
coals and – into mining coal and thereby positioning it for 
– for entities that are linked the Gupta family to be able to 
provide coal to Eskom. 
 
The Minister at the time had changed the – had 
changed the – had agreed with the board in changing the 
direction of Alexkor into coal mining as well but not to be 
10 
performed in Alexander Bay which is the place that Alexkor 
was created to serve mainly but the coal was going to be 
mined in Mpumalanga and all the other areas that are not 
in Alexander Bay and thereby redirecting all the focus of 
Alexkor and depriving the community that Alexkor was 
created partly to serve. 
 
 This was – this followed the – the announcement 
that there were going to be opportunities to serve Eskom 
by providing coal for them. 
 
Now what happened was that the – the idea or the 
20 
aim was to position Gupta companies to provide the coal 
and there has been evidence that relates to that.  So 
Alexkor was also being positioned for that. 
 
The evidence – that was what the whistle blower 
indicated but he also indicated other irregularities that 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 7 of 223 
 
were taking place at Alexkor. 
 
Having received that submission from the whistle 
blower then the commission’s investigators conducted their 
own investigations and the findings that were made or the 
conclusion that was drawn was that the allegations that 
had been made by the whistle blower could be supported 
by the evidence that was uncovered by the investigators. 
 
So our witnesses will be – this evidence addresses 
the terms of reference 1.1 and 1.5 of the commission and 
the – in Alexander Bay there was a land claim that was 
10 
made by the community of Ritchtersveldt.  They succeeded 
in their land claim.  The effect of their success was that 
they could now have access to the land that had been 
allocated to Alexkor for mining. 
 
So a consent or an order by consent was taken by 
the parties to that litigation which included the government 
of 
South 
African, 
Alexkor 
and 
the 
community 
of 
Ritchtersveldt in terms of which it was agreed that there 
would be a Joint Venture that would be created that would 
represent the interest of the community as well as the 
20 
interest of Alexkor. 
 
And that Joint Venture would – and part of the 
agreement was that the – the interest in the Joint Venture 
would be held in the following manner: 
 
Alexkor would have 51% interest and shareholding 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 8 of 223 
 
and the community would have 49%. 
 
So in effect a Joint Venture was then created and 
the purpose – the agreement was that the community got 
access to 49 – to the mining – the land mining rights and 
Alexkor which always had concessions to mine in that area 
it had had concessions to mine the land and also to mine 
the ocean.  So there was also Marine Mining and the result 
was that in terms of this agreement the community gets 
49% of the – of the share in the Joint Venture but they 
come with the land mining rights.  And Alexkor gets 51% 
10 
and it comes with the Marine mining rights. 
 
So this Joint Venture meant that they were going to 
pull their resources together so they would share in the – 
in the benefits which was good given that the land 
available for mining or the diamonds in the land had been 
depleted whereas the diamonds in the ocean had not been 
depleted. 
 
So it meant that while the community got this 
victory of being awarded the land that included a mining 
right which could also have become a – an anti-victory 
20 
because there was very little left to mine it meant that 
there was a benefit to the community by the formation of 
the Joint Venture and the fact that they were going to 
share together in the pooled resources. 
 
That is the nub of the evidence but what also came 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 9 of 223 
 
out and what had been explained by the whistle blower was 
that the Joint Venture although it had been established to 
ensure the interest of the community were guarded had in 
fact – had in fact appointed a contractor which was not 
incorrect.  They appointed a person or an entity that was 
going to be tasked with the marketing and sale of all the 
diamonds that were mined by the PSJV. 
 
So that meant that whether it is mined on the land 
or in the marine it would go to this entity and from this 
entity it would be marketed and sold and then the proceeds 
10 
would 
come 
to 
be 
shared 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
agreement. 
 
The allegations that came with the whistle blower 
indicated that the entity that was awarded the contract of 
ensuring – of marketing and selling the diamonds on behalf 
of the community; on behalf of Alexkor and on behalf of the 
Joint Venture the evidence was that that entity was a 
Gupta linked entity.  So – and their powers were extensive 
because the minors themselves – neither the miners nor 
the Joint Venture would in fact value the diamonds that 
20 
they were giving to this entity to market and sell. 
 
So they would take the raw material and give it to 
this entity and only this entity could then determine this is 
how much we value these diamonds that you have given to 
us and they had no way of double checking that.   
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 10 of 223 
 
 
And then in the sale – in the selling what also came 
out was that there were no proper records to show who the 
sales were being made to and how much.  So there was a 
lot of disgruntlement that had happened. 
 
There was an investigation that was commissioned 
by the Department of Public Enterprises and our first 
witness will be talking to that investigation. 
 
We have witnesses that will testify today that we 
have scheduled for testifying today.  It is two witnesses it 
is Mr Torres who is the author of the investigation reports 
10 
that was commissioned by the Department of Public 
Enterprises and we also have Mr Gavin Craythorne who is 
the whistle blower that approached commission. 
 
We also have other witnesses that we hope to be 
able to accommodate in the future that have – that will talk 
to the links in the evidence that was uncovered and – and 
tell – and put the story altogether. 
 
One is Jan Decker he is a forensic accountant and 
he conducted an investigation into the valuation process 
among other things and is able to talk to how much the – 
20 
the diamonds 
were in fact undervalued because his 
conclusion was that they were being undervalued by the 
entity.  And the other witness is Peter Bishop he conducted 
further investigations into the – into the allegations by the 
whistle blower and he drew conclusions from that and he 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 11 of 223 
 
was able to go further than what the whistle blower had 
done due to the powers given to the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you; thank you.  Are you 
ready for your first witness to take the oath? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay please administer the oath or 
affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR TORRES:  My name is Albert Torres. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
10 
prescribed oath? 
MR TORRES:  I do not have. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR TORRES:  Yes I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that that evidence you will 
give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but 
the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so 
help me God. 
MR TORRES:  So help me God. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you; you may be seated.  Yes you 
may proceed Ms Sibiya. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you Chair.  Good morning Mr Torres. 
MR TORRES:  Okay thank you. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Chair if the Chair can have in front of him 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 12 of 223 
 
the bundle that is marked Mining Bundle 01? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the bundle you are going to be 
using at the moment? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is Bundle – Mining Bundle 01.  
Right; yes. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you.  Mr Torres if I can take you – 
when I refer you to this bundle I will be talking about the 
numbering on the left hand side where it is writing – where 
it is typed in black and where it says Mining – if you turn 
10 
underneath the flap that is marked 1.1 you will see that on 
the first page that you open to on the left hand side of your 
page it says Mining 01001, can you see that? 
MR TORRES:  Yes I have got it. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay.  When I refer you to a page I will not 
say Mining 01 or 001 I will say page 1 and that is where I 
will be taking to – okay.  Thank you.  Please look at that 
page? 
MR TORRES:  Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Are those your full names written there and 
20 
your ID Number? 
MR TORRES:  Yes it is. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Is that your initial at the bottom? 
MR TORRES:  Pardon. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Your initial. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 13 of 223 
 
MR TORRES:  Signature – that is my signature. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Your initials or your full signature? 
MR TORRES:  The initials on page 1. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
MR TORRES:  And then I got my full signature on page 2. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay.  Do you confirm that this is a 
document that you prepared? 
MR TORRES:  Yes I do confirm. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And that you – you deposed to it in front of a 
Commissioner of Oaths? 
10 
MR TORRES:  Yes I do. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And do you confirm the contents that it is 
true to the best of your knowledge? 
MR TORRES:  Yes I do confirm the contents. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Have you had a chance to go through it just 
recently in preparation for today? 
MR TORRES:  No I have a chance yes. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you.  Chair with your leave may I ask 
that 
this 
document 
that 
is 
marked 
– 
that 
is 
titled 
Confirmatory Affidavit appearing on pages 1 and 2 that it 
20 
be admitted as an exhibit – Exhibit XX1.1? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Has it got any annexures or not? 
ADV SIBIYA:  It does – it does Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 14 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see there is another affidavit by Ms 
Dineo Petunia Tomo. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that an annexure to Mr Torres’ affidavit 
or is it a separate affidavit? 
ADV SIBIYA:  It is a separate – it is a separate affidavit 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So where are the annexures to Mr Torres’ 
affidavit? 
ADV SIBIYA:  In fact Chair Mr Torres maybe I should take 
10 
him first through the sections that I wanted to take him 
because it is a very short affidavit and it indicates what it 
is – what its purpose is.  So it titled Confirmatory Affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before I – I admit it I want to know 
whether when I admit it I admit it… 
ADV SIBIYA:  With the annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Together with its annexures or it is not. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is why I am asking whether it has 
got annexures. 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:  It has got annexures Chair.  He refers to 
them in [?]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are they referred to in the affidavit? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  Yes they are referred to Chair in his 
affidavit and they appear from page 5 and they go all the 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 15 of 223 
 
way to page 1079. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the – I think the problem is that the 
affidavit does not say for example in paragraph 4. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What annexure the report is.  It just 
refers to the report.  Is it not – is that right? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like the report is the only 
annexure is that correct? 
MR TORRES:  No Chair.  The report itself has annexures 
10 
to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no I am not talking about 
annexures to the report I am talking about annexures to 
the affidavit – to Mr Torres’ affidavit. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like the report is the only 
annexure to Mr Torres’ affidavit am I right? 
ADV SIBIYA:  And then include exhibits yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay then I think – I think Ms Tomo’s 
affidavit should not have been placed where it is placed 
because if it is not an annexure to Mr Torres’ affidavit and I 
understand why it should not it should not come between 
Mr Torres’ affidavit and annexures to Mr Torres’ affidavit.  
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 16 of 223 
 
That is not the right place. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Chair I concede that however it was 
necessary to do it in this way because her affidavit also 
confirms the same reports. They were working together and 
whereas he confirms that he was the lead she confirms that 
she was the junior that worked together. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but could that achieve the same 
purpose even if it came after the report? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it not? 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes, yes I accept that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it now comes between the 
affidavit of Mr Torres and the annexures and documents or 
the report which is an annexure to that affidavit and yet it 
is not an annexure to his affidavit. 
ADV SIBIYA:  It delves in annexure yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it may be that it should be – maybe 
you must think about where – are you going to be referring 
to it to his evidence? 
ADV SIBIYA:  No Chair.  We will not be referring to it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja maybe what we – what you – what you 
will need to do during the break maybe is to take it out 
from there and put it… 
ADV SIBIYA:  Somewhere else. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the report.  And then attend – then the 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 17 of 223 
 
numbering will obviously will change.  The best thing might 
be to not to interfere with the numbering if possible and 
have – have it numbered right at the end or after the 
report. 
ADV SIBIYA:  We will attend to that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  The affidavit of Mr Albert 
Torres which starts at page 1 together with its annexure 
namely the final report referred to in paragraph 4 of his 
affidavit is admitted and will be marked as Exhibit  
ADV SIBIYA:  XX1.1 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  XX1.1.  So Exhibit XX1 is Mr Torres’ 
affidavit together with the report which is an annexure to 
the affidavit. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Torres if we can go 
back to page 1 which is… 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
I 
think 
you 
need 
to 
move 
your 
microphone a little towards the centre because I do not 
think… 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:  It does not move so I need to move. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No it should be possible to move it.  Let 
– let somebody help you who – you see if you are speaking 
too far away from it you cannot be heard easily.  Okay 
alright. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 18 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us start then. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Mr Torres I refer you back on page 1 of your 
affidavit.  Do you confirm that at the time you deposed to 
this affidavit you were an executive director at Gobodo 
Forensics? 
MR TORRES:  Yes I do. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Please speak closer to the microphone. 
MR TORRES:  Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:  I think there will be a similar problem.  And 
10 
when you answer Mr Torres please look at the Chairperson. 
MR TORRES:  Yes okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:  So your neck will be sore but you will have 
to look at me when I ask questions but look at the Chair 
when you answer.  Thank you.  Are you still an executive 
director at Gobodo Forensics? 
MR TORRES:  Gobodo I am a director of Gobodo however I 
retired now but I am still a director at Gobodo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does that – does that mean you are not 
executive – an executive director anymore. 
20 
MR TORRES:  No I am non-executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you remain a director. 
MR TORRES:  I remain director. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you.  And do you confirm that Gobodo 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 19 of 223 
 
Forensic Audit was instructed by the Department of Public 
Enterprises to conduct an investigation? 
MR TORRES:  Yes I do confirm the Department of Public 
Enterprises appointed us to investigate this particular 
matter. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And can you explain to us the process that 
led to your appointment? 
MR TORRES:   Well we are on the panel with the 
Department of Public Enterprises.  So being on the panel 
suggests that we have already been appointed based on 
10 
our technical abilities.  So we were requested to submit a 
quotation for the investigation into the irregularities at 
Alexkor, PSJV entity. And on that basis we submitted a 
quotation and we were appointed. 
ADV SIBIYA:  What were the – what was the mandate that 
you were given? 
MR TORRES:  Well the mandate in summary there was – 
they wanted us to investigate the relationship – the soured 
relationship that existed between the contractors on the 
one hand and the board and executive on the one hand. 
20 
 
But 
there 
were 
also 
concerns 
raised 
by 
the 
contractors and these concerns – some of the concerns 
were also identified as issued that had to be investigated.  
So they were. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay.  And you conducted this investigation.  
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 20 of 223 
 
How long were you given to conduct it? 
MR TORRES:  We were appointed in or about July 2019.  
We then had a three month window period to complete.  So 
we submitted our report to the Department Of Public 
Enterprises on the 14 October 2019.  So it took us about 
three months. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And how many of you were involved? 
MR TORRES:  Only two of us. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
MR TORRES:  It was myself and Dineo Tomo. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  And you produced a report? 
MR TORRES:  Pardon. 
ADV SIBIYA:  You produced the report and conclusion. 
MR TORRES:  Yes I produced the report and I signed it. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay and this report you produced is the 
one that appears from page 5? 
MR TORRES:  That is correct that is the report. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And you were the author of the report? 
MR TORRES:  I was the author. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay.  Thank you very much.  Now if we can 
20 
go to the report and we can go – if you can turn to page 43 
of the report?   
MR TORRES:  Yes I am there. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Is this…. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 43? 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 21 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He may have given – Mr Torres may have 
given the gist of their mandate but I am sure that in the 
report that is one of things they start with. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say this is our mandate.  Maybe it 
would be good for you to direct him to that but actually he 
probably knows it so that he can just read that into the 
record. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes thank you very much. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you move on. 
ADV SIBIYA:  That is where I was going Chair because it 
is in the paragraphs that appear on that page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I thought it would be much earlier. 
ADV SIBIYA:  No before this… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Is the executive summary Chair.  So this is 
the actual start of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you wanted to look – you wanted to 
go to the executive summary or this – oh this is the 
20 
executive summary? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes thank you – thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 22 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can go ahead then. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you.  Mr Torres if you can look at 
paragraph 2.5? 
MR TORRES:  Yes I am there. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Please read that – is that – is it correct that 
that encapsulates what your mandate was, starting from 2.5. 
MR TORRES:   Okay can I read it? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
MR TORRES:   Yes, that was the mandate. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  So your mandate – if you can start 
reading, the department of ...[intervenes]  
MR TORRES:   Okay. 
“The Department of Public Enterprises speaks to 
appoint a suitable qualified and experienced service 
provider to investigate the legality of actions taken 
by the PSJV in the exclusion of the marine mining 
contractors 
and 
make 
recommendations 
arising 
there from.” 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, and if you go on to paragraph 2.6. 
20 
MR TORRES:   2.6. 
“The DPE, which is the Department of Public 
Enterprises, wishes to establish the cause of the 
soured relationship between Alexkor RMC PSJV and 
the marine contractors and make recommendations 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 23 of 223 
 
on improvements that can be made.” 
ADV SIBIYA:   And paragraph 2.7. 
MR TORRES:   2.7. 
“The 
DPE 
further 
requires 
an 
investigation 
to 
establish whether the board and the executive of the 
Alexkor RMC PSJV exercised objective, fair and 
transparent processes in the management of the 
operations.” 
ADV SIBIYA:   Is that everything that you were instructed to 
do? 
10 
MR TORRES:   Yes, but under our Purpose and Objectives, 
we actually break it down further. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, we will get to that. 
MR TORRES:   Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you. 
MR TORRES:   But in summary, that is what we were 
appointed to do. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  Thank you.  Now you are talking about 
the PSJV.  What is the PSJV? 
MR TORRES:   Well, the PSJV – I think you eluded to the 
20 
fact that there was a Deed of Settlement.  That in 2007 a 
Deed of Settlement between Alexkor on the one hand and 
government and the community of Richtersveldt was made 
an order of the court, right?   
 
Now in terms of the Deed of Settlement, the – an interim 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 24 of 223 
 
board had to be appointed and the board then had to 
establish a Pooling and Sharing Joint Venture, which should 
be made up of the Richter veldt community on the one hand 
and Alexkor now.   
 
So they referred to it as the Pooling and Sharing Joint 
Venture.  So the abbreviation PSJV refers to the Pooling and 
Sharing.   
ADV SIBIYA:   So the Department of Public Enterprises gave 
you a mandate to investigate issues related to the PSJV? 
MR TORRES:   Yes, the Department of Public Enterprises is 
10 
the shareholder representative of Alexkor. 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m. 
MR TORRES:   And Alexkor was part of the Pooling and 
Sharing Joint Venture. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
MR TORRES:   They actually had a majority shareholding. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
MR TORRES:   And based on that, the Department of Public 
Enterprises appointed us. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  Thank you. 
20 
MR TORRES:   Sorry, Mr Chair.  I must still get used to 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you will get used to it. 
MR TORRES:   Get used to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You will get used to it.   
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 25 of 223 
 
MR TORRES:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR TORRES:   Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Sorry.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  So 
they did not only limit your investigation to Alexkor issues? 
MR TORRES:   Because our investigation was into the 
Pooling and Sharing Joint Venture. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
MR TORRES:   Because everything that happened that we 
were investigation, we investigated for that period when the 
10 
PSJV was already in existence. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  Okay. 
MR TORRES:   I am sorry Mr Chair. 
ADV SIBIYA:   If you can turn to page 45? 
MR TORRES:   45... 
ADV SIBIYA:   That is where you set out the Purpose and 
Objectives of the investigation and the report. 
MR TORRES:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  So can you tell us what those were? 
MR TORRES:   Okay.  3.1, the purpose – this is just 
20 
background information. 
“The 
purpose 
of 
the 
report 
is 
to 
inform 
the 
Department of Public Enterprises regarding the 
background to the investigation, our approach to the 
investigation 
and 
procedures 
performed, 
any 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 26 of 223 
 
assumptions made and estimates supplied, our 
factual findings in respect of the investigation and 
our conclusion and recommendations based upon 
our factual findings.” 
 
Paragraph 3.2: 
“The primary objectives of the investigation are: 
- 
To 
establish 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
soured 
relationship between Alexkor RMC PSJV and the 
marine contractors and make recommendations on 
improvements that can be made. 
10 
- 
To 
establish 
whether the board and the 
executive of the Alexkor RMC PSJV exercised 
objective, fair and transparent processes in the 
management of Alexkor RMC PSJV.” 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now, you go to paragraph 3.3 and your title 
there is The Focus Areas of the Preliminary Investigation 
were as follows.  What informed the choice of these areas as 
the focussed areas? 
MR TORRES:   Well, this was actually highlighted by the 
Department of Public Enterprises but – and they are based 
20 
on the concerns and issues raised by the marine directors to 
the department, okay?  So it was an attempt by the 
department to address their concerns as well. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And so those – these are the focussed areas.  
Can you tell what they are? 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 27 of 223 
 
MR TORRES:   The first bullet point: 
“- 
To investigate the validity of the decision 
taken by the Alexkor RMC PSJV. 
- 
To exclude the three Marine contractors in 
2018 Mining Services Procurement Cycle. 
- 
To investigate the procurement process in the 
appointment 
of 
contractors 
in 
particular 
the 
appointment of a diamond marketing and sales 
company. 
- 
To investigate the process followed in the 
10 
evaluation of diamonds from the mine site to the 
diamond marketing and sales company officers. 
- 
To obtain and review the prices of diamonds 
realised since the appointment of the diamond 
marketing and sales company. 
- 
Investigate the alleged failure to comply with 
the contractual arrangement given access to the 
information relating to sales and marketing of the 
diamonds to the contractors. 
- 
To investigate the legality of the Coffer-dam 
20 
Operations which allegedly has caused adverse and 
damage. 
- 
To review all contracts entered into between 
the PSJV and the marine mining contractors, as well 
as any other contract forming related to the subject 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 28 of 223 
 
matter of the dispute between the parties. 
- 
To determine the contract awarding processes 
and systems are fair, transparent, equitable with the 
focus on mining contracting for both land and marine 
mining contracting, including the appointment of the 
diamond marketing and sales company. 
 
Oh, I think that is just a repeat of that. 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m. 
MR TORRES:   Yes. 
“- 
To determine the legality of the Coffer-dam 
10 
Operations which currently undertaking as Alexkor 
RMC PSJV and make recommendations on the 
outcome of the investigation.” 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you.  Now where do these focussed 
areas emanate from because these are very detailed? 
MR TORRES:   Again, the Department of Public Enterprises.  
They gave us our scope and then detailed it for us.  Because 
what we normally do when we do an investigation as well.  
We have – once we get appointed, we then have a briefing 
session with our principle because we do not want any other 
20 
– we do not want misunderstandings.  So make it clear.  
Every briefing session, they will then detail what we need to 
do and this was also where we got. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay thank you.  And if we move to page 49.  
There is that – the – are you there? 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 29 of 223 
 
MR TORRES:   I get confuse with the numbering but I have 
got it.  Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  There you set out the approach and 
procedures performed. 
MR TORRES:   Yes. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Can you tell us shortly without reading word-
for-word what was your approach ...[intervenes]  
MR TORRES:   Well, essentially what we do is, we – like we 
have a briefing session, then we would meet with the client.  
After 
that, 
what 
we 
do 
is, 
we 
then 
agree 
on 
an 
10 
implementation plan and that is where the three months 
came in.  This is what we are going to do and our deadlines 
for the report and all that.   
 
After that, it is – what we do is, is collation of 
documents.  We collect all the documents and once we have 
collected all the documents...  So, what we have here is just 
showing you our procedures, to collect the documents and 
what documents we have collected.   
 
We 
then 
review 
the 
documents 
and 
then 
do, 
if 
necessary, our interviews and all that.  So that is basically 
20 
the procedures. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now in this case, where did the briefing take 
place? 
MR TORRES:   The initial briefing took place at the 
Department of Public Enterprises, their offices.  We met the 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 30 of 223 
 
officials there. 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m.  And where did you get the document? 
MR TORRES:   The documents, initially the Department of 
Public Enterprises was going to give us the documents but 
Alexkor, the PSJV is situated in Alexander Bay which is very 
far.  It was then, subsequently, agreed – because we are not 
getting the documents.   
 
We then liaised directly with the company secretary, 
called Reagan Phillips.  And she electronically emailed us 
documents which we then used here.  And when we did visit 
10 
the Alexkor Plant, we were also given documents.   
ADV SIBIYA:   So the person that gave you the documents, 
is the company secretary of the PSJV? 
MR TORRES:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   To enable you to conduct your investigation? 
MR TORRES:   Pardon? 
ADV SIBIYA:   To enable you to conduct your investigation? 
MR TORRES:   Yes, yes.  Correct.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  Thank you.  If we move ahead to page 
60. 
20 
MR TORRES:   Page 60? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yebo. 
MR TORRES:   I am on page 60. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  So you say here, Background 
Information on Individuals and Entities.  You are talking 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 31 of 223 
 
about the entities that you were to investigate? 
MR TORRES:   Ja.  Essentially, the – it was for the joint 
venture. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
MR TORRES:   Just background information on that.  And 
that Scarlet Sky Investment 60 (Pty) Ltd.  This is the 
marketing company.  This is the company that was appointed 
to sell and market rough diamonds. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay. 
MR TORRES:   So we just gave a background.  And also in 
10 
the background, it is included who the individuals are, their 
links and so on. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Please tell us who the individuals are and 
what their links are as contained in your report without 
reading necessarily from the report. 
MR TORRES:   Okay.  The – Daniel Mark Nathan was the 
Director of Scarlet Sky Investments but he was also the 
CEO.  Hazel Ammann, Moira Ammann was what you would 
call a Stand-in Director because Scarlet Sky was a shelf 
company and she was a second Stand-in Director.  Christian 
20 
Gouws was also a Stand-in Director.  A lot of shelf 
companies would see his name.  So he is also a Stand-in 
Director.  The ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   A stand-in director being simple a director 
who is a director while a company is a shelf company, ready 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 32 of 223 
 
to resign once they have sold the company to somebody? 
MR TORRES:   Yes, that is correct.  Because if you have an 
incorporated company, you must have a director. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
MR TORRES:   So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But basically, at that time the company is 
not doing anything? 
MR TORRES:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Alright. 
MR TORRES:   You are right Mr Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TORRES:   And then you had Govender who became a 
director in 2015.  And then you had Kubentheran Moodley 
who was appointed at the same time that Daniel Nathan was 
appointed a director.  And he subsequently resigned on the 
5t h of November 2015.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes? 
MR TORRES:   Okay.  So those are the four directors. 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m.  And you can continue with what you 
were describing there.  Because you were describing the 
20 
...[intervenes]  
MR TORRES:   If I can just read 8.2.4. 
“There have been allegations that Kubentheran 
Moodley was closed to Salim Essa of Trillion.” 
 
Okay? 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 33 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m. 
MR TORRES:   So.  And then, we did a Google search and 
then found that there was a formal search seizure in storage 
facility by the State Capture Commission.   
“In the same court, Moodley had requested the court 
to interdict the Zondo Commission and deny them 
access to his documentation and other important 
personal items, including jewellery and cash that 
were in the care of Wayne Ryan Becker, at a storage 
facility, Knox Titanium Vaults which is in Sandton. 
10 
It appears that Moodley’s name has been mentioned 
many times at the Zondo Commission. 
The 
allegations 
that 
Moodley 
assisted 
Trillion 
Capital to lure Eskom and help the Gupta’s with ten 
million to buy Optimum Mine and had a hand in the 
Mediosa Contract in the North West.” 
ADV SIBIYA:   So this was the case at the time at the time 
you were preparing the report? 
MR TORRES:   This was the case.  What we normally do as 
well, is just to give background information. 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m. 
MR TORRES:   And the individuals that we are dealing with 
so we have a better perspective of what is happening. 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m.  What else are you saying here in 
relation to Moodley? 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 34 of 223 
 
MR TORRES:   Well, in paragraph 8.2.6: 
“The available information suggests that Moodley 
was 
the 
former 
advisor 
of 
the 
then 
Mineral 
Resources Minister, Mosebenzi Zwane. 
Zwane was appointed to former President Jacob’s 
Cabinet in or about September 2015. 
We know that Moodley resigned from SSI, which is 
Scarlet Sky Investments, on 5 November 2015. 
This is soon after Zwane was appointed to the 
Cabinet.” 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now just for my own sake of understanding.  
Did Moodley become an advisor of Minister Zwane after he 
left – he resigned or before he joined? 
MR TORRES:   It was before he resigned because he 
resigned in November. 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m? 
MR TORRES:   And he was appointed in September, if I am 
correct, ja.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Oh.  Because you are mentioning the 
appointment of the minister ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR TORRES:   Of the minister. 
ADV SIBIYA:   ...as having been in September.  So I am just 
trying to get clarity whether you are saying Moodley 
started...  Oh, or rather, he became an advisor after he 
resigned, after Moodley resigned from SSI, or was he an 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 35 of 223 
 
advisor prior to Minister Zwane becoming a minister?   
 
Because 
your 
sentence 
says 
that 
the 
information 
suggests that Moodley was the former advisor of then 
minister.  So I am not sure whether if a former advisor is 
what you wanted to say or when you say he was a former 
advisor, you meant he was an advisor prior to the minister 
being appointed. 
MR TORRES:   Okay ja, I am with you.  No, when Zwane was 
appointed, okay, Moodley was still a director of SSI.  As 
soon as Zwane was appointed – Zwane was appointed in 
10 
September 2015.  So why I am saying former, it is a former 
now.  Currently speaking, it is former.  So he was – he 
resigned in November.  Now I cannot remember whether he 
became an advisor in September or after he had resigned, 
unfortunately. 
ADV SIBIYA:   No, no, no.  That is fine.  I just needed to 
understand whether he was former then or if he is former 
now. 
MR TORRES:   He is former now. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Alright.  Thank you very much.  You 
20 
mentioned another character in paragraph 8.2.7. 
MR TORRES:   We found that Zarina Kellerman, a lawyer, 
was also one of three individuals appointed to advise Zwane.   
“The three advisors included, in addition to Moodley 
and Kellerman, Malcolm Mabaso. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 36 of 223 
 
Information 
in 
our 
possession 
suggested 
that 
Kellerman purportedly conducted a due diligence on 
SSI after they were appointed by the PSJV.” 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  You can leave it there for now.  I will 
continue with that train of thought when we get to the 
relevant part. 
MR TORRES:   Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And on 8.2.8, you explain the structure. 
MR TORRES:   Ja, the structure was..  Essentially, Daniel 
Nathan trading on 40% of the business.  It was represented 
10 
by Daniel Nathan.  60% was owned by Kimode, represented 
by Moodley.  So this gave the – in terms of the Black 
Empowerment Structure, there was a majority shareholding, 
black shareholding. 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m.  Okay.  You can now turn to page 64. 
MR TORRES:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SIBIYA:   This is where you are dealing with the Review 
of Agreement.  And you start by the Deed of Settlement 
between the Richtersveldt Mining company and Alexkor and 
the Government of the Republic of South Africa. 
20 
MR TORRES:   Yes.  The Deed of Settlement was...  Okay.  
There was an agreement between Alexkor on the one hand 
and government on the other.  And also the agreement of the 
– 
and 
also 
the 
Richtersveldt 
Mining 
company. 
 
The 
Richtersveldt Mining company was a company that was 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 37 of 223 
 
owned by the local community.   
 
Now in 2007, the court declared the Deed of Settlement 
a court order.  The Deed of Settlement deals with a number 
of issues.  It deals with the issue of the mining rights and the 
environmental issues.   
 
It deals with the way in which the company will be 
governed.  It also – there is a paragraph that stipulates that 
an Interim Joint Board must be appointed.  The Interim Joint 
Board will then form a Pooling and Sharing Joint Venture. 
 
But also very important, because the next agreement 
10 
called 
the 
Unanimous 
Resolution. 
 
The 
Unanimous 
Resolution is, in a sense, a governance framework. Because 
it speaks to your sub-committees, what sub-committees there 
should be. 
 
It also eludes to procurement issues in a sense.  So that 
was important just to establish the PSJV and give it a 
governance framework.  So the Deed of Settlement and the 
Unanimous Resolution should be seen, you know, together. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And what did the Unanimous Resolution say? 
MR TORRES:   Now, the first thing they had to do in terms of 
20 
the Unanimous Resolution is to form the Pooling and Sharing 
Joint Venture, the establishment of that.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  And how do we know what were the 
terms? 
MR TORRES:   The terms in the share...  Okay just hold on.  
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 38 of 223 
 
When you say it is the terms of the Unanimous Resolution? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
MR TORRES:   Ja, the Deed of Settlement refers to the 
Unanimous Resolution should be formulated.  So those are 
the terms.  The terms come directly from the Deed of 
Settlement. 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m.  And also, the Deed of Settlement also 
says how the formation of the PSJV is going to happen and 
also to give effect to the agreement in terms of the 
ownership and the shareholding? 
10 
MR TORRES:   Yes.  I think if you look at paragraph 9.1.9. 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m? 
MR TORRES:   It says here: 
“Clause 8.4.5 stipulates that the members of the IJV, 
which is the Interim Joint Board, must before the 
Unanimous Resolution can take you back refer the 
Unanimous 
Resolution 
to 
the 
principles 
for 
unconditional.” 
 
So they then did the Unanimous Resolution but got 
agreement from the principles, that is the government and 
20 
Alexkor. 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m.  Yes.  So this involved the Government 
of South Africa? 
MR TORRES:   Yes. 
ADV SIBIYA:   From the time that the joint venture was 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 39 of 223 
 
contemplated, 
the 
government 
was 
a 
party 
to 
that 
arrangement? 
MR TORRES:   Yes, because they are in effect the 
shareholder of Alexkor.  And also, because they have a 51% 
shareholding in the joint venture, they are also a shareholder 
in the joint venture, Pooling and Sharing Joint Venture. 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m.  Okay.  You move on and you start 
dealing with the agreement that was concluded by the JV 
and SSI. 
MR TORRES:   [No audible reply]  
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   On the next page 66. 
MR TORRES:   66? 
ADV SIBIYA:   That is where you then move on to speak to 
that.   
MR TORRES:   H’m. 
“An agreement was signed and completed between 
the PSJV and SSI. 
SSI was appointed specifically to market, value, sell 
and for the beneficiation of diamonds.” 
 
Now the agreement was signed by Daniel Nathan, 
20 
representing the SSI, Scarlet Sky.  And then Carstens, 
Norman Carstens, who was the CEO at the time Mr Chair, he 
represented the PSJV and signed the agreement. 
 
The agreement actually stipulates what should be done.  
For example, it stipulates the type of pricing model that they 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 40 of 223 
 
should have.  And auction sales to be conducted in order to 
sell.   
 
They also stipulated the way in which the diamonds 
should be sold.  They gave a breakdown.  For example, 10% 
had to be sold to the state diamond trader for beneficiation 
purposes. 
 
Another 5% had to be sold to the local company also for 
beneficiation purposes.  And then 85% had to be sold to an 
auction sale.  Those was – these are key-elements in the 
agreement. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay. 
MR TORRES:   And then he also speaks to the commission 
that has to be paid a handling fee to – which was 1.5% at 
that stage.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  And this contract was signed in...?  It 
is in paragraph 9.3.3. 
MR TORRES:   It was signed on 4 March 2015. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  And then you move on.  On the next 
page, you talk about a second agreement. 
MR TORRES:   Yes, there was a second agreement.  The 
20 
first appointment was a three-year appointment.  So they 
were appointed at the beginning of 2015, SSI.  But some 
time in 2016 a new procurement process was started for the 
selling and marketing of the diamonds. 
 
Nobody can explain why because the term had not 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 41 of 223 
 
expired yet but they were appointed.  So this agreement 
relates to that.  It is essentially the same but there are a few 
differences. 
 
For example, the first agreement was a three-year 
duration period.  The second agreement, the duration period 
was extended to five years which was quite a long time, you 
know. 
 
And also there were key-issues.  For example, the 5%, it 
had to be sold to the local - the batch sold locally.  It was 
excluded from this agreement.   
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay. 
MR TORRES:   So essentially... 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  We will go in more detail later on in 
your evidence at what your findings were because at this 
stage you are talking about what document ...[intervenes]  
MR TORRES:   Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   ...contracts you did.  So you do not have to 
go into a whole lot of detail at this stage. 
MR TORRES:   Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   But later on, you tell us what you discovered 
20 
and...  Yes.  If you made any adverse findings and what 
those were and what informed that. 
MR TORRES:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  The next agreement you looked at, you 
refer to on page 69.  So you can tell us briefly. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 42 of 223 
 
MR TORRES:   Okay.  This here, paragraph 9: 
“This agreement will appoint the Shallow Water and 
Beach Marine contractors.” 
 
Now, it specifically relates to – there are two documents.  
It is the Shallow – there were two agreements.  The one was 
– it is called – in fact, it is one agreement but there are 
different types of marine mining.  You have your beach 
mining activity and then you have your shallow water activity.  
So it deals with those miners here.   
 
So it is just for standard clauses where, you know, what 
10 
as – what are the obligations of the contractors on the one 
hand, the obligations of the principle on the other hand, but 
also in which payment will be done, the proceeds of the 
mining activity. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  Now you move on, on page 10 to 
speak to – about the PSJV Coffer-dam Operations.  What is 
the Coffer-dam ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say page 10? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Oh, my apologies.  It is on page 71 and it 
item ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TORRES:   Chair was also... 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MR TORRES:   [laughs] 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  My apologies.  Thank you Chair. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 43 of 223 
 
MR TORRES:   Coffer-dam Operations.  The Coffer-dam 
Operations – I am not a technical person Chair.  So I just 
want – but I had to find out what this was. 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m. 
MR TORRES:   The Coffer-dam Operations, essentially, take 
place where beach mining activity takes place.  It is on the 
shore.  So what they do is.  They build the coffer-dam wall 
and within the coffer-dam wall, they would have a machine 
digging the gravel from this.  So the coffer-dam would avoid 
the transport the water.   
10 
 
Now Coffer-dam Operations are – can be damaging to 
the environment.  It depends on what you are using.  So the 
Environmental Management Plan that the PSJV had only 
included the coffer-dam building with sand.  So.   
 
But they started using boulders and rocks to build the 
coffer-dam.  And once you start, that is a listed activity in 
terms 
of 
the 
Environmental 
Act. 
 
It 
damages 
the 
environment.  It damages the eco-system.  And this was an 
issue, a contentious issue.   
 
So it was one of the issues raised by the contractors, 
20 
and we look at it.  And we found that yes they had used 
boulders and rocks to build the coffer-dam.  According to 
them, they stopped using sand because the tidal waves in 
South Africa are very strong and they had to rebuild the 
dams.  Be that as it may, you need special permission to 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 44 of 223 
 
use boulders and rocks.  Now there were – they did 
…[intervenes] 
ADV SIBIYA:   Sorry.  Sorry, I just need to stop you 
because you keep saying they. 
MR TORRES:   Oh, sorry. 
ADV SIBIYA:   So you can continue. 
MR TORRES:   The previous JV, continued to use boulders 
and rocks.  They were reported to the authorities and by 
their own admission they admitted that they had used a 
listed activity because they submitted an application called 
10 
a 24G application.  24G in terms of inviting NEMA, the 
Environmental 
Act. 
 
Now 
once 
you 
submit 
a 
24G 
application it is an admission that you have done wrong 
and 
you 
want 
this 
wrong 
rectified, 
okay? 
 
So 
the 
complaints by the contractors were valid.   
ADV SIBIYA:   And what were your findings in that regard 
because is one of the issues that you did identify your 
focus areas? 
MR TORRES:   Okay.  Well, initially they denied that they 
had used boulders and rocks but I mean by their own 
20 
admission what we found was that they had then applied to 
the department for permission.  There was a public hearing 
because you need to have a public hearing, the public has 
to make its input.  We could find no adverse comments at 
the public hearing about this.  However, they then – there 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 45 of 223 
 
was only one – what we found that they then received the – 
they had to submit a new environmental management plan 
which would then include the use of boulders.  They had 
submitted that.  The department did not approve it as yet 
by the time that we were doing the investigation because 
they were still waiting for a financial plan from the PSJV.   
 
Now the financial plan is quite key because when 
you do the rehabilitation you need a financial plan but what 
we found was that the – we could find no evidence that 
they had used boulders and rocks and we had an interview 
10 
with the executive management and they were saying no, 
we have rehabilitated the land and that is why you will not 
see it there. 
 
Now you cannot just rehabilitate an environment in 
a vacuum, there is a process that happens.  You have to 
inform the department, the environmental department, they 
send out an inspector to have a look at the environment 
and then at the end of the rehabilitation process you get 
given a certificate to show the area has been rehabilitated.   
They could not produce any of that, you see?  That 
20 
in itself was illegal as well, them just going and do it, you 
know?  So besides the using wrong and listed activity, they 
also did that, Chair. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And what was the impact of what they were 
doing? 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 46 of 223 
 
MR TORRES:   Well, the impact is quite serious because 
once you build a cofferdam using material that you should 
not use, you then – you know, the sea has its own self-
cleansing way so the transport, the sediments, the sea, the 
waves and all that, transport the sediments.  So all that 
was stopped and then you find that it also damages the 
ecosystem there, that exists.  So it is quite damaging. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And, as you say, it still has not been 
rehabilitated. 
MR TORRES:   No, no. 
10 
ADV 
SIBIYA: 
 
 At 
the 
time 
[inaudible 
– 
speaking 
simultaneously] 
MR TORRES:   At the time when I was there. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  Now we move on page 83 to the 
detail of the appointment of SSI.  Page 83. 
MR TORRES:   Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  So you conducted this investigation 
into the appointment of SSI who were going to market and 
sell all the diamonds that were mined in the area by the 
PSJV. 
20 
MR TORRES:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
MR TORRES:   So you want me to – okay, this, the first 
appointment of SSI, what we did was, we then reviewed the 
procurement process.  It was very important, the manner in 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 47 of 223 
 
which they were appointed.  Now we found that the 
procurement, the procurement process for the appointment 
or the service provider to sell and market the rough 
diamonds, was ostensibly manipulated to favour Scarlet 
Sky and I will explain this, Chair.   
 
SSI was essentially a shelf company when they first 
submitted their expression of interest.  The director at that 
time was Hazel Ammann, who was a standing director and 
the two directors, Daniel Nathan and Kubentheran Moodley  
were only appointed weeks later.  So at the time when they 
10 
submitted 
their 
expression 
of 
interest 
the 
supporting 
documents 
misrepresented 
Nathan 
and 
Moodley 
as 
directors.  This was the first issue that we had. 
 
The second issue that we have, Chair, a minimum 
requirement for the bidder was you needed to have a 
licence 
to 
sell 
rough 
diamonds. 
 
It 
is 
a 
statutory 
requirement in terms of the Diamond Act. 
 
Now Scarlet Sky Investments did not have a licence 
so 
they 
should 
have 
been 
disqualified 
right 
at 
the 
beginning and then we – the bid evaluation and short 
20 
listing 
was 
outsourced 
to 
a 
company 
called 
Gamiro 
Advisory Services.   
 
Now 
Gamiro Advisory 
Services 
is 
an 
external 
service provider.  Now the unanimous resolution does make 
reference and alludes to the PFMA and the way the 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 48 of 223 
 
procurement should be run.  Even though the – and that 
scores a schedule 2 entity and the PSJV was also 
considered a schedule 2.    
They need to – you need to formulate your own 
policy, it is like Transnet and Eskom, they are all schedule 
2.  You are allowed to formulate your own policy, okay?  
However, they did not have a policy specifically for SCM, 
so the Treasury prescripts applied.  So in terms of the 
prescripts you need to have a properly appointed BEC 
made up of staff members and management, cannot have 
10 
an external party doing the evaluation and a short list.  You 
can bring them in as advisers, Chair, for technical advice 
because there are some technical issues.   
So this was an irregularity that we uncovered. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The noncompliance by SSI with one of 
the minimum requirements, namely being in possession of 
the licence, that could not have been an oversight on the 
part of those who were supposed to disqualify that, could it 
have been? 
MR TORRES:   Yes, it could not happen because it is a – I 
20 
mean, it is one of the main requirements …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because the first thing you do, is do 
they meet the minimum requirements?  Now in your 
investigation 
did 
you 
confront 
the 
person 
who 
was 
supposed to establish whether SSI met this requirement 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 49 of 223 
 
and if you confronted them, what was their explanation? 
MR TORRES:   Chair, firstly, Gamiro Advisory Services, 
who did the evaluation actually allocated zero points to 
Scarlet Sky for not having a licence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR TORRES:   Okay?  So, I mean, this was disregarded by 
the tender committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it is the tender committee that was 
supposed to pick this up? 
MR TORRES:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or at least they should have given effect 
to the zero …[intervenes] 
MR TORRES:   Yes, they should have and they did not give 
them zero. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TORRES:   They gave them the full five points and so 
this is where the discrepancies came about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But what I asking is whether you 
were able, as the investigators, to confront the tender 
committee, the Chairperson or whoever,  to say how could 
20 
you …[intervenes] 
MR TORRES:   Okay, Chair, the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   …not have disqualified SSI?  What is 
your explanation for this? 
MR TORRES:   These were former board members and we 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 50 of 223 
 
were unable to contact them, so we did not confront them 
but we did speak to the executive management team and to 
understand why this happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR TORRES:   So – but they also were excluded from the 
process and they could not… 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know, there is the tendency 
sometimes with investigators that just because somebody 
is no longer is employed by the entity then they do not 
follow them.  Why could you not get hold of them?  You 
10 
could not get hold of even one member of the tender 
committee, former member, to say tell us, what is your 
explanation, 
or 
send 
them 
a 
letter 
saying 
we 
are 
investigating, we have been mandated to investigate and 
this is what seems to have happened here and you were 
part of the tender committee and it seems you should have 
picked this up and you did not disqualify this.  What is your 
explanation for that because we may make an adverse 
finding about you and the tender committee.  What is your 
explanation?  Give us your explanation by such and such a 
20 
date. 
MR TORRES:   No, we did not, Chair.  We also had tight 
deadlines and time constraints, they wanted the report.  
So, I mean, there were a number of other issues that we 
wanted to follow up but unfortunately we could not. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 51 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it is a pity you did not do that 
because, I mean, you did have three months and, if 
necessary, you could have told the Department of Public 
Enterprises that you needed more time because this is 
quite crucial because you have a situation where your 
investigations reveal that member of the tender committee 
failed to disqualify an entity that should obviously have 
been disqualified.   
You need an explanation why they failed to do that 
because they could not have not seen that the SSI did not 
10 
have a licence because their job would have been to find 
out do you meet these minimum requirements.   
Did they ask that question and what was the answer 
because it may mean that they were part of corruption and 
that is quite something serious and you do not want to 
reach that conclusion without giving those people an 
opportunity 
to 
give 
an 
explanation 
for 
their 
strange 
conduct.  Do you understand that?   
And it enriches your report if you have confronted 
those people and you are able to say in your report:  After 
20 
we picked this up, we approached the tender committee 
and asked them, gave them an opportunity to explain and 
this is the explanation they have given, we think this 
explanation is nonsense or they have failed to give an 
explanation and we think they have failed to give it 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 52 of 223 
 
because they have none.  Do you understand that?  Then 
your report has more value than if you leave them out. 
MR TORRES:   You are correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TORRES:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR TORRES:   I hear what you are saying.  I think the next 
point that I was going to raise, Chair, was the tender 
committee recommended the appointment of Scarlet Sky.  
However, 
they 
gave 
a 
condition, 
they 
said 
we 
will 
10 
recommend the appointment provided a due diligence is 
conducted by the CEO, Carstens, who was also on the 
board. 
 
Now Carstens then informed the board that he had 
conducted the due diligence.  A due diligence would have 
entailed also confirming the legality of the licence, okay? 
 
Now Carstens misrepresented to the board that he 
had conducted a due diligence and on that basis they were 
appointed.  So we had interviewed Carstens about the due 
diligence, he says he has done it.  However, the company 
20 
secretary informed us that no due diligence was done and 
he wrote on email saying that he has done a due diligence 
.  So we looked at it from that point of view as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if you have done a due diligence  
would that not be a report? 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 53 of 223 
 
MR TORRES:   Yes, there should be because we want to 
know what you have …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and if he said he did it, did you ask 
for the report?  Where is your report? 
MR TORRES:   Yes, we asked, for months we asked the 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TORRES:   Repeatedly.  They had to eventually admit 
that no due diligence was done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He ultimately admitted that? 
10 
MR TORRES:   Well, no, the company secretary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TORRES:   Because he still admitted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TORRES:   He still maintained that he had done a due 
diligence . 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you, Chair, I think it is an opportune 
moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let us take – we will take the tea 
20 
adjournment.  It will be important that the – I hope the 
Commission investigators have closed the gaps that I am 
talking about that there will be evidence to say the tender 
committee has been approached about why it did not 
disqualify SSI.  Do we have their affidavits?  Do we have 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 54 of 223 
 
an explanation?  What is the explanation?   Matters like 
that.  There might be other minimum requirements that 
were not met.  I hope that has been taken care of. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Indeed it has.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  We will take the tea 
adjournment and we will resume at twenty to twelve.  We 
adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Torres you were 
explaining how the entity that scored SSI zero out of five 
and then you have the tender committee that changed the 
score. 
MR TORRES:   May I just put it on.  Gamiro Advisory 
Services scored zero points for the license; they had the 
statutory requirement of a license.  Gamiro also shortlisted 
three bidders there was seven that had submissions.  Now 
Fusion Alternatives they got the highest score of 75, 
Scarlet Sky Investments were second highest and then 
20 
there was a third company called CS Diamonds okay they 
got 67 points.  Now based on the short listing they 
presented to the tender committee; he tender committee 
then did their own evaluation subsequent to the first 
evaluation done by Gamiro.  What we did then we then 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 55 of 223 
 
compared the score sheets to see if there are any 
discrepancies and one of the discrepancies was the licence 
issue.   
The tender committee had allocated full five points 
for a licence but also we found that the criteria and the 
allocation of the points had been changed.  Now this to us 
was – I mean you cannot in the middle of …[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And just on the 5% that you say the 
tender committee awarded for a licence that could simply 
not be bonus points be awarded is it not because there 
10 
was no licence.  
MR TORRES:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So anybody who awarded SSI which is 
awarded five point which is as I understand from what you 
are saying with full points knew that there was no licence 
and therefore and awarding the full points must have been 
acting fraudulently because they would not have seen the 
licence, is it not or do I misunderstand something?    
MR TORRES:   No I agree with you Chair there was no 
licence.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you cannot – either you have, 
either the entity has a licence or it does not have.  It 
cannot be given 60% of the 100 points because if you have 
it, it is full points if you do not have it, it is no points, it is 
zero and therefore if you award the full points without 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 56 of 223 
 
there having been a licence then that must be fraudulent.  
MR TORRES:   There was no licence Chair and there 
should have – and this was one of the discrepancies we 
find that is why we did the comparisons. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR TORRES:   And I agree with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you cannot say we give you full 
points for a licence when you have not seen the licence.  
MR TORRES:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, or at least having satisfied yourself 
10 
that there is a licence.   
MR TORRES:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and I guess the way to satisfy 
yourself is for you to ask the entity to produce the licence.   
MR TORRES:   And Chair we did if I can just, we did 
approach 
the 
Diamond 
Regulator 
and 
the 
Diamond 
Regulator confirmed that the SSI does not have a licence.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so that five points is most likely 
fraudulent.  
MR TORRES:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The awarding of that unless those who 
awarded come and give an explanation that we cannot 
think of, ja okay.   
ADV SIBIYA:   They have been invited Chair to come and 
give their explanation.  We are hoping that they will.  
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 57 of 223 
 
MR TORRES:   Also Chair we found that in the original bid 
submission Scarlet Sky Investments has proposed an 
outright purchasing model all other bidders has proposed 
the auction sale of the pricing.  Now that purchase pricing 
purchase model was what was used by the previous service 
provider and this caused so much unhappiness it was a 
contentious 
issues. 
 
It 
was 
actually 
a 
matter 
to 
management and the contractors.  So when they did their 
presentations to the tender committee they then it was 
changed to the auction sale pricing model.  Now you have 
10 
a bid validity period of 90 days within that bid validity 
period you cannot make changes to the bid or if you do 
make changes all other bidders must be informed.  The 
company secretary again informed us that they have not 
informed any bidders that changes were made.   
Now allowing SSI to make a crucial change to the 
bid submission is an unfair and uncompetitive practice and 
it is a contravention of the constitution Section 217.  So we 
also found this to be a problem and lastly it is a due 
diligence issue which I alluded to earlier that was not 
20 
conducted.  So in essence the procurement process was 
irregular, it appears to be manipulated to favour SSI given 
that all these discrepancies we found.             
ADV SIBIYA:   So you are saying whether we were looking 
at the licence issue or we were looking at the other issue.   
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 58 of 223 
 
MR TORRES:   Ja the licence issues was one issue but 
there were a number of others.  All these issues taken into 
accounts shows that there was manipulation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But of course the licence requirements 
is a crucial one because you should not go beyond that 
stage if you do not have it because how are you going to 
do the job.  
MR TORRES:   No I agree with you Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   If you appoint somebody to as a Driver if 
they do not have a drivers licence.   
10 
MR TORRES:   No you cannot do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you.  Now Mr Torres and with your 
leave Chair you are aware that the Gamiro have prepared a 
response to this issue, yes?   
MR TORRES:   Yes, I have been informed.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, and you are aware that according to 
Gamiro they were not instructed to shortlist and they did 
not shortlist.  Can I refer you to page 622. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that in the same bundle?    
20 
ADV SIBIYA:   In the same bundle Chair, it is not the 
affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON:   622? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, Chair.  Am I correct? 
MR TORRES:   No on that…[intervene] 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 59 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   Sorry Sir I am waiting for the Chair to get to 
the page. 
MR TORRES:   I am here.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Am I correct that this is the document on 
which you based your conclusion that they were the ones 
that shortlisted? 
MR TORRES:   Yes, this is the document the letter of 
appointment.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, and this document that we find on page 
622 tell us what it is and just read it for us? 
10 
MR TORRES:   Okay, this is the letter to the chief 
executive of Gamiro Advisory Services and it is the 
appointment letter to Gamiro to evaluate and shortlist the 
procurement process for the marketing and selling of rough 
diamonds and the letter has been signed by Mervin 
Carstens the chief executive officer.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Where did you get this letter? 
MR TORRES:   This is a letter that we got from - in our 
batch because we got batch documents from the Company 
Secretary was our main liaison.  So she sent us all of 
20 
these documents so we got this in our batch from the 
Company Secretary.    
ADV SIBIYA:   The company secretary of the PSJV? 
MR TORRES:   Of the PSJV called Reagan Phillips.  
ADV SIBIYA:   So she is the one that when sending you 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 60 of 223 
 
documents that would support the investigation that you 
were undertaking included this document? 
MR TORRES:   Yes, what we would also do is we will give 
her specific documents that we wanted and say we need 
these documents and they would send it to us.   
CHAIRPERSON:   And what was the point about the letter 
that you say some of Gamiro or somebody makes?    
ADV SIBIYA:   The affidavit that has been submitted by 
Gamiro but was submitted in short notice and therefore is 
not yet before the Chairperson.  In that affidavit they 
10 
dispute 
that 
they 
were 
instructed 
to 
shortlist, 
yes 
and…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do they do so on the basis of this letter?      
ADV SIBIYA:   They say that they never received this letter 
and I am taking it as yes…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, alright.    
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, so they dispute that they shortlisted in 
the first place and Mr Torres has just given evidence of the 
scoring 
and 
the 
facts 
that 
they 
shortlisted. 
 
So 
I 
am…[intervene] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that a way of saying that they were 
not required to check whether somebody had the entity had 
a licence?      
ADV SIBIYA:   No they say that they scored them zero for 
that aspect but they are distancing themselves from having 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 61 of 223 
 
ensured that SSI is…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But getting, giving them zero for that 
aspect should mean they should not proceed to do 
anything else.    
ADV SIBIYA:   Chair I do not want to be…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not want to be there advocate.    
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, however what they say in their affidavit 
which is under oath and they have submitted is that they 
only put in the scores but did not say that these are the 
companies that must be shortlisted.  They say that they did 
10 
not have the authority to disqualify…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I am sure they will come and 
explain.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay but it is important for you to put to 
Mr Torres what they say about their report, ja.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, so do you accept that they did not? 
MR TORRES:   Based on this letter they did do a short 
listing and in any event when you do the scoring it is also 
an automatic short listing process unless of course you say 
20 
a company must be disqualified and you state explicitly 
why and there scoring already was the short listing.     
ADV SIBIYA:   And surely by employing Gamiro they had to 
have a certain expertise.   
MR TORRES:   Yes because you do not employ an external 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 62 of 223 
 
service provider if they do not have the skills and the 
capabilities to do the job because you have the skills in 
house.  So yes they should have known that SSI had to be 
disqualified for not having a licence.  
ADV SIBIYA:   How many tenders were in fact received? 
MR TORRES:   There were seven tenders that were 
reviewed Chair.  There were actually nine express of 
interest submitted but two did not attend the briefing 
session and did not submit a formal proposal.  
ADV SIBIYA:   So there was an external service provider 
10 
appointed to evaluate seven tenders? 
MR TORRES:   Seven tenders, correct.   
ADV SIBIYA:   And in your view and in your…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the bids seven bids for a 
particular tender? 
MR TORRES:   Yes, yes for a particular. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  
ADV SIBIYA:   So in your view why would they have 
needed to appoint a service provider for the evaluation of 
the seven tenders if not to shortlist and not to…[intervene]  
20 
MR TORRES:   Yes, you are quite right because you have 
the expertise inside who have been doing this job for quite 
some time and they do the bid evaluation all the time and 
then you provide an external provider it raises the question 
why specifically this service provider and why were they 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 63 of 223 
 
asked to shortlist because normally you just say do the bid 
evaluation.   
The bid evaluation should in itself tell you who goes  
to the next level.  Have they reached the threshold level 
because there could have been a threshold level?  I think 
there was a threshold level functionality of 70.  So if you 
do not reach 70 you do not go to the next level.  So there 
must have been a reason I think why…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you given and explanation as to 
why this was outsourced during your investigation?  
10 
MR TORRES:   What we wanted to know why – we also 
found that the company secretary and the other executive 
members because they were not involved could not give us 
an explanation.  So we then asked the…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But somebody must have taken the 
decision to outsource did you approach that person?    
MR TORRES:   Carstens now we – there were allegations 
that he had in his previous job that he had contact with 
Gamiro Advisory but we could never confirm it.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but what I am asking is did you 
20 
confront him to say explain why it was justified to 
outsource this and did you approach him, did you provide 
and explanation if he did what was the explanation?  
MR TORRES:   Well all that he said was that they have the 
necessary expertise and knowledge to do this particular 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 64 of 223 
 
job and also that they were doing other advisory services 
for the entity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry so you did approach him?  
MR TORRES:   Yes, we had an interview with him a formal 
interview. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and his explanation was? 
MR TORRES:   Well all he said they have the expertise 
they wanted them because they have the expertise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What the internal expertise, why not use 
the internal expertise?  
10 
MR TORRES:   Well I…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is an obvious question you would 
ask why 
you outsourcing 
because we have 
got the 
expertise.  
MR TORRES:   Well we questioned because we said by 
employing external service providers even if they have the 
expertise it is actually fruitless and wasteful expenditure.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is why I am saying it is an 
obvious question for you to ask to say why are you 
outsourcing you have got the expertise because the 
20 
outsourcing in circumstances where there is in-house 
expertise may be an indication of something else.  So it is 
a crucial question and an explanation for that why it was 
done in circumstances where there was in-house expertise 
to do the job is quite important.      
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 65 of 223 
 
MR TORRES:   No, his only explanation was that they have 
the technical ability in terms of the industry as well and 
that is why they were picked and then we let it at that 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 And 
what 
did 
you 
make 
of 
that 
explanation?  
MR TORRES:   It did not make sense to us Chair because 
the only technical issue was the licence.  The rest was 
have you met the requirements.  The scoring was on issues 
such as – okay there was some technical issues but the 
10 
scoring 
was 
on 
the 
criteria 
was 
mainly 
on 
local 
development what are they going to do on that, the pricing 
model was an important issue.  So they could have had - 
and this is what our argument was - you said yes fine 
maybe they could have come in as a technical advisor 
because that is what happens all the time.  Your BEC do 
not have all the technical knowledge at times so why did 
you not bring them in, you said no they were there they did 
the bid evaluation.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you and what else did you discover 
20 
had been done wrong in the procurement process? 
MR TORRES:   In the procurement process? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  
MR TORRES:   Well I think I have covered most of the 
items that were done wrong, it is just to summarise.  There 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 66 of 223 
 
was no licence, Gamiro as an external service provider 
there was no compliance in the way they were appointed 
because they should have appointed internal staff or have 
a properly constituted bid evaluation committee.  Also the 
scoring of the three shortlisted services providers there 
were discrepancies.   
For example, basic discrepancies like all three 
service providers had – okay after the changed bid 
submission of SSI they all proposed a commission of 1.5% 
but two of the service providers were given three points 
10 
and the other one was given four points.  You know for the 
same so how do you – so it was just to us we got the 
impression that is why we say we think it was manipulated 
they were just giving points to ensure that SSI got the 
highest 
points 
that 
was 
the 
presentation 
after 
the 
presentation.  
ADV SIBIYA:   And of course we have the issue of the due 
diligence that was a condition.  
MR TORRES:   That was a condition that I think also the 
sub-committee wanted to protect itself, they had made a 
20 
recommendation. 
 
They 
then 
said 
based 
on 
our 
recommendation, no we recommend SSI however you need 
to conduct a due diligence which was never conducted, 
that is it.     
ADV SIBIYA:   And when it came to the Board and 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 67 of 223 
 
reporting to the Board about the due diligence what did you 
find? 
MR TORRES:   Well Mervin Carsten’s the CEO actually 
wrote an email to Board members confirming that he had 
conducted a due diligence and based on that they accepted 
it and awarded the contract to SSI. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But how could they, how could the Board 
just accept his word one would have expected that they 
would ask for the report, the due diligence report so that 
they could evaluate it themselves and see what it says.     
10 
MR TORRES:   Chair right from the beginning of our 
investigation the due diligence report was one of the things 
that we asked them for.  Eventually right at the end they 
confessed 
and 
said, 
the 
company 
secretary 
actually, 
Reagan Phillips said look no due diligence was done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so the letter that Mr Carsten’s 
wrote to the Board did it say I have conducted due 
diligence and this is the outcome thereof or what did it 
say?    
MR TORRES:   I am trying to remember the email it is such 
20 
a – but the email said I have conducted the due diligence.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR TORRES:   I do not - the email did not specify you 
know what was in the due diligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would that email be part of the 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 68 of 223 
 
annexures to your report? 
MR TORRES:   It should be. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or you are not sure.  
MR TORRES:   I am not sure Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay that can be checked later, you see 
it becomes important because we also need to look at the 
role of Boards of these SOE’s.  How can you simply be told 
a due diligence has been conducted and you make a 
decision without seeing the due diligence report.  How do 
you do that?     
10 
MR TORRES:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it turns out there was no due 
diligence that was done anyway and then the question 
arises why was there nobody among the Board members 
who said where is the due diligence report, we want to see 
it before we make a decision you see.  Did you have 
access to the minutes of the Board meeting where they 
discussed and made the decision?  
MR TORRES:   Chair we would have had I think where the 
appointment was made in the Board I am sure we have got 
20 
that minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright it would be important to 
see what was said, ja okay.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you and then we move on to the 
second appointment but before we get there what did you 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 69 of 223 
 
find in relation to the expertise, the scoring for the 
expertise did you have any problem?  
MR TORRES:   The scoring? 
ADV SIBIYA:   In relation to the experience and the 
expertise, did you have any problem with that? 
MR TORRES:   The experience? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Of SSI.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Of SSI, yes.  
MR TORRES:   Well I think right at the beginning I alluded 
10 
to the fact that it was a shelf company so there was no 
business tract record there was no experience so they 
should have gotten very little.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR TORRES:   But they were allocated points and then 
there was also gaps in their bid that is why the criteria was 
changed as well because the pricing model they did not 
have in their first bid and then there was also beneficiation 
the local community they need to – there was an aspect 
where the local community had to be empowered.  That 
20 
was 
actually 
removed 
from 
the 
criteria 
during 
the 
presentation stage.    
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you okay now we can move to the 
second appointment of SSI.    
MR TORRES:   The second appointment of…[intervene] 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 70 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page is that? 
ADV SIBIYA:   It is the very next page Chair on page 92 I 
am sorry I did not take…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you took us to page 622 are we is 
it 623 or are we going back.   
ADV SIBIYA:   I am walking by myself Chair and leaving 
everyone behind. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja we can see that.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, we are actually back…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You need us.  
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   We are back at page 92. 
CHAIRPERSON:   92? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes thank you Chair.  
MR TORRES:   Okay I have got it here.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  
MR 
TORRES: 
 
 
The 
second 
appointment 
of 
SSI 
…[intervene] 
ADV SIBIYA:   Firstly I am sorry to cut you Mr Torres, were 
you happy with the appointment or did you also make 
adverse findings in relation to this appointment? 
20 
MR TORRES:   In our view the procurement process for the 
appointment of the service provider to market and sell the 
rough diamonds was fatally flawed and we did have 
adverse findings.      
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay and you are talking about the second 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 71 of 223 
 
tender.  
MR TORRES:   Yes, the second tender.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, now you can go ahead and say what 
you findings were.  
MR TORRES:   Now the second tender the BEC there was 
a 
BEC 
and 
the 
BEC 
comprised 
the 
executive 
team 
managers, so there was a BEC.  We then requested the 
minutes the scoring of the BEC it was at this stage when 
the company secretary who was also a member of the BEC 
admitted to us that they did no evaluation at all.  Their only 
10 
job was to ensure that there is compliance with the 
requirements.   
Now this is the requirements such as is there a 
tender certificate, is there a BEE certificate.  Now this is 
an administrative job that is usually done by supplier 
management staff it should not be done by an executive 
team.  So the BEC in itself was you could say a hoax in 
itself because they were appointed but to do what because 
your responsibility as a BEC is to do evaluation so they did 
no evaluation and that was to us a problem.  Already right 
20 
from the start this whole, there were problems with the 
procurement process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did the company’s admission, was the 
company’s admission that no evaluation was done in 
writing?    
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 72 of 223 
 
MR TORRES:   Well what she did was she said they had no 
records that an evaluation had been done and that is why it 
was a problem even to get minutes, documents.  In fact, 
there was even a problem in us finding out the number of 
submissions admitted.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but my question is whether 
whatever he said whether that was in writing namely 
whether he said there was no evaluation done or whether 
he said there were no records indicating that evaluations 
were done.  What he told you was it in writing?  Did he 
10 
sign a statement or do an affidavit, did he send a letter or 
was it just…[intervene] 
MR TORRES:   No we had an interview with her on this 
particular and a number of other issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR TORRES:   I am just trying to recall Chair but we did 
on this particular issues it is when normally they get 
appointed as BEC they do evaluations but I must, I cannot 
recall 
whether 
she 
informed 
us 
whether 
it 
was 
an 
instruction and I think that is what you want to know, am I 
20 
right Chair? That she was instructed.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.     
MR TORRES:   Not to do an evaluation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would your interview with him would 
have been recorded by any chance?  
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 73 of 223 
 
MR TORRES:   No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would not have been recorded 
because it is quite important information so I would have 
imagined that if you did not record the interview you would 
have asked him to do an affidavit or at least minimum a 
statement to say give us a statement that tells us exactly 
what you have just told us in this interview.  Did you do 
that?    
MR TORRES:   No we did not.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Why not, it is such an important thing? 
10 
MR TORRES:   Chair…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean evaluation was important, it 
should have been done here is the company secretary 
either telling you no evaluation was done or we were 
instructed not to do it or there are simply no records 
indicating that this was done.  So now you are conducting 
an important investigation how do you not secure either a 
statement 
or 
an 
affidavit 
from 
this 
giving 
you 
this 
information. 
MR TORRES:  I cannot recall us asking her for an affidavit 
20 
but I agree with you it is an important point.  Again Chair 
under the circumstances we were – in fact we thought we 
would get – get a second opportunity to continue and close 
the gaps but we never got to a second appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it is unsatisfactory.  It is unsatisfactory.  
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 74 of 223 
 
I mean this is very important.  Now somebody tells you very 
important information you are investigating.  You are going 
to compile a report give it to the Department of Public 
Enterprises and he tells you crucial information; you do not 
ensure that it is in writing to say the least or it is an affidavit 
or it is recorded.  It is unsatisfactory.  Ms Sibiya continue. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you.  Maybe if I can assist you Mr 
Torres.  On page 146. 
MR TORRES:  100 and? 
ADV SIBIYA:  46 – 146.  This is the section where you detail 
10 
the content of the interview.  You detail the date of the 
interview with Ms Phillips and you set out in the report still 
what she informed you.  Are you with me on page 146? 
MR TORRES:  Yes I am. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay.  So you will see that in paragraph 
17.5.4 you say: 
“On 4 October 2019 we interviewed Ms 
Ragan Phillips the company secretary of the 
PSJV and she informed us that she is an 
admitted attorney whose done post graduate 
20 
that is at Stellenbosch University.” 
And then three bullet points down can you see what you 
wrote there as a recordal of your consultation?  Can you 
read that for us.  So the fourth bullet point. 
MR TORRES:  It is the fourth bullet point. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 75 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
MR TORRES:   
“Appointed as – this is the interview with 
Phillips.  Phillips informed as follows: 
Appointed 
as 
part 
of 
the 
BEC 
for 
the 
procurement process involving the tender for 
marketing and selling of rough diamonds.  
The committee did not do any scoring for the 
evaluation 
purposes 
only 
checked 
compliance to the minimum requirements.” 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ask her why the evaluation was 
not done or the scoring for evaluation purposes was not 
done? 
MR TORRES:  Chair I think I do not see it here.  I cannot 
recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is such an obvious question to ask if 
you are investigating.  And this is what company secretary? 
MR TORRES:  Ja the company secretary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The company secretary is an important 
official in the company and – and if I recall correctly part of 
20 
their job is to ensure compliance with legislation and so on.  
So she sits on a committee which was supposed to conduct 
an evaluation and she tells you they did not do the 
evaluation because if they did not score that means they did 
not do the evaluation.  Most obvious question to ask is why 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 76 of 223 
 
not.  That is what you were about as a committee.  That was 
your job.  Why did you not do the job? 
MR TORRES:  In fact we raised the question that the PEC 
that is there job but she said they were – that is all they did.  
They were not given any other information to work on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja did you ask her why were you not 
given?  Who was supposed to give you information?  Why 
were you not given information? 
MR TORRES:  Chair the questions – we raised a number of 
questions.  I must admit that at times the – the – they were 
10 
evasive you know and because we also had time constraints 
we were in Cape Town we had conduct unfortunately were 
important when there was winds – a dust storm and we could 
not conduct any interviews.  We had to reschedule because 
it is quite a drive to Upington.  So you have to drive to 
Upington 700 kms then get a flight back to Joburg so it is an 
issue to get there.  So I think that the time constraints were 
also. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but you had three months to do this and 
you are interviewing the company secretary and she tells you 
20 
I was part of the committee that was supposed to do an 
evaluation.  We did not do an evaluation.  Obviously you 
must probe further to find out why.  Why did you not do your 
job as a committee to find out whether they were instructed 
by anybody not to do the job?  If they were instructed who 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 77 of 223 
 
instructed them?  What were – why did they comply with that 
instruction?  Was that instruction lawful?  And so or were 
they part of a certain agenda or were they not part of an 
agenda.  And you cannot find – cannot get an answer to 
those questions if you do not ask the relevant questions.  
You see it – it dilutes the significance of your report if you do 
not ask questions that should have been asked. 
MR TORRES:  I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see here on – on the fourth bullet point it 
says – you recorded that she said they only checked 
10 
compliance to the minimum requirements, is that right? 
MR TORRES:  That is right and I do say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did she say that they found that there 
was compliance with the minimum requirements – did she tell 
you that?  Or did she – what did she say was their finding 
about? 
MR TORRES:  There was – there was compliance to the 
minimum requirements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MR TORRES:  There was compliance to the minimum 
20 
requirements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Is that because Scarlet now did have 
a licence or what? 
MR TORRES:  Well they were using the licence of a related 
company. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 78 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that allowed? 
MR TORRES:  It is not allowed.  I mean you must have your 
own licence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so why – why do we not – why did 
you not make an issue on that?  Why did you not raise that 
with her to say but if they did not – if Scarlet did not have a 
licence then they did not meet the requirements.  They could 
not use somebody else’s licence. 
MR TORRES:  Chair I hear what you say but she says the 
requirements that they were given – all the requirements 
10 
were met.  Now we do not have a written document 
stipulating what requirements were put down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ask for them? 
MR TORRES:  Ja but there was no – we asked for all of that.  
There were no documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But who would have – who would have 
decided on the requirements? 
MR TORRES:  Well there ask essentially when you submit 
there are certain requirements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR TORRES:  That you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TORRES:  You will make your bids – your tax certificate, 
your BEE certificate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 79 of 223 
 
MR TORRES:  The document must be properly signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I am saying somebody within the 
company would say for this tender these are going to be the 
minimum requirements is it not? 
MR TORRES:  No, no.  There was no document stipulating 
what were the minimum requirements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so how – how did they – how did they 
know what the minimum requirements are that she is talking 
about here? 
MR TORRES:  Well we assumed that it was just the normal 
10 
administrative requirements.  You know having a tender, tax 
clearance certificate, a BEE certificate, a submission of 
documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but how could you assume.  This is 
something you are supposed to satisfy yourself about.  If you 
are asked to investigate whether a company was awarded a 
particular contract lawfully obviously you go back to the start 
to say okay when the request for information – the request 
for proposals was issued what requirements were there?  
Who was eligible to make a proposal?  Did these – this 
20 
company meet those requirements and take it from there? 
MR TORRES:  Well Chair at this stage already we knew it is 
a 
sham 
because there 
were 
no 
documents 
available.  
Because normally even the Supply Chain they would have a 
documents that is your tender requirements where these are 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 80 of 223 
 
the requirements and it is a tick exercise really.  You are 
quite right Chair it is a tick exercise.  But there were no – 
there was nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – but does your report say that there 
was – there were no such documents? 
MR TORRES:  There were no documents we asked for it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TORRES:  It does say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does say that. 
MR TORRES:  That we asked for all the minutes and 
10 
everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But are you saying at page 146 of the 
report that Ms Phillips said they checked compliance with the 
minimum requirements and found that there was compliance?  
Is that what you record her as having said? 
MR TORRES:  I will not say – I said only check compliance 
to minimum requirements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TORRES:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what I am asking – what – I am asking 
20 
what that means because it says only checked.  Now you can 
check and find that there was no compliance with the 
minimum requirements.  You check and find that there was 
compliance.  So this does not tell me which one so I am 
asking you did she say they checked as the committee 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 81 of 223 
 
whether there had been compliance with the minimum 
requirements and found that there had been compliance with 
the minimum requirements? 
MR TORRES:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or do you not remember? 
MR TORRES:  Yes there was compliance but we needed also 
the documents and that was not available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TORRES:  Because to us that – it is again yes there was 
compliance, what did you check?  They could not give us.  
10 
And I think this is one of our requirements that we wanted 
compliance check list which also we did not get. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But your report say – in regard to your 
interview of her does not – unless it is dealt with elsewhere 
does not reveal that you raised these queries unless you 
deal – you deal with that somewhere else.  Because you are 
interviewing the company secretary.  She says we checked 
compliance with the minimum requirements and obviously 
you have to say what did you find?  If she said there was 
compliance you say what were the minimum requirements?  
20 
Where are the documents that say those were the minimum 
requirements?  That does not appear in the report. 
MR TORRES:  It does not appear here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And yet it is quite something important.  
Because how can she say there was compliance if she 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 82 of 223 
 
cannot produce the document that tells you what those 
requirements were.  Can you see where – what – where my 
problem is? 
MR TORRES:  No, no I – I hear you and I agree with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you were – you would – I would have 
expected you to want to satisfy yourself on this because you 
want to be able in your report to say was she right in saying 
there was compliance with the minimum requirements or not?  
You see.  In your report did you deal with whether she was 
right about that? 
10 
MR TORRES:  I deal – no the BEC I only deal with the BEC 
issue and what she responded to.  The focus was because 
after – there was a short listing done and the short listing 
they also again like the first procurement presented to the 
tender committee.  Now also again our problem was how did 
they short list if there was no evaluation done?  There was 
no documents, nothing.  In fact the procurement process for 
the second appointment was a sham. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but you – at least this page 146 does 
not reflect that you probed issues that you were supposed to 
20 
probe. She seems to tell you she checked compliance with 
the minimum requirements and that seems to be left at that. 
MR TORRES:  Ja.  Yes I think if you look at the issues three 
months might seem a long time but it is a short time.  The 
investigation. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 83 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but just this one person you do not 
need – I mean just an hour with this person you say okay 
what were the minimum requirements? 
MR TORRES:  No we had… 
CHAIRPERSON:  These were the minimum requirements.  
Where are you basing that on?  Where is the document that 
told the bidders these were the requirements?  Where do you 
get that from?  How can you say there was compliance if the 
bidders were not told what the requirements were? 
MR TORRES:  Chair also you must understand that this also 
10 
served as a preliminary investigation.  We had expected to 
then have another phase where we would probe certain 
aspects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but these are the basic minimums.  
Why must those be dealt with by another investigation?  This 
is – there are the first things you look at and then they do 
not need a lot of time.  You see.  Why must the Department 
of Public Enterprises have to either appoint you or appoint 
somebody else to do another investigation after they have 
paid whatever they paid for your report when this can be 
20 
established very quickly?  Ms Sibiya continue. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Mr Torres on page 92 you set out on 12.1.2 
what was the minimum requirements. 
MR TORRES:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 84 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:  92 Chair.  In paragraph 12.1.2.. 
MR TORRES:  No on 92? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
MR TORRES:  Oh I am sorry. 
ADV SIBIYA:  92 in black. 
MR TORRES:  I am looking here.  The wrong page. 
ADV SIBIYA:  12.1 – 12.1.2 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:  You set out the minimum requirements for the 
second feat and … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  12.1.2 does not set out the minimum 
requirements it sets out what was considered to be minimum 
requirements.  I do not know considered by whom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Chair I am still taking Mr Torres to the 
document that supports because I think some of it he might 
have forgotten but he makes reference to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  So if I can take you very, very far to 
page 640 of the same document.  640 in fact that identifies 
the number of the exhibit only.  Now the document that 
20 
appears there it is called the Tender – it says Marketing – oh 
you not there yet.  Are you not there yet? 
MR TORRES:  Pardon. 
ADV SIBIYA:  You are not there yet? 
MR TORRES:  I am it is 642 you said. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 85 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  641. 
MR TORRES:  641 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
MR TORRES:  Yes I – I am there. 
ADV SIBIYA:  So what is this document? 
MR TORRES:  It says the Marketing Post Extraction 
Treatment processing and beneficiation of diamonds. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes but what is this document? 
MR TORRES:  Pardon. 
ADV SIBIYA:  What is this document? 
10 
MR TORRES:  Oh it is a request for proposals. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay.  And it is the request for proposals for 
the same contract we are talking about? 
MR TORRES:  That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay.  Now if I can take you to page 655 of 
that same document.   
MR TORRES:  Yes. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Do you see in the middle of the page where it 
is in bold 655. 
MR TORRES:  Oh 655. 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.   
MR TORRES:  I have got it. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Can you see in the middle of the page this is 
still the same document can you confirm that it is still the 
same document that we have just identified? 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 86 of 223 
 
MR TORRES:  That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay.  Can you see the heading in bold that 
says Section 2 detailed Terms of Reference?  In bold in the 
middle of the page. 
MR TORRES:  Yes I do see it. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay.  Can you see that sub-paragraph and 
immediately below that it says: 
“As 
a 
minimum 
requirement 
proposals 
must 
demonstrate the bidders' ability to.” 
MR TORRES:  Okay I am there. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay.  Do you not think this is where you got 
the minimum requirements that you reflect? 
MR TORRES:  I think this is exactly the same as the report. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  It is almost – it is not everything.  It is – 
this document – the items listed on this page there is only 
four of them so it is A to D and then you on page 92 in 
addition to what they have put in you include a BEE level 
and you include the tax clearance.  But in terms of the 
substance this is exactly the same. 
MR TORRES:  Yes.  Yes. 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well what was the page on the other one 
which is has got considered? 
ADV SIBIYA:  92. 
CHAIRPERSON:  92? 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 87 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  We can go line by line.   
MR TORRES:  So now Mr Torres how does your evidence 
that there were no documents setting out the minimum 
requirements gets reconciled with this document that sets 
out at page 655 the minimum requirements. 
MR TORRES:  No I have got the minimum requirements but I 
think the – I am talking about the compliance Chair.  There 
was no documents showing which compliance check was 
done.  Because we needed the minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well when you and I were talking about – 
10 
you remember the page in your report where you recorded 
what the company secretary said in the interview you had 
with her and she had said according to that report only 
checked compliance with minimum requirements.  And then I 
asked the question was there compli – did she say there was 
compliance with the minimum requirements?  Because 
checking compliance with minimum requirements does not 
tell me whether there was compliance or there was no 
compliance.  So we then got to talking about what were the 
minimum requirements.  That is when you said no documents 
20 
were provided to you that set out what the minimum 
requirements – as I understood your evidence 
MR TORRES:  Based on the report there were the minimum 
requirements were there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 88 of 223 
 
MR 
TORRES: 
 
Based 
on 
the 
report 
the 
minimum 
requirements were there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no I now know that they were there but I 
understood you to say you asked for documents that set out 
the minimum requirements and you were not provided with 
them.  That is how I understood your evidence.  Did I 
misunderstand your evidence? 
MR TORRES:  Well the – we did ask for documents that were 
not given the minutes.  Even the compliance check because 
she must have signed the compliance check list to say that I 
10 
have done this to this and this is – that we did not get.  But 
the compliance – the minimum requirements as specified in 
the terms of reference it is part of our exhibit – annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Sibiya how long do you need with this 
witness? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Chair I think one hour.  Yes Chair.  I do not 
want to underestimate the time as we are known to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we still have about thirty minutes 
before we get to one o’clock.  See how much you – how 
much you use that thirty minutes. 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not sure that we need an hour. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Continue. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you.  Now you move on – we move onto 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 89 of 223 
 
the issue of the marine contractors. 
MR TORRES:  Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:  If I understand correctly these were the 
people that had complained to the DPE and this related to 
the same soured relationship that had been identified and 
had been part of the reason that you were appointed to 
conduct this investigation.  I am taking you to page 98. 
MR TORRES:  98? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
MR TORRES:  I am there. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay.  Yes.  So what did you investigate and 
what did you find as briefly as you can?  What was the 
complaint that you were investigating? 
MR TORRES:  On the evaluation process itself we found 
more adverse findings.  There was a properly constituted 
BEC also made up of the executive team.  Because there 
were no issues with that.  There was the BEC/Tender 
Committee recommended 9 out of the 19 bids.  There were 
two bids.  The beach mining activity and there was the 
shallow water activity – marine activity. 
20 
 
So the beach mining activity there were – there were 
19 submissions.  8 bids were recommended for award.  The 
shallow water marine tender there were 66 bids submitted.  
51 bids were recommended for – for appointment.  Included 
in 
the 
51 
bids 
you 
had 
four 
contractors 
that 
were 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 90 of 223 
 
subsequently excluded from the procurement process by the 
board.   
 
Now the board held – and the four contractors that 
were excluded were Ocean Diggers, Malakaza, TL Marine 
and Repsol.  These were the four contractors. 
 
Now this is all related to the – the relationship that 
existed between the contractors on the one hand, the 
executive management and board on the one hand.  It was a 
hostile and unfriendly relationship and the board then 
decided – they had a special meeting held to – where they 
10 
discussed the appointment of these four contractors. 
 
At this meeting the board decided to exclude them 
from the procurement process on the basis that they were 
disruptive, they were abusive, they had damaged the 
reputation of the board and the executive management.  So 
on this basis they were excluded. 
 
However the – the process was not followed.  Even – 
because in terms of the unanimous resolution it is quite 
explicit.  It says the executive management can recommend 
to the board the appointment of an independent contractor. 
20 
 
If 
the 
board 
disagrees 
and 
rejects 
the 
recommendation it must be referred back to the executive 
management 
for 
reconsideration. 
 
The 
executive 
management then referred the matter back to the board.  
And if the board still – the board cannot refuse or reject – 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 91 of 223 
 
the 
second 
time 
around 
they 
cannot 
reject 
the 
recommendation of the executive team provided that the 
organisation will be financially prejudiced. 
 
Now the exclusion was not based on financial 
prejudice.  It was because of the type of relationship that 
existed.  So the board acted improperly in rejecting the 
award of the four contractors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Sibiya remember that his report is 
before me. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the findings are there.  Whatever 
recommendations are there. I think what is more important 
for you to look at the important findings that you want to 
bring to my attention let him deal with them and the basis for 
those findings and take it from there.  Otherwise most of 
what he says is in the report and one can read it but it is 
important to see the basis for certain findings. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and question him on the basis or the 
process of him conducting the investigation. 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you Chair I will do so.  Now Chair this 
is not an indication that I am not following what the Chair 
has said but I am just going to move to the next page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Of the report because the next … 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 92 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine ja. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you Chair.  On page 108 it could be 
that I am saying it is the next page and maybe I have left 
you behind again but I am now asking us to go to page 108. 
MR TORRES:  108? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
MR TORRES:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that 108? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes 108.  Now this was one of the more 
contentious issues am I correct? 
10 
MR TORRES:  Yes it was a conten – evaluation pricing or 
contentious issue. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  Okay.  Tell us what you were asked to 
check and the process that you followed before you have 
reached your finding. 
MR TORRES:   Okay.   
ADV SIBIYA:   As briefly as you can. 
MR TORRES:   There were complaints that there was...  
Chair, there were complaints that the diamonds were being 
undervalued and that no proper evaluation process was 
20 
being done.   
 
Now the way that they value the diamonds.  They call it 
the Four C’s Method.  It is your carat, your colour, the clarity 
and the cut.  Now there was a problem – there are two 
evaluations done.   
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 93 of 223 
 
 
At the processing plant you have the PSJV.  They have 
got a Diamond Evaluation who then do the evaluations there.  
Now the evaluation being done by the PSJV’s evaluator was 
done purely using carat quantities.  The other C’s were not 
used.   
 
And according to customs, it was the CEO.  He said no 
shares gone.  They evaluated at that stage.  Had no skills.  
She could only do carat evaluation.  So that was the reason 
they gave.   
 
And then there is another evaluation done by SSI.  They 
10 
get an independent evaluator to do evaluation.  There were 
also complaints from the evaluation done by SSI.   
 
What we did with SSI.  We then requested them to give 
us the certificate of the evaluation.  Of each diamond, there 
is a certificate issued.  Because that would give us more 
details on what, how it was done, what carat was there, the 
cut, the clarity and all that.  They could not give us any 
certificates.  I mean, they promised but they never gave us.   
 
And then we also did a comparison because it was very 
difficult now to do the evaluation based on here because 
20 
they did not give us any information.  So we were forced to 
then do a pricing – to get a pricing index, a Ziminsky pricing 
index.   
 
And also the second index was Bloomberg.  But it is not 
ideal to use this index because the pricing is average and a 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 94 of 223 
 
mixed bag of diamonds get used.  So your pricing will also 
be lower.   
 
However, we have found there were big discrepancies, 
that the pricing was much lower than the Bloomberg and the 
Ziminsky prices.  And in fact, under evaluation – ja, this 
would – there was a big problem there with the evaluation.   
 
And then, of course, also there was no compliance with 
the contractual terms for the agreement.  Contractual terms 
are very clear that 5% of the diamonds must be sold to a 
local buy for beneficiation purposes but 10% must be sold 
10 
through the State Diamond Treasure in terms of the Diamond 
Act.   
 
And then the 85% had to be purchased by buyers 
through an auction sale.  Now when we looked at the after-
sales report and the invoices, we found that, firstly, it 
depicted that 85% of the diamonds were being sold to 
Scarlet Sky.   
 
And in terms of the contract, it should be through an 
auction process.  We then requested the names of the 
bidders because they insisted that they held auctions.  We 
20 
said okay, then why – you should not be putting your name 
on the after-sales report.   
 
The response was:  It is classified information and we 
cannot reveal it.  We then insisted that:  No, PSJV is your 
client.  It is their information, right.  And we are doing the 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 95 of 223 
 
investigation.  They said:  We never got that information.  
Because we needed to know who are the buyers.   
 
We also needed to know how much was sold and to 
which buyer.  It is very important.  So that was a big problem 
to us.  So that is why we were also forced to do this 
MSCI/Bloomberg evaluation.  We then found that when we 
looked at the other, the 10% and the 5% sold, we found that 
it was based on carats, carat quantities.   
 
Now in terms of the contract it should be based on value 
and not on carat quantities.  So we did a comparison.  And 
10 
then we found that the way they did the pricing, they actually 
sold – under sold to the state diamond trader by sixty 
million.   
 
And they also under sold the 5% locally by thirty-eight 
million.  There was a dispute with them all the time because 
they insisted it is done on carats and quantities and they are 
misreading the contract.   
 
And even the regulator agreed with us.  It should be on 
sales value.  And the excess as well because it is a statutory 
requirement that 10% gets sold.  It is on sales value.   
20 
 
So there was – so there was definitely – it was a means 
of selling poor quality diamonds to – locally.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Mr Torres, when you speak about the sixty 
million amount ...[intervenes]  
MR TORRES:   Yes? 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 96 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   ...that was the value of the under sales.  Over 
what period? 
MR TORRES:   We are talking about since that first 
appointment which was the beginning of 2015 right up to the 
time that we were appointed.  I think just before our 
appointment.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  And your appointment was in 2019.  So 
that would be over a period of four years? 
MR TORRES:   Ja, I think. 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m.  Yes.  And then you also, with regards to 
10 
beneficiation, you also had a problem. 
MR TORRES:   Yes, we had a problem.  That is the 5% that I 
am talking about.   
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m. 
MR TORRES:   5% should have been sold – there were two 
problems.  Firstly, the 5% was based on quantities and not 
on value.  It also was undervalued and under sold.  The 
second issues was that the 5% was sold to a related 
company which was Daniel Nathan, owned by one of the 
directors.   
20 
 
Now this is a conflict of interest.  And at times they sold 
it to another company called Gettys(?) [00:06:55] which was 
also in the same premises where they were situated.  And, 
ja.  So they did not see it as a problem but we saw it as a 
problem.   
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 97 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   Without a license, could they, in fact, be 
selling to anyone? 
MR TORRES:   You know, eventually – because they could 
not provide us with all the information of the bidders, the 
evaluation certificate.  They could not tell us how much was 
sold to which bidder.  There was a suspicion because we 
even confronted the CFO and we said:   
 
You verify the veracity of these documents and you 
made a payment, a commission payment to SSI.  Why are 
you not – now why are you so?  Why did you not get the – 
10 
why did you not ask for more information?  Supporting 
documents before you signed off and paid?   
 
According to him:  No, we sold - the SSI are the buyers 
of the diamonds.  I asked him then:  Did you read the 
agreement?  The agreement is explicit  It says SSI only 
facilitate the buy.  They should not be buying.  He said he 
never read the agreement.   
 
And that to me was also another problem because how 
are you CFO, you verify payments and you do not – and – 
because you are supposed to check the veracity.   
20 
 
Check if these people had been properly appointment, is 
there an agreement in place, what does the agreement say.  
So that was the problem. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you.  And what did you find in relation 
to the relationship?  I am moving to the next topic. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 98 of 223 
 
MR TORRES:   The relationship? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, the relationship between the marine 
contractors and the JV. 
MR 
TORRES:   There 
was 
a hostile and 
unfriendly 
relationship.  In fact, the first relationship had broken down.  
And according to executive management, they were upset 
because their concerns were raised in public.  They were not 
approached.   
 
However, the contractors met with the executive team a 
number of times, raised their concerns to them.  It was 
10 
ignored.  And as a last resort, they then went public.   
 
And there are certain concerns that they raised which we 
investigated.  For example, they raised a concern that the 
processing, the gravel – the Diamond Gravel Processing 
Plant was operating inefficiently.  And they were particularly 
worried about the security controls, you know, of the 
diamond 
gravel 
because 
there 
are 
various 
stages 
of 
extraction as used in the plant.  We did a physical walk 
through the plant.   
 
And the first stages, what they call Density Media 
20 
Separation.  Diamonds are supposed to be one of the 
heaviest minerals.  So they use a dense – this separate the 
heavier diamond – the heavier material from the lighter 
material.   
 
Now the complaint, that they were not allowed to use 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 99 of 223 
 
their own traces, density traces.  The density traces would 
then cast the density.  We then approached and asked the 
operations manager why are they now allowed to use the 
traces.   
 
According to the operations manager, who was Jerome 
Cloete at that stage, there is no guarantee that the traces 
had been tested.  This was his excuse.  And we found it was 
not acceptable because a certificate you could do.  You can 
always ask the contractor to give a certificate that the tracer 
has been tested.  And that is what we told him.   
10 
 
And then the second point on the tracers was that, they 
were not told the number of traces that gets put into the 
separate piles, and this was an issue for them, because then 
you do not know what is happening.   
 
Now according to Jerome:  No, the contractors are lying.  
We have got records showing that they acknowledge how 
many traces are placed in that heaps and how many traces 
are taking out of the heaps. 
 
We then asked for the records, showing that the 
contractors had signed.  They could not provide us with the 
20 
records.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay. 
MR TORRES:   So we found the complaint and the issue 
raised on the traces was a valid one.  And then there was 
also the issue of the security control issue in transporting 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 100 of 223 
 
the diamond heaps from the X-ray room to the, what they call 
the Glove Compartment.  This is a glass, sort of a container.   
 
And because they use the container that is like – it is a 
metal milk-like container.  It looks like old metal container.  
They use that to transport the gravel, the diamond gravels 
and that is secure.   
 
However, because of insufficient numbers of containers, 
they then use a set-like bag.  Then the contractors were very 
unhappy with it because the set-like bag was of a poor 
quality and you could make a hole in this set-like bag and 
10 
actually remove diamond gravel and then close the hole as 
well.  So they were very unhappy.   
 
Again we questioned the operations manager about this.  
He admitted that they do use the set-like bag and they do 
not have sufficient containers. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.   
MR TORRES:   So this was an issue.  And then the other 
issues that they had were the reclamation of the tailings.  
Now the tailings are essentially your residue.  It is like your 
mine dumps that you have in Johannesburg.  It is a residue.  
20 
So it is a dump that they have.   
 
Now the special extraction process that they use to 
retrieve diamonds from the dumps.  Now they complaint that 
they were not given – they needed to share.   
 
In terms of their contract.  It is called tailings, they need 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 101 of 223 
 
to share equally the proceeds derived from the tailings.  Now 
we then questioned the CEO about it.  The CEO said yes 
they do qualify to share in the table tailings but not the 
stockpile tailings. 
 
The agreement does not make a distinction between 
table tailings and stockpile tailings.  The agreement only 
says tailings.  That is all it says.  
 
So we found this questionable.  And also, we did not – it 
was not part of our brief to investigate the appointment of 
ABICOR that did the – that was doing the extraction of the 
10 
tailings. 
 
So there was also a complaint that they had been 
appointed to do this and that Carstens’ wife was a business 
partner of ABICOR. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And ABICOR is the company that were getting 
the balance of the tailings? 
MR TORRES:   No, no.  ABICOR was appointed to do the 
extraction of the diamonds in the tailings. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  So the tailings that were supposed to be 
shared? 
20 
MR TORRES:   Yes, correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  Thank you.  Now I will move you to the 
last issue that I am going to deal with and that is in relation 
to the Governance and Management issues. 
MR TORRES:   Okay. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 102 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   You are on page 131.   
MR TORRES:   Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now you found that of the board – of the 
committees of the board that were in place, there was a 
committee that was not authorised to be a committee that is 
part them and that is the Tender Committee.  Tell us what 
irregularities or what you are unhappy about in relation to 
the Tender Committee. 
MR TORRES:   The Tender Committee was a committee 
comprising board members.  It was a sub-committee of the 
10 
board.  Now the Unanimous Resolution stipulated the 
formation of certain sub-committees. 
 
Now 
the 
role 
of 
the 
board 
has 
an 
oversight 
responsibility.  They should not get involved in operational 
matters.   
 
The 
Tender 
Committee 
– 
the 
work 
of 
a 
Tender 
Committee.  What they did here was is similar to what a 
Adjudication Committee will do.  The board does not get 
involved in operational matters.   
 
So we have an issue with that, and there was a good 
20 
reason 
why 
it 
was 
not 
suggested 
in 
the 
Unanimous 
Resolution. 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m.  Okay.  Those are the questions that I 
have Chair for this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What you may have forgotten to do is, is 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 103 of 223 
 
to give Mr Torres the opportunity to give his background, his 
educational and professional background and experience. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Will you take care of that? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  Thank you.  Mr Torres, I only asked you 
if you were still an Executive Director at Kimode and I did 
not deal with that.  So can you tell us your experience 
...[intervenes]  
MR TORRES:   Okay Chair ...[intervenes]   
ADV SIBIYA:   ..and your qualifications? 
10 
MR TORRES:   I have got a BCom Honours Degree in 
Auditing, X in Accounting.  I have also done my articles with 
what was then in the 80’s known as Peat Marwick, now 
known as KPMG.  I am a registered accountant with CIPA.  I 
am also a certified Board Examiner with the international 
body and the local body.   
 
I 
have 
almost 
40-years’ 
experience 
in 
financial 
management, external auditing, forensic accounting, due 
diligence investigations.  I have done and conducted audit...  
Well, when I was in the private sector, I did audits on the 
20 
banks.   
 
In the public sector, clients included the Reserve Bank 
of Ponzi schemes that we did.  We also did the first FICA 
Audit of the four piping(?) banks.  National Treasury was one 
of our big clients as well.   
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 104 of 223 
 
 
And then we have done across the public spectre.  We 
have 
done 
state 
entities, 
provincial 
departments, 
municipalities  And then...ja.   
 
And then my other experience is working as a Financial 
manager.  I have also sat on Audit Committees.  I served as 
Audit Chair as well.  So that is my background. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Thank you very much Mr Torres for 
coming to give evidence.  You may be asked to come back if 
we feel there is a need but thank you very much.  You are 
10 
now excused.  I do not think anybody wishes to do anything.  
So.  Ja, you are excused.  In the afternoon Ms Sibiya, who 
will you be calling? 
ADV SIBIYA:   I will be calling Mr Gavin Craythorne. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  We will take the lunch 
adjournment and we will resume at two o’clock.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you ready? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, thank you, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us …[intervenes] 
ADV SIBIYA:   Chair, if I may have leave to call my next 
witness who is Mr Gavin Craythorne. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your voice has gone down again.  You 
will have to raise your voice. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 105 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   My apologies, Chair.  I will do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat what you said.  Sorry, what 
is next? 
ADV SIBIYA:   The next witness is Mr Gavin Craythorne.  
Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it is as if I asked you to lower your 
voice more.  Come closer to the mic I think because it 
looks like your voice is naturally soft.  Okay? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Chair, my next witness that I will be calling 
is Mr Gavin Craythorne.  Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Please administer the 
oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
GAVIN JOHN CRAYTHORNE:   Gavin John Craythorne. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Yes. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give  
will be the truth the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth.  If so, please raise your right hand and say so help 
me God. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I do.  So help me God. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 106 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  You may be seated, Mr 
Craythorne.  Yes proceed, Ms Sibiya. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Craythorne, firstly, 
thank you very much for availing yourself and thank you for 
approaching the Commission when you discovered there 
were some things that were happening that should not be 
happening.  It takes a brave person to do that and we 
thank you for that. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Thank you very much, Chairperson, it 
is an honour to be here today, I hope do not disappoint 
10 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good, thank you for coming to give 
evidence, Mr Craythorne. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   My pleasure. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Mr Craythorne, before we even qualify you 
and tell the Chairperson who you are and what you do, just 
tell me very briefly what it was that made you come to the 
Commission. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I a founding member …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you not want to – I am sorry, Ms 
20 
Sibiya, do you not want to get the procedural matters out 
of the way, get us to admit his affidavit first? 
ADV SIBIYA:   The affidavit admitted, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then you can go into that. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you, Chair, I will do so.  Mr 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 107 of 223 
 
Craythorne, in front of you you should have a file that on 
the spine is written Mining Bundle 04A.  Do you have that?   
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Yes.  I do. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay, please turn in that bundle to just 
underneath the tab that says AFFI, A-f-f-i.  Are you there? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I am there. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay, thank you.  That is page 3. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   If you look on the left. Okay.   Do you 
confirm that this is an affidavit that you deposed to, that 
10 
these are your names at the top and at the bottom, that is 
your initial.  One of those is your initials. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I do. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And if I take you to page 95 of that same 
document. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Yes. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Is that your signature almost at the bottom? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is my signature. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let us clarify that.  There are two 
20 
signatures there.  The one above your name, is that your 
signature? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you.  And the signature that is right 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 108 of 223 
 
at the bottom? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That signature if of Captain Donna 
van Wyngaardt from Alexander Bay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Do you confirm that when you signed this 
document you signed it on the 17 July 2020 as stated there 
and in front of the captain? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I do. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And when you were signing this document 
did you swear the oath that this is the evidence – that this 
is your document and it is the truth? 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I did. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  Have you gone through this 
document recently? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I have.    
ADV SIBIYA:   Do you confirm now that the contents of this 
document are the truth? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   To be the best of my knowledge and 
to the best of my – it is true. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  And do you confirm that in addition 
to this document you submitted annexures that you refer to 
20 
in this document? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Yes. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And that those annexures appear from page 
96 of this bundle and carry on to the next bundle, bundle 
4B.  Do you confirm that those are documents that you 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 109 of 223 
 
submitted to the Commission together with your affidavit?  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Yes, I confirm that. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you.  Chair, if I may with your leave 
ask that the affidavit of Mr Gavin Craythorne that appears 
from page 3 to page 95 of bundle 4A and the annexures 
appearing from page 96 to the end of bundle 4B be 
accepted as EXHIBIT XX4? 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
The 
affidavit 
of 
Mr 
Gavin 
John 
Craythorne starting at page 3 of Mining bundle 04A 
together with its annexures will be admitted as EXHIBIT 
10 
XX4. 
AFFIDAVIT OF MR GAVIN JOHN CRAYTHORNE HANDED 
IN AS EXHIBIT XX4 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, you may then proceed. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  Mr Craythorne, I had asked you to tell 
us briefly what it was that made you come to the 
Commission. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Chairperson, I am a founding member 
of an organisation called the Equitable Access Campaign 
20 
and I am also a veteran diamond diver with 35 years of 
experience in the industry and the past 20 years I have 
been involved in diving diamonds and producing mining 
vessels for Alexkor.  I came to Alexkor in late 1998 when 
Alexkor 
first 
decided 
to 
outsource 
its 
diver 
mining 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 110 of 223 
 
operations and I went through the epic court as a diamond 
contractor for Alexkor.  I saw that in its entirety.   
I then went through the period when the deed of 
settlement was being finalised.  It was as if everything had 
come to a standstill and no real development could take 
place in Alexander Bay until the court case had been 
finalised.  So we were all looking forward with great 
expectations once the land claim had been concluded and, 
you know, people living in Alexander Bay and in the 
surrounding areas could get on with rebuilding Alexander 
10 
Bay into a world class marine mining centre.  That did not 
happen.   
You are going to hear today about the decline and 
the governance dissipation that has occurred over the past 
few years and as someone who has lived in Alexander Bay 
for 20 years and observed the steady and relentless 
decline in the standards of living, in the condition of the 
town, in the condition of the mine and knowing what was 
driving 
it 
and 
having 
already 
begun 
trying 
to 
raise 
awareness of these problems even before the Zondo 
20 
Commission 
was 
constituted, 
when 
President 
Cyril 
Ramaphosa became president that became the turning 
point in my difficult journey.   
And when the – when your Commission began I 
knew that there was a real chance to turn things around 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 111 of 223 
 
and I must say I feel today more than ever and again, I 
thank you for the opportunity to be here. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Mr Craythorne, you indicated that you are a 
member of EAC.  What is EAC?   
MR CRAYTHORNE:   The Equitable Access Campaign is an 
organisation that was founded in 2010 by a group of 
veteran diamond divers who had enough industry know-how 
to realise that the dramatic decline in our weather patterns 
was not something that could be ignored and that the 
revelations regarding climate change and so on were in 
10 
fact heralding a very, very difficult period ahead for our 
industry because our industry, which is focused on shallow 
water mining, depends heavily on the correct weather 
conditions. 
 
We work in a surf zone and the surf zone is a very 
dynamic zone, you cannot work there when the swell is in 
excess of about three to four foot without injuring yourself 
or just wasting your time under water so you need very, 
very specific calm weather conditions which decline from 
2000 at the turn of the millennium, we were averaging 
20 
about between 140 and 160 sea days to the worse year I 
think was in 2010.  I think it was around about 13 sea 
days. 
 
So it is a like your business being shut down for 
90% of the time compared to the availability that you have 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 112 of 223 
 
had and that you have been used to, you know, in the past.  
And with the pressure that climate change was bringing, it 
became very clear to the veteran diamond divers that the 
extremely inequitable structure of our industry would not 
be able to be supported with the new reality of climate 
change. 
 
Our industry is the only industry that I know of 
where you have an entire industry that is operated and run 
by professional people doing the actual mining but none of 
whom are actually owners of any mining right.  They have 
10 
access to the ocean to go and do what they love doing but 
it is done entirely at the whim of concession holders and 
that has always been a weapon that has been used against 
the small-scale miners to prevent any form of real industry 
consolidation 
and 
unification 
and 
any 
possibility 
of 
collective bargaining because every time that we try to 
organise ourselves it would always be sabotaged by 
underhand tactics and divide and rule tactics. 
 
So the EAC actually was prompted by the new 
legislation of which was based, if you read the preamble to 
20 
the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act, the 
entire Act is based on the principle and notion of equitable 
access which makes perfect sense to me but it does not 
seem to make sense to the concession owners who use 
their consolidated industry ownership to exercise brute 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 113 of 223 
 
force over contractors who, for the past ten years, I have 
been basically in a state of servitude because of the 
conditions and the commercial terms that I am forced to 
work under and all of my fellow diving contractors are in 
the same situation. 
 
So with the arrival of the changes, the fundamental 
changes are the use it or lose it principle.  We felt very 
confident that well, this is now going to herald a sea 
change, if you will excuse the pun, in our industry.  So, you 
know, a group of veterans, myself my good friend, who is 
10 
here today, who has been on this difficult journey with me, 
Mr George Nikolai, he has been diamond diver in Port 
Nolloth five years longer than I have.  He has been diving 
diamonds for 
40 years and he has got even more 
community activity or he is more of a community activist 
than I am. 
But it became clear to us that in order for us to get 
a better dispensation, a better relationship for our industry, 
we would have to rely heavily on the new legislation and 
that resulted in us in forming the Equitable Access 
20 
Campaign, we reached out to concession owners like De 
Beers, Trans Hex and the other Northern Cape concession 
owner Ms Ina Visser and we said to them listen, you guys 
are not anything with your concessions, you know, why do 
you not just, you know, give them back to DMR and let the 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 114 of 223 
 
small-scale marine miners do application to get them.   
That did not have much of an impact so we then 
approached parliament and we attended the hearings on 
the minding charter and we gave evidence to that effect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Sibiya, remember to lead the 
witness. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, Chair, thank you very much. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Okay, so …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   He may have a lot to say but you know 
the direction that you want to take him through. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   So it is difficult to say it all in a few 
words, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   But I hope that has been sufficient. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, that is fine.  Ms Sibiya 
knows what is in your statement fully and she will – 
through her questions she will direct you on the important 
issues. 
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I will focus on the issue now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Ms Sibiya? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you.  Mr Craythorne, so in a nutshell 
you are representing Equitable Access Campaign which is 
a group of other miners. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 115 of 223 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   That have been doing this work with you. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  Can you tell us about your 
qualifications and your experience and from there I need 
you to also explain how you started your engagements with 
Alexkor, briefly. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I matriculated in 1980, I went to the 
navy, I did my diver training in the navy to – what they 
refer to as a clearance diver 2.  After leaving the navy I 
10 
worked under the late Dr John Gurney who had a small 
operation in Doring Bay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Mr Craythorne, how long have you been 
diving? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have been diving diamonds since 
1985.  So I have got 35-odd years of diamond diving 
experience 20 of which have been as a contractor for 
Alexkor. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay, thank you.  What else do you do 
other than actually dive.  What else do you do that is 
20 
related to diving? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have always been fascinated by the 
possibilities that mechanising diver mining might have for 
the inshore as opposed to the offshore mining.  So I have 
been designing and building diamond mining systems 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 116 of 223 
 
starting off with very, very small cheap and nasty ski boats 
to, you know, much more advanced 50 foot vessels, to date 
I have built 40% of the diamond mining  vessels that have 
ever worked in the industry have been built by me. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And how were you introduced to Alexkor? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I was approached by the then 
production manager of the marine operations, Mr Theunis 
Swart, to build a 26 foot Butt Cat mining vessel for Alexkor, 
which I did, I believe it was in 1993 and flowing out of that 
I became interested in the affairs of Alexkor and the 
10 
possibilities because Alexkor does sit with the most 
exciting diamond licences that I know of anywhere in the 
world. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Do you still design and manufacture mining 
vessels? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   The last vessel that I built was for the 
late Dr John Gurney and his son, James Gurney.  They had 
approached me in 2013 already to buy a share in my 
business to build a vessel to bring into operation, Alexkor ’s 
operations, but we never made headway so I built it for 
20 
them and they took it to Trans Hex at De Punt and that was 
the last vessel.  That was 2013, I believe, that – the last 
time I built a mining vessel. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  Mr Craythorne, if I can take you to 
page 119 of the same bundle?  You will see that we are 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 117 of 223 
 
already in the middle of a document when we get to page 
119, so if we can first go – or keep your place in page 119 
and then just turn back to page 106.  Do you confirm this is 
your CV? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay and that the page on page 119 is part 
of your CV? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  Now if you look at that page, page 
119 and you look at the second vessel that is being 
10 
mentioned there.  I see the name Alexkor Limited.  What 
does that mean? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   This is a schedule of all the turn key 
mining vessels that I have built over the years and that is 
the DMV, which is the acronym for diamond mining vessel, 
Siya Delver 7(?) which was a 25 foot Butt Cat mining 
conversion that I had built under contract to Alexkor and I 
see it was 1993. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Do you still produce – how long after this 
did you continue producing vessels for Alexkor? 
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Well, it was at this time that Alexkor 
started becoming more focused on political matters and it 
had been the intention to develop a fleet of these vessels 
because they are very cost-effective in comparison to the 
vessels that Alexkor had been building for itself over many 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 118 of 223 
 
years.  Large steel vessels are not very cost-effective for 
working 
in 
very 
shallow 
water 
whereas 
small 
agile 
catamarans are much more effective, much more cost-
effective. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  Am I correct if I take you two pages 
before page 119.  Turn again to page 116. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Yes. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Am I correct that from page 116 up to page 
130 those are vessels that you built or had a hand in? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct and you will notice 
10 
that many of them are barges which have been exported to 
riverine mining jurisdictions like Angola, Congo, Sierra 
Leone and so on. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay, thank you very much.  Now when did 
your relationship with Alexkor change from being a service 
provider providing vessels to being a mining contractor? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Alexkor outsourced its operations for 
the first time in its history in late 1998 and when the 
notices went out for independent contractors to apply for 
contractors I did and I was successful and I began contract 
20 
mining operating a small 35 foot ski boat out of Alexander 
Bay Harbour in the last quarter of 1998. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay and has that relationship endured 
until now? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have been an active producer of 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 119 of 223 
 
diamonds for Alexkor except for a period… 
ADV SIBIYA:   Page 4. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Between 7 November 2017 to 19 
March 2019.  Those 16 months I believe it was  - were 
months during which my contract had been effectively 
cancelled and my access to the mine had been blocked. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay, thank you.  But you are back now 
working with Alexkor. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  From …[intervenes]  
ADV SIBIYA:   The PSJV or Alexkor. 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Ja.  Well, it is a PSJV.  I was an 
Alexkor contractor up until the inauguration of the PSJV in 
2012 and I to this day with the exception of those – with 
that interregnum I have been a contractor to the PSJV. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay and the other members of the EAC, 
are they also contractors to the PSJV? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct, the EAC members are 
all – have either – are or have been formerly contractors to 
Alexkor.  There are one or two members that have 
contracted on non-Alexkor concessions but they are – 
20 
probably one or two. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now who determines where you can mine? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That depends on the – who owns the 
licences.  The West Coast diamond area is divided up into 
a gird alphanumerically, running numerically north to south 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 120 of 223 
 
and alphabetically east to west.  Those concession blocks 
are approximately 40 kilometres long.  In the shallow 
waters they run a kilometre out from the beach and there 
you 
have 
the 
B 
concessions 
which 
run 
about 
five 
kilometres but where you work first of all depends on who 
you have a contract providing access to go and mine. 
ADV SIBIYA:   So in this case where the EAC is contracted 
to the PSJV is that what you are saying? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   All of the members of the PSJV, all 
have contracts with the Alexkor PSJV to mine on the 
10 
concession areas that they control and have ownership of. 
Now 
having 
first 
gained 
access 
through 
a 
commercial agreement where the concession owner, the 
second level of access is governed by a cadastral system 
using very basic GIS technology where you use a digital 
map dater and then you use area marking system that you 
can register where you would like to work and you may go 
and register areas and work them as long as they have not 
been registered previously and the standard area that we 
are allowed to mark as a 30 metre radius.   
20 
So, 
for 
instance, 
in Alexkor ’s 
1A 
concession, 
running from the Orange River mouth about 40 kilometres 
south, you have maybe about 40 contractors that have 
contracts with Alexkor and then they have three areas that 
they are allowed to mark along the coastline and you are 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 121 of 223 
 
also allowed to move those areas but you have to do it 
through a formal registration process done through the 
registry on the mine and the registry on the mine keeps 
track of where all the various contractors are working and 
to ensure that they are working in their registered blocks 
and to allow for cancellation and re-registration of these 
blocks. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay. Now tell me, when you mine in these 
areas, what is the timeframe that you are allowed to mine 
and when is it determined that you now need to bring your 
10 
whole – is there a time period that applies to when you can 
mine, when you cannot, what determines. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   We have what we call a weather 
window of opportunity so as I have explained diver based 
mining is highly dependent on calm weather conditions and 
more specifically calm sea conditions because you can 
have atmospheric conditions that are quite bad, but the 
sea conditions can still be quite good, so then it is more 
comfortable under water actually than being on the vessel, 
because the vessel is being blown around and making 
20 
breaking anchor and so on but it is weather dependant and 
also on capacity of the vessel if you are working. 
 
The amount of gravel that you have to produce 
generally to produce one carat of diamonds, my grades 
used to be in the order of 12 carats on a cube, that is a 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 122 of 223 
 
cubic metre of gravel.  The vessel that I operate can hold 
about 30 cubes and the density of marine gravel is about 
1.6 tons per cube, you are looking at roundabout 50 tons of 
gravel to produce a mere few grams of diamond.   
 
So when a vessel is full you have to come and 
offload or if the weather conditions are prohibitive then 
even before the vessel is fully loaded then you have to 
return to the harbour and offload what gravel you do have 
and sit on the moorings until the weather improves. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now if you can tell us about Scarlet Sky 
10 
Investments and your relationship with them, and bearing 
in mind that we have already heard the evidence of Mr 
Torre, so when did you start having a relationship with 
Scarlet Sky, do you have a relationship still? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   The relationship that I have with 
Scarlet Sky is a pending Kimberly High Court SLAPP suit 
which has still yet to be resolved, which they brought 
against me for defamation, but other than that I have had o 
relationship with Scarlet Sky, they have simply been 
brought into my life as a contractor through the decisions 
20 
and the ...[indistinct] that were highlighted earlier today, so 
the adversarial nature of my relationship with Scarlet Sky 
began in 2016 because the minute that Scarlet Sky was 
awarded the contract there was a lot of consternation 
amongst my fellow contractors at the time about the lack of 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 123 of 223 
 
transparency and the secrecy about who Scarlet Sky was, 
it was a strange name that nobody had heard before, no 
mention of diamonds anywhere in it, there was no track 
record. 
 
I myself at that time had, while still being a very 
active member of the equitable access campaign I had not 
been able to focus too much attention in the early years 
from 2015 on Scarlet Sky because I have been very 
involved in developing a piece of technology that is 
capable of being able to penetrate through the sediment 
10 
overburden.  The – besides the politics and the dissipation 
in governance the other factor that has prevented Alexkor 
and South Africa developing its marine mining – sorry Ms 
Sibiya – how did I get the relationship?  
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I beg your pardon sorry.    
ADV SIBIYA:   So you heard the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes you can intervene when the witness 
seems to take long to answer your question. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Okay, so in the initial stages I was 
20 
not 
involved 
too 
much 
with 
the 
kickback 
from 
the 
contractors over Scarlet Sky because I was devoting my 
attention 
and 
I 
had 
been 
travelling 
overseas 
going 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay, thank you, so you weren’t.  Thank 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 124 of 223 
 
you.   Now tell me in the chain of how the mines – how the 
diamonds go from the mine to the public tells us about that 
process, because you have told us where you can mine, 
you have told us what the – about the – you said the size, 
the cubic ...[intervenes]  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   The cube is the gravel ja. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, yes and all of those things, so tell us 
about that process from you now have this – you have a 
contract to mine for the PSJV, what happens from when 
you mine to where I buy my ring? 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Okay so as marine diamond mining 
contractors our job is to produce diamond bearing gravel 
off the seabed, we do that using specialised equipment, 
designed specifically for that.  We deliver the ore that we 
mine off the seabed to the harbour in Alexander Bay.  That 
bulk gravel is held for a period at the harbour, possibly a 
day or two before it gets transported inland to Alexkor ’s 
plant situated near the administration building. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Do I understand by the contractor, mining 
contractor transport it to the ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No the contractor delivers the gravel 
to the harbour and as soon as that gravel is offloaded from 
the vessel control over that gravel falls into the hands of 
Alexkor, or the PSJV in this case. 
 
So Alexkor PSJV then transport the bulk gravel to 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 125 of 223 
 
the plant.  When it arrives at the plant it will be put into a 
gravel pound which is fenced off, where there’s security 
access and it is usually the case that you don’t bring your 
gravel straight from the harbour and put it into the plant 
because there are other contractors that are ahead of you 
that are processing gravel so when you arrive at the plant 
you will stand in a queue, you might have to wait an hour 
or two but when your gravel is ready to be processed they 
will flush the system and then they will start what we call 
drawing your gravel out of a feed bin.  
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   Is that done in the presence of the 
contractor? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct, the contractors are 
called to the gravel pound when it is time to the fill the 
bins and it is the contractors working together with Alexkor 
PSJV personnel that use a front end loader to hoist the 
gravel up above the feed bins and then the contractors 
manually open up the bottom of the bulk bags to allow the 
gravel that has been placed in it while out at sea, because 
when we mine out at sea the gravel that gets kept on the 
20 
vessel to be processed is only a certain fraction of the full 
amount of material that comes off the seabed, maybe plus 
two millimetres minus 25 millimetres that gets retained and 
stored in those bulk bags, but at the plant those same bulk 
bags that get filled while you are out at sea then get 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 126 of 223 
 
emptied into the gravel bin. 
 
From the gravel bin the gravel then reports to the 
first phase of the recovery process and that is to reduce 
the bulk of the diamond bearing material. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay Mr Craythorne, I think you are 
possibly giving us too much detail, so what I need you to 
tell me are the steps that ...[intervenes]  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Before it gets to the ...[intervenes]  
ADV SIBIYA:   That are involved yes in the process. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Okay, so ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   And when you are explaining that part all of 
that you must just remember to tell me whether the 
contractor is there, the contractor is keeping an eye on 
what is going on, or who is doing what, but very high level 
Mr Craythorne, we don’t want to know about the separating 
and what falls out and ...[intervenes]  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Understood.   So when it arrives at 
the plant it goes through three primary – three distinct 
phases where eventually from perhaps 50 tons of gravel 
you will end up with maybe ten or fifteen carats, sometimes 
20 
you have a huge amount of diamonds from very little gravel 
and the converse is also true.  The grades are very erratic, 
but the time that the gravel is being processed inside the 
plant 
is 
controlled 
by 
PSJV 
personnel 
called 
plant 
operators.  In addition to the plant operators there are also 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 127 of 223 
 
outsourced 
security 
personnel 
and 
in-source 
security 
personnel 
that 
patrol 
the 
plant 
and 
as 
the 
gravel 
progresses through the plant the risk of theft grows greater 
because you start off with a large needle in a haystack, or 
sorry you start off with a needle in a very large haystack 
and that haystack gets progressively smaller and smaller 
and as the haystack gets smaller the risk of theft becomes 
greater, because it is easier to ...[intervenes]  
ADV SIBIYA:   Is the contractor there at that time? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   The contractor is not there all the 
10 
time, but the contractor is always at the final recovery 
where the diamonds are fed onto the – or the super 
concentrate, the remains ...[intervenes]  
ADV SIBIYA:   No Mr Craythorne don’t tell us about the 
super concentrates in that much detail. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That’s where the glove boxes are, ja. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, but you need to tell us that the 
diamonds gets from the harbour to this place for the 
purposes for example, I don’t want to be feeding you 
evidence ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Okay so ...[intervenes]  
ADV SIBIYA:   Meaning that we don’t need to know the 
actual process as if we are present when this is happening. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   So when ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   When it comes to matters that you know 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 128 of 223 
 
are not controversial you can lead on those, on matters 
which you know won’t be disputed by anybody, and I am 
sure the processes that you are talking about. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Thank you Chairperson.  So once the 
product has been recovered it then gets weighed in 
through a process control by Alexkor, it is a little register 
which is colloquially referred to as an inweegboekie.  The 
inweegboekie 
is 
a 
book 
which 
is 
countersigned 
the 
10 
contractor as well as the Alexkor PSJV representative 
where you record the quantity and the weight off the 
diamonds that have been recovered and generally stones 
over one carat are weighed and recorded also individually. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And then what happens when you have 
recorded the stones that have been recovered? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   At that point the diamonds are then 
put into safe custody and we are given a receipt out of the 
inweegboekie and unless you go to the sales that is the 
last that you see of your diamonds. 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:   What happens to the diamonds? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   The diamonds then are – they 
accumulative during what is referred to as a production 
cycle, so a production cycle is a period from when there is 
a production cut-off to enable the mine to reconcile its 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 129 of 223 
 
production for a period and prepare the production in that 
period for sale and when the next period starts, so 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SIBIYA:  So the diamonds are kept in whose custody?   
In PSJV’s custody during this period?  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   During this period while the diamonds 
are still on the mine it is kept in the PSJV’s safe custody. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And when the production cycle is finished? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   At the end of the production cycle 
they issue a close off notice to say to the contractors no 
10 
more production will be included in the upcoming sale 
beyond a certain date, so if they issue a cut-off date say 
for the end of January what usually happens is you have a 
flurry of processing taking place before the plant closes, 
but at the end of the day on January the 30 t h no more 
production will then be included for the upcoming sale. 
ADV SIBIYA:   So what happens to the diamonds at the 
end of the cycle, the diamonds that has been kept in the 
custody of the PSJV? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Those diamonds are then counted and 
20 
weighed and sieved, what they call – well you have two 
...[intervenes]   
ADV SIBIYA:  No, that’s too much detail.  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Okay, well at the close of the 
production cycle the diamonds are then transported p to 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 130 of 223 
 
Johannesburg for presentation to the State Diamond Trader 
and ...[intervenes]  
ADV SIBIYA:   Who, who transports the diamonds up to 
Johannesburg and who presents them to the State Diamond 
Trader? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I do not know who transports the 
diamonds from what we call the mine gate, it is the 
industry term, when your diamonds leave the mine you talk 
about the diamonds leave the mine gate and we don’t know 
who conducts that service or what form of transport is used 
10 
but the diamonds are transported to Johannesburg and 
then they are placed in a safe and secure area called Knox 
Vault in Johannesburg where Daniel Nathan has his 
premises, it is below the place Kuben Moodley has his 
safety deposit box.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay, we don’t know about all of that, 
whose custody is it given to? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It is given to Scarlet Sky. 
ADV SIBIYA:   So it is only given to Scarlet Sky when it 
arrives in Johannesburg? 
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is my understanding. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay and then that – so that is the level of 
the relationship that you have with Scarlet Sky.  What do 
they do with the diamonds that you have mined? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   The diamonds that the contractors 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 131 of 223 
 
such as myself mine are first ...[intervenes]  
ADV SIBIYA:   We are now just talking about Scarlet Sky 
and what do they do when they receive your diamonds? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   When they receive the diamonds they 
prepare them for viewing for the State Diamond Trader to 
select their 10% representative sample.  They select 5% 
for beneficiation and the balance, 85% then goes on 
auction at their premises, but I have never been to those 
auctions.  Some of my colleagues have been up to auctions 
but I have never been. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   And then you next hear when you get your 
money, is that when you next hear what has happened with 
your diamond? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Well a sale cycle, from the time that 
the diamonds leave the mine gate until the time that they 
have gone through prep for the auction and the payout is 
usually about two weeks, about a two week period from the 
time that your diamonds leave the mine till the time that 
you get paid out. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay, so you have said that your 
20 
relationship, you did not have any problems with SSI at the 
beginning? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I did not have any problem with SSI 
in the beginning and ...[intervenes]   
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay, and who determined the price at 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 132 of 223 
 
which your diamonds were being sold? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Well the diamonds are supposed to 
be valued on the mine for two reasons, number one is to 
insure the diamonds for their fair value, because if you do 
not analyse your diamond production you cannot attach a 
fair value to the diamonds, so you cannot just look at the 
size 
of 
a 
diamonds 
and 
the 
stone 
size 
frequency 
distribution, you have got to analyse the colour as well, 
you have got to look at the special stones. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, so who determines the value at which 
10 
your diamond are sold? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It is a lady by the name of Michelle 
Adams who is an employee of Alexkor who is involved in 
the management of the final stages of the diamond 
recovery process and then ...[intervenes]  
ADV SIBIYA:   So the value of – the price at which your 
diamond will be sold is determined by Ms Adams? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No she doesn’t determine the price at 
which ...[intervenes]  
ADV SIBIYA:   That is the question. 
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No she doesn’t determine the price at 
which it should be, at which it would be sold but she makes 
a very inaccurate assessment of what the value is in order 
for insurance purposes. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 133 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say inaccurate? 
MR 
CRAYTHORNE: 
 
 
Yes 
because 
any 
valuation 
Chairperson based solely on the size which is the one, the 
first of the four C’s, the carat weight, so if you pick up a 
rough diamond and it weighs four carats, you can pick up 
another diamond that also weighs four carats and simply 
because of the difference in the other three C’s, one stone 
could be worth 40 dollars and the other stone could be 
worth 40 000 dollars, so by simply conducting a valuation 
on the basis of stone size is a wasted exercise. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you say that she conducts effectively 
a useless exercise? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ms Sibiya? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you.  So you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think your question still stands.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ultimately when you sell, the price, 
that’s what she wants, who determines how much you will 
sell it for? 
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is determined – that is supposed 
to be determined by what we call price discovery. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Price? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Price discovery. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is that? 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 134 of 223 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Proper price discovery is where you 
have 
a 
competitive 
bidding 
process 
where 
buyers 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   An auction? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   An auction is a classic example of 
true price discovery but the auction has to be an honest 
auction.  If you have collusion then you are not going to 
have price discovery.  So if is an auction that is designed 
to allow for sharing of critical price information then you 
defeat the whole price discovery mechanism. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But there must be a basis upon which 
somebody who has relevant knowledge and expertise and 
experience should be able to say if you take this piece of 
diamond that person having analysed whatever analysis is 
required should be able to say if you go to sell it at an 
auction you should fetch not less than so much and maybe 
not more than so much, so therefore its price must be in 
the region of – somebody must be able to say that isn’t it? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   In a fair world that would be the case 
but for as long as I have been a contractor at Alexkor 
20 
contractors have never been allowed to critically analyse 
the value of their diamonds.  You have a brief look when 
you recover your diamonds but then it goes to the auction 
process, in the case Scarlet Sky, and previously it was an 
auction process conduct on SADIX, which is the South 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 135 of 223 
 
African Diamond Index, which Alexkor had been using, and 
in earlier years it was done on an exclusive purchase 
agreement where there was absolutely no price discovery.  
A subsidiary of De Beers would come and look at the 
diamonds, set a price and take the diamonds, so the 
history in the time that I have been a contractor for  
Alexkor the history of diamond pricing has been an 
extremely contentious issue, with the exception of the 
period between 2006 until 2011 where there was a 
reasonable period of price discovery.   You will always 
10 
have collusion at auctions, but you need to try and control 
it and put countermeasures in place to make it as difficult 
as possible. 
 
When the – in 2006 ...[intervenes]    
ADV SIBIYA:   I was going to say you seem to be wanting 
to drive us there ...[intervenes]  
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Okay but it is not as simple to say 
how does a diamond ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Sibiya continue.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, I don’t think you have actually told us 
20 
who determines. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   The buyers determine it.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay so it is the buyer that determines that.  
Does anyone set a benchmark that it must not be lower 
than this price?  
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 136 of 223 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Well that is where there is a big 
problem in the case of Scarlet Sky because the company 
that is conducting the auction is also the company that is 
doing the valuations, so if there is collusion taking place 
during auctions and the prices achieved on auction are 
extremely low there is no safety measure in place to 
prevent the sale of the diamonds, so your reserve price is 
extremely important, because if you have collusion and you 
have an honest reserve price you won’t have sales going 
through. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   So the reserve price is set by SSI? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   The reserve price has been set by 
SSI since late 2005.  For the period 2000 from about March 
to October ...[intervenes]  
ADV SIBIYA:   2005? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Sorry, 2015, I beg your pardon, there 
was another valuator that was valuing the diamonds, that 
valuator was dismissed by Mr Carstens and then the 
function of valuing our diamonds was then given to Scarlet 
Sky.  
20 
ADV SIBIYA:   So how do you as a miner know that your 
diamond is being under-valued or is being sold at the right 
price? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   You don’t know on a sale by sale 
basis.   Now ...[intervenes]  
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 137 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   This question is being asked because you 
have alleged in your affidavit that they are being sold for 
less than their value, so ... 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   So the – on a sale by sale basis it is 
very difficult to pinpoint because the type of production 
that you have can vary on a sale by sale basis. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Mr Craythorne okay you are telling me how 
it is difficult to ascertain.   I need you to tell me – you are 
saying on a sale by sale basis you cannot say that your 
diamond is being sold for a lower value. 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Ja. 
ADV SIBIYA:   So on what basis can you say that? 
MR 
CRAYTHORNE: 
 
 
Statistically, 
using 
statistical 
methods, using longitudinal studies, which is what I have 
done, is I have tracked Alexkor ’s pricing from 2000 using 
very basic statistical figures, I have used the price data 
that Alexkor provide with every sale.  I then created 
indexes for the various assortments of the mixed goods 
which are the diamonds below 6.8 carats.  Diamonds larger 
than 6.8 carats are not sold as mixed – what we refer to as 
20 
mixed goods, they are sold as individual diamonds and the 
pricing information relating to those individual diamonds is 
only disclosed to the person that actually mined the 
diamond, whereas in the case of the goods below 6.8 
carats there are 14 standard assortments into which all of 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 138 of 223 
 
the diamonds below 6.8 carats are sorted into using a 
standard sieving process, so you will have your five carat 
diamonds, your six carat diamonds, your four carat and so 
on, so ...[intervenes]  
ADV SIBIYA:   You said you created your own indices. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I created my own indices based on 
the information that is published for diamonds below 6.8 
carats.   I then benchmark that pricing data going all the 
way back to 2000, because there is NISCI index dated 
goes back to 2000 and I began really working at Alexkor 
10 
roundabout that time.  Dan Dale only arrived in 2000 and it 
was at that point that we started receiving brokers notes 
with the breakdown of what the prices are because the 
diamonds that if you are paid out pro rata on your 
contribution for each category. 
ADV SIBIYA:  So what do you put – you have now mentioned 
the Zimnisky Index what else do you use to compare and... 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  So – so what I have done is I have 
tabulated all of the pricing data over 20 years for each of the 
standard 14 assortments.  I have created indices for each of 
20 
those assortments which I then benchmarked with the 
Zimnisky Index.   
And what is important when you are analysing 
diamond prices is not the absolute price but the relative 
price because you do not – by looking at the absolute price 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 139 of 223 
 
you do not know if you got a good price or not.  You need to 
look at what the market is doing in that particular time and 
compare what your price was for similar goods at the same 
time.   
So starting in 2000 I compared the pricing behaviour 
of each of the 14 standard assortments of Alexkor diamonds 
against 
an 
internationally 
recognised 
index 
which 
demonstrated very, very clearly that from 2000 to 2006 there 
was rapidly increasing tracking error. 
 
Now tracking error is simply the difference by which 
10 
the asset that you are interested in is differing in relation to 
the market in which it is being sold. 
ADV SIBIYA:  So how much does not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Sibiya. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just remember to keep your eye on the 
relevance and importance. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of some of these things. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  In relation to what we are looking at. 
ADV SIBIYA:  We are digging Chair but that is where we 
going. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja just keep an eye on – on the real 
issues. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 140 of 223 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  So to… 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  To sum up then Chairperson the – the 
prices of Alexkor’s diamonds deteriorated dramatically in 
relation to the international benchmarks between the period 
2000 to 2006.   
 
When Alexkor went onto the open market from 2006 
to 
2011 
the 
prices 
performed 
much, 
much 
better 
– 
significantly so and from 2011… 
ADV SIBIYA:  Did they – did they then correlate with the 
10 
market in general? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Ja so when – when there – there was 
very little correlation in the first period from 2000 to 2006.  
There was a period or normalisation from 2006 until 2011 
and where prices were very closely correlated with what the 
market was doing and then subsequent to 2011 from 2012 
they have again worsened again dramatically. 
ADV SIBIYA:  What changed in 2012? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  In 2012 all of South Africa’s rough 
diamond prices suffered a massive drop.  The drop came 
20 
about as a result of a legislation that became effective in 
2011 it is Section 20A of the Diamond Act.  Up until the end 
of 2011 when rough diamonds were sold locally in South 
Africa licensed 
diamond 
buyers were 
allowed 
to 
visit 
auctions in Kimberley or in Johannesburg anywhere around 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 141 of 223 
 
the country with – in partnership with international buyers.   
 
What Section 20 did – what Section 20A did was it 
prohibited local licensed buyers from being accompanied by 
international buyers.  So that took out the international 
competitiveness out of South Africa’s local auction system. 
 
It caused such a lot of consternation in the market it 
resulted in a constitutional court case which was finalised I 
think in 20 – I do not want to quote the date but it did find it 
way all the way up to the constitutional court and it was 
based on the issues around Section 20A. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  Now you say in your affidavit on page 5 
that by 2013 in paragraph 14 you say: 
“By 2013 the Marine Diamond production of the PSJV traded 
on average at 30.2 % below the market.” 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct.  That is – that is a 
weighted average.  So it is – to make the analysis more 
manageable and for purposes of this submission I took the 
14 indexes that I created and fused them into one general 
index that taking into account the different weightings. 
 
Because 
different 
categories 
of 
diamonds 
have 
20 
different values and depending on the quantity that they 
make up of a production affects the overall average price.  
And based on that composite index by my calculation 
Alexkor’s prices were trading 30.2% below the market. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And what was the response of the EAC to this 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 142 of 223 
 
– to the fact that their diamonds that they were mining were 
trading 30% - 30.2%?  Was there a response by the EAC? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  No at this stage the EAC was not very 
active. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  In dealing with this matter. 
ADV SIBIYA:  So what was the response of the Joint 
Venture?  What did they do to counter what they saw as the 
fall in prices? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Well the PSJV like everybody is very 
10 
alarmed and their analysis of the situation was that there 
was a problem with the current service provider doing the 
marketing and sales called Diamond – Diamond Marketing 
Consultants and they – the technical committee of the PSJV 
made a recommendation to the board that the board rotate 
the then marketing and sales service provider to do a test. 
ADV SIBIYA:  How do you know this – those intimate details 
of what was happening inside the JV? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Well that – the contractors were 
informed by the PSJV that the PSJV was very unhappy with 
20 
the price performance under the then service provider and 
wanted to do a trial run using a new service provider.  So 
they brought in a company on a trial basis called Fusion 
Alternatives and for a period Fusion Alternatives then took 
over the function from the previous service provider. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 143 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:  And did the prices improve? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Not marketing.  In fact in some 
instances they actually deteriorated further. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And it was at that point that the PSJV 
advertised their tender that resulted in the award to SSI am I 
correct? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct and at – and at – in 
hindsight now that should be the point at which the PSJV 
should have realised that we were dealing with a problem 
totally unrelated to the marketing and sales.  The aetiology 
10 
of the problem there somewhere else. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That they pushed on ahead and got 
permission to launch a tender process to bring a permanent 
new marketing and sales service provider which culminated 
in the issuing of a tender in 2014 in October I believe. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay.  Now Mr Craythorne you go into a bit of 
detail in your affidavit regarding what you call irregular 
tender process followed in the appointment of Scarlet Sky.  
You have heard the evidence of Mr Torres before you.  Now 
20 
firstly just explain to the Chairperson how you came to have 
the detail that you have included in your affidavit because 
we understand that Mr Torres – his company was instructed 
by the Department to conduct an investigation.  So how do 
you – where you do get the authority to speak to these 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 144 of 223 
 
things?  How do you know these things that you are 
speaking about here? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Chairperson in – from 2016 to – from 
2015 when Scarlet Sky started marketing and selling our 
diamonds through 2016 the diamond prices got progressively 
worse.  It was generating a huge amount of anger amongst 
the members of the EAC.  My fellow EAC founding member 
Mr George Nikolai would regularly be stopped in the Main 
Street of Port Nolloth by angry members asking us when are 
we going to do something about the problem relating to 
10 
diamond prices.  And in 2017 I then did a very brief analysis 
which reflected the difference between the international 
prices and what we were getting and I then posted those 
prices at the entrance to the mine. 
 
That was at approximately four o’clock in the morning 
when I was actually on my way to go to sea.  I did not think it 
was a big deal.  Everybody knew that there was a problem so 
I thought well I was doing everybody a favour by just adding 
some you know analytical contribution to the consternation. 
 
That 
had 
some 
very 
immediate 
and 
severe 
20 
consequences.  The – the data that I put up was in the form 
of 
a 
curve 
– 
an 
index 
basically 
just 
comparing 
the 
performance of Alexkor’s diamond prices with the market.  
And there was security cameras filming this – this taking 
place.  The security unbeknown to me when – because we – 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 145 of 223 
 
I put the data up, went into the mine and went to sea and 
when I came back a day or two later there was a very angry 
letter from Mr Mervin Carstens saying that I was causing 
trouble by trying to generate anger amongst the contractors 
and our members for posting untrue information at the 
entrance to the mine.  And I was warned that I would be 
suspended if I continued to cause anger amongst the 
members when in actual fact it was the anger of the 
members that was driving me.  Not the other way around. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And then what was the outcome of that?  
10 
Because remember you were answering the question of how 
did you come to know about the irregular tender process? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I was warned to back off on the issue of 
the diamond prices which I did for a while but – because the 
problem just was getting so out of hand I started making 
further enquiries about who was – who were the individuals 
behind Scarlet Sky because nobody knew.  So I wrote to 
Regan Phillips and I requested information.  That information 
was denied and the situation escalated to the point where my 
contract – first of all my access into the mine was cancelled.  
20 
Shortly thereafter the contract upon which Ocean Diggers 
operates was also cancelled together with my fellow EAC 
colleagues and that – following that I then put a lot of effort 
into trying to get to the bottom of what was going on. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Because you had all the time? 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 146 of 223 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Because I had the time now.  So I – I 
started digging and I started collaborating with other people 
in the anti-state capture project you could call it.  And it was 
brought to my attention that the – one of the shareholders in 
Scarlet Sky was Mr Kuben Moodley.  And that was a point at 
which we realised what was going on.  And … 
ADV SIBIYA:  What did you know about Kuben Moodley? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Well he had been mentioned in the 
Public Protectors State of Capture Report and that was good 
enough for us to say well look there is a problem here.  So 
10 
his name popped up you know in AmaBhungane and Daily 
Maverick and all over the show. 
ADV SIBIYA:  In what context did his name pop up? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  In relation to the – there was – there 
was irregularities at the SABC.  There was irregularities in 
relation to Transnet and Eskom. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And how did he feature there? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  He featured as a close lieutenant of the 
Gupta family. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay. 
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  So with that knowledge in hand I then 
again confronted Mervin Carstens and said to him, listen you 
need to do something about this because this is why the 
diamond prices are so shocking.  And I wrote a very, very 
confrontational email but I felt it was the only thing that I 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 147 of 223 
 
could do at the time where I said straight out, listen you 
dealing with the state capture issue here.  You know and you 
need to suspend this contract immediately. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay.  Remember you are answering the 
question. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Okay how did I get the information? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Well what – what – far from being 
received you know with my efforts to help understand what 
was busy going on were met then with some threat from 
10 
Webber Wentzel on behalf of Mr Carstens where they 
threatened me with – with legal action if I did not refrain 
from – sorry I beg your pardon – ja it was Webber Wentzel.  I 
have had slap sheets.  And I – I refused to back down so I 
got hit with the slap suit and I found myself very quickly 
having to learn how to defend myself and that when I started 
looking even closer and closer and digging into what was 
going on.  I called certain questions to be asked in 
Parliament via Veronica Van Dyk about who these guys 
were?  What licences did they have?  And I had to very, very 
20 
quickly get to grips with the law because my life depended 
on it.  So I successfully defended myself against Webber 
Wentzel and Mervin Carstens only to one month later be hit 
with another slap suit from Mr Vikma Nqashu. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Mr Craythorne. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 148 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:  That is where I got that information – that is 
how I learnt.  I had to defend myself Chairperson and… 
ADV SIBIYA:  So where did you get the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you get some of the information from 
the court papers that were served on you? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  No my court papers? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or when you were being – defend 
yourself? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Ja when I defended myself I defended 
myself on the basis of you guys are acting illegally because 
10 
you – you do not have the licences and I confronted them. 
ADV SIBIYA:  But how did you know that they did not have 
the licence? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Because they were told then – because 
there are questions that are caused to be answered in 
Parliament admitted that they did not have the licence. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay.  Can I refer you to page 270 – 270?   
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Okay I am there. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Is this the question you are talking about 
because you mentioned now that you – you mentioned a Mr – 
20 
a Ms Van Dyk. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct ja.  So this is a question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is at page 200 and? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  270. 
CHAIRPERSON:  217? 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 149 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:  No 270. 
CHAIRPERSON:  270. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  Yes Chair.   
MR CRAYTHORNE:  This is the – this is the Parliamentary 
question which I caused Ms Veronica Van Dyk to ask in 
Parliament. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Question number 1267? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Did you ask all these questions or was there 
specific one that you were asking? 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I – I provided the questions to Ms Van 
Dyk and she processed these questions through Parliament 
through their processes.  And then the answer was provided 
and it is recorded here on page 272. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay so the first question that you caused to 
be asked was the question marked 1? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And you were questioning if there was a track 
record for Scarlet Sky Investments prior to them being 
appointed by Alexkor? 
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  What made you ask this question? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Because it was one of the minimum 
requirements 
or 
rather 
it 
was 
part 
of 
the 
tender 
specifications that had been issued when the PSJV sent out 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 150 of 223 
 
their RFP. 
ADV SIBIYA:  So you remembered this is 2018 that there 
had been this issue in 2014? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Well I looked back in the records to find 
what – what at the time that the tender was issued what the 
specifications were. 
ADV SIBIYA:  What put you in a position to question these 
things?  What were – what information were you armed with 
that led you to dig deeper and ask these kinds of questions?  
You have told us about your court case.  Was this after your 
10 
research?  What did you discover in your research that led 
you here? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Through – throughout the period from 
the time that my access into the mine was cancelled I began 
a rigorous process of discovery.  Trying to find out and that 
was an ongoing process right up until the time that I finished 
my affidavit for the Zondo Commission. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  So it has been – it has been a – it has 
been a process of discovery and the – the revelations that 
20 
have come about have been through process of ongoing 
research 
and 
requesting 
information, 
contacting 
the 
regulator to enquire whether Scarlet Sky in fact did have a 
licence and they informed me that Scarlet Sky did not have a 
licence.  So I was not only just relying on one source of 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 151 of 223 
 
information I was double checking it through the regulator as 
well.  So both the – both the regulator and Department of 
Public Enterprises confirmed that Scarlet Sky did not have 
the minimum requirement of licences. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Showing… 
ADV SIBIYA:  So let us go back to page 270. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:  So the question that was asked was whether 
Scarlet Sky Investments had a track record prior to its 
10 
appointment and the answer appears below – at the bottom 
of the page and the answer that they gave was that – that 
Alexkor gave was that the company had no track record until 
Mr Daniel Nathan with 20 years’ experience within the 
diamond industry was appointed as a director of SSI in 2014. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even that must be inaccurate because that 
is not the track – track record of the company that is the 
track record of an individual. 
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct and the dates – and he 
is – his directorship only became effective on the 4 
December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  So he was appointed in November. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 152 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  But the records that I accessed show 
that he actually only became effective as a director on the 4 
December even after the tender process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the fact of the matter is if you answer 
the question whether the company had a track record in this 
industry the answer is no. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The fact that at some stage an individual 
got involved in the company who had 20 years’ experience 
10 
does not give the company 20 years’ experience track 
record. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is how I looked at it. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And the next question was – question 2A why 
has no beneficiation for the community taken place since the 
appointment of the specified company by Alexkor and what 
are the details of how transferring the sale of diamonds to 
the company has impacted on the value return to Alexkor 
and the miners.  Why did you ask this question? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I asked this question because that was 
20 
one of their main selling points. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Whose main selling points? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Scarlet Sky.  Because when – you know 
we were as contractors raising major concerns about their 
poor performance in attaining fair diamond prices for us 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 153 of 223 
 
there was you know feedback from PSJV saying that you 
know they were doing a lot for the Richtersveldt community. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And the answer that they gave was that 
beneficiation is taking place in Houghton and has been 
taking place since 2015 and that SSI currently employs 
learners from the community. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct but as far as I am aware 
there had been no lasting – or there had – as far as I know 
there had been no qualified cutters or polishers that have 
emerged out of any of the commitments that Scarlet Sky 
10 
made to the Richtersveldt community. 
ADV SIBIYA:  They continued to say beneficiation contribute 
an additional 9% income to the pooling and sharing Joint 
Venture to income after the tender process. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Well whether the agreement with 
regards 
to 
beneficiation 
of 
diamonds 
was 
that 
the 
contractors would share in any upside and to my knowledge 
no contractors have shared in any upside of the diamonds 
that have been taken out of the production for beneficiation.  
So if there has been 9% that should have been shared in the 
20 
same ratio as the contractors contract to mine those 
diamonds stands.  So if a contractor has a 50% deal to mine 
a diamond for Alexkor and that diamond then goes for 
beneficiation you get paid out on a valuation price but 
whatever the upside it subsequent to polishing and the sale 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 154 of 223 
 
if there is a 9% additional value add that was supposed to 
have been shared 50% to the PSJV and 50% to the 
contractor after the beneficiator had taken his percentage. 
ADV SIBIYA:  The next question is on what basis was the 
company SSI again awarded the contract in November 2016?  
That is the first part of the question and then they continue 
with the next part of the question.  Now their response to the 
question posed on 3A on what basis was the company again 
awarded a contract in November 2016?  Their response is 
long but at the end of it is that it says – well let me start at 
10 
the top.  It says: 
“The process included the RFP which was 
advertised in the Government Tender Bulletin 
of 1 October 2014 as well as the Business 
Day of 2014.” 
Do you agree that was not for the 2016 tender? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  No that was – I beg your pardon that 
was for the previous tender. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  And then it continues 
“Seven companies expressed their interest in 
20 
RFP 03 of 2014 and submitted proposals.” 
Also in relation to the previous ones? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Ja because the – the convention – the 
numbering convention that you see in the RFP relates to the 
year – the 2014 indicates that that was a RFP from 2014. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 155 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes.  And then it continues and it says: 
“Gamera Advisory Services were appointed 
by the Alexkor PSJV board to evaluate the 
proposals received.” 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   
“The top three companies according to the 
evaluation scores were invited to present to 
the Alexkor PSJV board tender committee.” 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Correct. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   
“Following the presentation and assessment 
of the SSI bid proposal the Alexkor PSJV 
board was satisfied with the prices and 
proposals submitted by SSI.  The Alexkor 
PSJV board appointed SSI with effect from 1 
March 2018.” 
Is any of this correct in answer to the question of – on what 
basis was the company awarded a contract in November 
2016? 
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Not at all.  
ADV SIBIYA:  Why do you say that? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Well it does not make sense because 
they conflating the first tender process with the second 
tender process and they talk about a date being an effective 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 156 of 223 
 
date being the 1 March 2018 which it could not possibly have 
been. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Because the question is specific. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is 2016. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Ja. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes it is specific to 2018 to 2016 sorry.  So 
Alexkor did not answer this question? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  No. 
ADV SIBIYA:  The next part of the question is: 
10 
“Why is there no longer an independent 
valuator model included in the company’s 
contracts?” 
You can see their answer there in B. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Well… 
ADV SIBIYA:  And it says: 
“The 
independent 
valuator 
process 
was 
stopped 
after 
some 
of 
the 
contractors 
complained about beneficiation and it was 
decided 
that 
the 
diamonds 
selected 
for 
20 
beneficiation process will be paid based on 
the tender price.” 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Well, I do not know what to make of it 
because again it is seems to be conflating different issues.  
For instance, the original bid that Scarlet Sky made and the 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 157 of 223 
 
basis 
upon 
which 
they 
were 
provisionally 
awarded, 
successfully awarded the tender at the close of 2014, was an 
exclusive purchasing agreement akin to what was in place 
from 2000 to 2006... [dropping voice] 
 
And they had made it very clear, according to their 
expert opinion, in their bid documents that because of the 
introduction of Section 20A, auction processes would no 
longer be optimum solution achieving fair diamond prices 
and that Alexkor would need to consider their, what they 
refer to as a Proprietary Independent Evaluator Model.   
10 
 
So they were trying to resurrect the same arrangement 
that we had fought so hard against when De Beers buying 
Alexkor Diamonds.  And that bid which had cast dispersions 
on the tender system or the tendered documents. 
 
All of a sudden in January without any explanation, they 
do a flip-flop and changed their proposal from what they had 
initially proposed, which was, as what they referred to as 
their Proprietary Evaluation Model to the tender processes. 
 
So something happened over the holiday period resulting 
in a complete about-turn now which they then embraced the 
20 
same 
sales 
model 
which 
they 
had 
themselves 
cast 
suspicions on.  And then on top of it, won the tender.   
ADV SIBIYA:   And the next part of the question is.  Who 
made the decision?  Now I am not sure whether the decision 
– that is being referred to is the absence of an Independent 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 158 of 223 
 
Evaluator Model or whether the decision they are talking 
about is the award to SSI.. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It seems to me they have cannibalised 
some facts and mixed them up.  In a certain way it is true.  
They did abandon the Evaluator Model but they have 
abandoned it over December. 
 
And yet for the first year, there was still an Independent 
Evaluator.  So it seems to that even thought this company 
had agreed that tender was the way to go that at least for 
the first few sales that were conducted, they were done on 
10 
an evaluation basis, not on an auction basis.   
 
And at the point at which the Independent Evaluator then 
becomes redundant, he was dismissed.  So it is very 
confusing, actually.  And it is difficult to make head or tail of 
what was going on.  But it does not make sense and it 
certainly did not answer my question. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  Now I will move on to Question 4. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Yes. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Question 4 says:  Is the specialised company 
a licensed diamond trader?  Now who are we referring to 
20 
when we say the specified company? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Scarlet Sky, the company that won the 
contract. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  So is the specified company a licensed 
diamond trader and the premises licensed as a tender 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 159 of 223 
 
house?  The answer is contained in page 272. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   The answer that was given was that the 
diamond dealer license.  It was in a different company called 
Diamond Trading House.  Oh, sorry.  I beg your pardon.  
Called Daniel Nathan Trading  
ADV SIBIYA:   Where does it say SSI does not have a 
license Mr Craythorne? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Okay.  I am sorry.  Can I just read it? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Okay.  In terms of ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   That is why I referred you to the page. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Okay. 
“In terms of the South African Diamond and Precious 
Metals Regulator Prescripts, a license is issued to 
an individual diamond dealer or to a company, 
Diamond Trading House.  In this instance, Mr Daniel 
Nathan is the holder of the required diamond deal 
license.” 
ADV SIBIYA:   Did they say anything about the specified 
company? 
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Nothing.   
ADV SIBIYA:   So do they answer the question of whether 
SSI has a licence? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Is it true what they are saying in their answer 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 160 of 223 
 
that Mr Daniel Nathan is a holder of the required diamond 
deal license? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No, it is not true.  The license is held in 
a company called Daniel Nathan Trading CC.   
ADV SIBIYA:   So none of this part of the question – of the 
answer is true? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   With regard to the Diamond Trading 
House, I am not sure, regarding that license but certainly in 
the case of the diamond dealer license it is not true. 
ADV SIBIYA:   But Mr Craythorne, they do not say anything 
10 
about issuing of a Diamond Trading House license. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No, in their answer? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   They say. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   So I do not know if that answer is true 
because you have a diamond dealer license.  And in the 
premises that the diamond dealer conducts trading activities 
on, has to be licensed as well. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   So I am not – as far as I am aware, 
there is no license for that as well as far as Scarlet Sky 
goes. 
ADV SIBIYA:   You are conflating the issues Mr Craythorne. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Ja, let me ...[intervenes]  
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 161 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   But they do not say Nathan has or does not 
have a trading house.   
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   They are just telling us the fact of how 
licenses are issued. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   That is all they are telling us there.  Now I 
want to take you back to Question 3A because I now want to 
refer you to documentation.  So Question 3A is the one that 
was asking on what basis was the company again awarded 
10 
the contract in November 2016?  And the answer was 
contained on the next page on page 271.  Now you will note 
that it says when – it deals firstly with the wrong contract in 
that it deals with the process that was followed for the 2014 
tender process.  Correct? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Alright.  And then at the end it says the 
Alexkor Board appointed SSI with effect from 1 March 2018 
which is also incorrect.  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Probably. 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:   So they do not explain why the company was 
awarded another contract a year after it had been awarded a 
contract. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   They do not. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  Now just to complete that thought.  
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 162 of 223 
 
Can I refer you to Bundle 2?  So it is a different bundle all 
together. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have the bundle. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  Please turn to page 263.  Page 263. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is Mining Bundle of 2? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page? 
ADV SIBIYA:   263. 
CHAIRPERSON:   263. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Underneath the tab marked 3. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Page 263? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have it. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  This document is the agreement to 
market value and sell diamonds between Alexkor RMC PSJV 
and Scarlet Sky Investments 60 (Pty) Ltd.   
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now if we take this document and turn to 
page 268... 
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have it in front of me. 
ADV SIBIYA:   In Clause 4.1 it says: 
“This agreement shall commence on the signature 
date and shall continue enforce for a period of three 
years.” 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 163 of 223 
 
 
Do you see that? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I see that. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  And then we can turn to page 284 of 
the same bundle.   
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have it in front of me. 
ADV SIBIYA:   So we see in that page that the signature 
date is the 4t h of March 2015. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   So we know that this agreement started on 
the 4t h of March 2015. 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Appointing SSI to market and sell the 
diamonds for the PSJV. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now if I take you further in the same bundle 
to page 295. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have it in front of me. 
ADV SIBIYA:   This document is called The Agreement to 
Market Value Sell and Beneficiation of Diamonds between 
Alexkor and CJV and Scarlet Sky Investments 60 (Pty) Ltd.  
20 
Same parties, correct? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Same kind of contract, correct? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  Now I take you to page 300.   
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 164 of 223 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have it in front of me. 
ADV SIBIYA:   If we look towards the bottom of the page, 
you will see in bold number 4, Commencement and Duration.  
Do you see that? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I do. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now in 4.1 it says similarly: 
“This agreement shall commence on the signature 
date and shall continue enforced by a period of five 
years.” 
 
So the difference is that the previous one said it would 
10 
continue for three years.  This one says for five years.  But 
this contract also commences on signature date.  Correct? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  Now we go ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Did this one replace the 2015 one or did 
they run parallel to each other? 
ADV SIBIYA:   That is the answer we do not have 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Because it is the answer that was not given to 
20 
the parliamentary question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the second agreement, does it not say 
what its relationship is with the previous agreement? 
ADV SIBIYA:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay alright. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 165 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   And then on page 317... 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have it in front of me. 
ADV SIBIYA:   We can see that it is now says: 
“This 
agreement 
is 
signed 
on 
the 
6t h of October 2016.” 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And as we have already seen, it starts from 
signature date.  So this means that this contract started in 
October 2016 when previously they had signed with the 
same company in March 2015 for three years. 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   So clearly, the question related to the second 
contract.  The question in the parliament – the question in 
parliament that state:  On what basis was the company 
awarded the contract in November 2016?  So they are talking 
about the second contract? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Ms Sibiya ...[intervenes]  
ADV SIBIYA:   The date is ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The answer to my question is to be formed 
in Clause 30 of the second agreement.  It says: 
“This 
agreement 
supersedes 
any 
previous 
agreements between any of the parties in relation 
dealt with in this agreement.” 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 166 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the second agreement replaced the 
first agreement. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Replaced...  Yes, yes.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now the question that had been posed was:  
On what basis was the company again awarded a contract in 
November 2016?  We note that this is October 2016 but on a 
reading – do we know of any contracts that was awarded to 
SSI in November as opposed to the one in October 2016? 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No, they provided no clarity to my 
question that I posed via the parliamentary process.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  I think you misunderstood my 
question.  The question talks to November 2016 but we can 
see that this contract was signed in October 2016.  You 
posed the question to be asked.  Were you talking about this 
contract signed in October 2016 or were you talking about a 
different contract? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I was talking about the second contract 
which we had heard ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV SIBIYA:   This contract? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Ja.  We had heard that there had been 
a subsequent contract. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   So.  But that is all that we were told. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 167 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  So you assumed the time to be 
November 2016? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   2016, ja.  So my understanding was 
that there had been a contract initiated in 2015 which was 
supposed to run for three years.  Then we had heard via the 
grapevine that another contract had been issued in 2016.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   With no clarity as to – how that came 
about, was offered and that is why I asked the question via 
parliament. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   So do you agree that it is incorrect in page 
271, paragraph 3(a(v) where they say: 
“The Alexkor PSJV Board appointed SSI with effect 
from 1 March 2018.” 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I beg your pardon.  Can you just tell me 
that page number again?  271? 
ADV SIBIYA:   271, yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Okay, so ...[intervenes]  
ADV SIBIYA:   And the paragraph is 3(a)(v).  The V.   
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Are we still in Mining 02? 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:   Oh, my apologies. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Okay.   
ADV SIBIYA:   I have left it behind. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No worries. 
ADV SIBIYA:   We are back in Mining 04.  My apologies 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 168 of 223 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Has it not become clear that a substantial 
part of that answer does not – is not an answer to the 
question and in particularly about the basis on which the 
contract was awarded? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, Chair.  But there is also the issue of the 
date because ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   2018? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that is obvious, is it not? 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SIBIYA:   But the contract itself said, it is effective on 
signature and signature was in 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SIBIYA:   So everything that was answered here was 
not true. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you very much.  Now what else did you 
20 
find out about that was not correct in the appointment?  
Because you have not yet told us what you discovered was 
incorrect.  You have told us that you asked and discovered 
that SSI did not have a license through your questions that 
you caused to be asked in parliament. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 169 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you answer the question.  Can I 
just get this out of the way?  As far as the second contract is 
concerned.  That was not the subject of – that was not 
preceded by any competitive tender process, was it? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   As far as I am...  Chair, if I recall.  I 
remember seeing a copy of a request for a proposal but I 
cannot be sure on that because everything is so hazy, you 
know.  If it is difficult for me to track it.  But I do recall 
seeing something of a repeat ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   ...that but I cannot recall exactly where 
but it seems to me that to some degree there was some 
attempt to have an RFB. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Do you know what the answer is? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, Chair.  It is the one that Mr Torres was 
answering about when he said he asked the company 
secretary what rolled they played.  And the Company 
Secretary, Ms Reagan Phillips then said, although they were 
called a BEC, all they did was to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Where there was no evaluation? 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SIBIYA:   So that is the second contract.  So 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But did Ms Philips’ response to him reveal 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 170 of 223 
 
that there had been requests for proposals or not really? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Chair, we did not deal with that detail but it is 
part of the report of the Gobodo report that – which 
Mr Torres was testifying and it appears that there was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   But it seems to have been a foregone 
conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And he indicated that he does not know why 
there was a need for the second ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well you will just have to double 
check things to that report. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because it transpired while he was giving 
evidence that he was not asking some of the most obvious 
questions he should have asked. 
ADV SIBIYA:   No, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if he has reached certain conclusions, 
we have got to – or made certain findings – we have got to 
double check that those findings are sustainable. 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   But in as far as there having been a process, 
that is the one that had the minimum requirements and I 
referred us to the document that indicated the minimum 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 171 of 223 
 
requirements in the whole tender document that went out.  
So.  But I – we will double check ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so what I am saying is.  If they say 
there was no process, double check that that is factually 
true. 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what I want. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  Thank you.  Now can I take you back to 
the identified irregularities in relation to the appointment of 
Scarlet Sky that you referred to on page 6 of your affidavit?  
10 
Now I had asked, how did you get the detail?  Because the 
detail in the affidavit is:  “On the 21 s t of October, the process 
was initiated...” 
 
And then you go on to detail what happened in the 
Technical Committee and the tender advertisement and all 
those things.  So I had asked, how did you get this 
information of you to give it in this Commission as your 
evidence? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Chairperson, there was a – there is a 
lot of unhappiness from the Richtersveldt community over 
20 
the issue of Scarlet Sky and the diamond prices and the 
manner in which the tender was awarded.   
 
And that led to a complaint being made by the – an 
attorney acting for certain members in the Richtersveldt 
community 
because 
there 
are 
divisions 
within 
the 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 172 of 223 
 
Richtersveldt Community.  So this particular attorney was 
only acting on behalf of – on one instructions for one 
particular individual but it certainly ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you get that information from the 
attorney? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No, that information – I got it from a 
gentleman called Pieter de Wet who is a Richtersveldt 
member who also made a complaint to the – to – I think to 
DPE regarding the Scarlet Sky issue.   
 
That, 
flowing 
out 
of 
the 
complaint 
to 
the 
Public 
10 
Protector, 
an 
arrangement 
was 
– 
and 
there 
was 
an 
agreement between the parties, between Minister Lynne 
Brown, the Public Protector and that particular attorney that 
Alexkor’s own Audit and Risk Committee would do an 
investigation 
into 
the 
circumstances 
surrounding 
the 
appointment of Scarlet Sky.   
 
And as a result of that report, which I was given a copy 
of from Sam Saul, because he also blew the whistle to 
Amabhugane in the early days, and Sam and I have shared 
information.   
20 
 
So Sam, when he started doing queries into the whole 
Alexkor PSJV story and which led to him like an in-depth 
exposé on it, he was given a copy of this document which he 
passed onto me and this document derives a lot of the 
timelines and surrounding the appointment of SSI, when the 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 173 of 223 
 
need for a new marketing and sales service provider was 
identified and then the events that followed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Basically, that is part of where you got 
your information from? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Alright.  Thank you.  Now you say – you then 
go into detail the Technical Committee meeting of the PSJV 
which raised the concern regarding the manner in which 
diamond ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where are you now Ms Sibiya? 
ADV SIBIYA:   My apologies.  I am sure this time I have not 
left you in a different bundle.  On Bundle 4 on page 7. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  You may continue. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you.  I was reading from paragraph 25.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And then it says” 
“The committee advised that management request 
approval from the PSJV Board to appoint a new 
service provider on a basis to determine whether 
20 
there would be an improvement in pricing.” 
 
And then you highlight those that were present at the 
meeting.  Why? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Because those are the individuals that 
played 
key-roles 
in 
the 
appointment, 
the 
ultimate 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 174 of 223 
 
appointment of Scarlet Sky because they triggered the 
process that ultimately led to Scarlet Sky being awarded the 
contract.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  And then you say that at the time, 
Rafique Bagus chaired the joint board of the PSJV. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct.  And this information is 
drawn from the annual report, the Alexkor Annual Report. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  Now if we turn the page and move on to 
page 8... 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have it in front of me. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  In paragraph 30, you say that: 
“SSI 
sent 
and 
expression 
of 
interest 
on 
6 November 2014 on a letterhead that indicated the 
directors, were then Daniel Nathan and Kuben 
Moodley.” 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   You say this was wrong.  Why? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Sibiya, some of the matters have been 
covered by your previous witness. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And both of them might think their sources 
are the same.  It is just documentation.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Chair, he talks to a different aspect of 
irregularity that was not noted ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 175 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   ...in the evidence of the previous witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright, alright. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   The information that the Gobodo report 
refers to is based on the appointment date that when I did a 
company search, I worked on the effective date.  So while 
they were appointed on a date that Gobodo say, the 
appointment date is not the same as the effective date 
because they – as directors they get appointed internally in 
the company but the effective date as far as the registrar is 
10 
concerned, was on the 4t h of December which was even 
later, and I think that is relevant. 
ADV SIBIYA:   But you have gone ahead of me. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Oh, sorry. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Mr Craythorne, I was asking you why you say 
it was wrong for SSI on the 6t h of November to say that the 
directors were Daniel Nathan and Kuben Moodley?  So we 
are talking about the 6t h of November date. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   At that date, the company that they 
ended up with, was still sitting on the shelf, and they were 
20 
stand-in directors.  Moira... I think it is Moira... 
ADV SIBIYA:   So that is what is wrong? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is what is wrong, ja. 
ADV SIBIYA:   This was not true, in fact? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It is not true. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 176 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   H’m.  And then it says - and then we get to 
your point which is that... ...[indistinct – recording cut off] 
were – they became shareholders on the 20t h of November 
2014.  And then you say for – later on until the 4 t h of 
December - on paragraph 31.1: 
“Until the 4t h of December 2014, the date upon which 
Ms Moodley and Nathan officially became directors, 
SSI was the shelf company, and the day on which 
they became directors was 11-days after the official 
closing date of 24 November 2014.” 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   That was my point. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   And the evidence of Mr Torres was that 
there were directors then. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Which is incorrect. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Now you say it is incorrect.  Can I take 
you back to that bundle that we have put away, which is 
Bundle 2? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you do so.  We are at four o’clock.  
Let us talk about what is going to happen so that we are all 
on the same page.  I am still quite happy to continue. 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you have raised the issues of curfews 
and so on of which we may have to be aware. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What would you like me to do? 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 177 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   Chair, I believe we can continue until six if no 
one is objecting to that.  That would allow enough time for 
people, including my witness who is staying at a hotel, to get 
there at the right time.  And the Chair had asked me about 
the possibility of continuing on another day if by six we are 
not done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Chair, the witness is available to continue on 
Monday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay.  Mr Craythorne, you are quite 
10 
happy to – that we continue until six? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Counsel?  Mr Bham? 
ADV BHAM SC:   We are fine, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are fine? 
ADV BHAM SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you.  Let us take a ten 
minutes’ break now and then we will come back and 
continue.   
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think if we are going to continue on 
Monday we might not need to go on up to six, we might 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 178 of 223 
 
need to maybe take an hour from now, go up to quarter 
past five, so – because it appears that on Monday there 
will be some flexibility in terms of other witnesses.  There 
may be some – we should have enough time to finish his 
evidence first.  So we might not need to go up to six 
o’clock but if there was not much space on Monday then we 
would have to use every minute that we have this evening.  
So I think let us go up to quarter past five. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you.  I was referring us back to 
bundle 2, Mining 2.  If we can turn to page 286.  Okay, this 
is …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it quite hot inside here or is it just 
me? 
ADV SIBIYA:   It is, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think Mr Bham indicates it is hot.  
Maybe the technicians can switch on the aircon but they 
must just make sure it does not make too much noise.  Ja.  
Okay, alright. 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you, I will adjust my voice 
accordingly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not have a lot of hope that you will 
succeed. 
ADV SIBIYA:   I will try my best. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 179 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am willing to be proved wrong. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue in the meantime. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you, Chair.  Now, Mr Craythorne, this 
document that appears on page 286 is a company report on 
Scarlet Sky Investments 60, correct? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Did you source this document? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  Now I will take us – I would like us 
10 
to go to page 292.  If you look towards the bottom you will 
see where it is written in orange: 
“Company change history.” 
Correct? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And then if you go onto the next page, 293, 
and you will look at the third date from the top.  What is 
contained there? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Third from the top is the: 
“Director 
Daniel 
Martin 
Nathan 
details 
was 
20 
changed” 
And that was on the 4 February …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, sorry, just tell first what the third 
date from the top is? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   4 February. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 180 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is 4 February 2016, is that correct? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and then there is a column where it 
is 
written 
director/members/secretary/trust/both 
director 
and officer and then there is something written against 
that.  Just repeat what – tell me what it is? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It says: 
“Director/member/secretary/trust/both director and 
officer” 
Followed by: 
10 
“Director 
Daniel 
Mark 
Nathan, 
details 
was 
changed.” 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay, thank you.  Now if you go down, 
further down …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, what is the document?  What 
is the nature of that document?  What is the – what 
document is this?  It is a company report? 
ADV SIBIYA:   It is a company report on Scarlet Sky. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For Scarlet Sky Investments. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, sourced from that …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is a document issued by the same 
company. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, it is the document issued by 
LexisNexis, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 181 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you.  And then if you go further down 
back on page 293, Mr Craythorne. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Yes. 
ADV SIBIYA:   If you go further down – so you are on the 
third one and you go the 4 – the next one is the 4 
February, the one below that is the 12 August 2015.  The 
one below that is the 4 December 2014.  Can you read that 
one? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Again it says: 
“Director/member/secretary/trust/both director and 
10 
officer.” 
And then followed by: 
“Director, Daniel Mark Nathan was added.” 
ADV SIBIYA:   What does this mean? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   This means that his appointment only 
became effective on the 4 December 2014 and then we go 
below that and we see on the 4 December 2014 again 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am sorry, now that you have 
asked that question, let us go back to that date that we 
20 
have dealt with with regard to Mr Daniel Mark Nathan, 
there it is says his details were changed.  Do you know 
what that means? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I believe that could have been in 
relation to a shareholding change possibly.  I am not sure 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 182 of 223 
 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are not sure what it is. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I am not sure, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you.  So if you go to the second 
date, that is the 4 December 2014.   
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It has the same preamble followed by 
director Kubentheran Moodley was added. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And what does that mean again? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That means that his directorship only 
10 
became effective as of the 4 December 2014. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now we already know that the tender closed 
on – they submitted their tender in November 2014.  Were 
they directors when they submitted the tender on behalf of 
SSI as directors? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No, they were not. 
ADV SIBIYA:   So should they have been appointed just on 
that point alone? 
MR 
CRAYTHORNE: 
 
 
No 
because 
this 
is 
a 
false 
representation, they represented themselves as being 
20 
directors of a company that was bidding when it is not true. 
ADV SIBIYA:   So if we go back to that other statement in 
that other document where they said in answer to the 
question did they have a proven record at the time and 
they said no, until Nathan joined them with his experience.  
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 183 of 223 
 
So the question was did SSI have the experience and the 
response was they did not have a track record until Daniel 
Nathan joined them.  Is that true?  And as at the time they 
submitted the tender was Daniel Nathan in fact part of 
SSI? 
MR 
CRAYTHORNE: 
 
 
His 
experience 
was 
of 
no 
consequence to SSI’s tender. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes because he was not even a director at 
the time.  So that is another reason, that is something else 
that you discovered was not correct. 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   True. 
ADV SIBIYA:   An irregularity.  This was talking to your 
paragraph 31.2 which is where we were on page 8 of your 
affidavit so these were …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you asking us to move back to the 
other bundle? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, Chair, the other bundle, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, just announce each time you move 
from one bundle to another so that we can move with you. 
ADV SIBIYA:   My apologies once again, Chair, for that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, we are going back to Mining 
bundle 4A. 
ADV SIBIYA:   4, yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you are at page? 
ADV SIBIYA:   8. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 184 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   So basically what you are saying, Mr 
Craythorne, in your paragraph 31.2, you say: 
“The date on which they became directors was 11 
days after the official closing date of 24 November 
for formal written proposals to be submitted in order 
to compete in the tender.” 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   So if a due diligence had been conducted, 
which we have heard in the evidence of Mr Torres that it 
10 
was not, it would have showed these things and SSI should 
not have been appointed. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now from the evidence that you have given 
it seems that these were things that were easy to find. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   What does it tell you, that these things were 
not highlighted and instead SSI went through the shortlist 
and the appointment. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  It tells me that it was a foregone 
20 
conclusion, a fait accompli.  
ADV SIBIYA:   And what did you make of that? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I made of that that it was classic 
state capture. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And this was because?   
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 185 of 223 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   This was because the modus 
operandi that was being followed here was a dead ringer 
for the other known examples of this behaviour. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Sorry, I did not hear the last part? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   And this was a classic example of 
other state capture projects that had already been revealed 
in the public domain. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And then in paragraph 32 – oh, before I go 
to paragraph 32, you have already said that Kuben 
Moodley had been linked with state capture. 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   According to your investigations.  Okay.  
Now in paragraph 32 of your affidavit you tell us about an 
investigation carried out in 2015 by the audit and risk 
committee of Alexkor as instructed by Minister Brown. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   In paragraph 32.6 you set out an extract 
from the ARC report.  What is the significance of this 
extract? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   May I just take some time to read it? 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay, maybe let me direct you correctly and 
not direct you to the extract first.  In the paragraph above 
that, 32.5, you say that: 
“At the final selection only three people sat on the 
panel at Alexkor ’s Rosebank, Johannesburg head 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 186 of 223 
 
office.” 
Now this is part of what was contained in the report, 
correct? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   So this is not your own information, this is 
what you got from the report. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And it says: 
“These were the people, Bagus, Duncan Korabie 
and Dr Roger Paul.” 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And you mention that Korabie awarded SSI 
a full 100% mark. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   According to the Gamiro report that is 
true.  I beg your pardon, no.  According – I think it is in the 
Gobodo report that I picked this up, the fact that a 100% - I 
am not sure if – I cannot recall if I picked it up in the ARC 
or in the Gobodo report. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Well, you picked it up in the ARC report 
because you say in paragraph 32: 
20 
“And investigation was carried out and ARC report 
to Brown revealed the following.” 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Okay.  You are quite right, I beg your 
pardon. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, the day has been long.  We 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 187 of 223 
 
understand, Mr Craythorne.  Now you say in paragraph 33 
that: 
“It appears that there was a significant lack of 
clarity about SSI’s proposal and what exactly SSI 
had committed to in terms of funding, pricing, 
beneficiation, etcetera, which resulted in a delay in 
finally awarding the tender to SSI.” 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct.  Dr Roger Paul had 
raised concerns regarding the commitment to community 
upliftment and the issue around the valuation and whether 
10 
or not that was an appropriate way of ensuring that Alexkor 
would achieve the best prices and – I do not recall of the 
concerns they had but there was a flurry of emails in late 
December whereby Mr Carstens was anxious to inform 
Scarlet Sky that they had been provisionally awarded 
winning the contract.   
There was hesitance on the part of Dr Roger Paul, I 
recall, but ultimately Mr Carstens was given permission to 
inform Daniel Nathan and Marc Chipkin who was – on 
correspondence that I have seen, he was the Chief 
20 
Operating Officer of SSI at the time that the tender was 
taking place and Mr Carstens informed that subject to him 
doing a due diligence in January they had been successful. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now you say in paragraph 37 – in fact in 
paragraph 37 you make a number of conclusions.  Are 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 188 of 223 
 
these your own conclusions or are these – are you quoting 
from a document? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   These are my own conclusions 
flowing out of information that I had gathered in my SLAPP 
suit defence. 
ADV SIBIYA:   So in paragraph 37.1 tell us what you say 
there. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:    
“Whereas SSI’s original proposal was to procure 
rough 
diamond 
production 
through 
an 
outright 
10 
purchase of production at a price determined by an 
independent valuer, SSI was permitted to change its 
bid proposal to the selling of rough diamonds 
through and auction process to the highest bidder.  
This favoured SSI and afforded it a competitive 
advantage over other bidders.  SSI was also 
permitted to include 1.5% handling fee by handling 
the rough diamonds.” 
ADV SIBIYA:   And then in paragraph 38 you say: 
“It seems self-evident that the outcome of that 
20 
process was a foregone conclusion.” 
As you have just testified. 
“And that the process itself was a mere sham put on 
by the PSJV management team headed by the CEO 
Carstens to try to create a façade of compliance 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 189 of 223 
 
with required procurement processes.” 
That is your own conclusion. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is my own conclusion, yes. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And then in paragraph 40 you say: 
“Having won the tender SSI went from being a 
dormant shelf company to suddenly appearing on 
the local Diamond Trading scene as the PSJV’s new 
marketing and sales service provider taking delivery 
of its first tranche of multi-million rand rough 
diamonds on 15 March 2015.” 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:    
“At its new offices located at 1 River Street, 
Houghton, Johannesburg.” 
That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, that is what I wanted to check, what 
did you want to highlight there? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   What I wanted to highlight there was 
the fact that a considerable amount of money had been 
spent in anticipation of winning this tender. 
ADV SIBIYA:   So the new office as created in anticipation. 
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Ja, ja. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Alright.  Now you say in paragraph 42: 
“As will be demonstrated below, the awarding of the 
tender to SSI and the subsequent renewal of its 
contract has contributed to the collapse of Alexkor 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 190 of 223 
 
and with it, the economies of Alexander Bay and 
Port Nolloth and RMC.” 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Is that part of the reason why you came 
here? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Absolutely. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now in the next section you detail the links 
between Scarlet Sky and the Guptas.  We know that some 
of this was not your own investigation and you mention that 
part of it was dealt with in the investigation by Peter 
10 
Bishop.  Can you talk to these findings, was any of what 
follows 
between 
paragraph 
43 
and 
48 
your 
own 
investigation or is this based on the investigation that you 
referred to? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   This is my own information, this – but 
I may have drawn on documents that were provided to me.  
But I do not see anything here that …[intervenes] 
ADV SIBIYA:   You did not find yourself? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Ja. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  Now in these paragraphs you 
20 
mention the links.  Can you tell us what the links are 
without necessarily repeating what is in the affidavit?  
These are the links between SSI and the Guptas as 
discovered by you. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 191 of 223 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Ja, when you look at the individuals 
that are involved with the outcome of SSI being inserted in 
Alexkor ’s diamond value chain, they are very well-known 
individuals in the public discourse around state capture. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Other than Moodley, who would you be 
talking about? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I have mentioned here Malusi Gigaba, 
Mosebenzi Zwane, Rafique Bagus, Mervyn Carstens, Kuben 
Moodley, Percy Khoza, Kellerman, Hantsi Matseke, Daniel 
Nathan, Selwyn Nathan, Marc Chipkin and Salim Essa. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  Now tell us, you say in paragraph 48.1 
that Malusi Gigaba was instrumental in the awarding of the 
tender.  Now we know that the tender was awarded in 
March 2015 and that Malusi Gigaba was no longer a 
Minister at the Department of Public Enterprises at that 
time so when you answer the question of why you say he 
was – he is the first person you list as having been 
instrumental in making sure the award was made to SSI. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   The name came first in mind because 
this is when the state capture project actually began with 
20 
the 
appointment 
of 
Malusi 
Gigaba 
and 
him 
gaining 
influence over the strategic future of Alexkor.  So in my 
mind he was involved, but I will concede that he was not 
directly 
involved 
but 
he 
was 
certainly 
laying 
the 
groundwork for what was to come later.  So I will concede 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 192 of 223 
 
that it is not correct to say that he was directly involved 
but he was certainly a pivotal player in the overall theme of 
state capture at Alexkor running from 2010 to where we are 
today. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes and in 2010 what happened? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   He became Minister of Public 
Enterprises. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Now sorry to take you back because I have 
taken you to paragraph 48 but I need you to go back to 
paragraph 44.  In paragraph 44 …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, just to make sure that the 
two of you are on the same page.  Mr Gigaba was 
appointed as Minister of Public Enterprises with effect from 
the 1 November 2010, he replaced Ms Barbara Hogan. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I think he remained Minister of 
Public Enterprises until 2014, after the general election. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if you look at the term or the period 
during which he was Minister of Public Enterprises, are 
20 
there any decisions that he made relating to Alexkor which 
you associate with him having played a role in the alleged 
state capture – alleged capture of Alexkor? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Yes, Chairman, because Malusi 
Gigaba or ex-minister Malusi Gigaba was instrumental in 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 193 of 223 
 
repurposing the board for the purpose of taking Alexkor 
ultimately out of diamond mining and into coal mining 
which I view to be an absolute strategic blunder of epic 
proportions and was one of the issues that I tried to deal 
with by confronting the Portfolio Committee in parliament 
over this strategic decision and I wrote a report to 
parliament trying to raise the alarm bells but ultimately all 
of my efforts to draw attention to how catastrophic it would 
be to take Alexkor, which had just resolved the Gordian 
knot of the land dispute, and was all set now to recover 
10 
and rebuild itself after that internecine fight, was now 
going to be misdirected into a misguided strategy around 
coal when it had no – absolutely no, in my view, strategic 
reason to want to go there, it had every reason to want to 
focus on the marine diamonds because there is a such an 
enormous future in marine mining on the West Coast of 
South Africa and you can see it in Namibia, Namibia has a 
flourishing marine mining industry.  They are investing 
trillions in building capacity and we sit with a moribund 
industry on the other side of the maritime boundary. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now you mention that you communicated 
with the Portfolio Committee in parliament to try and bring 
this issue to their attention.  Do you have copies of 
correspondence 
between 
yourself 
and 
the 
Portfolio 
Committee and are they here in the bundle? 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 194 of 223 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Volumes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, that is important because 
part of what the Commission is looking at is what was 
parliament doing about some of these matters. 
1. Which may have been in the public domain. 
2. Which may have been brought specifically to 
their attention by members of the public. 
So it is important to have that evidence to say here is the 
member of the public who brought these matters to the 
attention of parliament, what was parliament’s response, 
10 
did 
they 
acknowledge 
receipt, 
did 
they 
respond 
in 
substance, what did they do about it or were these pleas 
simply ignored? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   They were simply ignored. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you.  Ms Sibiya? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you.  I am trying to decide whether to 
continue the vein where the Chair as started or to finish 
the parts I was dealing with.  I think I will finish the part I 
was dealing with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:   And then continue in this vein. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you.  Mr Craythorne, I was referring 
you back to paragraph 44 on page 12. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Yes. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 195 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   Where you say – where you set out the 
group structure that was submitted with the proposal for 
the first tender by SSI.  Now at this time 60% of the shares 
were owned by a company represented by Moodley and 
40% was owned by DMT represented by Daniel Nathan. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay.  And then in paragraph 45 you tell us 
about the current shareholding.  Now who told you about 
this current shareholding? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   This current shareholding I am not 
10 
sure it could have come from – I have to refresh my mind 
because I have drawn on so many resources, I think it 
could have come from the Commission’s investigators or 
Mr Henk Smith, I honestly, I cannot remember offhand.  
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay, and it says – because I want to know 
whose opinion is this reflected in paragraph 45.3, because 
in paragraph 45 you then set out a different shareholding 
reflecting 30% owned by the Richtersveldt Community 
Trust, DNT still owning the 40% and then in 45.3 you say 
30% was owned by a black female who Daniel Nathan 
20 
informed a Democratic Alliance member of Parliament, 
Veronica van Dyk, when she visited the premises in 
December 2018 that this member, this black female is 
Reagan Phillips and then you say the company searches 
could not confirm this.

MR CRAYTHORNE:   That’s correct, Ms Veronica van Dyk 
her constituency is Namaqualand so it is not her portfolio, 
mining is not her portfolio but she has great affinity for the 
people of Namaqualand, she has seen the devastation left 
behind the terrestrial mining activities over the past 70 
years and she was introduced to me by a fellow female 
diamond diver, there are female diamond divers, who said 
that 
Ms 
van 
Dyk 
was 
quite 
passionate 
about 
the 
Richtersveldt and Namaqualand and wanted to learn more 
and that resulted in a friendship whereby she would help 
10 
me try and get answers which I was unable to get through 
any others means, by launching questions in Parliament, 
so there were a whole series over time of questions and 
one of the things that Veronica revealed to me was 
because of the questions that she was asking in Parliament 
she was approached by certain individuals, who I haven’t 
mentioned in my affidavit, so I won’t mention it here, who 
were concerned about the questions that she was asking in 
Parliament and assured her that she was effectively 
barking up the wrong tree, and there was no substance to 
20 
what myself and others were saying in the EOC  and 
invited her to go and attend the auctions. 
 
I have never attended an auction because there is 
no point in attending an auction without having access to 
data, it is pointless, so Veronica did go, Ms van Dyk did go 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 197 of 223 
 
an auction, met Mr Daniel Nathan and upon meeting Mr 
Daniel Nathan he informed, according to her, that the 
shareholding that had been relinquished by Kuben Moodley 
had subsequently been taken up by two individuals, one of 
whom was the Financial Accountant of Alexkor and the 
other was Company Secretary, Ms Reagan Phillips but that 
was – I only was told that by Veronica and I couldn’t 
confirm it in any way Chairperson. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay thank you.  Now I am taking you back 
to where you were – where you were explaining why you 
10 
say former Minister Gigaba was instrumental I awarding of 
the tender to SSI.  
 
If I may just refer you to paragraph 49 on the next 
page, page 13.  You start saying that at the time of the 
appointment of SSI Bagus was both the Chairman of 
Alexkor and of the RMC Alexkor Joint Venture and then you 
say he was appointed the Chairman of Alexkor by Gigaba 
in September 2012.  When Bagus was appointed all of the 
directors of the board of Alexkor resigned and six new 
directors were appointed.    
20 
 
What were you saying here? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   What I was saying here was that the 
Board had been reconstituted to fit his vision for Alexkor 
becoming a coal major. 
ADV SIBIYA:   When you say his vision who is the he that 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 198 of 223 
 
you are talking about? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is the vision which was 
announced by both Mr Gigaba as well as the Deputy 
Minister at the time and it was also given in his testimony 
in I think 2018 before Parliament on the Eskom inquiry he 
was asked by the Minister, by the Portfolio Committee 
Chairlady, I Ms Ngangu Gcabashe, about what he had done 
to advance emerging black miners and he repeated that he 
had 
intended 
to 
develop 
emerging 
back 
miners 
by 
redirecting Alexkor out of diamonds and into coal and into 
10 
partnering with emerging black coal miners to supply coal 
to Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it not strange to take a company 
that is based where Alexkor was based, where it had been 
dealing with the mining of diamonds and say it must now 
also direct its attention to coal mining in Mpumalanga? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Absolutely but the reasoning given 
was the PSJV and the fact that the PSJV had effectively 
sidelined Alexkor itself as a company because Alexkor will 
only have oversight, so in principle in some respects there 
20 
was nothing wrong with Alexkor looking for an alternative 
revenue stream, but there was something very wrong in 
doing it when it wasn’t budgeted or costed, so the money 
to support all of the activities that were taking place, all of 
the consultants that were being paid to pursue a coal exit 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 199 of 223 
 
strategy was coming from the efforts of myself and my 
fellow diamond divers. 
 
So while we were producing very profitably for the 
PSJV a lot of money, a significant amount of money was 
being invested in these coal mining ambitions and you 
could see Alexander Bay as a town deteriorating, you could 
see our operations and the support of our operations 
deteriorating and still the money kept on flowing and 
Parliament raised the issue in 2016 when I attended the 
Portfolio 
Committee 
briefing, 
because 
it 
had 
been 
10 
announced already in 2013 I think in the annual reports 
that Alexkor was going to start pursuing coal mining 
opportunities and various other opportunities beyond the 
Richtersveldt and my argument was it cannot be fair that 
enormous amounts of money are expended by Alexkor 
pursuing projects funded by people like myself that don’t 
have any intention of benefitting us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, Ms Sibiya? 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you.  According to your knowledge 
did Alexkor in fact even have the expertise to embark on 
20 
this new direction? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I don’t believe so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the resignation of the other board 
members to which you refer, of the Board members to 
which you refer in paragraph 49 I think when Mr Bagus was 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 200 of 223 
 
appointed do you know the circumstances under which they 
resigned, were they asked to resign, did they decide to 
resign on their own in protest to something or what was the 
position, or had their term come to an end, is that 
something you know, or is that something you don’t know?  
MR 
CRAYTHORNE: 
 
 
Chairperson 
at 
some 
point 
I 
remember tracking down Dr Di, Dr V Magen, I believe at 
the time that I got hold of her she was living on the West 
Coast, I think she had retired and I had a very long and 
cordial discussion with her trying to find out what was 
10 
going on, and I couldn’t get ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   A straight answers?    
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I couldn’t get a straight answer no.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay so at this stage all you are 
going to say is they resigned but what the reason was you 
are not sure. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you, in paragraph 50, five zero, you 
then link Mr Bagus to the board meeting of ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course Ms Sibiya it may be that when 
they 
resigned 
they 
would 
have 
furnished 
letters 
of 
resignation and those maybe on record within the company 
and maybe some of them would have stated the reasons so 
that can be checked, the reasons may be relevant, 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 201 of 223 
 
because in other SOD’s there has been evidence of certain 
people being pushed out of certain positions so that others 
would be appointed and then certain things happened after 
those appointments had to have happened, so it is 
important 
to 
check 
whether 
the 
reasons 
for 
the 
resignations may have anything to do with that. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Thank you Chair, we will follow up on that.  
In paragraph 50 Mr Craythorne you mention that Bagus 
attended the Alexkor Board meetings as well as those of 
the joint venture including those of the 23 r d January 2015 
10 
and 29 January 2015 where the decisions to support SSI 
were made. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That’s correct.    
ADV SIBIYA:   And then you say after the meeting of 23 
January 2015 Korabie resigned. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   This is the same Korabie that had scored a 
100, that had scored SSI 100? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Do we know why he resigned? 
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   In the Audit & Risk Committee report 
that was compiled for former Minister Lynn Brown, it was 
recorded in that report that Mr Korabie resigned around the 
time that the due diligence was not being done and Mr 
Korabie had raised quite a lot of objection to the award 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 202 of 223 
 
without a proper due diligence and further information was 
revealed to me by way of Mr Sam Sole from Amabhungane 
who shared the information that Alexkor had provided him 
in response to questions he had asked the PSJV Board in 
response to prompts from me as whistleblower and in the 
response that he had got and in the article that he wrote 
for Amabhungane, I beg your pardon, he mentioned that 
there – it was a burning issue for Korabie, which it clearly 
is because he awarded them 100% but then was extremely 
unhappy when they were appointed without their being a 
10 
due diligence. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you.   You carry on to speak about 
Carstens and you say he was appointed as the CEO in 
paragraph 52 on page 15, you say he was appointed as the 
CEO of the joint venture in August 2012 and then you 
mention in the next paragraph that the Audit & Risk 
Committee meetings were attended inter alia by Carstens, 
Dr Paul, Dr Briscoe who were present at the meeting of the 
15 t h of January where the decision to support SSI were 
made and that these are the same people that attended the 
20 
technical committee meetings, so you are linking again 
Carstens, as you indicated in paragraph 48, that these are 
the people that were instrumental in ensuring that the 
tender was awarded. 
 
Now you say there are Gupta associates linked to 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 203 of 223 
 
State Capture, why do you say Carstens is a Gupta 
associate linked to State Capture?  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Well because Carstens compromised 
himself so obviously in an effort to accommodate what a 
Gupta linked company was executing upon Alexkor, so his 
behaviour is the basis upon which I link him to the Guptas, 
because no rational person would have done that. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes, in the face of all the shortcomings with 
its SSI tender. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   And also the vicious response and 
10 
relentless victimisation that he inflicted upon myself and 
other 
contractors 
that 
tried 
to 
raise 
valid 
concerns 
regarding the Gupta links of this entity, he defended them 
viciously.   
ADV SIBIYA:   And we won’t forget that he indicated there 
had been a due diligence.   
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   No evidence existed and when in fact the 
Company Secretary said there hadn’t been. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:   You move on and you deal with Khoza, Mr 
Percy Khoza, you deal with him in paragraph 54 and you 
say he was appointed as the CEO of Alexkor and he was a 
mining executive with both diamond and coal experience, 
and then you make a – you draw a conclusion that he was 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 204 of 223 
 
hired in part to pursue Alexkor ’s diversification into coal 
approved by Gigaba.  Why do you say that? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Because he told me personally in a 
meeting in Cape Town during one of the Indabas, I forget 
which one, I forget which Mining Indaba it was, that I had 
met Mr Khoza and he had told me in the presence of a 
former Alexkor Chief Executive as well as a colleague of 
mine from the marine mining industry, that he had been 
brought on board to execute the coal strategy but he was 
going to resign from Alexkor. 
10 
ADV SIBIYA:   Okay then you go on and you deal with Mr 
Moodley, of whom you have already told us, and in 
paragraph 57 on page 15 at the top of page 15, you say 
that a number of media reports have linked Moodley to the 
Guptas and to the erstwhile Minister of Mineral Resources, 
Zwane, who is infamous for his involvement in the Vrede 
Dairy Project which paid for the Gupta wedding. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And you mention that you have noted that in 
the 
Commission 
witnesses 
have 
stated 
that 
Moodley 
20 
assisted Trillian Capital to loot Eskom and assisted the 
Gupta’s in acquiring Optimum Mine. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct, that flows out of the Public 
Protector ’s Report as well. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Mmm, and then you carry on, would you like 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 205 of 223 
 
to read the last line there? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:    
“It would appear that he has also assisted the 
Guptas in looting the diamond resources in the 
Richtersveldt 
for 
Daniel 
Nathan 
and 
other 
connected persons benefit.” 
ADV SIBIYA:   And then you move to Mr Essa.  Do you 
have 
personal 
information 
in 
relation 
to 
Essa’s 
involvement?  I note that you mention that much of this 
was discussed in Bishop’s affidavit, so that is why I don’t 
10 
want to go into it if you ...[intervenes]  
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Yes and also Essa’s links were also 
made public by if I recall the – or a key link in this was the 
Integrated Capital Management which had very strong links 
to Salim Essa but also had very strong links to Scarlet Sky 
because Marc Chipkin was in fact the Chief Operating 
Officer of Scarlet Sky at the time that it was punting for the 
tender, so the Chipkin, the Marc Chipkin links and the 
Trillian story in my mind positively link Mr Salim Essa to 
the SSI story. 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:   Mmm. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On a lighter note Mr Craythorne I wanted 
to say I see that you when you give an answer you look at 
the evidence leader and it is only when she doesn’t look at 
you that you look at me [laughing].    
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 206 of 223 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   I am learning.  I asked her 
...[indistinct] but she said that would be too obvious. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughing] let us continue. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Indeed Chair, I will draw no meaning from 
that at all, thank you Chair.   You carry on and you mention 
Kellerman, that is Zerina Kellerman. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes.  We have heard of Kellerman in the 
earlier evidence of Mr Torres. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   She was the Chief Legal Officer of 
10 
Alexkor at the time that SSI was being introduced.  I did 
not investigate or look much into Ms Kellerman, I know 
very little about what her links are further than the fact that 
she was subsequently appointed as an advisor I think to – 
as I record here Mazibenzi ...[indistinct – dropping voice[ 
but there is also some emails where she was copied in 
during the period so she was very much on board the 
process of bringing Scarlet Sky into Alexkor but I am not 
certain exactly what active role she was playing so it 
looked to me more like you know it doesn’t seem to me that 
20 
– I don’t have any evidence of – that I can say well she did 
exactly this or exactly that, but as the legal officer and with 
regard to her responsibilities for ensuring the governance 
she 
could 
have 
done 
much 
more 
to 
prevent 
these 
governance oversights taking place. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 207 of 223 
 
ADV SIBIYA:   You go on to mention Ms Hantsi Matseke. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   It was very clear yes to me as a 
marine miner how Ms Hantsi Matseke could become the 
Chairperson of Alexkor.  My investigations in the public 
domain revealed her links to the former Premier of the Free 
State, 
Secretary 
General 
Ace 
Magashule, 
and 
her 
relationship so there were certainly deep concerns for me 
when I discovered this because it just added to the weight 
of the State Capture theme that was developing. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And from the timeframe that you give in this 
10 
paragraph that she was the Chair of Alexkor from August 
2015 to October 2018, you already testified that the – no 
you did not – sorry I don’t want to put words in your mouth.  
Do you know if she was the Chairperson, well you say yes, 
I am sorry, I am confusing myself, you say she was also 
the Chair of the joint venture, so if you look at the 
timeframe of August 2015 to October 2018 she was the 
Chair at the time that the second award was made. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct and she was also the 
Chairperson of the Free State Development Corporation.  
20 
So it was a curious mix of credentials. 
ADV SIBIYA:   And then the last institution that you 
mention is Regiment Capital. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Well Regiment – a lot of what I have 
subsequently discovered about Regiments Capital has 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 208 of 223 
 
been through interaction with the Commission, but the 
individuals in Regiments Capital, in Trillian, Integrated 
Capital Management, it was a – seemed like there was a 
constellation of satellite entities revolving around Salim 
Essa’s office in Melrose Arch, even Scarlet Sky’s offices at 
the time the tender that the tender was placed it was right 
next door to Salim Essa, so in terms of connecting 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   How do you know that, is it because you 
physically go there, or how do you know that? 
10 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   No I have seen letterheads with the 
addresses of the various companies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   And you know information in the 
public domain, the Budlender Report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   And various other reports, they all 
talk about a Melrose Arch centre of gravity when it comes 
to State Capture. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well it is important because as you 
20 
may know there has been evidence in regard to Eskom. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Relating to Mr Essa meeting with certain 
Eskom officials at Melrose Arch in some offices there, so – 
but you say you base what you are saying on letterheads 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 209 of 223 
 
and information in the public domain? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:   On page 16 of the same bundle in 
paragraph 62  you make a submission that the buyers 
tender process and the involvement of the aforementioned 
Gupta linked individual are enough evidence to reasonably 
conclude that the insertion of SSI into the PSJV’s Diamond 
Value Chain was a Gupta sponsored State Capture project 
that followed the same modus operandi used by the Guptas 
10 
in the capture of other SOE’s. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:   Mmm.  And you carry on that there was not 
even a need for such a company to be appointed, for any 
company 
to 
be 
appointed 
in 
this 
role 
in 
the 
next 
paragraph? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Yes, I am going to read it and then 
follow it with perhaps some further explanation, is that in 
order?   
ADV SIBIYA:   Yes that is fine.  
20 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   Paragraph 63 reads as follows: 
“Indeed there was absolutely no need for any 
marketing 
or 
sales 
company 
to 
promote 
the 
diamonds recovered by PSJV.  Given the expert 
opinion of Charles Windham regarding the self-
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 210 of 223 
 
selling quality of Alexkor ’s diamonds, and example 
set by Zimbabwe State owned diamond company, 
who sell their own productions in Zimbabwe, I 
submit 
that 
international 
buyers 
will 
travel 
to 
Zimbabwe 
to 
buy 
Mirandi 
diamonds, 
they 
will 
certainly also travel to Alexander Bay to buy 
Alexander Bay’s diamonds, Alexkor ’s diamonds.” 
So Charles Windham is an internationally acclaimed expert 
on polished and rough diamonds.  His company for many 
years was the government diamond evaluator for the 
10 
Canadian Diamond Industry.   He was brought into contact 
with Alexkor around 1998 by the former or the Chairperson 
at the time who was Advocate Nona Gaza, because 
Advocate Gaza had deep concerns already then about what 
was taking place, and she went and visited Ma ...[word cut 
off] and did extensive research Chair and did extensive 
research on the diamond pipeline it is what we call it in the 
industry.  And – and as part of the process Mr Charles 
Windham submitted a report in 1998 to Alexkor making it 
very clear to Alexkor that by turning themselves into an 
20 
exclusive agreement with De Beers – at the time it was De 
Beers it was costing at least 23% of what could have been 
achieved through a process of proper price discovery.  And 
the – the report that Mr Windham authored even he as an 
expert based in London knew that there is no better address 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 211 of 223 
 
in terms of the [00:01:00] geology than the address that 
Alexander Bay has.  It has got the – what – in the mining 
industry they talk about a phenomenon called closeology so 
you have scientific geology but then you have closeology.  
So if you mining diamonds hand over fist like they are in 
Namibia you should be able to be mining diamonds hand 
over fist across an imaginary line in South Africa.  It is the 
same deposit.  So that is what closeology means and that is 
a point that already in 1998 somewhere as far removed from 
Alexander Bay as Mr Charles Windham was making.  So the 
10 
– regarding the quality of Alexkor’s diamonds he made it 
very clear that Alexkor does not need any marketing the 
diamonds are so well renowned people will come and buy 
them in Alexander Bay.  This whole story of marketing this 
and marketing that it is all nonsense.  It all opens up 
opportunity for state capture and for ravaging the value pipe 
– the value chain and the diamond pipeline. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you very much.  Chair this is the end of 
this line of questioning so I am looking at the time as 
agreed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we can stop now or we could go on 
for another fifteen minutes and stop at half past.  If that is 
fine with everybody I think it would be fine with everybody. 
Maybe let us do that. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you Chair. 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 212 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just take the next fifteen minutes then 
stop at half past. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:  The next section of your affidavit Mr 
Craythorne you deal with how there was also a breach of 
statutory provisions.  We are still on page 16.  You deal with 
the provisions of the Diamonds Act. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct.  By law you are not 
allowed to conduct licensed activities under the licence of 
10 
someone else.  So the – the activities of Scarlet Sky which 
were conducted on the strength of a licence held by Daniel 
Nathan Trading is – is not permitted.  It is unlawful. 
ADV SIBIYA:  So in addition to the other irregularities in 
relation to their appointment this was in fact unlawful for SSI 
to then having been appointed – do what it was appointed to 
do? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And then you explain in paragraph 70 on page 
17 paragraph 70 that there is even a prohibition on the 
20 
utilisation of unregistered premises as a trading house. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I am not sure what the situation is now 
but at the time there – the premises that Scarlet Sky was 
conducting the auctions was not registered as a tender – 
what they call a tender house.  So the premises themselves 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 213 of 223 
 
have to be licensed as does the entity that is managing and 
conducting and directing those activities on those premises. 
ADV SIBIYA:  And then you – you take us back to that 
question that we have already dealt with in Parliament and 
you draw a conclusion on page 18 at the top of page 18 
paragraph 73.1 and you say: 
“Although Daniel Nathan is a holder of a 
diamond 
dealer 
licence 
and 
a 
diamond 
trading house licence these licences were 
issued in the name of DNT and not SSI.” 
10 
What is the significance there? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  The significance of that is that it is 
irrelevant that he has a licence.  It is a requirement that the 
– the entity that is conducting the business and the premises 
upon which they are conducted has – that entity has to have 
the licence.  It has to be in that entity’s name.  It cannot – it 
is like the driver’s licence as Mr Torres said.  You cannot 
drive a car on someone else’s licence. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Okay.  Now we move to a different section of 
your affidavit and we deal on page 19 with a complaint 
20 
levelled by the mining contractors.  You start out by saying 
that the value has considerably diminished.  You have 
already told us how you calculated the value by producing 
your own indices and doing comparisons.  Now you are 
telling us that in October 2017 you wrote to the company 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 214 of 223 
 
secretary of the JV on behalf of the EAC’s members and who 
had – who had expressed their concern and anger about the 
ever decreasing values attributed to the diamonds produced 
by them.  Now was this after or before you posted the pricing 
on the outside of the mine – the plant? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  This was around the same time.  I 
cannot be certain whether it was before or after. 
ADV SIBIYA:  What was the gist of what you wrote to Ms 
Reagan – Ms Phillips? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  The gist was effectively that there was 
10 
no – well first of all there was a huge amount of discontent 
regarding the price performance but there was also a lot of 
consternation about the lack of information about what – who 
these people were and you know what was – what was the 
reason for this dramatic drop?  So my – the purpose of my 
letter to Ms Phillips was to say, look everybody is very 
unhappy about this situation.  Can we get together as the 
EAC representing the contractors and yourselves and can 
you start making some disclosures so that you know we can 
at least understand who it is that is behind this poor 
20 
performance and how it is that they came to be where they 
are?  And there – I also raised the concerns around the 
disappearance of our tailings which was also a burning 
issue.  I raised also concerns about the lack of disclosure in 
the annual reports.  Because it is vital for us and in fact any

user of an integrated report to have segment information.  
You need to understand if there is cross subsidisation of 
business units which are the business units that are 
performing well and which are the business units that are 
not?  And if you do not have segment reporting you have no 
way of understanding why it is that when you have a 
segment that you are a part of that is performing very well it 
is that the overall enterprise is going downhill. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Now you pointed out a number of things.  
What was the response that you received because to me this 
10 
sound like serious issues?  So what response did you 
receive? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  I can – can I read the response? 
ADV SIBIYA:  Huh-uh. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:   
“Dear Gavin your email 09 instant is noted.

and 
diamond 
pricing

Phillips." 
ADV SIBIYA:  Ja and after this you wrote another email 
which is then when you went into greater detail as you have 
just explained? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That is correct.  Actually it was the 
second letter that I went into the type of detail about what 
sort of transparency it is the contractors were seeking in 
order to gain some kind of understanding as to why their 
businesses were suffering as a result of such poor pricing 
performance.  And I – I note in my affidavit that I received no 
10 
response to that email. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Hm.  Instead what happened after that email 
in paragraph 85? 
MR 
CRAYTHORNE: 
 
After 
I 
raised 
serious 
concerns 
regarding the sharp decline in the prices of our diamonds my 
and several other miners’ contracts were cancelled. 
ADV SIBIYA:  So in the timeline how soon after these emails 
were your contracts cancelled? 
MR 
CRAYTHORNE: 
 
Well 
before 
the 
contracts 
were 
cancelled they were – they were actually cancelled by way of 
20 
non-renewal.  So we had been contractors with Alexkor for 
many, many years and the contracts would get renewed 
every three years or so and what happened in our instances 
the – the whistle blowers from the EAC did not have their 
contracts renewed but in my case because they felt that my 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 217 of 223 
 
behaviour was particularly egregious to them they actually 
blocked me personally.  So before they cancelled my 
company’s contract they knocked me out as the key person 
involved in running the business and blocked my access into 
the mine.  So that began what was to be the start of the 
decimation of my financial wellbeing.  Because that resulted 
in sixteen months of shut down without you know vessel 
insurance which I – to this day I cannot pay the insurance on 
my vessel.  This year I nearly lost my vessel twice.  Just 
before I came to the commission I struggled in a big storm 
10 
35 knot wind where the moorings broke and I had to go into 
the mine and myself and swim out to my vessel to save that 
vessel.  If that vessel is gone on the rocks that is the only 
thing my wife and my family have left and we cannot insure it 
because we – they are stealing our diamonds in the plant.  
So – it has been a tough journey to get here Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SIBIYA:  Mr Craythorne you say it was yours and 
several other miners’ contracts that were cancelled.  Were 
they also people that had been vocal against certain things 
20 
at the PSJV? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Yes but not very vocal.  Look I – I – 
over the four years from the time that I first blew the whistle 
in Parliament in November 2016 it was not as if we came out 
guns blazing.  It started off you know friendly request to – I 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 218 of 223 
 
wrote to the Alexkor board and I said look there are things 
that are going on in Alexander Bay which have serious 
implications for you as the 51% owner in this PSJV and with 
regard to your – your assets – your very valuable diamond 
assets that we need to know about.  And I gave an 
undertaking – I corresponded with Zukiswa Rantho who was 
then the chairperson of the Portfolio Committee.  She was 
very interested and we found out in a subsequent meetings 
that we had my colleague George and I that her son had 
been threatened in a street coming out of school.  Okay.  
10 
She told me and George that she had tried time and time 
again to arrange an oversight visit to Alexander Bay and 
every time she tried to arrange it the answer was no because 
it was too dangerous and the members of the Portfolio 
Committee safety could not be guaranteed.  The same 
allegations were made on record it is in the [00:15:37] by 
Honourable Cathy Labuschange where she stated in a 
Portfolio Committee that she was told to stay away from 
Alexkor and we need to find out who it is that was 
intimidating Zukiswa Rantho and Cathy Labuschange and 
20 
going out of their way to make sure that Alexkor or the 
Portfolio Committee could not do oversight of what was 
going on in Alexkor. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What reasons were you given for the 
cancelation of your contracts? 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 219 of 223 
 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  The breakdown of the trust relationship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What were you told was the factual basis 
for the conclusion that there was a breakdown in the trust 
relationship if this was clarified to you at all? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  There was not much detail given. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Did you ask – ask them to tell you 
what they were talking about? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Well we – one colleague in particular 
wrote to Ms Phillips.  I could understand why they were 
upset with me because I was going to the press, I was going 
10 
to the media but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  That had only come very late in the day.  
So there had been a build-up of tension of tension so what – 
what became apparent to me Chairperson as someone – a 
member of the public that is if you want to make – if you 
want to get people’s attention you have to put yourself in 
harm’s way.  They do not take you seriously.  I had to put 
myself in harm’s way and end up getting slap suited by 
Webber Wentzel and top advocates and then again getting 
20 
another slap suit again.  That destroyed my business.  It 
destroyed my sense of wellbeing.  It has had an immense 
impact but that is the kind of thing that you have to do before 
people actually start thinking well look why is this guy so 
crazy?  You know is he a lunatic or does he really have 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 220 of 223 
 
something that he has to be angry about? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  Or upset about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And of course sometimes what – what 
happens is that harm is visited upon you to – so as to deter 
others from following in your footsteps. 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  And that is why there is so much fear 
amongst the – that is why we do not have a support base.   
We do not have a power base because when – when Mr 
Wayne Cook very – when my – when I – when my access into 
10 
the mine was cancelled Wayne simply wrote a letter to 
Reagan Phillips saying look this is a bit heavy.  And you 
know she reacted very, very harshly to him and that resulted 
in him having his contract cancelled.  And they – when he 
asked for an explanation they said to him because you Mr 
Wayne Cook are supporting Mr Gavin Craythorne. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What do you think they would say in 
defending their decision to cancel your contracts?  What do 
you think they would put on the table?  Do you think they 
would have nothing factually other than to really talk about 
20 
what indeed happened?  Namely you were raising issues that 
they were uncomfortable with or do you think they would 
come up with some? 
MR CRAYTHORNE:  When – Chairperson when I first rang 
the bell in late November 2016 my concerns were not about 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 221 of 223 
 
the Gupta’s.  The – the Gupta emails had not surfaced yet.  
The whole state capture story had not really dawned on us 
as a country of what was going on.  I was more concerned 
with white monopoly capital state capture because I had read 
Santie Terblanche’s book Lost in Transformation and that 
woke me up to what apartheid was all about.  To what you 
know it is just you have the insiders and you have the 
outsiders.  So if you are on the outside it is tough and 
sometimes you can get on the inside but then you got to play 
the same game.  So the only indication that I got was when I 
10 
tried to point out to the Alexkor board who I met in 
Parliament listen the issues that you need to start paying 
attention to.  I told them that I believe that the PSJV had 
been captured by Transhex okay.  The entire PSJV top 
management is all Transhex executives and they are also 
part of – oh okay let me not go there for now Chairman.  But 
it was very clear to me what was going on and I tried to warn 
the Alexkor board that the narrative that there was no future 
diamond mining potential for Alexkor was a horrendous lie.  I 
In fact authored a report discussing the local geology – 
20 
historical production and why it was so important to start 
focussing on the marine.  And I initially got a very warm 
response from Zukiswa Ntlangula who was a board member 
of Alexkor at the time.  And when I met her in Parliament I 
had a very good discussion with her and I said to her, look I 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324 
 
Page 222 of 223 
 
will put together a report for you okay but I need your 
support.  All that happened was that she referred what I was 
saying to Mr Carstens and that resulted in a month later just 
before the mine closed I got called into meet and face 
Mervin Carstens and Ms Reagan Phillips who were livered 
because what I had done and they said listen I am going to 
lose my contract.  And I said straight to them and I said 
listen you know you betrayed us you know in terms of you 
know the Scarlet Sky issue and you know this Quesko [?] 
plan which had emerged and so on. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  We are – we have gone 
past half past five.  I think we must stop here unless there is 
a question which you think should not wait. 
ADV SIBIYA:  I have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Until Monday. 
ADV SIBIYA:  I have one question but I cannot guarantee 
how long Mr Craythorne will take in answering. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SIBIYA:  So we can stop here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let is wait.  Let it wait. 
20 
ADV SIBIYA:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we are going to stop at this time.  
Thank you to everybody for cooperation for us to work until  
now.  We will continue on Monday then at ten o’clock and we 
will deal with other issues connected with Monday on 
08 JANUARY 2021 – DAY 324
