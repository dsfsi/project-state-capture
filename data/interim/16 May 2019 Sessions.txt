HEARING RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Mokoena, good morning everybody.  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are starting about five minutes late and I think 
yesterday too we were starting a few minutes later than we should have 
started and for all of that I am responsible.  We are going to try and do 
better.  Thank you.  Are you ready to proceed?  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  We are ready Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Mr Mahomedy before we move on to the 
10 
new topic yesterday I was reflecting on your evidence in relation to the 
acquisition of the locomotives and I think one of the aspects that w e 
did not touch on is the question of the pricing.  Can you give us a 
sense as to from the time when Transnet engaged CSR up until the time 
when we are now referring to in terms of the locomotives what was the 
price difference? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Mahomedy. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Transnet had acquired 
previously locomotives from various entities.  
20 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And as we provided 
testimony to the 95 locomotives that were provided or the agreement 
was signed somewhere in 2012 that was at a price of R28.2 million a 
locomotive.  The 100 locomotives which was in 2014 we paid R44 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 3 of 182 
 
million for those locomotives. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  In two years? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Within two years.  And the 
20 – in 2014 we also at the time then signed the contract for the 359 
which is part of the 1064 and that price is just over R50 million a 
locomotive.  So in a two year period one sees the price of lo co – this – 
a similar locomotive yes there are specification differences between the 
locomotive but the price has moved from R28 million to R50 million or 
just over R50 million a locomotive.  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes.  . 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Alright that is the – sorry 
that was the electric locomotive with China South Rail.  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now may I then refer you to page 
19 of your statement and we are just about to address a new topic on 
paragraph 5.6 which you have termed as t he interest rate swops which 
were prejudicial to Transnet.  But before doing that there are three if 
not four issues which I need to canvass with you so that we can be able 
to properly place your evidence in context.  The first one if you can 
explain to us what are these interest swops alright?  And the second 
one is that when one considering this interest swops what are the 
20 
factors that you might need to consider before you executive such an 
interest swop?  And thirdly if you can educate us about the disti nction 
between the floating interest rate and the fixed interest rate.  And then 
lastly if you are able to do so also share with us the advantages and 
the disadvantages of those two types of interest.  Obviously you will 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 4 of 182 
 
link them to the transactions that you are going to be adducing 
evidence upon.  Let us take them now in turn before we deal with the 
specifics, the interest swops what does that mean?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Thank you.  I think the – 
Chair the first thing is that we just need to reca p that Transnet went 
into a number of loan transactions as we explained yesterday.  We had 
the KFW Development Bank Loan which – out of Germany for R2.76 
billion and the EDC the Canada Exim together with Investec for R6.991 
billion. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Those two had direct 
relationships with the delivery of the Bombadier locomotives.  We then 
had the United States Exim Bank together with South African 
Institutions for R5.7 billion which was directly associated with t he 
General Electric locomotive contract.  We had the ZAR Club Loan which 
we spoke about R12 billion.  And then we had the China Development 
Bank facility which was for 1.5 billion dollars which was largely for the 
China South Rail and China North Rail loco motives.  The reason that is 
important is because as we go further in the discussions all of those 
particular loan transactions were what we call floating rates but we will 
20 
again discuss that.  I think we also need to take a step back.  Transnet 
as a business would require funding on a time basis depending on the 
activities, the capital expansion etcetera.  Traditionally we could either 
fund our business through the cash that we generate from within the 
business and its operations. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 5 of 182 
 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Or we would have to borrow 
money and that is done through financial institutions both locally and 
globally.  When one has to engage with financial institutions there are a 
few factors that you have to look at and it is n o different to an 
individual borrowing money for whether it is a home or a car where you 
look at first and foremost you look at what is the interest rate?  
Whether that is affordable to you so the company in this case when – 
what is the repayment terms? Wh at is the maturity period?  Any other 
fees that the lender is actually considering or will include and what are 
10 
the collateral and guarantees that the lender will be requiring?  Now 
when we look at all of that you will look at it you will then decide and 
assess whether this is a loan that you want to engage in.  One 
additional thing from an institution perspective like Transnet we will ask 
whether the rate is floating or fixed.  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  A floating rate is simply a 
variable rate.  Meaning that it has a link to an index.  Traditionally in 
institutions like Transnet it would have a link to what is called JIBAR, 
the Johannesburg Inter Bank Rate. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  In an individuals’ case it 
would be prime and it is either prime plus or prime minus.  It is a 
similar example.  So when we look at the floating rate as I said it would 
be linked to JIBAR.  It would say JIBAR plus a number of basis points 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 6 of 182 
 
or ex percentage.  And if JIBAR increases then your interest will 
increase.  If JIBAR decrease then you should see a decrease in your 
interest rate.  When we talk about a fixed rate it is essentially looking 
at the term of the agreement and then applying a rate of interest that  is 
not changeable over the period of this loan or the period of the 
agreement.  Now there is a few factors around a fixed rate.  The first is 
that if it is a long term loan that you have taken the fixed rate would 
ordinarily be higher than your floating r ate because the bank or the 
financial institution that is lending money on a fixed rate will have to 
factor in the risk of whether the rate is going to move in which direction 
10 
that rate is going to move.  And the longer the term the greater the risk 
to the bank because this is now based on a number of variables that 
could affect the interest rate.  In this case in all of the loans that we 
outlined earlier on Transnet engaged with the lenders on a floating rate 
basis.  Meaning these had all been linked to so me index.  Either JIBAR 
which is Johannesburg or LIBOR which is the London Inter Bank Rate.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And floating in this context floating interest rates 
means the same as like fluctuating interest rate?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So it would be linked to what 
happens to interest rates over a period of time.  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair what is also important 
is that these were loan agreements that were over  a period of time 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 7 of 182 
 
some of them going to up to fifteen years.   So they are long terms 
loans that are applicable to Transnet.  That is the basis of the 
transaction. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So what is a swop?  It is 
essentially where we enter into an arrangement with a financial 
institution and we then convert the floating rate to a swop – to a fixed 
rate.  Now it is done in a – in a different way in the sense that it does 
not affect the underlying loan transaction.  That l oan transaction 
remains for Transnet’s account but with the institution or what we then 
10 
call the counterparty we will then engage in a transaction which is a 
derivative instrument where the financial institution will essentially buy 
the floating rate and s ell us a fixed rate.  I hope I am explaining that 
clearly.  And using an example if we had a R100  000 loan which was at 
9% on an annual basis that would mean that you are to pay R9  000 
interest.  That is a floating rate.  And next year the rate goes to 10 then 
it is R10 000.  The financial institution would essentially say okay we 
will take the R9 000 risk but we will now charge you 12% fixed.  So you 
got no variability on the rate.  But you will now have a higher interest 
rate which means Transnet must pay  the financial institution R12 000 
20 
the financial institution pays us R9  000 at the end of the day it 
increases your interest bill by the R3 000.  Now it gets a little more 
complex when it comes to transactions the sizes of that we are talking 
about which is multibillion rand.  It goes into the cash flows etcetera 
but essentially Chair that is what it is.  
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 8 of 182 
 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It is a swop between the two 
rates.  De-risking for Transnet or a perception of de -risking for 
Transnet to say well you now have a fixed rate for twelve years – 
fifteen years in this case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course just as in the case of an individual having a 
loan with a financial institution the advantage of a fixed interest rate is 
that both parties have certainty as to what they are in for and that the 
financial institution is kind of protected in case the interest rates go 
down but also the individual is kind of protected in case the interest 
10 
rates go up. So they agree everyone is certain they c an plan – the 
individual can plan his or her financial – make financial plans knowing 
what exactly the – his or her obligations would be if it is a fluctuation 
interest rate when the interest rates go down as a borrower you are 
very happy. When they go up you are not happy.  Same considerations 
apply to an entity such as Transnet when it enters into these 
transactions? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Those are exactly some of 
20 
the considerations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  But one from a Trans – from 
a company – from a company perspective one has to look at the term of 
the loan as well and what the economists are saying in terms of 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 9 of 182 
 
whether that interest rate will actually incre ase over a period of time. 
Because if you fix it you have to look at what rate you fixing it at and 
whether that is making business sense.  And the reason that you are 
mandated to look at that from a fiduciary perspective is to ensure that 
you do not bring undue costs even though you correctly point out Chair 
it removes the – the uncertainty and gives you a fixed price number.  
The challenge is that if a rate that is quoted to you at a point in time 
interest rate, if that is deemed too high in the long term  then it costs 
you a lot more money.  And I think when we apply it to billions it 
translates into billions or rands that can be lost.  So it is a calculated 
10 
risk that a business should take.  And there is significant amount of 
calculations that have to go into determining whether that risk or 
whether the company has the appetite for that risk.  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you just whether it is a company or individual they 
must just do their homework. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before agreeing to a fixed term – fixed interest rate 
or a fluctuating interest rate or floating interest rate.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That is true Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes.   
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Realistically speaking the – 
to answer a question in terms of some of the advantages or possible 
advantages the loan really becomes advantageous to an institution 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 10 of 182 
 
when the interest rates begin to increase.  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Ja. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And if the interest rate stay 
very flat and you have taken a rate out at a much higher price then 
again as the Chair pointed out you will be sitting there with a loss 
position because you could have taken a loan at a much lower interest 
rate.  And I there is also a number of other considerations.  One of the 
key things is actually to understand the term as I said what is the 
forward view from the experts in the field in terms of what will happen 
to the interest rate?  That requires a number of – it has got a number of 
10 
variables whether we talk about the inflation in the country or we talk 
about key positions that are held, the elections, all of these things the 
political stance that people take and analysis that is done, all of that 
has an impact on the potential of what could happen to an interest rate 
whether it would be impacted positively or negatively.  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now against that background and 
clarity that you have now furnished to us may we then proceed to 
interrogate the relevant facts pertinent to this topic starting from 
paragraph 5.6.1?  Take us through.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair as I mentioned earlier 
20 
on all of the loans that we had undertaken as Transnet were executed 
on what is called the floating rate which essentially means they were 
linked to an index.  These were executed at a point in time.  The Club 
Loan by the way for which we paid Trillian the R93.5 million was 
between a number of parties ABSA, Nedbank, OMS and Future Growth 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 11 of 182 
 
and the Bank of China totalling R12 billion had two draw downs.  
Meaning that the R12 billion was not made available to Transnet in one 
cheque it was lent to Transnet in two tranches.  The first tranche was 
on the 1 December 2015.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I am interrupting you maybe I should have 
asked this yesterday.  Why is it called a club loan?  Are there multi 
parties to it? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair.  It is simply a 
syndicated loan with more than one party and therefore it was given 
this term. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So different financial institutions who are prepared to 
lend you money on maybe different terms, is that right?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but – but the agreement is the same?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The agreement is the same 
but it is held individually with those entities.  
CHAIRPERSON:  With – yes yes 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It does not necessarily mean 
that the terms and conditions are exactly the same.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  They would be similar. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  We would have gone out to 
the market and said we are looking for R12 billion and our term is 
fifteen years. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 12 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  You need to present a 
proposal that will be assessed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So the ZAR Club Loan was 
essentially a syndication of four institutions – five institutions in this 
case Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes you may then proceed.  You were 
saying – you had – still on paragraph 5.6.2. 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes so on the 1 December 
2015 of the R12 billion Club Loan there was a requirement that R4.5 
billion be lent to Transnet on the 1 December.  The balan ce of R7.5 
billion was to have been provided later on.  On the 3 December Chair 
the former head of treasury Mr Ramosebudi submits a memorandum to 
Mr Pita the then Group Chief Financial Officer recommending that the 
interest rate on the Club Loan be convert ed from floating to fixed. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Now before you proceed further with 
that. May I refer you to Folder number 23 Chair that is on page 454?  It 
is being marked as MSM23 and before you deal with your evidence any 
20 
further just as a high level you know high level interrogation of that 
document please you know to take us through it and the essence and 
why was it important in relation to the evidence that you adducing now?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think page 454 gives 
a perspective of the involvement of certain entities.  
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 13 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I was at 517 so…  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  454 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  454? 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  That is Folder number 23. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did you say anything Mr Mokoena about 33 – 
item? 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I thought – I went to divider 33. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  23, 23.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  454 is where I should be.  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let me just get there.  Okay I am there.  Thank 
you. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair it is the document that 
is titled ‘1064 timelines’. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  We have endeavoured to put 
together the entire perspective on the 1064 transaction.  And the 
20 
reason that it becomes quite important is for one to understand the role 
of certain entities in the entire process.  When we consider the 
procurement of 1064 it tends to get a very focussed attention around 
the procurement principles and it – around the potential issues around 
R38 to R54 billion.  And it is generally limited to that conversation.  
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 14 of 182 
 
However one has to look at the entire 1064 process commencing from 
July 2012 when the RFP was issued at which tim e the business case 
was not approved.  It was approved subsequent to that but the RFP was 
issued subject to the approval. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  We then have the locomotive 
advisory contract which we spoke about which initially was with the 
McKinsey consortium and then purported to have been ceded to 
Regiments.  That fee structure as we explained yesterday Chair moved 
significantly from R35.2 million and the beneficiary of that was largely 
10 
Regiments. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  To the tune of I think about 
R267 million.  Chair it did not stop there.  It then went further into the 
funding and the CDB loan of 1.5 billion dollars for which Regiments 
were paid 166 million success fee.  Then w e move to the ZAR Club 
Loan for which Trillian were paid R93.5 million which is including VAT 
so it was R82 million plus VAT.  And then we move into this 
conversation of the interest rate swops.  The interest rate swops are for 
the total of the loan implications of that or the loans that were 
20 
essentially swopped from floating to fixed total just over R23.3 billion.  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And Regiments as far as we 
have been able to ascertain were paid by the Transnet sec ond defined 
pension fund an amount just over R227 million for the execution of 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 15 of 182 
 
these swops.  We will explain all of this as we go through.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Just for the swops? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Correct Chair.  There were 
two swops and one swop was directly between Transnet and the TSDBF 
the Pension Fund and the other one was done with Nedbank as the 
counterparty.  Nedbank have confirmed subsequently that they have not 
paid any fees directly to Regiments.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am a lay person to these financial things but 
you have explained to me that an interest rate swop is basically 
converting from either fixed rate to a floating rate or from a floating 
10 
rate to a fixed rate.  That seems to suggest to me that there is not a lot 
of work that needs to be done obviously there may be a lot of 
homework to be done by somebody who must recommend whether a 
swop should happen or not and then the person must decide.  But I am 
just not sure – is there a lot of work involved to justify such a high 
amount of fee generally speaking? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair before we asked the 
question about the amount of work.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I think it is key to know that 
20 
the Transnet Treasury team had the capability to do this work.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The other thing that is also 
key is that the R227 million that was paid is what we call a present 
value. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 16 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Of all the fees that would 
have been – would have accrued to Regiments over a fifteen year 
period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It is a lot more in what we 
would call nominal terms but it was paid out of the pension fund on day 
1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMED Y:  So the pension fund lost 
10 
R227 million but essentially it was all relating to this transaction with 
Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So in the one case Chair as 
we understand with Nedbank, Nedbank would have done the work in 
terms of the pricing, in terms of all of the analysis and then provided 
Transnet with the calculation of the interest rate.  However that was 
done through Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  An intermediary. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  That we believe was not 
necessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Because the capability 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 17 of 182 
 
existed within Transnet to do this.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes the R227 million is quite 
significant Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Actually from the documents 
that we have reviewed through the pension fund it was worked out on 
both the swops.  The Nedbank swops what we call the Nedbank swops 
as well as the pension fund swops w here we had done a direct 
transaction. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So they essentially were I 
am not saying too specific swops but two groups of swops.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The first was a R12 billion 
loan the ZAR Club Loan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Which was at a floating rate 
which was then swopped to a fixed rate and that was executed by 
Nedbank in conjunction with Regiments.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  We have also learnt that 
Nedbank then essentially sold that swop forward to the pension fund.  
So ultimately from a Transnet perspective we have got a complicated 
transaction between Transnet, Nedbank and the Pension Fund. Then 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 18 of 182 
 
there was a second grouping of swaps  Chair which was an amount of 
about R11.3 billion – the loans totalling 11.3 billion – which was 
swapped directly with the Pension Fund.  Both – if you would like to 
call it the calculation of the commission for Regiments – I would use 
the word “commission” just to explain the concept – was calculated at 
20 bases points which is 0.2 percent of all of the cash flows over the 
15 year period and then present valued to today’s money at the time.  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Which was calculated at 
227.8 million – I think it was – which was paid out to Regiments from 
10 
the Pension Fund.  It was not paid out by Transnet but it was paid out 
from the Pension Fund.  The Pension Fund is currently in a process of 
litigation with Regiments for those Funds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But their fee – that is no Regiments - would have 
been – how much it was would have been in part if not solely influenced 
by the kinds of amounts that we are talking about like a commission.  
So the bigger the amounts that they are dealing with the bigger their 
fee because it is in the form of a commission.  Is that – that right? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it does not depend on how many hours they put 
20 
into the job and how much effort they put into  the job? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think what is also 
quite interesting is the timelines for when these swaps were then 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 19 of 182 
 
executed.  As I said we entered into the Club Loan to receive the first 
charge on 1 December 2015.  On 3 December 2015 there was a 
memorandum from – as I said Mr Ramosebudi and supported by Mr  Pita 
– that suggested we should engage in these swaps.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And just remind me again Mr  Pita what was his 
position at that time? 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:   
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  He was the Group Chief 
Financial Officer – Acting Group Chief Financial Officer – at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Chair, may I refer you to the folder 
number 24 – 2-4 – in order for us to be able to follow the evidence of 
Mr Mahomedy? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Mr Mahomedy may you please identify 
that document for us. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
Chairperson 
this 
is 
a 
memorandum from Mr Phetolo Ramosebudi to Mr Garry Pita – the 
Acting Group Chief Financial Officer of Transnet at the time titled “R12 
Billion Club Loan Interest Rate Risk Explanation”.  
20 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  And is this the one that you are referring 
to in paragraph 5.6.3 of your statement?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes.  Could you please just – you know – 
highlight the important aspects flowing from that document?  
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 20 of 182 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think essentially this 
document tries to explain why Transnet should engage in the swap 
transaction.  However there is a shortcoming – significant shortcoming 
- in the transaction because the explanation given in terms of what may 
happen to interest r ates in Clause 8 or paragraph 8.  It says:  
“The latest (indistinct) projection or forecast from 
BER is reflected below to give an indication of what 
may happen with floating interest rates over the 
medium term.” 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAOMEDY:  Now very clearly we were 
talking about a transaction that was for a period of 15 years.  To give a 
view of two and a half years does not justify making a decision of a 15 
year movement in interest rates.  That is the one aspect of this 
particular memorandum that was concerning.  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  May I also refer you to under the 
heading “Motivation” and interrogate the issues that are listed therein 
and please comment whether in the light of what you have said to the 
Chairperson do they make sense at all? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So once again on - in 
20 
paragraph 9 under “Motivation” it says:  
“As per the interest rate forecast above the short 
term rates are expected to increase over the 
medium period ...” 
I am not sure what that me ant because it said we are talking about 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 21 of 182 
 
short term interest rates and then say medium period.  
“…and this poses a serious risk.  However the 
reality is that what is proposed on the table talks 
about a movement from 6.5 percent to 6.8 percent.”  
It is a 0.3 percent movement.  It does not reflect what is in the 
motivation that would create a business case for us to consider a long 
term contract of 15 years to be swapped to a fixed rate.  Chair what is 
also quite significant is that there were a string of email s on 
2 December 2015 
when 
one 
would 
assume 
that 
there 
was 
a 
contemplation of whether we should move to a fixed or floating rate.  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Are you referring to those from page 
461? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  461 and 462. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  But I would start with 462 
Chair.  This is a memorandum that was attached to this document that 
was sent by Mr Danie Smith who was the Deputy Treasurer at the time 
to Mr Garry Pita and Mr Phetolo Ramosebudi.  On 2 December at 10:39 
am he writes: 
“My humble opinion on the interest rate exposure of 
20 
the Club Loan.” 
Mr Smith had submitted a detailed memorandum …  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
To 
Mr Pita 
and 
Mr Ramosebudi suggesting that the interest rate swap was not a good 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 22 of 182 
 
idea for Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In – in reaction to the memorandum that we have just 
dealt with? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No Chair.  The memorandum 
that we dealt with …  
CHAIRPERSON:  In respect from what Mr  Ramosebudi? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Ramosebudi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ramosebudi. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair the memorandum …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Sorry my apologies Chair.  
The memorandum that we dealt with was dated 3 December. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So it is after this. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  After. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Prior to this memorandum 
being written Mr Danie Smith … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
Was 
clear 
in 
his 
20 
memorandum to say that he does not believe that swaps are a good 
idea for Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, okay, okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Mr Pita then response … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 23 of 182 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  As per page 462. 
“It is well written and I understand the logic.  
Phetolo are you (intervenes).”  
CHAIRPERSN:  I am sorry.  At 462 I have the memorandum from the 
person referred to as Danie - and I think you said it is Mr  Danie Smith? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then on top of that or just above that I have got 
what appears to be an email addressed to – the name does not appear 
fully but it looks like something Danie.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  He says it is well written and I understand the logic 
but that appears to be from Garry.  Is that no Garry  Pita? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Garry Pita? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  He actually acknowledges 
the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But where is the one to which they are responding – 
to which he is responding?  
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair this is the mail – the 
mail trail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So it is a response …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 24 of 182 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  To that mail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The memorandum is actually 
with me.  I am not sure if it (intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not in - in the bundle? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No (intervenes). 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  No the previous – the previous 
memorandum Chair it is not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, (intervenes). 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  The previous memorandum alluded to by 
10 
Mr Mahomedy is not in the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you see.  That is why … 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  But the memorandum …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I am trying to get a sequence.  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because we – we saw Mr Ramosebudi’s memorandum 
… 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where he was arguing for an interest rate swap and 
then – then you referred to a memorandum and then read to us emails 
20 
that seem to respond to that memorandum.  So I am looking for that 
memorandum first. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that – so you say it is not here in the bundle?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No Chair. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 25 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, but it can be found?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair.  It should be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  We will provide that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright because then it helps to connect …  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I think from what you are telling me it looks 
like the – the author of that memorandum took a view that is contrary to 
the view expressed by Mr  Ramosebudi.  Am I right?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair.  You are correct 
10 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of interest rates swaps.  So Mr  Ramosebudi 
comes with a view that is different from that one in circumstances 
where somebody has already said that is not the way to go.  So one 
would therefore like to see the reasoning of both and – and one 
assumes that Mr Ramosebudi – one would want to know whether 
Mr Ramosebudi was aware of that other memorandum and how one 
compares their reasoning as to who had a sounder reasoning for the 
position they were taking.  Okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think we will provide 
20 
that memorandum.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  But I think it is key that the 
– on 2 December Mr Danie Smith was clear in his view that there was 
not a need or there was not a case for Transnet to enter into a swap.  
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 26 of 182 
 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  And that is per the email on page 462?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  462. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes and then take us … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and you said Mr Danie Smith was what position 
again? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
He 
was 
the 
Deputy 
Treasurer of Transnet at the time reporting to Mr  Ramosebudi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  That is important. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is important.  So – so – but his email is it prior to 
10 
Mr Ramosebudi’s one in terms of dates?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No Chair.  It is actually … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is after? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  His email is first …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  On 2 December … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And just to give you the full 
email trail Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The email is from Mr  Smith 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  To Mr Phetolo Ramosebudi 
and Mr Pita. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 27 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  To say that he has a 
difference of opinion.  He do es not believe Transnet should do this.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
Mr Ramosebudi 
then 
responds …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  But also by the way on 
2 December Mr Ramosebudi sends this exact mail …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
And 
document 
to 
Mr Eric Woods at Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  Well part of what – what I would be 
looking for is where - where some of the people in Transnet were 
disagreeing with Mr Ramosebudi – part of what I would be looking for 
are their reasons because his – his email where he expresses his view 
on the face of it appears to be motivated.  He gives reasons.  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now one would therefore want to compare reasons for 
a different position and then see.  Thank you.  
20 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes Chair.  Yes Mr Mahomedy take us 
through that email trail. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So we said on 2 December 
… 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Ja. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 28 of 182 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  This mail from Mr Smith says 
that the annual interest rate cost between the floating rate and what is 
called the midmarket rate would be – would cost Transnet in the region 
of approximately R200 million a year in additional interest and in his 
view he did not agree that Transnet should actually – he specifically 
says: 
“It is recommended that the Club Loan not be 
switched to a fixed rate exposure by means of an 
interest rate swap.”  
And he goes on to explain that.  However a day later Mr  Ramosebudi 
10 
then prepares the memora ndum that we just talked of where he says 
that he believes this should be executed by Regiments.  He – the 
purpose of the memorandum if I may just add some – he says: 
“The purpose of this memorandum is to obtain 
approval from the Acting Group Chief Executive - 
sorry – the Acting Group Chief Financial Officer – 
to:  1.1, hedge the interest rate exposures from a 
floating to fixed basis for an amount of R12 billion.”  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Chair that is to be found on page 457.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  457. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
“1.2, 
he 
says 
instruct 
Regiments 
Capital 
as per 
the 
1  064 
locomotive mandate to execute the hedges with 
Transnet approved counterpart; 3, the execution 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 29 of 182 
 
cost hedges by Regiments Capital will  be an all-
inclusive – will be all inclusive in the rate of the 
interest rate swap. “  
So Chair there is a few key issues that we have to point out.  The first 
is at the time 1.2 was not valid.  Regiments did not have a mandate.  
Their mandate had essentially been concluded a few months before that 
when the 166 million was paid.  That particular memorandum had 
concluded that mandate.  So Regiments had no mandate as far as 
Transnet is aware. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  And procurement process that appointed 
10 
Regiments? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  There was no procurement 
process and Mr Pita was not authorised in terms of the delegation of 
authority to appoint Regiments.  That had to have been done through a 
proper procurement process even at the time – if it were to be done 
through a confinement – but it would have had to have been approved 
by the Group Chief Executive not the Group Chief Financial Officer.  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Did it serve …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we not still dealing with the matter where 
Regiments came onto the scene by way of – of a session or purported 
20 
session or that was in regard to …?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair - Chair that was in 
regard to the 1 064 advisory. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  But we have to also follow 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 30 of 182 
 
the timeline…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Because the last approved 
memorandum by the BADC … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Which was the authority at 
the time …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Rightly or wrongly but it was 
the authority who concluded the 1  064 transaction advisory when they 
10 
said that the total payment will be 265.5 million.  I think there was a – 
there was a memorandum in July 2015. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  This memorandum is dated 
3 December 2015.  There was no prior approval – there was no prior 
approval that Regiments could continue because there was no 
agreement essentially.  That agreement had terminated in July in terms 
of procurement process.  So they effectively …  
CHAIRPERSON:  But … 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Just kept an agreement 
20 
open. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but was there somebody who made a decision 
purporting to mandate them to continue and deed so without following 
proper procurement procedures or was the position that they – they 
kept being around and people thought they were still mandated to 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 31 of 182 
 
continue or is that something that is difficult to tell?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think it is a mix of 
both to be honest with you.  The first is obviously Mr  Woods was a - 
you know – was – was somebody who was quite present at the Transnet 
Offices.  So that could have created that perception but also the 
memorandum that is in front of us gives a sense that Regiments wer e 
appointed but there was no procurement event.  What is also quite 
fascinating about this memorandum is that when we go to the 
recommendation of the document on page 460 it does not mention 
anything about Regiments being instructed to have a mandate.  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So it – it starts off in the 
purpose of the document but trails away into the conclusion of the 
document and it does not mention that.  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  But to be more specific – I mean – 
having reviewed all these documents pertaining to this transaction did 
you come across any document that could have actually given 
Regiments any mandate as per this memorandum?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair as I – as I mentioned 
earlier on the timing is  quite critical … 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
Because 
the 
last 
memorandum that approved Regiments to execute on any transaction 
relating to 1 064 was significantly earlier – I think it was July  2015.  
There was not any subs equent process that appointed Regiments as a 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 32 of 182 
 
mandated advisor to Transnet for this particular transaction.  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  And this particular transaction did it 
serve on any of the committees that you elaborated upon when you 
adduced evidence yes terday? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Not to my knowledge, no. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes.  You were still at the point of 
highlighting those concerns which you are raising in relation to what is 
stated under the heading “Purpose”.  Anything else that y ou wish to 
highlight? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before – before you do that.  You just told us 
that the last email or memorandum relating to the mandate of …  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Regiments was around July.  This is now – we are 
dealing with a memo that comes up in December.  So there has been 
about five months or so or six months.  So during these intervening 
months from July to December would there have been other activities 
that Regiments would have been known to be involved in with Transnet.  
So I am wondering whether there had been a lull of about five months 
and suddenly there is a – a memorandum or whether there had been a 
20 
lot of activities between involving Transnet and Regiments maybe in 
regard to other things. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I just want to correct 
what I said earlier on.  The last memorandum was in April  2015 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 33 of 182 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Relating to the transaction 
advisor not July sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes and that gives us about eight months.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Eight months. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Intervening period, ja. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes.  Regiments would have 
been involved at the time as I best understand in a number of other 
consulting arrangements.  For example there is the general freight 
business transaction that they were involved in or consulting work that 
they were involved in.  I am not sure in terms of whether they had 
10 
continued work in that eight month period on  the Treasury side or … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Or anything relating to 1  064 
advisory.  That I am not aware of Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes Mr Mahomedy I am saying that in 
relation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think then you can deal with your question.  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  To the issues that you are raising the 
heading “Purpose” is there any issue that you wanted to highlight to the 
20 
Chair? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes.  Chair I think also one  
of the key issues on this memorandum - as I alluded to earlier on in 1.3 
says: 
“The execution cost of hedges by Regiments Capital 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 34 of 182 
 
will be all inclusive in the rate of the interest rate 
swap.” 
Which means this memorandum that the R12 billion ZAR Club Loan 
which was now going to be hedged on in an interest rate swap whatever 
the interest rate swap by the financial institution would be would 
include the - for want of a better word Chair as I said earlier on – 
include whatever commission was going to be paid t o Regiments.  So 
we will deal with that a little later on as well and there was no 
disclosure as far as we are aware in this memorandum of the 
percentage or of the rate that Regiments was going to be paid…  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes.  You can … 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And this was then approved 
by the group. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  If you go to page 460. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Four. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  4-6-0. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Of the same document and take us what 
it said under - under “Recommendation” and comment in as far as it 
relates also to Regiments. 
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So in the recommendation 
on page 460 under Item 24: 
“It is recommended that the Acting GCFO – being 
the Group Chief Financial Officer – approves the 
hedging of the interest rate, the risk exposures on a 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 35 of 182 
 
float for fixed basis for all the 12 billion Club Loan 
drawdowns.” 
And this is essentially compiled by the Group Treasurer at the time and 
signed off by Mr Pita who is the Acting Group Chief Financial Officer at 
that time.  Again as I pointed out earlier on it is not in line with the 
purpose of the document.  The purpose of the document was to get 
approval on three matters which was the hedging of the rate, 
instructing Regiments Capital and the fact that the rate would include 
the Regiments Capital commission …  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And when we go to the 
recommendation it just talks about approving hedging of the interest 
rate.  So it – it is an anomaly in - in how we actually prepare 
documents but that is just an observation in terms of this particular 
document Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Under “Purpose” that paragraph 1.2 namely one of 
the purposes of the memorandum was to:  
“Obtain approval from Acting Group Chief Financial 
Officer to instruct Regiments Capital as per the 
1 064 locomotives mandate to execute the hedges 
20 
with Transnet approved counterparts.”  
Now you made the point yesterday and I think you repeated it this 
morning that - and I am now paraphrasing – to the extent that 
Regiments may have had any mandate to do anything which – as I 
understand the position – would depend on validity of the session from 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 36 of 182 
 
McKinsey to the extent that they had any mandate from Transnet.  The 
mandate they had was the mandate that McKinsey had and that 
mandate was very limited.  It did not include execution - that is – that 
is what I understood you to have said – to the extent that that maybe 
right.  Would it be correct to say paragraph 1.2 under “ Purpose” of that 
memorandum from Mr Ramosebudi would seek to give them the 
mandate to get involved in the execution?  Am I correct in 
understanding reading it that way?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair.  You are correct 
in understanding that way.  This mandate is – this mandate of executing 
10 
is fundamentally different. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is new? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It is new. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes (intervenes). 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair what is also …  
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is where you – that is where your point about 
failure to follow procurement prescripts and procedures arises?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now may I refer you to page 19 
20 
and take us through from your paragraph 5.6.4?  That is where we 
interrupted you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is now back to his statement?  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  His statement Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 37 of 182 
 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Now that you have interrogated the 
relevant annexures. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair once again Chair the 
timeline becomes quite crucial in the conversation.  As I said on 
1 December 2015 Transnet has a drawdown with the …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am – I am sorry.  We might have left some loose end 
in relation to that memorandum but I may have missed this – we should 
finalise that by saying that Mr  Ramosebudi did get the approval that he 
was asking for.  Is that right looking from …?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair it …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Looking at the end of the memorandum (intervenes). 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I would say yes and no 
because the …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:   
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chief Financial Officer was 
not in a position to approve points 1.2 and 1.3 essentially but he did 
approve the hedging to continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  (Intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he got part of what he wanted?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  He got … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Part of what he wanted? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  He go part of what he 
wanted. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 38 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay thank you.  Alright. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And largely what he got was 
the approval to actually go into the swaps agreement.  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Swap yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and did he get paragraph 1.2 of his memo?  
That is the approval to instruct Regiments to execute.  He did not get 
that? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair as far as we are 
concerned the delegation of authority did n ot allow for the Group Chief 
10 
Financial Officer – Mr Pita – to give that approval because it was 
something that the Sub Committee of the Board could only do.  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is – that is a different issue.  You are 
answering the question whether Mr Pita had the power to grant the 
approval.  My question is at a factual level.  Rightly or wrongly 
Mr Ramosebudi thought that Mr Pita was the right person to get 
approval from and my question is whether he got approval from Mr  Pita 
as a matter of fact whe ther or not Mr Pita had authority to give that 
approval is another issue. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair in terms of this 
20 
memorandum he got that approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you but you make the point that Mr  Pita 
as far as you are concerned did not have the authority to grant such 
approval? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Correct Chair. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 39 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes.  You are taking us through the 
timeline.  You said it is important.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think it is necessary 
as I said that the drawdown occurs on 1  December 2015 and then here 
is the memorandum from Mr Danie Smit on the 2 n d of December and 
then the memorandum from Mr Ramosebudi that we’ve just discussed 
on the 3 r d of December. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    Yes. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   To be clear this was quite a 
10 
significant transaction and one gets the sense that it seems to have 
been rushed through because the transaction, or the first part of the 
transaction was executed on the 4 t h of December.  All of this happens 
in a three day period, which is interesting as an observation, 
considering the magnitude of the values that we are referencing Chair.   
 
So on the 4 t h of December Regiments then execute as per 
5.1.5 in my statement they execute  an interest rate swap on behalf of 
Transnet, with Nedbank.  This is a R4.5billion drawdown, the execution 
of the interest rate swaps are at a fixed interest rate of 11.83%.  Chair 
if it may please the Commission that we look at page 455, I think it’s 
20 
under Annexure MSM23.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair this schedule 
endeavours to give the Commission a perspective on the timelines but 
also some detail that gives you perspective on the loans that was 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 40 of 182 
 
swapped and the differentials  in the interest rate.  At the time when the 
transaction was entered into there were – for the ZAR Club Loan the 
rates, the interest rates at the time were around 9.03, between 9.03% 
and 9.12%.  These were then fixed at 11.83%, and the 2.7% on average 
or 2.6% on average movement is quite significant when you take into 
consideration the value of R4.5billion.   
 
We also there was a second swap with Nedbank on the 1 s t of 
March 2016, the second draw -down of R7.5billion was made and this 
drawdown was also swappe d from floating to fixed on the 7 t h of March, 
in a six day period, with Nedbank as the counterparty and that 
10 
execution rate on the fixed basis was 12.27%, and when we look at 
those transactions the original floating rate at the time was between 
9.53% and 9.72% but they were fixed at 12.27%.  
 
Chair I referenced the Commission to MSM25.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    It’s on page 464 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  46? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair there’s a – it has been 
brought to my attention ...(intervention)  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, at a convenient time, Mr Mokoena you can 
just watch where the convenient time would be, I want to go back to Mr 
Ramosebudi’s memorandum and ask you a question, but I want you to 
finish what you are dealing with first.  464 you said?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes.

CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   Chair in the review of this 
documentation and the review of the transactions it was brought to my 
attention 
that 
the 
Nedbank 
Compliance 
Department 
required 
confirmation from Transnet that it was satisfied with the pricing and 
value of the transaction.  If it pleases the Commission I would request 
to read out the email on page 464.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes do that.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   Chairperson ...(intervention)  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Firstly identify it, as to who the role -
10 
players that email, it was despatched to who by who and the date and 
take us through the context. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   Chair it is despatched from a 
Moss Brickman of Nedbank on Wednesday the 16 t h of March 2016 at 
1:30 pm to Mr Phetolo Ramosebudi at Transnet under the subject 
“finalisation of documentation surrounding the swap transaction”.  I will 
read the entire document, it’s no t that long. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that’s fine. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   It says: 
“Hi Phetolo, 
20 
Once again thank you for the opportunity provide to Nedbank 
[I’m reading it verbatim Chair] ...”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, that’s fine. 
MR

MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   Yes. 
“Once again thank you for the opportunity provide to Nedbank 
to participate in your heading requirements.  As per our 
discussion in order that we are able to close the loop on the 
transaction completed it would be most appreciated if you 
could share with us the special authority granted you to go 
ahead with the hedging.  We are still awaiting” ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think it’s “if you would share with us”.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     
10 
“...if you would share with us the special authority granted you 
to go ahead with the hedging.  We are still awaiting the signed 
confirmations but are aware that some peop le are travelling.  
Additionally our compliance is requesting a letter that 
essentially states that Transnet has looked at the transaction 
and the rates concluded and that Transnet is satisfied with the 
pricing and value of the transaction.  For ease essen tially they 
are looking for something along these lines.  “In terms of the 
interest rate swap transactions entered into with Nedbank on 
or about 8 March 2016.  I am aware that these trades priced a 
20 
a pure mid-market rate of approximately 11.42% NACQ.  I am  
further aware and agree that these trades were executed of a 
level of 12.37% NACQ which results in a difference of 95 BPS, 
meaning basis points, above or over mid -market value.  The 
trade numbers of the trades in question are set out below and 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94

they are given, and then your assistance in this matter is much 
appreciated.

Head Balance Sheet Management  
Treasury  
Nedbank Corporate and Investment Banking”  
Chair the reason this mail is for our review is Mr Ramosebudi 
subsequently copies and  pastes that particular paragraph and this mail 
is sent at 1:30 pm and he then responds, I think through his office, at 
10 
5:24pm to say “please find attached approval for the transaction”.  
 
A few pertinent points out of this is ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry let’s hear first where his response is.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Take us through  his response. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   Chair the next page is 465. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   We will see a note from Carol 
Perry who was the then assistant to Mr Ramosebudi on the 16 t h of 
March 2016 at 5:24pm says: 
“Good day Moss, 
20 
For ease of reference Mr Ramosebudi has rephrased the 
content of his mail in the form of a letter for the supporting 
documents.” 
And that letter is then sen t through to ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  It is sent to the person from Nedbank who had sent 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 44 of 182 
 
the email that you read?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this is sent on the same day, a few hours later.    
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMED Y:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From Ramosebudi’s office by a person called Carol.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, yes, you may continue. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair what is interesting from 
our observations on this particular  email is that the request for the 
authority that is made in this email on the 16 t h of March is post the 
10 
transaction has been executed in December 2015 and on the I think it 
was the 7 t h of March 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well shouldn’t you first take us to what he is 
attaching because I think your comments are on the content thereof, or 
the date thereof, isn’t it?  Because the person from Nedbank, Mr 
Brickman was asking basically for proof that there was the right 
authority isn’t it? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the letter from the person referred to as Carol 
purports to attach the required authority and you have some comments 
20 
to say about that, but I think we must just identify where that is first.   
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   Chair as I see it’s not in the 
document that is submitted but I think from my perspective Chair the 
point that we’re making is that this request came in post the execution 
of the transactions. The transactions were executed, the first one in 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 45 of 182 
 
December 2015 on the 4 t h and the second one was on the 7 t h of March 
2016.  This request from Nedbank is required on the 16 t h of March 
2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so you’re saying – or maybe they have, they may 
have, there may have been a reason that made them think you know 
what we should have asked for this before but to the extent that that 
authority may have existed as at that time let’s ask for it now, but 
hoping that what they would be given would show that it was authority 
that existed before execution, and if that happe ned, if that was the 
case then from their point of view they might feel that they are fine, but 
10 
if the authority seems to have come after they may or may not have 
been happy with that depending on a number of things, but you are 
saying that from your point of view that’s the issue, that’s the point you 
wanted to make that the authority comes after.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  But let’s go back to page 464, and let’s 
entertain for a while what has  been placed in inverted commas by 
Nedbank when requesting that authority in those terms.  What was 
Nedbank actually conveying to Mr Ramosebudi, what was really being 
20 
sought Mr Mahomedy so that the Chair should understand the essence 
of your evidence in this regard. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  In essence Chair I think 
there’s two things being requested in this email, the first is that Mr 
Ramosebudi to provide the authority, the special authority that he 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 46 of 182 
 
would have had, that’s in the upper most paragraphs.   The second 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  This is for the swap that ...(intervention)  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  To execute the swap. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To execute the swap, ja. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Which was already executed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The second piece is an 
authority from Transnet to say that the pricing was acceptable, now the 
reason why this is important is because there’s a fact that says that – 
10 
in this document that says the mid-market, the pure mid-market rate 
was 11.42% and the rate that was billed to Transnet was going to be 95 
basis points points higher.  In a transaction of this nature it is our view 
and our opinion that the 95 basis points was outside market conditions, 
it was too high, and essen tially what is happening here is that there’s a 
requirement or a request from Nedbank or the gentleman from Nedbank 
who is asking Transnet to say after the fact, I keep saying that Chair 
because it’s quite critical, after the fact to say that it’s acceptab le that 
we charged you 12.37%  when the market, mid -market was 11.42%.  
This also has to be thought of in conjunction of my previous testimony 
20 
on the swap approval memo which said that Regiments rate will be all 
inclusive, which means that somewhere in betw een this rate we believe 
Regiments commission was added into the rate as well which would 
give one a view in terms of why the rate was 95 basis points higher.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You see when I read the email from Mr Moss 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 47 of 182 
 
Brickman to Mr Ramosebudi it seems to me  that it’s an email that 
comes from a client of Transnet or that comes from somebody who finds 
something strange in what is being done, and just wants to make sure 
that whoever says this must be done from Transnet, one, has authority 
to say so, two, knows or appreciates the implications for Transnet if 
what he is requesting to be done is done, in other words it seems to me 
to be somebody who says I don’t want Transnet to ask anybody later on 
to say I was party to doing this and that maybe I failed in my 
obligations in that I didn’t make sure that Transnet appreciated what 
the implications of doing this would be, therefore I wanted to make sure 
10 
that if anybody accused Nedbank or him of not having done his job 
properly they would say here is proof they said th ey know all this, they 
are aware of all of this, we can go ahead and then we went ahead, is 
that a justified impression of the email from your point of view as 
financial person? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair, I think this is a 
document that was requested to ensure exactly what you just put out 
because that was the as per the mail it says our compliance and one 
would understand that to be the Compliance Department, so the 
question is who actually found, or what was it that they were looking 
20 
for, what did they find that was not necessarily in line with what was in 
the swap agreements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.   
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair it’s also worthy to 
mention at this point and we will come back to the calculations of all of 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 48 of 182 
 
the values etcetera, but it’s also necessary to mention we have dealt 
with what we call the Nedbank swaps, which was the ZAR Club Loan 
which was in a floating rate initially that was converted to these two 
tranches of fixed.  There were also other transactions t hat were then 
converted into – from floating to fixed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we go to other transactions I think it is 
convenient for us to talk about, to go back to Ramosebudi.  Now you 
remember that I asked you whether Mr Ramosebudi got the approvals 
that he was asking for by way of that email, and you said partly yes 
partly no, and I think you said what you got related to hedging.  I just 
10 
want us to go back, is it 46 ... 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  457. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  You see he was aski ng, that 
memorandum was addressed to Mr Pita and in paragraph one under the 
heading “purpose” he sets out three issues in respect of which he was 
saying he was seeking approval, okay and again the one is the hedging 
of the interest rate risk exposure from a float for fixed basis for the 
amount of R12billion, two, to instruct Regiments Capital as per the 
1064 locomotives mandate to execute the hedges with Transnet 
approved counterparts.  Three, the execution cost of hedges by 
20 
Regiments Capital will be all in clusive in the rate of the interest rate 
swap. 
 
Now when you go to the end of the – or to the last page at 
page 460 it says compiled by and then you’ve got his name and his 
signature, and then below that it says approved/not approved and then 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 49 of 182 
 
below there is a signature for Mr Gary Pita and his name and the part 
that is crossed out seems to be the not approved part which suggests 
that he was approving, he was being given an opportunity to say he is 
not approving or saying he approves, and he seems to have sa id I 
approve.   
 
Now that seems to me to suggest that he is approving 
everything for which approval was being sought from him, and if that 
interpretation of the memo is correct that means he approved all the 
three items that Mr Ramosebudi set out under the  heading “purpose”.   
 
It may be that the reason why you answered my question the 
10 
way you did is because under recommendation in paragraph 24 maybe 
that might not have been wide enough in your view to cover all the 
three purposes, I’m not sure.  Is that th e reason why you answered the 
way you answered? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I think that’s the key reason 
because when we at Transnet prepare a memo the requirement is that 
whatever you 
want 
must 
be very 
explicitly stated 
under the 
recommendation. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you accept ...(intervention)  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I accept. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That there may be a different interpretation that 
approval for all three items was granted.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  I actually agree that 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 50 of 182 
 
technically all, whatever was requested in the memo was approved.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, okay, thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now Mr Mahomedy before you proceed 
with the other relevant facts in your – and under that heading, may I 
refer you to page 465, Chair that is under folder number 25.  
CHAIRPERSON:  25? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  25, just to complete the evidence of Mr 
Mahomedy pertaining to the sequence of emails that passed between 
the parties and I think that on page 465 you might have omitted an 
important email if you look right at the bottom of that page you may 
10 
wish to indicate to the Chair as to who wrote that email and to whom 
was he writing to, and what did he say, and you can tie it up with w hat 
it conveyed to the Chair. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Thank you Advocate.  I think 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  We are on 464, is that correct?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  465. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  465. 
CHAIRPERSON:  465, okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  At the bottom, that is the last email 
20 
appearing there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chairperson this email is from 
Mr Ramosebudi, Phetolo Ramosebudi of Transnet to Mr Moss Brickman 
because the email addresses are exact ly the same, mossb@nedbank, 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 51 of 182 
 
this one is @nedbankcapital, on the 16 t h of March 2016 at 3:14pm.  The 
conversation is: 
“Hi Moss, 
In terms of the interest rate swap transactions entered into 
with Nedbank on or about 8 March 2016 I am aware that these 
trades priced at pure mid-market rate of approximately 11.42% 
NACQ.  I am further aware and agree that these trades were 
executed at a level of 12.37% NACQ, which results in a 
difference of 95 basis points over mid-market value.” 
This is Mr Ramosebudi then confirmi ng to Mr Brickman it is a copy and 
10 
past Chair of the exact paragraph on page 64 in which Mr Brickman 
wrote to Mr Ramosebudi requesting where he says for ease essentially 
they are looking for something along these lines, so exactly what is in 
inverted commas is copied and pasted by Mr Ramosebudi to Mr 
Brickman an hour and a half or an hour forty four minutes later.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Would that have been ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  It may be that copy and paste is correct but 
effectively what he does, that is Mr Ramosebudi is to give Mr Brickman, 
Moss Brickman, exactly the wording that he knows Mr Brickman will be 
happy with, is that correct?  
20 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no change of anything. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No change. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Would that swap have been in the 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 52 of 182 
 
interest of Transnet? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think the additional 
cost that – before I answer that question Chair I would like to just 
explain that there was another swap as well, another interest rate 
swap. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, before you deal with another swap just to make 
sure that we don’t lose track of some of the things, we are still going to 
look at the – at whatever document Mr Ramosebudi may have provided 
purporting to be authority, is that right?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  We’ve got such a document?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, okay, you may proceed.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair as I explained earlier on 
this was a total of R12billion in loans, it was essentially the ZAR Club 
Loan that we had entered into on a floating rate of rates between 9.03% 
and 9.27% at various times, this entire transaction was swapped with 
Nedbank.  Chair there is a further R11.3billion which was entered into 
as a separate ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I’m sorry, I want to make sure I follow, you say 
20 
this entire transaction was swapped with Nedbank, we have been using 
swap so far in the context of an interest swap, is that what you are 
talking about? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, it’s just that you said the entire transaction 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 53 of 182 
 
was swapped and I wasn’t sure if it still meant the same thing as 
swapping an interest rate? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  It’s still interest rates. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  My apologies Chair, you are 
100%. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chairperson the R12million in 
loans, the interest rate swap was with Nedbank.  There were certain 
other transactions as I provided an analysis earlier this morning again 
which involved EDC, Exim of Canada with Investec, Lipfin, Omsfin and 
10 
Standard Bank, where we had entered into these loan transactions 
between 2014 and 2015, these had existed, these were transactions 
that were already in progress.  These were then involved in an interest 
rate swap with the Transnet Second Defined Pension Fund, which is 
called for short the TSDPF.  Also by the way Chair executed with 
Regiments as the intermediary.  Those rates were converted between 
the original floating rates were between 8.8% and 9.9% and they were 
converted at between 11.15% and 12.07%, and those were done in 
March 2016 and April 2016.   
 
Chair the key issue with the pension fund swa ps or the interest 
20 
rate swaps that were done with the pension fund was that at the time, 
which is prior to the pension fund in terms of Transnet policy did not 
qualify as what we call an approved counterparty in terms of whether 
we could actually be doing this kind of transaction with them.  
 
There was a subsequent mail that – a memorandum again that 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 54 of 182 
 
was signed by two or three people that said that it would be approved – 
it would become an approved counterparty.  Saying that Chair I think 
one of the key things is that the calculation at the time of the 
commission again I use the word commission loosely and that was then 
paid out, calculated and paid out by the pension fund.  That was for 
loans totally R11.3 billion.  So the interest rate swops for Transnet 
effected two different loan types totally R23.3 billion.  Chair the reason 
that becomes very key is when you have to do the calculations of the 
incremental interest. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC :  Yes. 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It is quite significant.  But 
just before we go into the calculations of the interest as it relates to 
mandates Chair it is also quite important to note that Transnet being a 
player of significant nature in the financial services sector in terms of 
loans and facilities that we generate and commercial paper that we put 
into the market we ordinarily do send out to the local and global 
banking sector what we call the mandate for trades.  And this is done 
annually.  So in 2014 and 2015 as per my Annexure MSM26 on pages 
472 to 476 Chair these are examples of mandate letters that would 
have gone through to various financial institutions which confirm who 
20 
are the employees that are mandated to act for Transnet in certain 
specific transactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us pick the one on page 472 and ju st read for us 
what does it say in order for us to understand what you are testifying 
on? 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 55 of 182 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It is a mandate for domestic 
market traders. 
“The employees of Transnet SOC Limited indicated 
below are hereby authorised in the normal course of 
their employment to enter into capital and money 
market 
transactions 
and 
more 
specifically 
to 
participate 
and 
deal 
in 
bonds 
listed 
on 
the 
Johannesburg 
Stock 
Exchange, 
repurchase 
agreements, money market instruments and interest 
rate derivatives on behalf of Transnet SOC Limited.  
10 
Within the limits set out in the delegation of authority 
framework and or the financial risk management 
framework as approved by the Transnet Executive 
Committee or board of directors.  It produces…”  
Or it goes on to name the people, provides their Identity number and 
the signature of the relevant individual.  And then it says:  
“Thus 
done 
and 
signed 
at 
Johannesburg 
in 
accordance with the Transnet delegation of authority 
framework.” 
It is signed by the Group Treasurer at the time and then countersigned 
20 
by the Group Chief Financial Officer at that time.  In 2014 and in 2015 
it was signed by the then CFO’s or the then CFO both of them by Mr 
Anoj Singh.  The 2015 document on 473 is signed by Mr Ramosebudi on 
the 12 May 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see I am trying to see the date of the document 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 56 of 182 
 
itself at 472 and I do not see any date other than the date on which Mr 
Anoj Singh signed it.  I had expected that where it says ‘thus done’ that 
would give a date.  So are you – when you say it is a 2014 document 
simply because Mr Anoj Singh’s signature indicates that he signed it on 
the date given there which is on the – in 2015 / 14? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC :  Now Mr Mahomedy I do not understand 
that if there are those mandates that are sent to look to financial 
institution and international institutions how would one find Regiments 
10 
trading on behalf of Transnet in those media transactions that we have 
actually canvassed? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair that can only be the 
case if specific delegation or mandate was provided to Regiments to 
execute a particular transaction.  Later on in my testimony I talk about 
the concerns as it relates to Transnet practice and Transnet proces ses 
and Transnet frameworks as it relates to all of the swop transactions.  I 
think we – save to say that our financial risk management frameworks 
and delegations etcetera do not allow for third parties to be executing 
on Transnet’s behalf.  Unless there w as a specific delegation given or a 
20 
specific mandate that was given to Regiments.  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if Transnet had a practice of sending out these 
mandates that would mean that anybody within the relevant market, 
anybody of significance would be aware that there would be specific 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 57 of 182 
 
people that Transnet would have mandated to do certain things and 
therefore they would before engaging with anybody one would expect 
them to double check whether that person is somebody who is 
mandated by Transnet to do that. Obviously if that person’s name does 
not appear in the mandate such as this but he or she is able to produce 
a special mandate or authorisation then and that authorisation is seen 
as legitimate by the third party then they could c ontinue but the 
question would – one would expect the third parties to want to check 
whether they are dealing with somebody whose name appears in a 
document such as this. 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair that is accurate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And I think more so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  In the case of the 
significance of this value and this transaction.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So I think I agree with you 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC :  Yes.  May I – May I take you back to 
page 20 of your statement and simply to clarify one or two issues 
arising from there?  You have testified about a number of interest 
swops and others you are referencing in those r elevant paragraphs, 
paragraph 5.6.5 and 5.6.6 and you also mentioned the others.  
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 58 of 182 
 
Financially what does it mean to Transnet when these swops are 
executed from time to time?  Have you ever computed as to how much 
did Transnet lose? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair yes we have done the 
computation.  I would like to just explain the computation.  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  If it – if I am allowed to.  
The first thing is that when you do an interest rate swop you are 
essentially looking at the future of interest rates as compared to where 
you are.  As I explained earlier on.  Which means that if the agreement 
10 
was signed at I am using an arbitrary number of 9.5% floating at a point 
in time and we then engage at 12% as long as that rate stays at 9.5 you 
will have a 3.5% deficit and you will be always paying 2.5% more.  But 
one has to obviously always match this because the curves the interest 
rates do change.  Your fixed will be exactly that it is fixed and as the 
forward view gets taken on an interest rate and you have interest rate 
increases in the market etcetera the differential will be lower if the 
interest rate goes lower than the 9.5 that you originally went at then it 
will be greater.  So yes in terms of 5.6.11 in my stat ement we 
endeavour to explain … 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC :  It is on page 21 Chair. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Page 21 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The decision to swop from 
floating interest rates to fixed interest rate ha s resulted in the following 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 59 of 182 
 
additional interest rate cost to Transnet and this was as of the 25 
February 2019.  And Chair the context to that is that this is the 
differential between the interest rate over the last three odd years when 
this was signed in 2015 December to today to the 25 February 2019 
just over three years.  For the Nedbank transactions Transnet has paid 
additional interest of R785.3 million.  For the Pension Fund 
transactions Transnet has paid an additional interest or paid additional 
interest of R696.6 million. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC :  And this is on swops nothing more but 
swops? 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  This is just on the swops.  
This is what we call realised loses meaning we have paid physically 
realised these particular losses.  We also do a calculation of what we 
call the unrealised loss meaning what we estimate will be the loss of 
interest to the end of the transaction.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Does this represent a loss that Transnet says it would 
not of it probably would not have incurr ed had the swop not happened?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair.  If the swop was 
not executed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Then we would not have had 
this particular cost, additional cost.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Do – have you – I assume that in order to 
answer that you would – in order to be able to answer that question you 
would have been – you would have worked out exactly what Transnet 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 60 of 182 
 
would have paid if there had been no swop in interest rates and the – 
and because you have don e that homework you are able to say this 
loss would have been avoided?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair this is that 
homework that has been done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  To actually look at  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  What did transpire on the 
floating rate. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And again Chair I think it is 
a crystal ball that not everybody owns but it is taking a view on the 
long term interest rates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The contrary position to this 
is one would say well you know it was fixing the rate, it was all of these 
good things that the advantages being that as you pointed out earlier 
on it gives you a – it takes away the availability etcetera.  That is in its 
place. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm ja. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  However the key question is 
should Transnet have gone into the swops at all?  And as I mentioned 
the Deputy Treasurer at the time did not agree with the swops.  The 
consequence of entering into the swop agreement is as I pointed out in 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 61 of 182 
 
terms of the realised losses of R785 million with the Nedbank 
transaction and R696.6 million with the Transnet Second Defined 
Pension Fund transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is altogether abo ut R1 billion what? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Just over R1.4 billion Chair.  
Just about – sorry my apologies.  Just about R1.4 billion.  
CHAIRPERSON:  About R1.4 billion. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And that is the differential in 
the interest rate between what was floating, what we would have paid.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Versus what we are currently 
paying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And that is only to the 25 
February 2019. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And as we go on… 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  These contracts…  
CHAIRPERSON:  And as we go on you will be carrying more losses?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  These contracts terminate in 
2030 Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  I see that Chair you are now venturing 
into mathematical computation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC :  Despite what happened between us when 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 62 of 182 
 
Mr Volmink testified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let us take the – let us take the short 
adjournment and we will resu me at half past eleven. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mahomedy my watch might be ahead of your – of 
your watch.  It says 29 minutes to 12 now but I did say in the morning 
that I was responsible earlier for about five minutes delay in our 
10 
starting and also yesterday a few minutes.  So – but I did say we try 
and improve. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  My apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine.  Thank you.  
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Mr Mahomedy just before the tea 
adjournment you were still dealing with paragraph 5.6.11.  If you can 
summarise what you are conveying to the Chair please?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair as I said that the 
20 
figures that we provided the 785 million and the 696 million in what we 
deem as realised losses.  Meaning that based on the information up to 
25 February that gap between the floating rate and the fixed rate has 
not closed.  It has not narrowed for us to gain benefit from this 
transaction. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 63 of 182 
 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  In addition … 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes). 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  We also do a calculation of 
what we would call the unrealised portion of the loss looking forward to 
the end of the contracts and the calculations that we have performed to 
date say that there would be an additional - based on the forward 
curves of the intrastate as well.  So it is not based on today’s rate.  It 
is based on the future perspective as well.  We have an unrealised loss 
of approximately a further R1.8 billion on these two transactions which 
10 
essentially means that if things stay as they are and the forward curves 
stay as they are then Transnet will be – what we would call – out of the 
money by an estimated R3.2 billion over the 15 years.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course what is most important to consider when 
one looks at such a – a big amount of financial loss to Transnet that 
arose from the decision to swap from a floating interest rate to a fixed 
interest rate is to what extent that decision could be said to have been 
as a result of negligence – maybe gross negligence – or incompetence 
or a criminal agenda.  In other words it is important as one looks at all 
of this to be able to say to the extent that making the decision to swap 
20 
from a floating interest to a fixed interest which has now produced this 
loss – future loss for – for Transnet.  Was this simply because 
somebody may have meant while but just got things te rribly wrong or is 
this a situation where one can say looking at the information that was 
available to the person and looking at that person’s experience and 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 64 of 182 
 
qualifications and competence in the – this kind of area that decision 
could simply not have been made by somebody who meant well for – 
was trying to look after the interest of Transnet as they should.  So – 
so – and it may well be that sitting there you yourself might not be able 
to go as far as a certain point but you can only go up to a certain poin t 
but it is important that I know how far you can go in terms of saying 
when I criticise this decision I criticise it because I think the person 
who made it was somebody who had another agenda or you say I 
cannot go that far but I think it was just grossly  wrong or grossly 
negligent for anybody with that kind of experience with those kind of 
10 
qualifications and in that position to make this decision maybe in the 
light of what other people were saying on the same issue.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think one has to look 
at it very circumspectly and we have reviewed a number of documents 
in this regard and the overall management of the Treasury function.  It 
is worthy to note in this particular transaction that there were no 
Transnet Treasury Officials involved in the execution in the calculations 
in the assessment of the swaps which in itself tells a story of in my 
humble opinion somebody not willing to take a risk that people will 
actually do the calculations and say no.  That is the first point.  Th e 
20 
second point Chair in reviewing the documentation one does not get the 
sense that we actually considered a 15 year position on what may or 
may not have happened to the interest rates for us to make an informed 
decision.  As per the memorandum that we dis cussed Chair it is clear.  
It says: 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 65 of 182 
 
“We have reviewed the short term interest rate on 
the medium period.” 
This was a 15 year transaction which would have required at best for us 
to take a longer view than two and a half years.  The memorandum from 
Mr Smith is also very clear.  It says that he does not as the Deputy 
Treasurer with somebody who had at the time – I think - more than 30 
years’ experience or about 30 years’ experience.  It would not be 
opportune for somebody to ignore that for the Executives tha t were in 
place.  You would have had to have considered this.  Chair one other 
key piece of information is that Transnet had not executed an interest 
10 
rate swap for many years which then begs the question why this one – 
why suddenly and one has to draw the inference that it was done to 
benefit an entity in the like of Regiments specifically with the 
significant amount of money that then flowed to Regiments around this 
time and that is as far as I would go in terms of my assessment based 
on the reviews that we have undertaken.  The issues of negligence or 
gross – dereliction of duty etcetera would be one for I guess another 
day but presented with information of this nature at the time and I 
guess one will also say well some of it is in hindsight but for a busi ness 
the size of Transnet one is always expected to take decisions in the 
20 
interest of the business.  The entity is a significant player in the South 
African space but also not just in itself but also in the space of public 
funding.  So it would be somethin g that you would have expected for 
the Executives to have obtained multiple opinions on this not to have 
executed based on – right now it is based on one individual that writes 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 66 of 182 
 
memorandums to say that this is what I think should happen.  
Magnitudes of the transactions of R23 billion should have been 
considered a lot more diligently by the Executives at the time – in my 
view Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you – you say something that is quite significant.  
You say negligence and gross negligence might be for anot her day but 
what you do say is in your view when you look at the facts and when 
you look at how this came about the surrounding circumstances you – 
you infer that the person who made this decision made it for the benefit 
of Regiments.  Is that correct?  
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To assist – to assist or benefit Regiments.  In other 
words that would mean that that person did not seek to protect 
Transnet’s interests at that stage and that person’s – what you are 
saying would suggest that that person sought to benefit Regiments 
even to the detriment of Transnet.  So I just want to – to make sure that 
I understand you what you are saying whether I understand you 
correctly. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair that is a – that is 
correct from my perspective. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now if we can move on for you to 
summarise for us the contents of paragraphs 5.6.12 to 5.6.14 of your 
statement. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think it is necessary 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 67 of 182 
 
to say that – you know – for what we could call an unwind of this 
transaction for us to actually get to a position where these losses …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am terribly sorry Mr  Mahomedy and Mr Mokoena.  I 
just want to go back to the question I asked  you just a minute ago.  You 
did not want to express any opinion on the issues of negligence or 
gross negligence and that – that is why you said maybe that is for 
another day.  I just want to mention this to you and then you can 
comment on it.  If a person who was making the decision that there 
should be an interest rate swap was doing so in order to advantage or 
ensure benefits to Regiments as opposed to looking after the interest 
10 
of Transnet.  That would exclude negligence because that person would 
have an intention – would be intending to benefit Regiments as 
opposed to Transnet.  So in other words it is a – it is a much more 
serious conclusion to make against them – against that person than to 
say maybe it was negligence or competence.  That you understa nd?  
You have no problem with that?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay thank you. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  But just to also – sorry – to 
add to this I think it is also important – the one point that is important 
20 
or two of them Chair is that the short period of time between the time 
we executed the loan and executed the swap one has to question why 
did we not think about entering into a fixed loan – fixed interest loan 
upfront. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 68 of 182 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  As required by the dictates 
of our financial risk management framework …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Within Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It is not a decision that you 
should be making … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  In between a transaction …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Or intermittently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It should also form part of 
your strategy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes from the beginning? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  From the beginning …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  You should have a funding 
strategy that says X amount will be floating.  X amount will be fixed and 
you will adhere to that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Now had we gone into that 
transaction up front with a perspective of entering into a fixed rate …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  For that period of time we 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 69 of 182 
 
would have a very difficult disc ussion today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The rates may have been 
different.  I do not say it would have been different.  It could have been 
different. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  But it questions the entire 
process in terms of why this was made and as I also presented Chair it 
was all done … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The decision to change from 
fixed to floating was done in a 24/48 hour period.  
CHAIRPERSON:  This was in – this was in March 2016.  Is that right?  
When the swap …? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair the first tranche was 
in December 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  December, yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  On 4 December 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and the – the earlier – the time when it would 
have – the thing would have been considered as a long term view was 
20 
how many months earlier than that?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair we had a number of 
discussions that go back to September/October  2015 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  When the loans were being 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 70 of 182 
 
conceptualised at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – so the – the point you are making – the 
latest point you are making is this that when – when you were 
considering the whole issue part of what you would have cons idered is 
whether the interest rate regime that should be applicable is a fixed 
rate - interest rate regime or a floating interest rate regime and in 
considering that you would have looked among other things at the long 
term nature of the transaction – 15 years and you would have looked 
also at the amounts involved and then you would have taken a 
deliberate decision to go one – one way or another and in this case you 
10 
took the decision to go the route of a floating interest rate.  So the 
point you are making is that two/three – two/three months thereafter a 
decision is taking early December by one person maybe two persons.  
One recommend – asking for approval another one granting the 
approval to change that and you make the point.  You say but if three 
months or so earlier looking at a long term view a decision was taken to 
say the floating interest route – rate route is the correct one.  It should 
have been quite difficult to change it within such a short time.  That is 
what you are saying? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  There should have been something very special.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair.  I think your last 
point everything that you said is 100 percent correct but your last point 
needs a little more explanation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 71 of 182 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
The 
question 
is 
what 
changed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What changed? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  For Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was so special to change that earlier decision?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when you look at that memorandum from 
Mr Ramosebudi addressed to Mr  Pita asking for the approvals you say 
you do not find anything special in – in the contents of that 
memorandum that would justify the change?  
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair right up to 1 December 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  We are still in the process 
with the funding institutions to provide us the money.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
They 
provide 
it 
on 
1 December … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
And 
we 
changed 
this 
20 
strategy on 4 December. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Literally within – or the 2 n d 
or 3 December … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 72 of 182 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Within a few days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So as you very succinctly 
point out Chair four or five months before that …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Why was the strategy not 
reconsidered? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Why was the strategy to go 
into floating?  Why did it – what occurred? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Or what information was 
available to whom that would actually …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that had not been available before?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Correct but that is a very 
important question you asked Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm and – and the persons or people from Transnet 
who had been involved in the earlier decision to say let us go the 
floating interest rate route would that have been  a number of different 
people who came to that decision?  
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair that transaction was 
the Club Loan.  There would have - I assume – there would have been 
individuals … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
That 
may 
have 
been 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 73 of 182 
 
involved in that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes but – but the change was made by …?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
An 
individual 
or 
two 
individuals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  An individual with the approval of another individual/  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  But coupled with that Mr  Mahomedy 
there was a comprehensive advice by the Deputy Treasurer.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Who said that you cannot go on this 
interest swap in that manner and that advice was never taken?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That advice was not taken 
no, agree but I think Chair as we go further we will give more colour to 
what processes within Transnet should have been applied that in our 
view were not applied as a result of bringing in an intermediary like 
Regiments. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  You were at the verge where you were 
now summarising for us the contents of paragraphs 5.6.12 to 5.6.14.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair as we said there is 
20 
different cash flows over this – these particular transactions.  However 
if the interest rates were to move in the wrong direction and one 
assumes that Transnet can recover from this position it would have to 
be very significant because we first have to recover the 1.4 billion that 
we are out of the money already and you would have had to look at that 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 74 of 182 
 
benefit accruing a lot sooner and we do not in terms of the current 
trends and the current forward projections that is not where we think 
this transaction will conclude in any profit to Transnet.  I must also 
hasten to point out that as I said the beneficiary of the TSDPF 
transaction is the Transnet Second Defined Pension Fund.  We have 
also learnt that - as I said earlier on – that the Nedbank swap – interest 
rate swap was then effectively – if I can use the word – forward sold to 
the Pension Fund as well.  For these transactions we understand the 20 
bases point fee was included in the rates as a fee.  We say it is 
payable by Nedbank.  I think it has been confirmed by Nedbank that 
10 
they have not paid the fee directly.  However we are looking at the 
calculation that has been provided by Regiments.  As I also said earlier 
on Chair from the documents that we reviewed Regiments were paid 
R227 million by the Pension Fund.  Now it is a matter of debate as to 
whether they were paid the amount or whether they had extracted the 
amount … 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And that is something that is 
under debate in the courts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that about whether they helped themselves to the 
20 
amount or whether they were paid by – by the Pension Fund?  Is that 
what – what you are talking about?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA 
SC: 
 
Now in relation 
to those 
swap 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 75 of 182 
 
transactions you identified certain irregularities and you raised some of 
the concerns.  Can you take us through those concerns that you are 
raising? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think as I mentioned 
earlier on Transnet had not entered into any major interest rate swaps 
in the recent past and the decision to enter into a loan agreement or 
the decision to enter into a loan agreement with a floating or fixed rate 
should have taken place at inception of that loan ideally.  Whilst  there 
may be circumstances and these are normal market conditions the 
outlook on the interest rate does not change on a daily basis or a 
10 
weekly basis.  It is sometimes – unless you have quite a significant 
event that will create a swing in the market cond itions.  We did not see 
that in the three days or in the three months before that.  I reiterate 
and reemphasise the point that the Transnet Treasury Team had and 
still has the expertise to handle these transactions what we term vanilla 
transactions.  These are stock standard transactions or stock standard 
swaps.  That the Transnet dealing room would have the expertise to 
assess and execute.  I further go on – on page 22 under 5.6.15.2 – to 
explain what the normal process should have been within Transnet if 
these swaps were executed by the Transnet Treasury Team.  In all 
20 
probability they would have looked at the transaction and then decided 
how many parties should have participated in the transaction up front.  
That would depend on what is called the counterp arty appetite.  The 
dealing room will then obtain pricing from counterparties and do a 
match and understand and assess which entity provided the right price.  
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 76 of 182 
 
Now how is the right price determined?  The pricing obtained under 
5.6.15.5 on page 22 Chair – pricing obtained is always benchmarked – 
benchmarked 
internally 
by 
the 
dealing 
team 
and 
they 
utilise 
independent pricing models of entities like Reuters and Bloomberg.  
Post the event – sorry Chair – none of these processes were followed 
internally at Transnet.  The dealing room was not involved.  They 
essentially were given the transaction after the conclusion to say you 
will record this particular transaction.  When they were given this 
particular …  
CHAIRPERSON:  And you have not come across any document in  your 
10 
review of these transaction which reflects any explanation by the 
people concerned as to why these processes that would normally have 
been expected to be followed were not followed?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair we have not come 
across any of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  In fact to the contrary we 
have discussed this with Transnet Treasury Officials and the dealing 
room … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Individuals.  They raised this 
as a concern. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  They were told things like 
we will work around you.  We will work above you.  We will work 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 77 of 182 
 
through you.  Those were the kinds of statements that were made when 
people raised objections to some of these type of t ransactions to say 
why it is that we are not being considered …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  For providing our expertise.  
So to the contrary it was actually - in my humble opinion – an intent to 
have Regiments execute these transaction s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if – if that true that seems to say do not both us.  
You do not matter. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is - is that a fair interpretation of what you 
understand was told to them?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair towards the latter part 
of yesterday I mentioned that the Chairman of the Board had made a 
statement at one of the Board meetings suggesting that Regiments had 
gained access to our dealing room.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:   
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And when I addressed that 
to the officials in the dealing room they said Regiments never gained 
20 
access to the dealing room. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The dealing room just moved 
to Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 78 of 182 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
So 
they 
executed 
the 
transactions on Transnet’s behalf and the dealing room the individuals 
were not engaged or … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Consulted in any shape or 
form. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Ramosebudi and Mr Pita would have been part 
of what is considered to be the dealing room?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In – in terms of normal processes at Transnet?  
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would – they would not be part of that? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No they would not be part of 
that process.  There is a much focused team.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Who works on – on these 
type of transactions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It is the dealing room …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And they would report to 
Mr Ramosebudi as the departmental supervisor or superior …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And Mr Ramosebudi would 
be the direct report of Mr  Pita at the time and Mr  Pita would not - as 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 79 of 182 
 
the CFO – not necessarily have a direct line with the Treasury Team.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But if – if the people in the dealing room reported to 
Mr Ramosebudi then that means Mr  Ramosebudi was in charge of the 
dealing room or was in charge of the people in the dealing room?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair he was in charge 
of the people yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So he – he might not ordinarily have been 
expected to be part of a certain team  maybe but he was in charge of 
them … 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And therefore if he was in charge of them I take it he 
was in charge of the dealing room.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   Yes, no I agree with you on 
that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   But you, yes, so it would 
have reported to him ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I was trying to understand the concept of saying 
the dealing room went to Regiments, so if – because if you say Mr 
Ramosebudi was not part of the dealing room then I’m wondering how 
20 
did the dealing room go to Regiments, but if Mr Ramosebudi was in 
charge of the people in the dealing room then maybe I understand what 
they meant.   
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   Okay, no you’re right 
...(intervention)  
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 80 of 182 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   The question might be which dealing 
room, the one at McKinsey or the one at Transnet.  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, the – what he was saying was that he was 
told, what Mr Mahomedy was saying was that he was told b y the people 
in the dealing room that the dealing room had gone to Regiments and I 
can only – in the context of his evidence I can only understand that to 
mean that somebody other than the team that normally forms the 
dealing room but somebody else connect ed with the dealing room went 
to Regiments, okay alright.  So my understanding is correct?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay thank you. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair I think 5.6.1.16 on 
page 22 we say, “post the event of the interest rate swopped 
transactions in question the dealing team then obtained external 
indicative pricing from other market participants which suggested that 
the margin on the second (indistinct) of the Nedbank swop transactions, 
which was on the 7 t h of March 2016 were in the region of between 32 
and 54 basis points higher as compared to quotes received.  At the end 
of the transaction the dealing room was then given the documents to 
record, some of those dealers decided to go and check on this pricing 
20 
and they found that the Nedbank pricing was between 32 and 54 basis 
points higher than compared to quotes received.  This is probably 
due...(intervention). 
CHARPERSON:    So in other words does this mean that somebody in 
the dealing room of Transne t went outside to test the quote that was 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 81 of 182 
 
being approved by those above the dealing room team and established 
that those above them had actually received different quotes some of 
which were 32 and 54 basis points lower than the ones that were being 
approved.  In other words one would have expected that they would 
have gone for a lower one, is that right but they’d gone for higher 
ones? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay which must have been quite surprising I would 
guess to the dealing team?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:    Correct.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Because they then said that 
this is  probably due to the fact both the swops with Nedbank and the 
pension fund was secured in a non-competitive environment and in 
addition both of these swops had to include the fee of 20 basis points 
payable to Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that payment to Regiments you would say when 
you – when we hear about it we must remember that the fees for 
Regiments, or the commission had already been provided for elsewhere 
earlier is that right? 
20 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Yes, that’s right. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair the premium or what 
we call the premium of 54 basis point s on this quantum of debt over 15 
years represents an approximate additional cost to Transnet of 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 82 of 182 
 
246million rand on a net present value at the time of the trade and a 
premium of 32 basis points over 15 years approximates 146million rand 
of additional cost to Transnet over the period on a net present value.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    And you conclude on that topic with 
paragraph 5.6.16 can you please summarise it for us?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair in the local advisory – 
and my apologies to take us all the way back but in the local 
transaction advisory contract which initially was a confinement, and I 
may have stated yesterday, it was an open tender but it was actually a 
confinement that went through a process and McKinsey or the McKinsey 
10 
consortium was selected at that point in time.  The McKinsey 
consortium had provided a submission to Transnet and it included 
Nedbank as one of the consortium partners.  We also discussed then, 
that Nedbank – and I draw inference by the various communications 
between Transnet and McKinsey informing McKinsey of the conflict of 
interest that was identified or perceived at the time where Nedbank 
requested to be excused from the consortium as a result of them 
considering the need to get into funding transactions later on in the 
transaction. 
 
What my point here is that, Nedbank had, essentially 
20 
submitted a bid together with McKinsey and then later on Nedbank was 
replaced with Regiments as the party.  That perceived conflict which 
existed when Nedbank withdrew was no diff erent, in my view, to the 
conflict that existed when Regiments began executing transactions on 
Transnet’s behalf as it related to the 1064 funding and I go further to 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 83 of 182 
 
explain this.  In my view, in 2015, Regiments had largely become the 
lead consortium partner with the exit of McKinsey at the time.  They 
now provide advice through their advisory service, they provide 
advisory service on the funding programme.  They then execute the 
swops for Nedbank and the TSDBF the interest rates swops for 
Transnet and the counter party being Nedbank and the Transnet Second 
Defined Pension Fund as the counter parties. Regiments receives 
significant payment from the TSDBF for this transaction.  Regiments 
also gets paid for the arranging of the China Development Bank loan 
which we spoke about earlier of 166million.  
10 
 
One other fact, Chair, is that Regiments a different company 
name within the Regiments stable is also the asset manager or one of 
the asset manager’s of this Transnet Second Defined Pension Fund.  
So they acted as advisor to Transnet, they then act as the executor of 
the transaction with Nedbank and Transnet, on the other side they’re 
acting as the asset manager for the pension fund and for me Chair, in 
my opinion Regiments were conflicted in their functions on many  levels. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    And having paid in all those different 
roles. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     In their different roles they 
20 
were being paid by different entities.  Some of them directly and others 
in-directly with the inclusion of the 20 basis points in the rate and I 
think, that for us, looking at that Executives across all of the entities 
should have identified this as an immediate red flag and also Chair I 
must also state that Transnet is conducting a detailed review of this 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 84 of 182 
 
transaction with the pension fund, the implications thereof and also the 
entire process around which some of these were managed at the time 
and subsequently we have also in the recent days read about a very 
significant transaction that was done on the 9 t h of December 2015, the 
date on which a specific Finance Minister was removed and another 
appointed which, in some essence from the information that we 
currently have impacts the Transnet Second Defined Pension Fund as 
well.  So the total flow of this Chair, is stil l a matter that is under 
review from Transnet’s perspective.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Can we now move on to deal with the 
10 
1064 locomotive deferral options starting from paragraph 5.7 of your 
statement and firstly give us a background facts pertaining to that 
deferral. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   During the latter part of 2015 
the signing of the 1064 contract – now the consequences of this were 
being felt in the business in the sense that we had paid, as I stated at 
that time, significant upfront deposi ts with not many locomotives by this 
time being received.  This was causing a lot of challenges in the 
liquidity position at Transnet and Mr Pita, the then Group Chief 
Financial Officer at the time contacted my office and asked that we 
20 
assist in understanding the consequences and implications if Transnet 
were to defer the delivery schedule with the current OEM’s.  It was a 
request that obviously, when we looked at it, meant that we would be 
going back to the six-year delivery schedule that was originally 
envisioned in the business case largely.  However we were also 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 85 of 182 
 
informed, at the time, by the Group CFO that the Regiments team were 
working and reviewing what the costs may be if we extended these 
contracts further.  In addition the Regiments team were also 
considering a number of different options giving due consideration to 
the (indistinct) of volume at the time, they were looking at whether 
there were opportunities to lease some of these locomotives to other 
parts of the Continent, creating special purpose  vehicles for sale of 
excess locomotives etcetera, these were just some of the different 
options that apparently the Regiments team were looking at, as I was 
informed by the CFO. 
10 
 
On the 26 t h of February 2016 one of the employees at 
Regiments submitted estimated calculations to my office to say that the 
possible, maximum deferral cost for another two years would be a 
further 13billion rand.  Chair this would have been on top of the 
54billion rand.  My team and I were not aware of which contractual 
mandate this team at Regiments was working on, however, at the time I 
commissioned the Mckinsey team to review the Regiments proposals 
and consider all of the different nuisances of any potential deferral of 
the delivery programme.  The McKinsey team were contracte d under 
what was then called SWAT2 at no additional cost it was within the 
20 
contract that was established. 
 
Chair there is a submission in the document that talks to the 
process that we followed and all of the different options that were 
considered, however, to put a shortened version on the table, we had 
considered all of the current – at the time, the current progress that 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 86 of 182 
 
was being made or lack of it with the original equipment manufacturers 
and there were significant challenges that each one of them was facing.  
Some of them to date, have not yet been resolved. We had provided, to 
the Group Chief Financial Officer in writing that there was absolutely no 
need for us to engage with original equipment manufacturers to incur 
additional cost giving considerati on to the production challenges that a 
few of them were facing and in some cases some of the OEM’s had not 
even commenced production in South Africa.  So based on that we had, 
I would say, concluded and informed the Group Chief Financial Officer 
that nothing should happen.  The reason we put this on the table is 
10 
because there was a submission from Regiments that supposed a 
13billion rand increment in the cost of the locomotives which we are 
grateful was not implemented at any point that is the reason for th is. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Did you question at this stage as to 
how Regiments was appointed?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Yes we did, we to date have 
not receive any response at that time we were not aware of which 
contract they were working on. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes, now can you proceed (indistinct) 
SWAT contracts with McKinsey and Regiments?  
20 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair as I made an effort 
yesterday to explain the concept of SWAT, this was just the project that 
was created to assist Transnet at the time in making sure that the 
capital portfolio was something that was achievable and that it was 
within the constraints of the various functions within Transnet whether 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 87 of 182 
 
it was an executable portfolio, considering that it was quite a 
significant portfolio at the time.  At points the portfolio was over 
340billion and it was something that we needed to manage.  I think the 
rationale for SWAT1, essentially was also – I think also it’s important to 
point out that SWAT1 was envisaged in 2012,  there was an open tender 
process, there was a whole lot of work that was done in 2012, I was not 
present in 2012 in this particular function, I only joined this 
department, as I said, around February 2013 when the – it was in the 
final stages of contracting with McKinsey. 
 
I think the key issue was that the team – there wasn’t a very 
10 
significant team in Transnet at that point and there weren’t very strict 
and formalised processes around the capital projects and capital 
programmes of Transnet.  The key obje ctives for McKinsey at the time, 
for SWAT1 were that they had to formulate a capital strategy, they had 
to define the capital portfolio of Transnet, as I said, look at whether 
there were opportunities to optimise this portfolio, it was 340billion but 
we had to look at it in terms of affordability at Transnet, cash 
availability and all of the financial ratios and also look at whether this 
portfolio was doable and when I say doable meaning, could it be 
executed within the then strategy of Transnet called MDS,  the Market 
20 
Demand Strategy.  We attached in the documents some of the benefits 
at the time that were achieved which were signed off by the then Group 
CFO as well as the Group Chief Executive.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    May I (indistinct) to page 499, it is 
folder number 29 Chair. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 88 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:     Thank you. 
MR ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    Are you there Mr Mahomedy?    
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Could you please identify that 
document? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair it’s a memorandum 
that’s addressed from Mr Anoj Singh to the then Group Chief Financial 
Officer, to Mr Brian Molefe, the then Group Executive of Transnet.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Is it the one that you’re referencing in 
your testimony? 
10 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Yes Chair, the purpose of 
this submission is to notify the Group Chief Executive of the capital 
portfolio savings and benefits of the McKinsey led consortium engaged 
in the capital optimisation SWAT initiative.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    And you’re also involved in this 
transaction? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Yes I was involved in the 
management of this contract and the McKinsey and Regiments teams 
essentially reported into my office for the execution of SWAT1 and the 
next programme which was called SWAT2.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    And SWAT was that and acronym for anything?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    It was just a combination of letters?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     I’ll have to ask somebody 
who was there at the time Chair, this was something that was defined in 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 89 of 182 
 
2012 but it has, from what I’ve checked it has no specific – the 
abbreviation is not a representative of any specific nature.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    And if you may turn now to page 506, 
Chair that is MSM13, it should be the folder number 13.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    And also for completeness just take us 
– identify the document and take us through the contents thereof in 
summary. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair I think this relates to 
10 
what we call – it’s a document from myself to the McKinsey led 
consortium at the time specifying very detailed what the billing and 
invoice processes should entail specifically in terms of who should be  
issuing the invoice, who should review the invoice, where it gets the 
proof of payment etcetera, quite clearly stated to both the McKinsey 
teams as well as the Regiments teams that were in the organisation at 
the time.  This becomes more relevant as we go  further down the 
document Chair, there is reason for this but it’s actually just 
highlighting exactly what process was implemented at that time, who 
would be the responsible manager, what would they prepare there 
20 
would be a detailed benefits memo, we woul d have an understanding of 
how far they are in  a particular piece of the contract etcetera, all that 
was relayed through this particular memo, making sure that there was 
an appropriate process for the approval of invoices for this particular 
project. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 90 of 182 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes, can you then take us through the 
other contracts involving McKinsey and Regiments as per your 
paragraph 5.9? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair I think there were a 
number of other projects...(intervention).  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    And the reason why are you 
highlighting them in this statement?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     I think it’s key to – for me to 
provide full transparency of my role with teams from McKinsey, 
Regiments over the period of my tenure at Transnet.  There were a 
10 
number of projects that Regiments and McKinsey were involved in, as I 
put out the SWAT1 and SWAT2 these are two separate contracts, two 
separate projects, then there was the Manganese Support contract and 
I will touch on that just now and the NNPP project which was the new 
multi-purpose pipeline.  These were significantly large capital projects 
that were under execution or getting close to  execution and my role as 
the General Manager at the time of Group Capital Integration and 
Assurance was to look at some of these projects and whether we were 
ready for the execution of these projects and the NNPP was to address 
some of the challenges.  At the time the NNPP project was termed a 
20 
project in distress, there was significant challenges to that proj ect 
depends who you speak to the costs had escalated exponentially from 
the originally envisaged business case at the time which was written 
many years before that. There was a risk of security of supply to the 
inland of our country, the project was experi encing delays that were 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 91 of 182 
 
going on, not for months but they were now going on for years and 
Mckinsey was brought in at that time to assist, together with 
Regiments, to assist to try to bring this project back online. It was at 
that time, in 2014 before the locomotive contracts, it was about the 
biggest single investment Transnet was going to be involved in which 
was ranging between 25 and 30billion rand, so that’s the context of that 
particular one. 
 
The Manganese project was also, at that time, envisaged to 
cost Transnet anything in the region of between 15 and 26billion rand, 
the McKinsey consortium were brought in to assist with preparation to 
10 
make sure that the project was viable, it was ready for execution.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    And how were they appointed, the 
Mckinsey consortium?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     As far as I’m aware these 
contracts were also through confinement.  Now in my particular role in 
these it would have been, in one case, to integrate the different entities 
that would have been involved in the – in these particular projects to 
assist McKinsey in coordinating all of the stakeholders and the reason 
being that if we look at Manganese for example, it spread across a 
number of operating divisions within Transnet including Transnet 
20 
Freight Rail, the Ports Authority as well as the Port Terminal Operator. 
So to assist in making sure that there was  an integrated solution that 
was put on the table I would have played quite a role in integrating the 
key stakeholders of the various divisi ons. 
 
We would also have been involved in looking at the 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 92 of 182 
 
governance processes and making sure, from a capital perspective not 
a procurement perspective, that these projects were moving in the right 
direction and ultimately one of the key accountabilities w as to always 
look at making sure the project could be delivered at the right value 
with the value engineering and that’s largely the role that we would 
have played in a number of other transactions that involved McKinsey 
and Regiments. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    We are now going to spend much more 
time on the next topic where you are dealing now with the relevant 
issues pertaining to Trillian from page 27 paragraph 5.10 can you trace 
10 
those events from 25 t h February 2016, you may proceed to outline 
those facts for us. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:    Chairperson, I think it’s also, 
here, relevant to give some context as I spoke about the SWAT2 
contract, that was between Transnet and the heads of agreement was 
with McKinsey and at the time we were informed that  the supplier 
development partner was Regiments.  On the 25 t h of February 2016, 
Chair, if I may reference the Commission to the index MSM31 page 511.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    It’s folder 31 Chair. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Folder 31, under the pa ge 
20 
number 511, I received an email from an employee of Regiments on the 
25 t h of February 2016 at approximately 22h45pm and I will read this 
mail it says – it’s from an employee at Regiments Ms Fahima Badat on 
the 25 t h of February as I said to undisclosed r ecipients, I was one of 
those recipients and it says, 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 93 of 182 
 
 
“Good evening I trust that you are well.  This email is to inform 
 
you that my email address will be changing effective 1 s t March 
 
2016 to Fahima.Badat@tcp.co.za. as a consequence of the 
 
partnership re-configuration the Regiments Advisory Business 
 
Unit will form part of a new group of companies Trillian Capital 
 
Partners.  We remain committed to exceptional client service 
 
during the transition.  Please us e my new email address going 
 
forward, kind regards”. 
 
Chair on the 25 t h of...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it says to undisclosed recipients that’s what the 
10 
author would have written?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:    No Chair they would have 
blind-carboned it to a whole lot of people so it wouldn’t actually reflect 
who it’s actually sent to but it was sent to me, amongst others.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes so the part that says undisclosed recipients 
would have been put by whom?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That’s because there wasn’t a 
specific individual that was – it was sent to from an email perspective 
Chair from the system so this is just a system...(intervention).    
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh so this is what the system says when you don’t 
20 
...(intervention). 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     When you blind-carbon. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh okay so but whatever the author would have 
done he or she – it’s a she is that right – she didn’t want the recipients 
to be known, is that right?  
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 94 of 182 
 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     That’s correct Chair so I’m 
not sure who it was written to, all I’m aware of that I was one of the 
people. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay thank you and you knew the author?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Before that? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     This was an individual who 
worked at the – at Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes okay. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:    And had also worked on the 
10 
SWAT1 and SWAT2 projects.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright thank you.    
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   Chair within ten minutes of 
receiving that email I then forwarded that email to certain key partners 
and principals at McKinsey.  Namely Mr Prakash Parbhoo, Mr David 
Fine and Mr Kannan Lakmeeharan...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you proceed you say tha t this was the author 
of this email was somebody at Regiments?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was involved in work relating to Swat 2?  
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How – what was her position?  I just want to see how 
high she was in the Regiments hierarchy?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I would not actually be 
able to confirm that but she was one of the seniors.  
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 95 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  One of the senior people. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That was on the project yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  You may proceed.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC SC:  But at this stage Mr Mahomedy did 
you encounter Trillian before?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  This will be the first time?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  We had not encountered 
Trillian.  We heard that there were – at this point we heard there were 
rumblings of some discomfort within the Regiments space.  We did not 
10 
know about Trillian.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And therefore I think the first 
thing or the first action from my side was to send it to the heads of 
agreement partner being McKinsey.  And as I said I addressed – I 
literally just sent this mail on directly to them to the various – Mr Pabo 
was one of the key principles in Swat 2.  Doctor Fine was one of the 
partners and Mr Lakmeeharan was also one of the principles at the time 
on the Swat 2 contract. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  We sent it for information to 
them. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  You were just about to tell us as to what 
you did after receiving this email?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair subsequent to that I 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 96 of 182 
 
forwarded the email to Mr Garry Pita and Mr Edward Thomas amongst 
others but these were the two key individuals.  Mr Pita being the Group 
Chief Financial Officer and Mr Edward Thomas being the Group Supply 
Chain Officer, the head of procurement requesting their guidance as in 
my view at the time I said no procurement relationship existed with this 
new entity called Trillian.  Again as I stated to them the Swat 2 
engagement at the time was signed with McKinsey and Regiments as …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry are you reading from an email you sent to 
them? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No Chair I am reading from 
10 
my statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh from your statement okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  On page 27. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Paragraph 5.10.2. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  .2 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair as I said on the 1 
March after sending this mail requesting guidance around the 
procurement issue because Trillian were not mentioned in any 
20 
correspondence as far as I was aware of around the McKinsey contract.  
And I followed up and escalated the matter because I did not receive 
any response.  I followed up and escalated the matter further to Mr Pita 
at a team meeting where I was informed that McKinsey was in the 
process of replacing Regiments with Trillian.  This was the feedback 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 97 of 182 
 
that was provided to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but – so McKinsey was not completely gone from 
the picture? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  No Chair and the – in 
February 2016 they still had the Swat 2 contract which was continuing.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  They were still there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  But then this problem with 
Regiments came about. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Then we receive a note to 
say that Trillian is coming into the picture.  We follow this up.  We get 
told that there is a process between McKinsey and Trillian to replace 
Regiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  However I cannot remember 
exactly but there was a letter that was circulated to my offi ce by the 
McKinsey partnership at the time which was dated the 23 February 
2016 which I annex as Folder 32 on page 513.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair this letter is signed by 
two directors of McKinsey and addressed to Mr Garry P ita.  And in this 
document they make clear that we have been informed – sorry Chair I 
am reading on page 514. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 98 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Towards the middle of this 
particular page. 
“We have been informed that Regiments Capitals 
management 
advisory 
business 
is 
transitioning 
ownership to Trillian Capital Partners.  They will be 
subject to the ownership composition management 
and staff composition and capability criteria above.  
We are not able to commence a relationship with 
Trillian or any other partner or sub-contractor until 
10 
these criteria have been met and approved by our 
global risk and legal teams.”  
What is clear is that on the 23 February 2014 – 2016 McKinsey had 
already given clear indication to the then CFO Mr Garry Pita that th ey 
had made no decision on engaging with Trillian.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yet on the 1 March 2016 
when I escalated the matter I was told that there was a discussion 
between McKinsey and – in the – they were in the proc ess of replacing 
Regiments with Trillian.  Chair further to that on the 10 May 2016 under 
20 
Folder 33 page 517 there was a special acquisitions and disposals 
committee meeting which was held.   
CHAIRPERSON:  That is now a committee of the board?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 99 of 182 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  This committee approved the 
session of certain contracts from Regiments to Trillian.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Can you read for us paragraph 5.2?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It says: 
“Firstly this is the special acquisitions and disposals 
committee meeting held on the 10 May 2016 
resolution number 5.2 – my apologies sorry item 
number 5.2 session between Regiments and Trillian.  
Resolved that the committee approved.  
The session of the contract from Regiments Limited 
10 
PTY Limited to Trillian Capital Partners being 
satisfied that the BBBE status is not affected.  The 
increase 
in 
scope 
for 
the 
detailed 
capital 
optimisation services and the increase in contract 
value from R375 million to R463.3 million and the 
contract extension on the 30 September 2016 to the 
31 March 2018 subject to zero budget implications 
for the company.” 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now before you comment on the 
contents of that approval as per resolution tha t you have just read now 
20 
when this acquisition disposal committee approved or purported to 
approve the session do you know whether they were furnished with any 
sessionary agreement between the parties?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  As far as we have revie wed 
all of the documents Chair we have not come across a formal session 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 100 of 182 
 
agreement. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And this body was it aware that Trillian 
had not submitted any tender to Transnet in order for it to provide 
these services? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAH OMEDY:  In terms of what was 
submitted to this body for approval was again – once again a 
memorandum that was presented to the board acquisition disposals 
committee which I have under Folder 34 but that was all.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it Folder 34? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Does it – I am going there.  Does it purport to 
tell the committee what the terms and conditions of the session were 
going to be? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  Chair as far as I have 
reviewed this document it does not go into a detailed discussion on the 
terms of the session but rather focusses on a letter I think that is – well 
that was annexed to this document at the time.  It is not annexed to 
this particular memorandum.  On page 521.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The 
20 
bottom 
and 
it 
just 
states 
that:  
“On the 13 April 2016 Mr Eric Wood sent a letter to 
Transnet Annexure B indicating that he is ceding his 
rights received from Regiments to Trillian Capital 
Partners effective 1 March 2016.  Trillian – Transnet 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 101 of 182 
 
then initiated its vendor process and there is no 
reason why Trillian cannot be a vendor to Transnet.”  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And that was all? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That is what is being – what 
is stated here. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And at that stage Mr Mahomedy do you 
know whether any due diligence was conducted in relation to Trillian 
who is now going to acquire the services that were initially performed 
by McKinsey? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair on page 521.1, 521 .1 
10 
the very next page there is an attempt to explain that where they say 
that the EME affidavit provided for the level 2 BBBE certification 
indicated that they are 60% black owned.  The shareholding of Trillian 
Holdings Pty Limited 60% wholly owned by Mr S alim Essa.  [Indistinct] 
Pty Limited Pty Limited 25% wholly owned by Mr Eric Wood.  Daniel 
Benjamin Roy 1.8%.  Jan Johannes Fourie 1.2%.  Another company 
which is I think pronounced Arium Nominees 12%.  A holding vehicle 
whose shares will be transferred to  staff at a later stage.  And the 
directors of this company were Eric Anthony Wood, Tebogo Leballo, 
Jeffrey Irvine Afriat at the time.  And he just goes on to explain that 
20 
Trillian or the company its shareholders are nought on the Transnet list 
of excluded tenderers. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  So Trillian was going to take those 
services from Regiments by merely that letter and the memorandum 
that you have indicated to the Chair and nothing more.  No 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 102 of 182 
 
procurement, no committee having reviewed any of the relevant 
documents. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That is correct.  But I would 
like to add. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  In terms of point number 17 
on this memorandum just mid-way through that or it says: 
“There is a requirement for the scope of the 
contract.” 
The second sentence Chairperson. 
10 
“There is a requirement for the scope of the contract 
to be increased to include the full ambit of the 
capital 
optimisation 
programme 
and 
to include 
increase the value of the contract  by the unspent…” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry you have lost me, where are you reading 
from? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  Chair I am still on page 
521.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It is point number 17. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright thank you. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  My apologies Chair. 
“There is a requirement for the scope of the contract 
to be increased to include the full ambit of the 
capital optimisation programme and to increase the 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 103 of 182 
 
value of the contract by the unspent portio n of the 
previous capital optimisation contract of R88.3 
million.  That contract is the previous capital 
optimisation contract is what we call Swat 2.”  
I will give some context to that now Chair.  
“And 
to 
increase 
the 
contract 
date 
from 
30 
September to the 31 March.” 
So essentially there were two particular sessions.  The one was what 
was commonly called the General Freight Optimisation Programme 
which was heads of agreement was with Regiments.  As per point 17 it 
10 
talks about the capital optimisation contrac t.  And they talk about the 
unspent portion of R88 million.  This contract heads of agreement was 
with McKinsey.  As far as I am aware there has been no indication from 
McKinsey written or otherwise in a form of an agreement or a letter that 
ceded this contract to Trillian.  So there were two parts of this that we 
have to keep in mind.  It was not just one session.  It was essentially in 
my humble opinion two sessions.  One was the General Freight 
Contract which Regiments were the heads of agreement with an d that is 
a purported session that they talk about.  But the second one is the 
Capital Optimisation Contract which at the time was the heads of 
20 
agreement was with McKinsey.  In addition as far as my memory serves 
that contract terminated in April 2016 whic h makes it strange that in 
May 2016 we see the contract that is essentially terminated. It – from  
CHAIRPERSON:  Purported to be ceded?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 104 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It is purported to be ceded. 
Firstly there is no indication from McKinsey that they ceded this 
contract to anybody because the contract terminated if my memory 
serves me correctly I think it was the 8 April 2016.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  A month later there is a 
document that purports to cede that part of the contract to Trillian.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  But there was also this increase 
10 
scope of capital optimisation of R88.3 million was that subjected to any 
formal tender or procurement within  Transnet? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No as far as I am concerned 
there was not even a request for that service because at that time this 
particular activity rested within the confines of my department.  We 
were not even aware that there was this requirement or submission that 
was being made on our behalf.  But as I said there was a contract that 
previously existed which terminated in April 2016 that talks to this little 
piece that is called ‘increase scope for capital optimisation’ but there 
was no procurement event, no. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now I pose this question to you at the 
time when we are still on page 517 dealing with what was approved in 
paragraph 5.2 and I wish to invite your comment on that paragraph?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Well Chair I think again you 
know for me it is a purported session. The documents that were 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 105 of 182 
 
submitted did not carry a session agreement.  There were would be a 
number of questions that one could ask around the due diligence of 
Trillian at that point in time.  B ut again also whether it was even 
appropriate that we could have as management and the management 
who submitted this submission made the claims that were did around 
the value, the session as well as the increased scope of R83 million.  
CHAIRPERSON:  This session referred to in Item 5.2 at page 157 that 
is a resolution of the acquisition or special acquisitions and disposals 
committee of the board does not the wording – does not refer to an 
approval in principle or approval of a session in principle which is 
10 
different from approving the actual  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Session. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Session and to the extent that that is a correct 
reading of that resolution then one would say how could the committee 
approve a session without seeing the actual ses sion where the terms 
and conditions would be set out.  And you have said that you – through 
your process of reviewing all these transactions and looking at all kinds 
of documents you have been unable to come across the actual 
agreement, the actual session. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair that is correct.  And to 
20 
your previous point Chair I agree whole heartedly because as the 
executives and non-executive directors of the business the key issue is 
one has to understand the terms and conditions of that s ession to 
ensure that the session was not going to put Transnet through any 
undue risk. That would have been expected of the – of that committee 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 106 of 182 
 
as well as the executives who made this – the submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  However there is a single 
letter as far as I am aware that says:  Mr Wood is proposing that this 
be ceded.  The problem with that is that he is a member of Regiments 
at the time and he is a member of Trillian later on as well so again one 
could question this from a – many different conflict angles as well.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Because the importance of an in principle decision is 
where the board or the committee might be saying in principle we 
approve negotiations for a session but in the end we must see the 
10 
session and then see whether we in the light of the terms and 
conditions we approve. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you cannot – it is difficult to see how you can 
approve an agreement without seeing the terms and conditions of the 
agreement.   
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  But could this be the services that one 
could simple cede without having to really invite tenders and ensure 
20 
that there is an open, fair, transparent, comp etitive procurement 
system?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No that is clearly not 
apparent in the process that was followed here.  It was merely a 
transfer of a contract from one entity to another with no procurement 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 107 of 182 
 
event.  If that entity was not going to actually execute the transactions 
you would have had to have gone back and asked why because there 
was a contract in place for that entity to deliver in this Regiments 
whatever the deliverables were expected.  So it does not from a 
procurement perspective  it does not necessarily make sense that we 
would have just ceded over a contract without understanding the 
session agreement, without understanding the risks to Transnet.  
Without assessing whether there was a need to actually go out on a 
new procurement event instead of just – so this was essentially for 
want of a better phrase Chair and would like not – this is not part of a 
10 
procurement principle in Transnet but it became a confidential confined 
session.  That is really what happened here because this en tity came 
out of nowhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well a question which I asked Mr Volmink last week 
when he gave his evidence was whether a session is compatible with 
the whole idea of tenders or procurement because the idea of 
procurement of a tender is that:  
1. The body issuing the tender Transnet in this case wants to get 
the best service for as reasonably priced as possible for the 
cheapest price they can get out of the market.  Sometimes they 
20 
may be certain factors that are taken into account but basically 
that is where you start from you know.  If two companies are 
going to give you a service that is equal and one offers you a 
cheaper price than the other you go for the one with the cheaper 
price.  Excuse me.  There may be factors where you may led you 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 108 of 182 
 
to [indistinct] tamper with that but that is the starting point.  And 
now but then the other factor is that you have an obligation to 
ensure that who you give business to is dealt with transparently 
to avoid corruption.  And one of the factors you have to take into 
account is can they deliver?   
2. You want to see a lot of things about their credibility and so on 
and so on and you will invite different people to tender.  And if – 
and nobody who meets the requirements is excluded as long as 
you meet the requirements you may put in your bid.  So if now 
having gone through that process you are going – and you have 
10 
chosen a particular service provider and then before they can 
finish the job they saying well we will give this job to somebody 
else and from now on it is so and so that will do this job.  It does 
not seem that it is compatible with the whole idea of a tender.  It 
seems that a service provider which for one or other reason 
realises that they can no longer perform in accordance with the 
contract should be – should come back and say we have 
difficulties we cannot perform and then you as the business must 
then decide how that should be dealt with and it may well be that 
you should put out a tender for somebody who can finish that job.  
20 
So I do not know whether you are able to say anything on this 
but the more I think about it the more it seems to me that the 
whole idea of a session is incompatible with the whole idea of 
tenders and open and transparent processes that are required by 
Section 217 of The Constitution and o ur procurement legislation.

MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair if I may comment on 
that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I appreciate that maybe some of this might be 
law. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you might not be able to express a view bu t I just 
give you a chance to comment if you want to.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair earlier in my testimony 
we talk of the McKinsey consortium on 1064 advisory.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And we mention that 
because there was a change in the consortium composition that 
process was deemed irregular.  It would hold the same principle in my 
view in terms of the consortium in this case here was Regiments and 
McKinsey became Trillian with McKinsey being excluded.  And you bring 
in this case even further you remove Regiments as the entity, the 
juristic entity that the contract was entered into with and replace them 
with an entity that is completely different.  To Advocate Mokoena’s 
point as well I think it is important that when we tal k about the due 
diligence did we do a due diligence on the capacity and capability of 
20 
this entity to execute exactly what was originally envisaged in the 
contracts.  And that question remains unanswered or is absent in terms 
of the memorandum.  And I think Chair to opine on what you have just 
put out I think that it is not compatible to have sessions as you would 
bring in – you could bring in significant undue risk to – into a 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 110 of 182 
 
procurement event that was essentially de -risked at the time of the 
event.  There could be a whole host of other matters that we will have 
to look at but I think this particular session is flawed fundamentally 
because the consortium that had put in the bid was McKinsey and – or 
at the time Regiments and McKinsey and that was fundamenta lly 
changed firstly by  removing McKinsey and then replacing them with 
Trillian.  So I think that I support some of your views Chair.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  May I refer you to page 28, 28 of 
your statement. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  With particular reference to paragraph 
5.10.5.3 where you state that where it was stated by the ADC that there 
was an increase in contract value of GFB contract from 375 million to 
463.3 million.  Do you know which contract are they ref erring to here? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes there is a – there was a 
contract called General Freight Optimisation.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Which I believe the heads of 
agreement was between Transnet and Regiments  with McKinsey as a 
partner or a supply development partner to that – to Regiments. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  But they were now going to be performed 
by 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Trillian. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Trillian? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 111 of 182 
 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  And when that scope of that magnitude 
was been envisaged also that component did not go to any procurement 
of any tender processes?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  As far as I am aware the 
initial contract to Regiments was also a confinement. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
So 
it went 
through a 
confinement process but this increase in scope did not go through any 
procurement activities. 
ADV PHILLIP MAKOENA SC:  Yes.  Chair would this be an appropriate 
10 
time to adjourn for lunch?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, let us take the lunch adjournment and we will 
resume at two.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready Mr Mokoena?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Chair we are ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, proceed. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Chair before we proceed with the 
20 
remaining paragraphs under that heading that we were dealing with 
before the lunch adjournment we managed to trace some of the 
documents which the Chair requested us to locate, we beg leave to 
hand in the memorandum dated the 2 n d December 2015 and also the 
letter dated the 16 t h of March 2016.  We will then try to locate – Chair 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 112 of 182 
 
we propose subject to your directions that the memorandum dated the 
2 n d December 2015 be inserted immediately after the documents in 
folder number 24, because it makes sense, that’s where they feed in in 
terms of chronology and the evidence of Mr Mahomedy and subject to 
your directions to mark them as page 462.1 to page 462.3.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh this memorandum that has just been handed up is 
not Mr Ramosebudi’s memorandum that we discussed earlier?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    It’s not Chair we will lead the witness 
through this memorandum then you’ll follow the sense is the one whic h 
was advising against the swap and it was only referenced in an email 
10 
but we did not have the memorandum itself.  So if Chair could go to 
folder number 24. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes that’s where I am. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    What I’m looking at is when you said it’s a 
memorandum dated 2 December I thought it would be the memorandum 
that Mr Mahomedy told me about which had preceded Mr Ramosebudi’s 
memo which was taking a position in relation to interest rate swaps that 
was 
directly 
agains t 
the 
position 
taken 
by 
Mr 
Ramosebudi...(intervention). 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   This is the memorandums Chair if you 
look at the sequence...(intervention).  
MR 
MOHAMED 
SULEMAN 
MAHOMEDY: 
 
(Indistinct) 
from 
Mr 
Ramosebudi.    
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    No Chair if you go to the last page, 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 113 of 182 
 
page 463 – 462.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page?    
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    461 – oh the document that we’ve just 
handed to you Chair, of the document that we’ve just handed to the 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    And then go to the last page of that 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Mr Mahomedy will explain to you that 
10 
this was in fact a document by Mr Denis Smit, the Group Treasurer.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    And he’ll explain to you as to why you 
find the name of Mr Gary Pita and Mr Ramosebudi but he’ll do that 
through his evidence, you’ll follow it.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Oh okay alright. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes so this is the one that 
precedes...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     Oh okay so where should we slot this one in?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    This one should go immediately after 
20 
page 460. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Shouldn’t it come before page 457 in terms of the 
dates in comes before and in terms of the logic of the story it seems to 
be long before?   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Chair we can then amend the page to 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 114 of 182 
 
become 457.1 instead.  
CHAIRPERSON:     What should we mark it page?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Page 457.1 and then we’ll number the 
following pages as 457.2 and 457.3 in order to follow that chronology 
and the sequence. 
CHAIRPERSON:     We’ll mark it MSM – or should we make a reference 
to MSM or not? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   MSM457.1, the only thing is that in the affidavit does 
he refer to such a memo?     
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    No Chair he doesn’t refer to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay we’ll slot it in with the understanding that it’s 
not a memo referred to in his affidavit but it should have been referred 
to and it belongs immediately before the one that is at page MSM457 
but you have said that we must put .2 for the other one.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    For the next page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes for the next...(intervention).   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes and the other page should be .3 so 
that we are able to follow in terms of reference.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay now let’s – the new memo the first page on 
20 
the new memo is MSM457.1. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Must I then say 2, 3 for the next one?    
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 115 of 182 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    457.2 and 457.3, the last page. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Is – has the witnesses one already been taken care 
of? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and then the one tha t was – that is 457 
remains as 457 or do we do anything to it?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    That will go to folder now – if you go to 
folder number 25 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    You’ll see that’s where on page 464 Mr 
10 
Mahomedy is referencing a number of emails and they go up until the 
last email which is on page 470 therefore we are proposing that this 
one document, it should be page 470.1.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Are you talking about the letter now?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    The letter Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I’m not there yet.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Oh you’re still on the memo?  
CHAIRPERSON:     I’m still on the memo we have marked the new 
memo MSM457.1 up to 3. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:     And I think we have agreed that it should come 
immediately before MSM457. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Definitely. 
CHAIRPERSON:     So my question was whether we should leave 
MSM457 as it is in terms of the numbering of the page or whether we 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 116 of 182 
 
should put any new thing. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    No Chair...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You want us to leave it like that?     
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay this will have to be punched then in due course 
okay then you say we – in regard to the letter...(intervention). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    The letter should go immediately after 
page MSM470 which is the last email in the sequence of those 
correspondence. 
CHAIRPERSON:     And you suggest that it should be MSM what?  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    470.1 so that it doesn’t tamper with any 
other numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay, alright thank you, yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes Chair, having done that then we 
can proceed to place them properly by means of evidence of Mr 
Mahomedy.  Mr Mahomedy earlier on, with re ference to folder number 
24...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     Maybe just before you proceed because there is a 
context to the new memo or are you going to go back to it at some 
stage with the witness?  
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes that’s what I’m...(inter vention).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay I wanted to – ja that’s fine then.    
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC : With referenced to folder 24 which is 
page MSM457 you indicated that there was a memo – this was the 
memo by Mr Ramosebudi which was despatched to Mr Gary Pita, do 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 117 of 182 
 
you recall? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   Yes.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    And  you also referred to a 
memorandum preceding this one wherein there was a clear advice not 
to make a – an interest rate swap do you recall that?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Unfortunately that document was not 
part of the papers and you have now since located that document, am I 
correct? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Yes. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Now may I refer you to MSM457.1 and 
please identify that document. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair it’s a memorandum 
which is unsigned but attached which was Annexed to an email from Mr 
Danie Smit to Mr Ramosebudi and Mr Pita which is titled, “12billion 
rand club loan interest rate, risk explanation” and dated the 2 n d of 
December 2015. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes but when you look on the fact of 
that document it says to Gary Pita acting Group Chief Financial Officer 
then it says from Phetolo Ramosebudi Group Treasurer.  Can you 
20 
explain how do you come to the conclusion that it was in fact from Mr 
Danie Smit? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:    Chair as I testified earlier 
the email that was sent on the 2 n d of December 2015 at 10h30am from 
Mr Danie Smit which is evidence pack 462 where he s tates, my humble 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 118 of 182 
 
opinion on the interest rate exposure of the club loan and as you will 
note there, there was a document attached to that email, this is the 
document that was attached to that email.  So it was essentially 
prepared as is stated on the docum ent on page 457.3 that it was 
compiled by Danie Smit and it was supposed to have been then 
recommended by Mr Ramosebudi for submission to – for approval by 
the then acting Group Chief Financial Officer and we are now aware 
that, that document did not get a pproved. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I think you said Mr Danie Smit reported to Mr 
Ramosebudi, is that right?  
10 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So Mr Danie Smit would have prepared a – this 
document on the basis that it would be – it would go, ultimately to Mr 
Gary Pita but after Mr Ramosebudi had signed it – had signed it to say 
he was recommending what was said in the memo.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Yes Chair, that would have 
been the flow ordinarily. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes so the intention was that in effect Mr Danie Smit 
and Mr Ramosebudi would be making a recommendation to Mr Gary 
Pita and that the recommendation would be based and supported by the 
20 
contents of the memo.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:    That is correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But if Mr Ramosebudi did not agree with it then he 
could amend it or change it or whatever but Mr Danie Smit prepared it 
on the basis that he and Mr Ramosebudi would agree but as it turned 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 119 of 182 
 
out Mr Ramosebudi does not appear to have agreed.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, alright. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    Now may I refer you to page 457.2 of 
that memorandum that we’ve just introduced into evidence and take us 
what Mr Danie Smit says under the heading, conclusion ? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:    Chair under the conclusion 
point number 14 of this memorandum it states,  
 
“it is recommended that the club loan not be switched to a 
 
fixed rate exposure by means of an interest rate swap due to 
10 
 
the following:  if there was a definite need to fix the rate 
 
during the finalisation of the club loan, the loan should have 
 
been dealt as fixed as any swap will create an amount of 
 
volatility in the income statement due to fair value movements 
 
which could be minimised by the a pplication of hedge 
 
accounting.  Interest rate swaps will use massive credit lines 
 
from banks which is not that freely available over a 15 year 
 
tenure and these lines are required to hedge foreign exchange 
 
related exposures due to the MDS requirements. Swaps will 
 
come at a cost which need to be determined in the market.  
20 
 
Liquidity for the 12billion will have to be tested in the market.  
 
There is currently a gap of around 200 basis points between 
 
the cost of a floating rate and the indicative cost to  fix and 
 
based on the forecasts from BER and the additional pressure 
 
the cost of swapping to fixed will create, on the cash interest 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 120 of 182 
 
 
cover ratio of the Group.  It is not recommended to swap the 
 
club loan from floating to fixed”.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    So this was the advice conveyed by Mr 
Danie Smit to Mr Ramosebudi?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    And despite this advice you’ve already 
testified that we know that the swap were executed.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     That is correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes now...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     This memo gives reasons of motivation why it was 
10 
not a good idea in the view of Mr Danie Smit to swap interest rates 
regime from floating interest rate regime to a fi xed interest rate regime 
and – but we know that about two days later – is it two days later Mr 
Ramosebudi prepared a document that was saying that there should be 
a swap.  Now have you had the chance to look at the reasons given by 
both these memo for the different positions they take and are you able 
to say whether or not the one that Mr Ramosebudi sent to Mr Pita 
whether it does reflect that he had an answer for the arguments in the 
other memo. In other words does his memo tell us that he did consider 
the various arguments against a swap and he had an answer for those 
20 
arguments and that’s why he went ahead and didn’t agree with Mr 
Danie Smit’s position? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Chair we have had a chance to look at 
the two, the peculiar thing is that if you look at the two memo’s the two 
memorandums under discussion points 4 to 8 is essentially, largely a 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 121 of 182 
 
copy and paste from one memo to the other which actually doesn’t 
make sense because the one memorandum is saying you shouldn’t be 
actually executing this and the other – the memorandum on the 3 r d of 
December says you should but there are some slight nuisances that 
have been amended, so that’s the first thing but the second thing is 
that...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry just to get that, did you say from what, 2 to 
8?   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Chair points 4, if you look at both 
memorandum point 4...(intervention).  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:     On each one? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Point 8 or 10 on 457.1 it’s 
point 4 to 10 has largely been copied an d pasted into memorandum 
number 457 from point 4 to 8 with some minor tweaks.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes and that’s the discussion part.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay and I see that on the purpose Mr Danie Smit’s 
one has got one purpose, Mr Ramosebudi’s one has go three purposes, 
is that right? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair that’s the 
20 
difference.     
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes and then you can go on. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair then if we look at the 
key issues that have bee n raised by Mr Smit, the first one is, if there 
was a definite need to fix it should have been at the finalisation of the 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 122 of 182 
 
club loan, that matter is not responded to in any way.   
CHAIRPERSON:    Is not dealt with ja. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:    No Chair, the interest rate 
swaps will use massive credit lines from banks which is not that freely 
available, that again, when we look at the memorandum under the 
motivation, it’s not mentioned at all in terms of how that was going to 
be mitigated, it’s a significant risk.  Swaps will come at a cost, that is 
somewhat addressed in the discussion which was a copy from the 
previous document...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:  But then if – but then if it is part of the discussion 
10 
that was in Mr Danie Smit’s memo then i t can’t possibly support 
contradictory conclusion. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   Chair the only thing they did 
was, they used that argument and then added a line that says, this 
eliminates the interest uncertainty for the loan and fixed the 
commitments for the duration of the loan.  So to convert the negative 
they created – they haven’t addressed the fact that this brings more 
than 200million rand of additional cost to the income statement that’s 
still not addressed.  The liquidity issue of 12billion rand has not been 
addressed and the impact of the (indistinct) from BER that has not been 
20 
addressed so nowhere in the document has it actually addressed the 
risks that Mr Smit actually raised in the memo or the email of 2 n d of 
December 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   You, earlier on also took the Chair 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 123 of 182 
 
through folder 25 and testified on a number of emails that has passed 
hand and you even used the words that there was cut and paste in what 
was written in the email from Nedbank whi ch was subsequently – which 
subsequently found its way into the letter of Transnet by Mr 
Ramosebudi, do you recall that evidence?    
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:    Yes Chair.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Now if you go to MSM470.1 and please 
identify that document and while doing that also contextualise it in 
relation to the evidence that you’ve deduced before this Commission 
earlier on today. 
10 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair we provided evidence 
earlier on in terms of page 465 which says that Ms Carol  Pillay who 
was the assistant to Mr Ramosebudi on the 16 t h of March 2016 sent an 
email with an attachment to Mr Moss Brickman of Nedbank saying that 
Mr Ramosebudi has rephrased the content of his email in the form of a 
letter for the supporting documents and the Chairperson asked for that 
specific letter.  Chair we’ve been able to trace that letter and provide it 
accordingly where in 470.1 is a document that’s in front of us which is 
on a Transnet letterhead signed off by Mr Phetholo Ramosebudi on the 
16 t h of March 2016 as the Group Treasurer addressing that letter to Mr 
20 
Moss Brickman and essentially the first paragraph of that letter is a 
copy and paste of the email Mr Brickman had sent requesting this 
particular paragraph to be included and there is a seco nd paragraph 
which says,  
 
“furthermore a copy of the approval of the transaction was sent 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 124 of 182 
 
 
to you on the 16 t h of March,  please note the second 
 
subsequent transaction for the CPI loan novation as per the  
 
GC approval detailing no fees for Regiments as the 1064 
 
locomotives agreement”. 
 
That is the two documents that were requested Chair.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes now having dealt with those issues 
that were still pending may we then proceed with your evidence and 
may I refer you to page 28 of your s tatement with particular reference 
to paragraph 5.10.7 and take us through the summary of the payments 
which were made to Trillian. 
10 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair, the payments that we 
reflect in the 5.10.7, a number of them and we will identify th em were 
done in line with the purported session that we discussed before lunch 
in some level of detail.  That was the – essentially the contract under 
which these payments were made.  There was a  payment that was 
marked Transnet Property for 41.04million,  a payment – well there were 
three invoices that were marked General Freight Business for 
23.94million, there were two invoices that had the reference SWAT and 
another one the reference GCIA being Group Capital Integration and 
Assurance 
for 
38.7million, 
th ere 
was an invoice 
for Transnet 
20 
Engineering for 11.4million and as we mentioned earlier on that for the 
ZAR Club Loan there was a payment of 93 odd million which included 
VAT.  We did state that under 5.10.7.5 that there was no evidence as 
far as we have reviewed and requested that any work was done for the 
provision of the service under the arranging of the ZAR Club Loan for 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 125 of 182 
 
93million or 93.5million.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair it is also necessary to 
note that under 5.10.7.3 for the SWAT and GCIA invoices totalling 
38.7million rand this amount was refunded to Transnet in December 
2016 as we believe no work was executed by Trillian even though the 
payment was made in July 2016.  I will deal with that in a little more 
detail as we look at the next part of the statement Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:     But I do want to know, just what the – whether in 
refunding this amount Trillian considers that no work had been done or 
10 
whether they gave another reason for refunding it?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Chair a number of these 
invoices had made their way into the public domain before this time, 
before the December period as I’m aware Regiments had taken 
exception to some of these payments, claiming that they had executed 
the work and why was Trillian the beneficiary of the  payment, that was 
one of the key disputes that occurred at the time.  The other key piece 
of evidence is that these two invoices particularly related to my area of 
control at the time. As I mentioned earlie r on, the SWAT contract as 
well as Group Capital Integration, these were my areas in Transnet at 
20 
that point in time.  We got to hear of these invoices and the costs were 
wanting to be allocated to my department, we resisted and asked them 
what work, where was the evidence of any work.  As I pointed out 
earlier on, when – in March 2016 we had wanted to understand the 
procurement event with Trillian and at time we had asked all of the 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 126 of 182 
 
people who represented Trillian that were previously with Regiments to 
leave the building or leave our side of the building as we didn’t have 
any procurement event with them.  So when these invoices surfaces 
sometime in July I think it was or late June 2016 it was quite surprising 
to say the least because we were certain that Tri llian had not executed 
any work at the Group – in the Group Capital Integration and Assurance 
function.  I will later on, also provide testimony to the processes that 
were implemented at Transnet to investigate the leaks of information.  
 
This amongst others and the reason I say that was because we 
had made very clear to those particular investigators that these 
10 
invoices were invalid because Trillian had not done any work in the 
Group Capital Integration space neither had they done any work 
referencing the Swat 2 contract.  In fact they had done now work in our 
department.  So it was a – I would say a – a combination of factors that 
would probably have led them to refund this particular amount.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I want is their version as far as you know it if 
you do know it?  They had received payment a large payment and you 
were now demanding the money to be paid back. Did they just pay back 
without saying anything?  Did they say we believe we are entitled to 
this amount but for reasons a, b, c, d we are  giving it back to you?  Or 
20 
did they not say anything they just transferred the money back that is 
what I want to know? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I am not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether is it – they… 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I am not in the know.  This 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 127 of 182 
 
particular transaction was as is evidenced by the documentation 
managed by largely Mr Edward Thomas who was the Group Supply 
Chain Officer at the time and Mr Garry Pita.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  Outside of that very few 
people seemed to have an understanding of what actually transpired 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And you are not aware of any correspondence 
that may have accompanied the refund from them?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I am not – I am not aware of 
10 
anything Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Can I pose the Chair’s questions slightly 
different?  If indeed Trillian had performed and executed work or render 
the services for the amount which they have been paid for would there 
be any reason for them to pay back that money?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No there would not be any 
reason if the work was executed. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So it – also Chair one of the 
20 
invoices is reflected as work done on the 1 Febr uary to the 1 April at 
which point there was no contract, session or otherwise because the 
session only existed on the 10 Feb – 10 May 2016.  So how could they 
have actually executed work as Trillian in February, March and April 
2016?  It goes against all logic even though it was problematic in the 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 128 of 182 
 
session in the first place.  But even though it does not make sense 
because these payments were – or the invoices were reflecting work 
done prior to any commitment Transnet had with Trillian.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You conclude on this topic by identifying 
some of the deviations from the Transnet practice.  Could you please 
take us through them flowing from paragraph 5.10.8.1?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair earlier on I brought to 
the attention the – of the commission the payment process that had 
been implemented by our team which required that the manager 
responsible will sign off. There would be an explanation of the fees, 
10 
what they were – what work was actually executed etcetera.  Chair 
under MSM35 one will note that the invoices were all literally one 
liners.  Work done, fees for work done, fees for professional fees, work 
done, professional fees, work done to close [indistinct].  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  It is fine.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja what page is – are those invoices? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  525. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Folder 35 Chair. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :   So folder 35 Chair my 
apologies.  All of those invoices from page 524 through to 529 they 
20 
have got the signature of two key execut ives.  And the reason we raise 
this is because it would ordinarily be expected that a business process 
owner signs off the invoice to say that he has received the goods or 
service.  That is Transnet practice and the payments process that we 
attach in MSM36.  But here we had the Chief Procurement Officer 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 129 of 182 
 
essentially signing on the invoice together with the Group Chief 
Financial Officer Mr Pita.  So those signatures identified as Mr Edward 
Thomas and Mr Garry Pita.  As I said it is not appropriate for the 
person not receiving the service if the service was provided there would 
have been a process owner in Transnet who would sign off to say he 
accepts the service, the quality of the service and the product that was 
delivered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I still have not found where those invoices are.  
You said  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Folder 35. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Divider 25. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  35 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  35 
CHAIRPERSON:  85? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  35. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like today as the day progresses the 
equipment is making sure that I cannot hear you.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  It is 35 Chair and you will see what the – 
what Mr Mahomedy is talking about with lack of information or any 
peculiarity pertaining to why those invoices should be paid.  And he 
20 
was also giving testimony on who signed the two – who signed those 
invoices and contrary to what is the practice of Transnet as contained 
in one of the documents in Folder number 36.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like the – the signatures that appear on each 
of the invoices are signatures of the same people, is that correct?  
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 130 of 182 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you were making a certain point about the people 
signing, what was the point you made?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair the signature of the 
right is Mr Edward Thomas who was the Group Supply Chain Officer.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  In normal processes within 
an organisation the procurement individual or the procurement head 
should not be signing invoices.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Because that is the process 
post his accountability. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because his or hers is to check that the process is 
correct? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not – not so much the product. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That is correct Chair.  The 
product or the service delivered would be attested to by a process 
owner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And on all of these 
documents there is a lack of a process owners’ signature.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And that is key in terms of 
trying to understand why these payments were made in the first place.  
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 131 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and are you able to say in terms of your own 
experience at Transnet that generally the person who would sign an 
invoice would not be a procurement person?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Two principles Chair. The 
one is that it would not be a procurement person.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And the second would be 
that a process owner  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Whoever that may be will 
10 
sign for the receipt of that service.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And deliverable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what – what type of person would be a process 
owner if you are able to clarify that?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair if you look at the…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Would it be like the head of the department whose 
needs or which needed the service or the product. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That is one hundred percent 
correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And when you look at the 
invoice for example on page 479. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The invoice says Transnet 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 132 of 182 
 
general freight breakthrough.  One would have expected that somebody 
from that division  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That managed this for 
general freight be it the Transnet Freight Rail Chief Executive or the 
Chief Operations Officer 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  They would have signed this 
to say that this invoice is valid, people delivered the service.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  If we look at another one it 
says Swat 2 that would have expect – been expected to have my 
signature because it was on page 527 my apologies 524 and 527.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry you are too fast for me.  Where does it say 
Swat 2 the first one which is…  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  527 Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Page 527 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I was looking at the one at 524  Okay.  527 wait – 
where about in the  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It says… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where about in the invoice does it say Swat 2?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  Chair it says work done, 
professional fees, work done  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh there is Swat 2 now I see it. It is has got two 
projects. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 133 of 182 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so you would have been the process owner?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you – it should have come to you for you to sign?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you were happy with that the work had been done?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  In the first place if Trillian 
pitched Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  So but your signature is not there.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it was never brought to you at the time?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the other signature i s it Mr Pita’s signature?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he was – he was in treasury?  He was in…  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No Chair he was the Group 
Chief Financial Officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Group Chief Financial Officer. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Of Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would a person in that position normally sign 
20 
invoices? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  He would ordinarily sign 
after the process owner signs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHO MEDY:  If it was beyond the process 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 134 of 182 
 
owners’ delegation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So if it was above – in this 
case he would have signed post …  
CHAIRPERSON:  After you had signed?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  After I would have signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Do they all relate to your department or only the 
one you mentioned related to your department?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair there is two that relate 
to my department. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  There is – page number 529 
as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  These two relate to my 
department and the others relate to a variety of functions at Transnet.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But you are able to say in regard to the others 
as well the process owner, the person who was supposed to have 
signed had not signed.  So the process owners’ signature has to be 
there even if in addition to it there must be the Chief Financial Officer ’s 
20 
one? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  And the process owner’s 
signature should be before the Chief Financial Officer signs.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So if there is one that shows 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 135 of 182 
 
it after then this was authorised for payment essentially before.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR 
MOHAMMED 
SULEMAN 
MAHOMEDY:  The 
process 
owner 
confirmed it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say that these invoices are defective, raise 
question marks to say the least?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  In addition to the fact that 
these invoices some say services were rendered in March 2016.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  April 2016 when Trillian had 
no contract at Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The session only took place 
on the 10 May. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Mr Mahomedy there is also a policy 
20 
document governing the internal controls with the processing of 
payment and if I may re fer you to Folder number 36 Chair, 36 and …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Folder number? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  36, 36. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 136 of 182 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And then maybe respond to the 
questions of Chair in relation to that document as well and why do you  
believe that in this instance it was never adhered to?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think under page 532 
one line amongst the entire process says:  
“The cost centre manager is responsible for all 
appropriate documentation supporting the invoice 
such as agreements, order forms, tender documents, 
quotes, all goods received.”  
So it is largely the cost centre owner or the manager receiving that 
10 
specific service.  And in this case as I mentioned that did not follow 
that due process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where is the sentence that you just read about all 
cost centre manager or something?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair page 532. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I am there. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The section 1.2 supporting 
documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It goes through and then 
20 
somewhere in the middle of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I think the third bullet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The third bullet point?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 137 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So would the cost centre manager be the same as the 
person you referred to as the process owner?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That would ordinarily…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Or they different people?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It would ordinarily be the 
same person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  If the costs are being 
allocated to my cost centre. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but it can be somebody different?  
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It could be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And also Chair under 1.3 the 
last bullet on the page  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It says: 
“The goods receipt is done by the requisitioner and 
all relevant supporting documents must be sent – 
must be submitted to the corporate accounting – 
corporate centre accounting in line with the date 
20 
etcetera.” 
That is also saying that the person who requests the service must 
confirm he received the service. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So – so in many respects in terms of the 
evidence given by yourself as well as by Mr Volmink and the 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 138 of 182 
 
Chairperson of the board so far it appears that the – unless we find or 
we are furnished with proper explanations by the people who were 
involved in some of these things it appears that there was just blatant 
disregard of procedures and processes which are put in place to try and 
minimise chances for abuse, for corruption and of minimising losses, 
potential losses to Transnet.  So unless one finds – unless there is 
somebody who comes up and gives a sound explanation why these 
procedures and processes were disregarded it appears that it was just 
a blatant disregard of processes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair in support of your view 
10 
I think a number of these processes that we reference are standard 
processes in Transnet.  None of them are complex, none of them are 
difficult to follow.  We have been doing this in a particular way for a 
long period of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course it is – it is possible that some of the 
persons or all the persons who may be implicated in disregarding these 
processes may come forward and give possible explanations for why 
the disregard of those processes and procedures was justified and so 
on.  So we will wait and see but we – in the absence of that it does 
appear that some of the acts of disregard were  – may have been quite 
20 
blatant.  Hm yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  You conclude on that topic on paragraph 
5.10.8.2 and 5.10.8.3 can you simply summarise for the Chair some of 
the points which I am sure you have already highlighted?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHO MEDY:  Ja I think key to this is the 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 139 of 182 
 
processes were not followed for the payment of Trillian invoices.  The 
second point is that in a number of cases the services that were 
supposedly vended were before Trillian had any valid procurement 
event.  It was before the 10 May even if we question the session but 
before the 10 May 2016 it is clear from the invoices some of them date 
back to 19 February 2016. So the entire – all of the payments to Trillian 
are at best questionable Chair.  And we did receive a refund  for R38.6 
million and that is not normal in any of this kind of situation.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I see that you mentioned in your statement that 
10 
you received a refund of R38.7 million from Trillian and you say there 
was no work that had been done by Trillian in that regard – in regard to 
that amount.  But you also say that there was no work done in regard to 
the invoice or the payment of R93 million but that one has not been 
refunded, is that correct?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and you are not aware whether that no work was 
done is being disputed or not?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No Chair we have 
commenced a process through our attorneys to …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  To recover. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  Civil action against the 
company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes we can now proceed to deal with the 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 140 of 182 
 
facts pertinent to Nkonki Incorporation.  You started dealing then – with 
them from paragraph 5.11 on page 29.  But b efore you do that please 
give us the background you know relevant to Nkonki?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair it is necessary to note 
that Nkonki were a service provider to Transnet for certain internal 
audit functions that were outsourced.  In 2013 Tr ansnet went through 
an open tender process to appoint a firm or firms to assist with the 
internal audit function which was outsourced.  At the time three bidders 
were appointed as the preferred bidder of a consortium for the internal 
audit function.  They included KPMG, Nkonki and Sekela Xabiso.  The 
10 
Nkonki contract at that time was awarded for a five year period 
commencing on the 1 August 2013 to end on the 31 July 2018.  That 
initial contract was for a value of R500 million for the five year period.  
In around March 2018 there were a number of announcements made by 
various authorities in the accounting, auditing profession including the 
auditor general at the time asking for state organs to consider 
termination of contracts with Nkonki as a result of a num ber press 
articles that appeared with re – relating to their association with the 
Guptas.  Transnet followed suit and terminated the internal audit 
contract prior to the 31 July 2018.  We have reviewed some of the 
20 
contracts that Nkonki had and we note the following.  It around January 
2017 Transnet received unsolicited bids.  Chair I am on page 29 of my 
statement under 5.11.2.  In January 2017 Transnet received unsolicited 
bids from Nkonki as well as one that was under Nkonki and Oliver 
Wyman for a variety of services including what was called supply chain 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 141 of 182 
 
efficiencies, coal and iron ore line volume and tariff optimisation.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  May I refer you to page 452.  Chair that 
is Folder number  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  5, 54 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Folder number 37.  37 
CHAIRPERSON:  37? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  542 ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  And if you could please identify 
10 
that document for us? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair this a document that 
Nkonki had submitted.  This is one of the documents.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.   
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair at that time in early 
2017 as I said Nkonki had – already was providing the internal audit 
service and they had an existing contract for that.   In a memorandum 
dated February 2017 which was addressed to the assets – my 
apologies, the acquisitions and disposals committee the ADC Transnet 
executives proposed that Transnet utilise the existing internal audit 
20 
contracts for these unsolicited proposals.  And in the Transnet contract 
it allows for something called non-audit work.  Under the Folder 38 we 
have included the specific requests that went through to the Transnet 
Acquisitions and Disposals Committee.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Page 571. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 142 of 182 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Page 571. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY :  Chair this document was 
submitted to the Acquisitions and Disposals Committee as the last page 
– I think it is page 575 suggests on the 7 February 2017.  Chair what is 
also noteworthy from our perspective is I do not think is to clear but the 
Acquisitions 
and 
Disposals 
Committee 
approved 
this 
particular 
submission and the value that was marked in the submission says that 
it should not exceed R500 million in consulting fees.  Now the five year 
contract for internal audit services was for R500 million.  However this 
10 
particular extension in value or increase in value was not to exceed 
R500 million.  This is a breach of the National Treasury notes that have 
been in place since some of them 2016 and others from 2008.  On two 
fronts Chair.  The suggested extensions under my statement page 30.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I may have – you may have lost me 
somewhere.  The memorandum at page 5 71 it is addressed to the 
Transnet Acquisition and Disposals Committee which is a committee of 
the board.  It is signed at the end at 575 by Garry Pita, Group Chief 
Financial Officer and Phiwe I do not know whether it is Shinga or 
Selinga Chief Legal Counsel and he or she recommends and Siyabonga 
20 
Gama signed it – Mr Siyabonga Gama signed it as Chief Executive – as 
Group Chief Executive.  They all recommend what it is in the 
memorandum.  Have you referred to any response from or decision by 
that committee and did I miss where that is?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair on page 576. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 143 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I think this is unfortunately a 
very difficult page to read. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe before we do that what did you say was 
sought to be achieved with that memorandum?  The purpose which is 
obviously stated in paragraph 1 there, 571.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Maybe read it Mr Mahomedy.  Read the 
purpose, the contents of the purpose into the record.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair this memorandum as 
you correctly point out is from the Group Chief Executive to the 
10 
Transnet Acquisitions and Disposals Committee.  The purpose of this 
memorandum is for the Acquisitions and Disposals Committee to 
recommend that the board approve the app ointment of consultants for 
the cost savings and efficiency proposal for the ISCM which is Supply 
Chain Management from Nknoni which was approved as a permitted 
non-audit service by the audit committee.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The iron ore and coal 
revenue enhancement programme proposals for Transnet Commercial 
from Nkonki Incorporated which was approved as a permitted non -audit 
20 
service by the audit committee.  And then delegate authority to the 
Group Chief Executive to sign all documentation including the contract 
documentation. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  Now what the Chair wants to know 
is whether what was sought in that memorandum was it ultimately 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 144 of 182 
 
granted or approved? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And before the – before that 
just confirmation that the cost and savings and efficiency proposal for 
ISCM which they say is from Nknoki Incorporated refers to the 
document to which you referred a few minutes ago.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – so in other words they received this document 
from Nkonki and then they were now – they were in agreement with it. 
They were proposing to [indistinct] the Acquisitions and Disposals 
Committee to say please approve that we do this?  
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright then you can proceed.  Then the 
committee makes a decision?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair under the 
document numbered 576. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  This is essentially the 
minutes of the Acquisitions and Disposals Committee meeting number 
76 – I think 716/17 FY held on the 13 February 2017 at 10:05 at 
boardroom 4901. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  Do you have a better copy of that document 
Mr Mahomedy? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  Yes.  Will you please also mark - mark as 
one of those documents that we have to exchange from the files 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 145 of 182 
 
because there are quite a number of them which are not quite legible.  
We will through your benefit just to listen you a nd try to follow what you 
will be reading in this document.  It is difficult to read.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair the document is the 
constitution of the meeting.  The members who were present:  
Mr Stanley Shane, 
Mr Gama, 
Ms L C Mabaso 
and 
Mr Z A Nagdee.  
These are the members of the Committee.  The Chairman was 
Mr Shane.  In attendance were a number of Transnet Executives and 
there then we had partial attendance.  Under – on the right hand side – 
I think it is 5.6.4 a member enquired whether the s ervices could be 
10 
capped within the Committee’s authority namely 500 million and sought 
clarity on the contractual terms for the said services.  Management 
confirmed that the accumulative delegated authority of the Committee 
for appointment of consultants is 500 million and that the costs could 
therefore be capped within the approval limit of the Committee.  It was 
further agreed that the Board of Directors would be informed of the 
decision through the standard practice of tabling the Committee’s 
Resolution Register at the next Committee meeting.  Essentially this – 
this submission was approved by a Board Committee with the delegated 
authority Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It concerned …  
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and did the – did the Committee give – approve 
everything that was asked for by the particular Executives who were 
…? 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 146 of 182 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay alright.  Thank you. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair in my opinion I think 
Transnet’s acceptance of Nkonki’s unsolicited bid did not comply with 
National Treasury practice 01/2008 - 2009 as the …  
CHAIRPERSON:  But before you say that can you just summarise what 
the substance is that their proposal was about.  What – what did they 
want to do and why were they making an unsolicited bid?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair they asked for three 
things … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Or they spoke to three 
things.  The first was procurement optimisation.  Optimisation of our 
processes … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Bringing in savings on 
procurement contracts and assisting Transnet to better its income 
statement and balance sheet position.  The second page was to look at 
the coal line optimisation and enhancement.  What opportunities 
existed for volume growth and any tariffs possibility with customers?  
20 
The third was the iron ore line to actually engage again with customers 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  To look at what opportunity 
may have existed … 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 147 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  For iron ore volume growth 
and if there was a potential for us to look at the tariffs …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Or the customer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So those were the three key 
issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and they were approved?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The interesting thing about 
that is that from the contracts that we have not seen  around or have – I 
have not discussed around Regiments and McKinsey – they were given 
similar contracts before that on coal enhancement.  McKinsey was 
given a confinement on that - I think it was in 2014 - I am not sure and 
Regiments – McKinsey were given a contract for the iron ore tariff 
review as well.  So it seemed to be a duplication in very quick 
succession, but that is the context to which …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  But despite it being a duplication – I mean – 
20 
these services are those which would ordi narily have to go out on open 
tender.  Am I correct? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair because there are 
– there are service providers who can provide this service outside of 
Nkonki. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 148 of 182 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the policy or at the time what was Transnet’s 
policy on unsolicited bids?  Was there a policy that would say 
something like if Transnet receives an unsolicited bid this is what 
should follow or was there – was there nothing specific?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair in terms of National 
Treasury Practice Note 11/2008 – 2009 which Transnet subscribed to 
the criteria for consideration of an unsolicited proposal is very clear.  It 
says: 
“Institutions 
are 
not 
obliged 
to 
consider 
an 
10 
unsolicited proposal but may consider such  a 
proposal only if it meets the following requirement – 
only if it meets.  A, a comprehensive and relevant 
project feasibility study has established a clear 
business case.  B, the product or service involves 
an innovative design.  C, the product or servic e 
involves 
an 
innovative 
approach 
to 
project 
development and management or D, the product or 
service presents a new and cost effective method of 
service delivery.” 
20 
Those are the specifics of the National Treasury Note on unsolicited 
bids.  Amongst other things there is a – it talks about a lot of detail in 
terms of what should be provided etcetera.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But when it says an unsolicited – an unsolicited bid 
maybe considered under the circumstances which you have set out – 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 149 of 182 
 
which it sets out.  What is your understanding of what that means?  
Does it mean if you consider that this is something you need as an SOE 
you can then take it and conclude the contract with the person who 
sends the unsolicited bid or does it mean that if you believe that you 
need this kind of service or product you should then follow the tender 
processes or in other words those exceptions that it seems to set out 
are they to say if anyone of these is present you can conclude a 
contract without going through procurement or tender – open tender – 
or does it mean if you need it you must still go through the tender 
process or procurement processes?  
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair the first principle here 
will be to assess whether the unsolicited bid provided a solution that 
was not ordinarily available in the market.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  In this particular instance I 
do not believe that to be the case – in my view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It was for optimisation of a 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  There are a number of 
institutes out there and institutions out there that would be able to have 
helped us … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  If we had put out a proper 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 150 of 182 
 
open tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  This was again not just a 
confinement.  This was piggybacking off a contract that was already in 
existence … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And going in through a 
technicality of saying it is other servic es but so significantly that we 
were possibly going to double the value of that contract …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Without any process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So is – is your answer that having National 
Treasury – to which you have referred … 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Was noted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would permit or would not permit Transnet to 
conclude a contract which it considers it needs - for a service that it 
considers it needs from a service provider who provides an unsolicited 
bid or would the position on your understanding be that if the SOE such 
as Transnet – an SOE such as Transnet believes that it needs this kind 
of service then it would generally speaking have to put it out to tender 
20 
unless the - it is a situation which under the procurement prescripts it 
will be permitted to not go through an open tender?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair in terms of the policy 
from National Treasury it goes further to say after a lengthy discussion:  
“If the accounting officer or accounting authority 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 151 of 182 
 
decides to consider the unsolicited bid he or she 
must send a registered letter …”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  “…to the address 
referred to in paragraph 2.2a confirming the 
decision ...” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  “…to consider the 
unsolicited proposal.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
10 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It was not a decision that 
was for Transnet as far as I understand it.  It had to have gone through 
a process of review. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh.  So where it says - refers to consider it 
seems to maybe this what one will say might be different from the 
understanding - I may have heard earlier on.  It seems to – to make a 
distinction that you – you – if you are – if you are going to consider it.  
I means you are going to consider it without an open tender.  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are certain circumstances which must be 
20 
present before you can do that but if you are not prepared to consider 
it that might mean you want to put the whole thing out to tender and 
they might have to bid like everybody else and it would be considered 
later if they are successful or somebody else’s one maybe considered 
later? 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 152 of 182 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair in terms of – again – 
in terms of this document from National Treasury it is clear.  It says:  
“If the unsolicited …”  
Further down the document. 
“If the unsolicited proposal is concluded then the 
institution must prepare and issue bid documents 
…” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  “…the process to 
be followed when procuring a service provider.”  
10 
It goes on to say: 
“Preparation 
of 
an 
RFQ 
or 
a 
Request 
for 
Qualification to test the market for the existence of 
other private entities capable of product or service.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  “Preparation of a 
draft contract etcetera.”  
So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It is not - it is not giving a 
20 
blanket authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  You say consider it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes you considered it then 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 153 of 182 
 
give the work out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It follows some process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  And all of those issues were not adhered to 
by – when –when this – this bid was – you know - approved or accepted 
by Transnet? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Not to our knowledge. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  No. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  But the other compelling reasons whic h you 
wanted to bring to the attention of the Chair for instance at the time 
when this unsolicited bid was submitted Nkonki had an already existing 
contract of 500 million.  So this one was in addition to that one?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It was on top of that yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  So meaning that it – it took the value note 
to 1 billion – to one … 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  To 1 billion.  Had we …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  Had … 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  
Had 
we 
allowed 
it 
to 
20 
continue. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  Yes and now you conclude on the last sub 
paragraph 5.11.3.2.  You can take the Chair through that last 
paragraph. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair before that I also want 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 154 of 182 
 
to provide clarity that we did not spend this money.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  In around the time that this 
was identified by ourselves in June/July  2018 all of this – by name and 
all of the issues were also being raised through the media.  Transnet 
had paid R26.1 million for these rela ted services with a further R60 
million that is – that was outstanding and remains outstanding as we 
dispute this amount. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  My apologies for that.  I 
10 
think under 5.11.32 what we are saying is the 100 percent increase in 
the value of Nkonki’s contract is also a contravention of Treasury 
Practice Note 3/2016 and 2017 dated 19  April 2016 that limits the 
variation of contracts and this is a deviation.  A variation of the 
contract to a maximum of 15 percent  or 15 million.  When we go and do 
the calculations based on what was included in this memorandum and 
the approval of being under 500 million – the under 500 million is not 
necessarily a definitive sum but if you do the calculations based this 
had to have been submitted to National Treasury for their review and 
their input.  It had not gone to National Treasury.  It took the 
20 
Acquisitions and Disposals Committee approval as being final.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  That was not the case. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  Yes.  Now we can proceed to deal with 
T-Systems from paragraph 5.12. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 155 of 182 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair there is a number of 
issues around T-Systems that have been made public.  However in my 
testimony I do not – I do not deal with the details around that save to 
say that in my role as the General Manager of Finance at Transnet 
Group Capital between September  2016 and 15 May 2018 we identified 
that the division was paying for approximately 2  200 computers when 
the division only employed about 1 100 people.  It is a process that we 
undertook to identify, track these computers.  We found that 450 
computers were ordered in July 2015.  That were never utilised by 
Transnet.  It seems to have gone missing.  We could not find these 
10 
computers.  They did not …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Had they been delivered?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  They had been delivered to 
Transnet Offices and then had been moved to unknown locations.  It 
came into the business.  They were not even preloaded with the 
Transnet software because the Transnet software has got tracking 
software which is loaded on.  We could not track these computers.  The 
reason we put this on the table is that all these computers were leased 
through T-Systems – through the T-Systems contract which was sub 
contracted to entities like Zestilor and later to InnoVent Rental and 
20 
Asset Management Solutions.  Both Zestilor and InnoVent had 
ownership linked to Mr Salim Essa an associate of the Guptas at the 
time and a major shareholder of Trillian Ca pital Partners as well. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So how many computers all together were delivered 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 156 of 182 
 
and were paid for – delivered but had disappeared?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  We believe it was more than 
1 000 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  In one division. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean how much would that have been in terms of 
what that division lost?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair it ran into a few 
million Rand a year because these computers were all leased.  So you 
were paying for computers that did not exist and you would continue 
10 
paying for them until you reached a settlement with the entity to settle 
these computers because there were leases that just continued into 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  The leases would have been for how long?  Would 
they have been all more or less for the same duration or you do no – 
you would not know? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair they would have – 
ordinarily three to four year life …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  The lease but it only 
20 
cancelled when you had returned the computer physically …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  And then it would terminate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  So in some cases the 450 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 157 of 182 
 
were computers that we identified in July 2015 but there were other 
older computers that were never returned that had gone missing that 
were being paid for until about the middle – I think – the middle or 
towards the latter of 2017 when we finally settled the matter and p aid 
the difference and we stopped the payment from recurring.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Has – has that issue been determined by an 
investigation as to whether it is – this might just be just sheer theft 
which might not be connected with anything or Transnet up to now has 
not determined exactly what happened?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair we were unable to 
10 
determine exactly what transpired because we had the – the 
confirmation of the delivery and then it just got cold.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But there would have been peop le under whose 
custody each – each computer was brought.  If they – when they were 
delivered if they were supposed to be housed in one place there would 
have somebody who would have been responsible to make sure that 
they were safely kept there and if they  were delivered to – they were 
given to employees they would be – they should have been records of 
which computer was given to which employee and that employee would 
have had to confirm whether the computer ever reached him or her and 
20 
what happened to the computer or was there no paperwork or no paper 
– paper trail? 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
Chair 
there 
was 
an 
investigation done.  A number of employees or a few employees were 
suspended. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 158 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
Subsequently 
some 
resigned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  We also had identified 
individuals who were involved in theft of computers.  We are not able to 
establish whether it was entirely all of these computers or some of 
these were definitely related to  that case.  The individuals – individual 
was found guilty and was – was sentenced accordingly at the time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is something.  As I mean 1 000 – more or 
10 
less 1 000 – computers get delivered and they just disappeared and 
nobody at Transnet knows exactly what happened. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  It is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is very strange. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  A challenge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  We … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it – it must talk to – it must talk to certain weak 
systems within Transnet.  I mean that is not one computer 
disappearing.  It is – it is … 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  1 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a lot of computers.  How can they just disappear 
and nobody knows who took them, when they took them and where  did 
– where did they go.  It must talk to weak systems within – within 
Transnet. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 159 of 182 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think that is a - that 
is a key thing we looked at was as to whether this was an intentional 
weakening of the system, whether it was so mething that happened and 
I think the jury is still out but there was definitely some involvement of 
different individuals to weaken the system so that things like this would 
be – go – would go undetected for periods of time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean because even those who weaken the system it 
should be possible to determine them.  It should be possible to 
determine who did – who was responsible for that and because 
certainly with that kind of thing that should be of such great concern 
10 
that immediately Transnet should be - immediately Transnet discovers 
this kind of thing.  They should be wanting to see what do we put in 
place to make sure that tomorrow – we do not wake up one morning and 
find that Transnet has – does not have a single computer throughout 
the country. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think at that time – 
this goes back to 2016 – there was a considerable change in the 
management of that division. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  There were a number of 
20 
Executives who were move d, a number who were suspended and an 
entire new management team was taken into that division.  That is 
when this was discovered.  It would have gone undetected had there 
not been a significant change …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 160 of 182 
 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Reshuffle in management. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is – is there a report sitting somewhere which was 
compiled by whoever was asked to investigate the circumstances under 
which those computers were – were or disappeared and so on?  Is - is 
there a report somewhere?  
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair there should be a 
report somewhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  We will try to locate that 
report because this matter was reported to the Forensic Team to look 
10 
at. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is – it is horrifying. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is horrifying and it is taxpayers’ money.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  It is Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  The next topic that you are dealing with 
Mr Mahomedy is the Neotel matter from 5.13.  Mr Volmink did testify on 
this issue at length.  You can give – you know – the summary and the 
highlights of what you want to convey to the Chair as corroborating 
20 
obviously what Mr Volmink has testified on. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair I think under the folder 
41 commencing on page 595 this was what we believed to be an 
original memorandum that is dated 30  October 2013 under banner 41 
page 595.  This is a memorandum at the time from Mr  Garry Pita who 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 161 of 182 
 
was the Group Supply Chain Officer, Ms  Hansika Motwani who was the 
Chief Information Officer, myself at that time acting as the Chief 
Financial Officer in Mr  Singh’s absence to Ms  Sharla Pillay who was the 
Acting Group Chief Executive in Mr  Molefe’s absence.  As I said it is 
dated 30 October 2013 under the title: 
“RFP 
Number 
GSM13040722 
for 
Provision 
of 
Network Services Request for Approval to Approve 
the Process, Award Contract and Issue a Letter of 
Intent Inviting Neotel to Further Invest Negotiations 
as the Preferred Bidder of this RFP”.  
10 
The purpose of this submission is to request the Group Chief Executive 
to approve the procurement process an award of business to Neotel 
(Pty) Ltd, sign the letter of intent for the preferred bidder, sign letters 
of regret for the four unsuccessful bidders, sign the letter to extend the 
current Neotel contract. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  And who was the Acting Group Chief 
Executive at the time?

for 
Provision 
of

Approve the Process Award Contract and Issue a 
Letter of Intent.” 
This document as its purpose states: 
“To inform the Group Chief Financial Officer, the 
Group Chief Information Officer and the Group 
Chief Supply Chain Officer of my decisions to award 
the above mentioned business to T-Systems South 
Africa 
in

– under page 603 in the approval it notes the following under item 
number 26. 
“Based on the explanations given above I request 
the Group Chief Financial Officer, the Group CIO 
and the Group Supply Chain Officer to note my 
decisions to award business to T-Systems in terms

“…and that I am overriding the recommendation 
made in the Tier Report.” 
Which is the Evaluation Report of Procurement.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA:  Yes. 
MR MOHAMMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: 
 
Essentially 
Chair 
this 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 164 of 182 
 
memorandum 
on 
20 November 
discarded 
the 
memorandum 
of 
31 October replacing Neotel with T-Systems.  Then Chair under MSM or 
under folder 43 page 607 there is a further memorandum dated 
5 December 2014 which is addressed from Mr  Anoj Singh, Mr Garry Pita 
and Ms Hansika Motwani to Mr Brian Molefe. 
“The purpose of this submission is to request the Group Chief 
Executive to approve the award of network services to Neotel, 
for a period of five years with effect December 14 to November 
2019, signed the MSA, the Master Services Agreement for the 
provision of network services between Transnet and Neotel, 
10 
sign a letter informing Neotel  that Transnet will not evoke its 
right and step in as per Clause 51 15 should the Vodacom 
purchase of Neotel be approved.  Sign the letter informing 
Neotel that Transnet will withhold R79million until the financial 
guarantee is finished, etcetera.”   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes.  And you make some key 
observations from paragraph 5.30.6 on page 32 of your statement, can 
you take the Chair through your observations?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   Chair what is important is 
that as we pointed out the first memorandum which had gone through a 
20 
proper process had all of the relevant supporting documents in place, 
was approved by the then Group Chief Executive Ms Charla Pillay on 
the 31 s t of October.   
 
On the 20 t h of November 2013 Mr Molefe rescinds that entir e 
process and makes a unilateral decision to award the entire contract to 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 165 of 182 
 
T-Systems and then a year later or more than a year later 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  By that time – I’m sorry – by the time Mr Brian Molefe 
did that had Neotel been told of the  decision, do you know?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:    Chair all the documents that 
we have, the documents were signed, I’m not sure if they were sent.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   And then suddenly a year 
later Neotel is then appointed, so there’s a decision to appoint Neotel 
through the correct procurement process, then suddenly it’s T-Systems 
10 
and then a full year later finally Neotel is appointed.  They key 
observation Chair is under the folder 43 on page 608, and that talks to 
the fact that the transition cost moved from 175million to 225million 
and in terms of what is provided there does not seem to be an adequate 
explanation as to why the transition cost moved by approximately a 
clean R50million. 
 
That’s the first observation, and the second observation and 
the second observation was that in the first memorandum the 
suggestion was a three year with a two year option and this 
memorandum was effectively now being given for a five year contract 
20 
option. 
 
Those are the key issues  on the Neotel process. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You obviously have had a chance to examine Mr Brian 
Molefe’s reasons for going against the decision that had been taken 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 166 of 182 
 
which you had supported by way of the memorandum to which you 
refer.  Are you able to say something about the two sides of reasons, 
on the one hand the reasons with which you associated yourself for 
saying Neotel must be awarded and the reasons that Mr Brian Molefe 
gave for overriding the position?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAH OMEDY:  Chair I think in reviewing the 
document one finds that there’s a fairly technical discussion around 
who is the final authority when there’s a dispute.  As far as we were 
concerned on the 31 s t of October 2013 there was no dispute, the cross -
function evaluation team had reviewed all of the relevant submissions 
10 
and they had provided to us a detailed report that proposed that Neotel 
was the preferred bidder. 
 
Now in the submission from Mr Molefe he talks about 
concentration risk as Transnet is Neotel’s largest client, counterparty 
risk etcetera.  These risks existed with Neotel in the past so I’m not 
sure and from my perspective there’s a number of other issues on the 
CCTV cameras and various ports were not operational etcetera.  There 
may have been some discomfort, but that would have had to have been 
addressed through the relevant procurement channels.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Am I right to say that assuming that Mr Brian Molefe 
20 
did have the power to make that decision am I right to say you are not 
in a position to say that the reasons he gave when weighed against 
those that are contained in the memo with which you associated 
yourself were such that one just couldn’t understand the decision, now 
I’m not talking about whether he had the power or not but just decidin g 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 167 of 182 
 
to give the contract to T-Systems as opposed to Neotel?    
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY: Chair what is not necessarily 
sitting well from an understanding perspective is why as the Chief 
Executive he prepared the memorandum himself, why it’s not supported 
by the supply chain office to agree, concur with his assessment, the 
governance team or legal representative to agree with the principles 
that were espoused in that document, that’s the first thing.  
 
The second thing in hindsight obviously Chair one is not  clear 
as to why we then went back to the original decision with an additional 
R50million (indistinct). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know we have – I have heard evidence from other 
Transnet witnesses ...(intervention)  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Mr Volmink Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that where there was a court judgment?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes Mr Volmink gave quite detailed 
analysis of the (indistinct) and he went back and even told us his 
reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes there was senior counsel’s opinion and so on.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay, thank you. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    You conclude that portion of your 
statement with paragraph 5.13.7 and 5.13.8, if you can simply read 
them into the record, we will then deal with the next topic.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   It has also been reported 
widely that Neotel made, allegedly made various payments to Homix, a 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 168 of 182 
 
known Gupta company.  The pattern is discernible in the manner in 
which the estimated total cost of the 1064 locomotive transaction wa s 
increased.  There seems to be a pattern in my view.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes, now you then deal with what you 
term a culture of intimidation and investigations, you can summarise 
that for us. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   Chair in 2016 in September 
there was an investigation that was lodged in Transnet to determine 
whether individuals were implicated or involved in the leaking of 
Transnet documentation.  I had informed the investigators on numerous 
10 
occasions that the work that Trillian did or they work that they – my 
apologies the invoices that were presented by Trillian there was no 
work performed as I testified to earlier on, and that these invoices were 
authorised by Mr Pita and Mr Thomas and they could not be for bona 
fide services.  This was presented in the first interview which was in 
the middle of September 2016 to a group of investigators from both the 
firm of attorneys, Werksmans, as well PWC.  
 
A number of testimony around the Trillian invoices were 
presented to that particular, those particular firms.  We were subjected 
to voice analysis tests, handwriting analysis and many hours of forensic 
20 
interrogation.  This commenced as I said in the middle of September 
2016 and continued up to the beginning of April 2017.   
 
At that time Transnet had announced a voluntary separation 
program for management and I then made an application to take that up 
as working at Transnet at the time became unbearable with the 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 169 of 182 
 
Executives that had originally or at the time that were there.  At some 
point towards the middle of April 2017 I was called to a meeting with Mr 
Pita, who advised me that the Werksmans/PWC teams reported only to 
the Board, the forensic team had found no conclusive evidence that I 
was involved in any wrongdoing and that my VSP application was not  
going to be approved as Transnet needed the skills and experience.  
 
I am not aware if – I’m not aware why my VSP was rejected as 
I did not receive any further correspondence on that matter.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But didn’t you just say they said they needed your 
experience and skills? 
10 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair that was verbal 
communication. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you did not get it in writing. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I didn’t receive any written 
feedback. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In writing okay.  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:   Yes Chair.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    And now from paragraph 7 you are 
dealing with the remedial action, can I propose that we skip that topic 
and we will conclude with it and we will move on to deal with item eight 
20 
which is now your personal declarations.  Just summarise for us what 
you’re stating under that heading?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Thank you.  I think during my 
time at Transnet and my career over many years I have worked 
extensively 
with 
many 
service 
providers 
including 
M cKinsey, 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 170 of 182 
 
Regiments, PWC and the like, amongst others, I would have been 
invited to many conferences, benchmarking visits locally as well as 
globally that were arranged to buy these entities.  All of the related 
costs would have been paid for by Transnet at  the time.   
 
I also have developed many relationships, both personal and 
professional with key individuals at these firms, including but not 
necessarily limited to Mr Parbhoo, Prakash Parbhoo, Mr Cannalac 
Miharan, Mr David Fine, Dr Andrew Shaw.  Some of t hese relationships 
will endure to this day.  There are certain specific entities and 
individuals that have crossed paths with me or I crossed paths with 
10 
them over the years that I think requires special mention.  Cutting Edge 
and Mr Althaf Emmamally.  Amon gst my first jobs in the Corporate 
Sector I worked at Eskom from 2001 to 2004, August and the then Chief 
Financial Officer of the Transmission Division, whom I worked under 
was Mr Althaf Emmamally.  My appointment at Eskom went through 
normal recruitment processes with me responding to an advert in the 
Sunday Times. 
 
 
On leaving Eskom in 2004, August, I joined Spoornet, what 
was then called Spoornet.  This time I was approached by Mr 
Emmamally and appointed by Executive Authority under the leadership 
20 
of the then Chief Executive of Spoornet, Ms Dollie Mogatle, who was 
also at Eskom in my tenure.   
 
In mid-2006 I resigned from my position at Spoornet after 
being approached by Mr Johan Grimbeeck, director and shareholder of 
the Cutting Edge Group.  I was offere d a position of managing the 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 171 of 182 
 
finance division with the key focus of creating a consultancy and 
developing finance business intelligent software.  
 
As Divisional Directors we were given a minimum shareholding 
in the group entity of 2%.  This was relinquished  in April 2008.  In April 
2008 after differences with the shareholders and the directors, 
including Mr Emmamally I had a mutual separation agreement with 
Cutting Edge as part of –with Cutting Edge, and as part of this process 
Cutting Edge Finance was trans ferred to me as it was the division that 
was developed by the finance team and myself, and I was given 100% 
of the shareholding of this company.  Mr Emmamally has been named in 
10 
articles in the media as having links to the Gupta Family.   
 
Since 2008 I have had limited interactions with Mr Emmamally 
and Cutting Edge Commerce.  I am aware that Transnet through a 
confident, sorry, my apologies, through a confinement process 
appointed Cutting Edge around April 2014 to provide a solution for 
systems analytical tool and capabilities that will enable or that will 
provide key procurement matrix and analysis.  Neither myself nor my 
department at the time, DCIA, was involved in the appointment of 
Cutting Edge.  During the course of their appointment at Transnet I had 
no dealings with Cutting Edge when they executed their mandate.  
20 
 
Cutting Edge Finance, which is a company that I own, has 
been dormant since late 2009 and has done no work for an State 
Owned Entity post 2009. 
 
Under 8.6 on page 36 Mr Mohamed Bobat, Mr Boba t has been 
named in the media as being one of the advisors that was 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 172 of 182 
 
controversially appointed to advise the then Minister of Finance, Mr 
Des van Rooyen.  I purchased land in a gated complex in October 2003, 
with no understanding of who the other homeowners  are or were.  This 
is a freehold property and not a sectional title development and is used 
as my primary residence.  After I built my house I subsequently learned 
that Mr Bobat also owned a freehold property in the same gated 
complex, and he resides at this property as well.  I was appointed as 
the Chairman of the Homeowners Association and still am the 
Chairman.  Mr Bobat was also appointed to the Association as a 
director and we remained co-directors on the Board of the Homeowners 
10 
Association.  I have no contact with Mr Bobat outside of these meetings 
and correspondences as related to the Homeowners Association.   
 
I must also indicate that Mr Bobat also worked for Regiments 
when Regiments rendered services to Transnet between 2013 and 
2015.  Mr Bobat was one of the Regiments personnel that were 
assigned to this project.  I had no direct role or influence in the 
appointment of Regiments for these assignments.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    And Mr Anoj Singh? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Mr Anoj Singh subs equent 
to passing my BComm degree in 1995 I enrolled at the then University 
20 
of Durban Westville for the post-graduate accounting program in 1996.  
Mr Singh at the time was also enrolled for this program and accordingly 
we were classmates for that year.  When I joined Spoornet in 2004 Mr 
Singh was the manager responsible for financial reporting at the time at 
Spoornet.  Our interactions were professional and as frequent as our 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 173 of 182 
 
jobs would have required.  In December 2012 Mr Singh approached me 
to offer me a role as the General Manager of Group Capital.  I accepted 
the role and joined the Group Finance Team officially in February 2013.  
 
During the period of 2013 until 2015 before Mr Singh moved to 
Eskom I reported to him directly, effectively Mr Anoj Singh was my 
direct line manager.  During the this period in my opinion we had a 
cordial and professional relationship.  
 
Mr Pita was a colleague during the time that Mr Anoj Singh 
was the CFO.  He was appointed by the then Minister of Public 
Enterprises, Ms Lynne Br own, as the Acting Group Chief Financial 
10 
Officer Transnet effective 1 s t August 2015 and subsequently confirmed 
as the Group CFO in 2016.  For the ensuring 13 months I reported 
directly to Mr Pita until my appointment as the GM Finance of Transnet 
Group Capital on the 1 s t of September 2016, a position I applied for 
and was interviewed by amongst others Mr Pita.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes, and those are the declarations that 
you sought to make before the Chair?  
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    Yes.  May I now refer you back to page 
34 of the statement and now deal with the remedial action.  
20 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  In the recent months together 
with the Board and Executive Management I think there has been a lot 
of introspection around what has transpired at Transnet and what needs 
to be done to avoid this from ever happening again in Transnet or in 
our country.   
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 174 of 182 
 
 
There have been breaches of corporate governance, there 
have been manipulations of certain processes and polic ies within 
Transnet and right up front Transnet, together with the Board has 
begun looking at and making immediate improvements to the 
procurement processes and controls, bringing in Treasury, Risk 
Management and Oversight embedding the financial and capit al 
controls that should exist in a business that used to be there as well by 
the way, an immediate action that has already been implemented is to 
amend the delegation of authority to not allow individuals the authority 
to sign off on procurement transactions, on capital investment 
10 
decisions, where it’s possible.  
 
The oversight process and assurance processes have been 
improved significantly with the Board taking on a very, very diligent 
perspective 
as 
it 
comes 
to 
things 
around 
Treasury, 
Finance, 
Procurement and Investment decisions.   
 
Transnet has also embarked on a program to recover funds 
and as we stated and testified earlier on Chair we have recovered the 
R618million from China South Rail, the R86million we will continue to 
pursue that.  We are pursuin g legal opinion in terms of understanding 
whether ...(intervention)  
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Legal processes? 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:     Legal processes and legal 
opinion to set aside the interest rate swap transactions that are costing 
us in our view approximately R400million per annum in addition to the 
interest, floating interest rate.  We have commenced a renegotiation 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 175 of 182 
 
process with the original equipment manufacturers to align all 
requirements in the short, medium and long term and we are also i n the 
process of talking to certain service providers where there are certain 
allegations around those service providers to reach an agreement on 
some sort of settlement to recover some of these monies back to 
Transnet. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  I think the one key thing Chair 
that is necessary to mention as well is that Transnet is a significant 
entity in the lives of South Africans, in the lives of the business 
10 
community, but at the same time there are a number of peopl e in the 55 
000 strong Transnet community that remain committed to this business, 
and they are good people, they are passionate people, they are people 
who have literally given their lives, they are people in Transnet that will 
be here for more than forty years, working in one entity, committed to 
this country, so together with these people we will ensure that we take 
Transnet to the next level and make sure that as South Africans we 
deliver on the mandate that we have from the country.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes and finally you have made a 
request that you wanted to read the contents of your conclusion and 
20 
with the indulgence from the Chair can I then refer you to page 38 and 
read for us from paragraph 9.1, that is now under your – under the 
heading conclusion. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Chair in my opinion, I think all 
of this is my opinion subsequent to all the observations and reviews 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 176 of 182 
 
that we’ve conducted in the last few months.  I believe Transnet was 
successfully manipulated to benefit a few indiv iduals and entities 
through the following modus operandi.  A focus on significant 
procurement transactions for goods and services which required willing 
participants internally and externally.  Through supply and development 
requirements from Transnet local consulting houses were inserted by 
executives to identify opportunities and design schemes to siphon 
funds out of the company.  The design and use of complex financial 
instruments that hid flows to beneficiaries and created annuity losses 
for State entities, and internal governance structures were deliberately 
10 
weakened, overlooked and not utilised effectively.  
 
Much has been written about the recent events in State Owned 
Entities and how these entities were repurposed for the benefit of a 
few, almost all with either limited access to information or a view only 
into a single transaction. 
 
Over the last few months in my current role I have come to 
realise how legitimate projects or initiatives were directed in a 
particular way to achieve the agenda of the co rrupt.  In my humble 
opinion the process of manipulation and repurposing of Transnet was 
facilitated by parallel approval processes by individuals rather than 
20 
selected committees, which was facilitated by what I call the duality in 
the delegation of author ity framework.  Management overriding certain 
key decisions with no upward reporting and oversight, Board approvals 
without submissions serving at the Executive Committees accountable 
for the transaction.  Board processes overturning management 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 177 of 182 
 
decisions and the Board involved in procurement decision making.  
 
The complexity of terms and transactions most in the financial 
instruments environment and isolating transactions from management 
to avoid obtaining an integrated view of State Capture.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Mr Chair that concludes my 
questions for Mr Mahomedy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much Mr 
Mahomedy for your evidence, thank you for  having come forward and it 
may well be that you will come back at some stage and I h ave no doubt 
you will come if you are asked to come.  
10 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that – we can leave it at that for now, if there 
are any further questions you will be approached, but thank you very 
much for coming to give evidence. 
MR MOHAMED SULEMAN MAHOMEDY:  Thank you Commissioner, 
thank you Chairman for the opportunity.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, you are excused. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Mr Chair at some point we will uplift your 
exhibits in order to ensure that you rep lace those eligible documents 
and also to make sure that we provide those other necessary 
20 
documents that you requested. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I think there were also, I don’t know whether 
these two documents that were handed up this afternoon cover all the 
documents that were referred to which we didn’t have in the bundle but 
which it would be desirable to have ...(intervention)  
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 178 of 182 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  We will look at our notes and make sure 
that you cover those, one of the aspects that you requested was the  
composition of the Treasury Department and how it was ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes, yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  We also need proper copies in due 
course to be available.  To the extent necessary other witnesses of 
Transnet might actually even  testify on those documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, there was also the issue of the composition of 
the Board or the acquisitions and disposals at a certain time.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  We have made notes of those, they will 
10 
be properly placed before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no thank you and then these two actual 
documents will be punched and placed in the right place in the bundle.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes we (indistinct) Chair and we thought 
Mr Pretorius saying something Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, Mr Pretorius, do you have something that you 
want to say? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Chair you are aware of the need 
to place before the Commission an affidavit, I see it’s four o’clock, 
perhaps ...(intervention)  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no we can ...(intervention)  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  You want to do it now? 
CHAIRPERSON:  ...deal with it quickly ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  It’s the affidavit of Zwelini 
Mkhize, it will be EXHIBIT C3, and if I may read it onto the record, it’s 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 179 of 182 
 
not long. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja please do so.  It relates to the evidence of Mr 
Jonas that Jonas gave evidence that I think on the 16 t h of January 2016 
he had a meeting with Dr Zwelini Mkhize.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The evidence is quoted in the 
affidavit, so it will become cl ear what the context of the affidavit is.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no I just want to make sure that – because it 
comes out of the blue, he had given evidence that he had met – that is 
Mr Jonas had given evidence that he had met on the 16 t h of January 
with Dr Zwelini Mkhize and in that meeting he had disclosed to Dr 
10 
Mkhize what had happened according to his version when he met Mr 
Ajay Gupta or another Gupta brother at the residence of the Guptas on 
the day that he indicated he was there, so this is an affidavi t from Dr 
Mkhize to deal with whether he confirms that or not.   
 
Okay, you can read it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Yes, that was partially confirmed 
in the affidavit Chair, it reads: 
“I, Zwelini Lawrence Mkhize state under oath and state that I 
am the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional 
Affairs, 
having 
been 
appointed 
by 
the 
President, 
His 
20 
Excellency Cyril Ramaphosa on 27 February 2018.  I was the 
Treasurer General of the African National Congress for the 
period 2012 until December 2017.  I have been requested by 
the Commission to provide a statement regarding an allegation 
made by Mr Mcebesi Jonas insofar as they relate to my 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 180 of 182 
 
knowledge which specifically relates to paragraph 46 of Mr 
Jonas’ statement.  The said paragraph states the follow ing: 
‘Subsequently in January 2016 I had a meeting with Dr Zwelini 
Mkhize in Johannesburg, the then ANC Treasurer General, 
about another matter.  During the course of the meeting he 
said he had heard a rumour about the Guptas offering me an 
inducement to take up the position of Finance Minister and he 
asked whether this was true.  I told him what had occurred and 
I mentioned the role played by Fana Hlongwane and Mr 
Duduzane Zuma in facilitating the said meeting.  Dr Mkhize 
10 
indicated that he was shocked and advised that he noted my 
concerns regarding the matter including in respect of the role 
of Mr Duduzane Zuma.’”  
That’s the quote from the statement of Mr Jonas.  The statement of Mr 
Mkhize continues: 
“Having read the above paragraph to Mr Jonas’ statement I  
hereby confirm the contents in its entirety.  According to my 
recollection it was on the following week that I met the then 
Secretary General of the ANC Mr Gwede Mantashe at Lthuli 
House as he was also a fulltime official of the ANC with me.  I 
20 
shared with him what Mr Jonas had told me.  He also indicated 
that he was aware of the allegation.  The matter was then 
discussed by senior officials and thereafter by the National 
Executive Committee.  A resolution was subsequently taken 
that given the seriousness of the allegations of State Capture 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 181 of 182 
 
that were being made any ANC member who had more 
knowledge about having been approached by the Guptas in a 
similar manner to Mr Jonas or who was in any way affected by 
this must come forward and provide information to th e 
Secretary General.  My understanding was that this was meant 
to avoid these allegations only being discussed informally and 
behind the scenes with no resolution but rather to deal with 
them through a formal process and appropriate channels.”  
And that statement was sworn to and commissioned on oath.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, I think a copy thereof should be sent to 
10 
the 
persons 
that 
Mr 
Jonas 
in 
his 
evidence 
says 
were                                
present at the meeting and so that they know that there is an  affidavit 
that is to this effect,  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What they can or can’t do with it, it is a decision that 
they will take but they should know that there is an affidavit to that 
effect.  At this stage there might be no n eed to call Dr Mkhizi for 
purposes of that aspect, but if their reaction is such that they feel that 
he should be called then we will hear what they have to say.   
 
At this stage the idea is that this is a conversation between 
20 
two persons, no one else seem s to have been present who can say, 
who can dispute what they say they said, but if they have any of the 
implicated persons wants something to be done about it then their 
request can be considered then on the merits.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Okay Chair, we will do so. 
16 MAY 2019 – DAY 94 
 
Page 182 of 182 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay thank you.  Tomorrow should we start earlier 
than normal, are we likely to finish that, tomorrow’s witness in one day 
or not, or unlikely. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Chair the next witness, Mr 
Callard, will take several days, possibly more than two days but time 
has been set aside for it.  I haven’t consulted with the evidence leader, 
Ms Sello, about it so I am not really in a position to answer.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well yesterday we had discussed the possibility that  
he could start his evidence today, and I was subsequently told that 
there was difficulty with that because the preparations for him to give 
10 
evidence had not been finalised, so I think it should be possible to start 
early tomorrow, so ...(intervention)  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Yes, there was another reason 
why he wasn’t available Chair and that is at the time in another enquiry 
where he is at present giving evidence, so it’s been difficult to arrange 
times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIU S SC:  But he is available tomorrow, 
and Ms Sello is not really objecting to an early start, she is comfortable 
with an early start I am informed.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay let’s start at half past nine then tomorrow.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  As you please Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, we will adjourn then for the day and tomorrow we  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 17 MAY 2019
