PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 02 SEPTEMBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Notshe, good morning 
everybody. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  We are ready to start Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair before we start with today’s – 
with 
the 
witness 
for 
today 
can 
we 
just 
do 
some 
housekeeping exercise?  In your – in your – in the bundle, 
10 
BOSASA Bundle 1 Chair there was an issue on Monday 
about the transcript which starts on page 48 of that bundle 
which has a very small font up to page 56.  I am instructed 
by the – by the record keepers that it has been now the – 
they have put copies with a bigger font which is instead of 
having pages in the small font they are bigger fonts.  They 
say on – they say after page 56 Chair will find that there 
are pages starting with the blue sticker on – on the page.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You said point – page 48? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  It starts from – the one does start from 
20 
the old one which is starting from page 48 to page 56 and 
then the replacements will start after page 56. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it the same number of pages or is it 
more pages? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No there is more pages. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 4 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Because as you will see that the – what 
was in this page were about four pages in each page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I think what – that is fine.  What 
should be done is that it should be paginated because it is 
not paginated at the moment.  And there are two ways of 
doing it.  The one way involves taking out the pages with a 
small font. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And replacing them with the ones with 
10 
the right font and then paginating those.  Another way is to 
keep the pages with the small font with the pagination that 
they have and then paginate these other ones with the 
right font as well but paginate them in such a way that you 
do not interfere with the next – the pagination of the next 
pages. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No fine.  Chair… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it seems to me that the best way is 
just to take out the wrong font and then what you can do 
when you paginate the ones with the right font – so the 
20 
ones with the right font would start from page 48; the first 
page and then when you reach page 56 which is where the 
– the last page of the small font then you could say for 
pages that come after page 56; 56.1, 56.1, .2, .3. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 5 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you do not interfere with the… 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  With the existing pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Alright.  Chair can I – can I suggest 
this?  That the secretariat will deal with the paging 
fortunately this – this bundle will also feature in tomorrow’s 
hearings.  Before we start tomorrow’s hearings and I will 
inform you what has been done and then – it will be 
corrected. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Um – well are you going to be referring 
10 
to these pages today? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Today – no I will not do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will not oh okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so the pagination they can do then. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair the witness for today is also in 
respect of the BOSASA enquiry and the witness is Ms Gina 
Pieters and she is the former secretary of Mr Angelo 
20 
Agrizzi who has testified.  Her testimony will be about the 
interaction she had in the form of arranging for presents 
for Ms Sandy Thomas and Ms Nomvula.  Her evidence – 
her affidavit is on page – it is in Exhibit 29 and it starts 
from page 71 of the exhibit.  Then there is – then with 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 6 of 270 
 
attachments and it will go to page 17. She will testify about 
her arranging for the hampers and also arranging for the 
Get-Well cards for Ms Sandy Thomas.  The witness is Ms 
Gina Pieters; she is here to testify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Please administer the oath or 
affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MS PIETERS:  Gina Pieters. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
10 
MS PIETERS:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MS PIETERS:  I do. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Do you swear that the evidence you will 
give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but 
the truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so 
help me God. 
MS PIETERS:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may be seated Ms Pieters.  Thank 
20 
you. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Ms Pieters although I am asking you 
questions you are talking to the Chairperson so if – when 
you answer please look at him.  And then if you can raise 
your voice with that, we can hear you. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 7 of 270 
 
MS PIETERS:  Sure good morning. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Ms Pieters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Pieters. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Just can I – there is a file in front of 
you.  That file it has got statements can you look at what is 
– put as number 29. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On a lighter note Mr Notshe this is one 
witness who appears quite happy to be here. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair from the beginning I could see 
she is very, very happy. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you for coming to testify. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  She is – she is – unfortunately she was 
telling me the whole – she is from Randfontein. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The whole of Randfontein as we speak 
is on standstill.  Shops have closed to watch her testify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Ms Pieters again I ask you turn to page 
72 of that and then keep your finger there on page 72 and 
then go to – and then go to page … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have told her you are referring to the 
black numbers for page numbers. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then go to page 78.  There is a 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 8 of 270 
 
signature there on that page above where it is Gina 
Pieters.  Whose signature is that? 
MS PIETERS:  It is mine. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And you have looked at the document; 
do you confirm that this is your affidavit? 
MS PIETERS:  Yes I do. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair can this affidavit of the witness 
be admitted as Exhibit T29 in Bundle BOSASA 01? 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
The 
affidavit 
of 
Ms 
Gina 
Pieters 
appearing at page 72 will be admitted and marked as 
10 
Exhibit T29. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  Ms Pieters you – you might – is it 
correct that you were the former professional assistant of 
Mr Agrizzi who has testified in this commission? 
MS PIETERS:  I was yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  What were your duties when you were 
working for Mr Agrizzi? 
MS PIETERS:  Well everything that a PA does except take 
the children to school that was not in my duties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MS PIETERS:  And then I also at – coordinated the bid 
offers – tenders – we submitted tenders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now you – in your affidavit you have 
told – you have testified about preparing birthday hampers.  
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 9 of 270 
 
Can you tell the commission about that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean before that do you confirm that – 
or rather from when to when were you Mr Agrizzi’s PA? 
MS PIETERS:  From May 2004 until February 2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright thank you.  Continue Mr 
Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And in your affidavit you – you deposed 
to the fact that you had prepared some birthday hampers.  
Can you tell the commission about that? 
MS PIETERS:  Yes it – at some point in my tenure to Mr 
10 
Agrizzi I was requested to send hampers to Ms Nomvula 
Mokonyane and her PA; Sandy Thomas.  I can however not 
recall the exact date but I do have evidence that it was 
from 2010 definitely.  It could have been before that as 
well but I cannot locate any records to confirm that 
unfortunately. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  How did you interact – how did you – 
did you interact directly with Mr Thomas or Ms Mokonyane? 
MS PIETERS:  Yes I was – Mr Agrizzi would ask me to 
send hampers and I get hold of Sandy Thomas to get hold 
20 
of her physical address.  I had to ask Ms Thomas where 
she would prefer the hampers to be sent to and if I can 
recall correctly, she asked me not to send it to the office 
and gave me a home address.  Then there was – that was 
one occasion and then a few months later maybe a year 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 10 of 270 
 
later I was asked to send hampers again.  Thereafter I 
saved the detail.  When something became a regular 
occurrence, I would save the details on my phone with an 
address and the telephone number so that it is easier to 
contact the person. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now on page 73 of your affidavit – of 
the record and page 6 you refer to – there is an email that 
you sent.  Can you tell the commission about that email? 
MS PIETERS:  Yes that was one year when I was late in 
sending the hamper. Let me just check.   
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Just to help is it correct that the email 
appears on page 83? 
MS PIETERS:  That is correct that is the one – the 
occasion where I had forgotten and I ordered the hampers 
late. It was after the birthdays. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just – just tell me first who the email 
came from; to whom it was addressed; on what date it was 
and the time and then we read the email and then 
elaborate on it if you would like to? 
MS 
PIETERS: 
 So the email was from me to our 
20 
procurement head Dudu Dube her assistant Enesentia 
Maria [?] and the other Procurement Head Arthur Hand 
where I asked them to please assist with the two ladies’ 
hampers to the value of R1 500.00 each.  One was 
addressed to Minister Nomvula and the other one to Sandy 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 11 of 270 
 
Thomas and then I stated what they needed to write in the 
cards.  Would you like me to read that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Read that ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Just – ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja read that. 
MS PIETERS:  The one to Minister Nomvula was: 
“Happy birthday may the Lord Bless you 
always. Regards Gavin.” 
 
And the one to Sandy Thomas: 
“Happy belated birthday may the Lord Bless 
10 
you always.  Regards Angelo.” 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then read the rest of the email 
there? 
MS PIETERS:  And then I wrote: 
“Please do not make any reference to 
BOSASA contact number for both parcels is 
Sandy Thomas.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you do not have to read the cell 
number. 
20 
MS PIETERS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the last sentence. 
MS PIETERS:  And then I asked: 
“If they can deliver this afternoon still it 
would be great otherwise not later than 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 12 of 270 
 
close of business tomorrow please.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Continue Mr Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now let us just go to the – at the top of 
the email.  You say it is Dudu Dube.  Who was Dudu Dube? 
MS PIETERS:  Dudu Dube was the procurement Head of 
Department for procurement. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Where in BOSASA? 
MS PIETERS:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then Enesentia Maria? 
MS PIETERS:  She was the assistant. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then Arthur Hand? 
MS PIETERS:  He was also Head of the Department. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  So all these people were within 
BOSASA? 
MS PIETERS:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see. Now then you say in the email 
there is a – as a reference when you reading the message 
in the card it says: 
“Happy birthday may the Lord Bless you 
always.  Regards Gavin.” 
20 
Who is Gavin? 
MS PIETERS:  That is Mr Gavin Watson. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see.  And then the one for Ms Thomas 
it says: 
“Happy belated birthday may the Lord Bless 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 13 of 270 
 
you always.  Regards Angelo.” 
Who is Angelo? 
MS PIETERS:  That is Angelo Agrizzi. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now at the bottom there is in capital 
letters: 
“Please do not make any reference to 
BOSASA.” 
Why is that? 
MS PIETERS:  That is so that the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And whose idea was it? 
10 
MS PIETERS:  Mr Agrizzi used to ask me to do that when 
things were confidential and there was not to be any links 
made to BOSASA preferably. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS PIETERS:  So that is why that he – he would have 
asked me to do that and that is why I put it there in Bold 
Capitals so that it could not implicate them – link them you 
know in an untoward manner to BOSASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So – so it was his – Mr Agrizzi’s 
instruction that you should make sure that when they do 
20 
the cards they do not make any reference to BOSASA? 
MS PIETERS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now I see at the top I always struggle 
to read emails because they start with the latest. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 14 of 270 
 
MS PIETERS:  Yes. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And with the earlier one and then the 
latest.  The latest there is from Enesentia Maria at 11:14 
and she sends this to Kobella Porshoko?  Who is Kobella? 
MS PIETERS:  Kobella was also a stationery administrator 
in the procurement department. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And he says: 
“Hi Kobella for your attention.” 
So she was referring your email to Kobella? 
MS PIETERS:  Correct. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Yes.  Now there was an issue as to 
whether these were received.  Ms Thomas says she could 
not remember whether they were delivered at her home.  
Did you receive any – any report that this could not be 
delivered? 
MS PIETERS:  No I did not. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now when you – when there is a – is 
there – when there is a problem about a request like this 
problems or a delivery or could not be delivered do you get 
a report back from the people you have sent? 
20 
MS PIETERS:  Yes and I would like to add that the supplier 
was very reliable at times when they could not locate the 
recipient, they would contact me.  There was also weekend 
deliveries from time to time that the recipient was not 
available that they reported to me. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 15 of 270 
 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now there is – there is also in your 
affidavit about a hamper that was sent to Ms Thomas and 
the email is on page 85 of the record.  Can you take us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of Bundle BOSASA 01. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Of bundle… 
CHAIRPERSON:  BOSASA Bundle 01. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  BOSASA Bundle 01. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Page 85.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  The email where – who is it from? 
MS PIETERS:  It is from myself. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  What – can you tell the commission 
about that email and how did it come about that you sent 
such an email? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please read it first and then you can tell 
me more about it?  Who it was to; who it was from; what 
date it was; what time and read the contents and then tell 
me how it came about? 
MS PIETERS:  The email was from myself on the 28 
20 
November at 10:31. It was to Dudu Dube and Arthur Hand I 
cc’d Jacques Van Zyl.  The email read: 
“Good day Arthur – Dudu and Arthur.  I trust 
you are well.  In Enesentia’s absence I am 
not sure who to contact so sorry for bugging 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 16 of 270 
 
you.  Could you please kindly arrange for a 
ladies hamper of R700.00 to be delivered to 
Ms Sandy Thomas and the address is listed 
and a telephone.  Please treat as VIP.  Card 
was to read:  Get Well soon card.  Dear 
Sandy wishing you a speedy recovery and 
everything of the best.  God Bless Angelo 
Agrizzi.  If they can deliver today it will be 
great otherwise tomorrow morning please.  
Thank you.” 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  How did it come about that you sent that 
email? 
MS PIETERS:  Mr Agrizzi called me and he said to me 
Sandy is not – she is in hospital please get hold of her and 
send her a parcel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And did you have any report that this 
could not be delivered or? 
MS PIETERS:  No. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  There was a problem about it? 
20 
MS PIETERS:  No. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now there is also an email which is 
attached again to BOSASA Bundle 1 page 88. Can you – 
can you read that email and then explain to the commission 
how did it come about that you sent that email? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 17 of 270 
 
MS PIETERS:  The email is also again from myself to 
Enesentia and Magdel Wilson on Thursday 23 September 
2010 at 11:42.  I read – I wrote: 
“Dear Enesentia can you please arrange for 
the attached order for delivery on Saturday.  
Please note that the words on the card 
should be exactly as I have stated on the 
card and not address it from BOSASA 
Management only Angelo.  Thank you.” 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now you refer there to attached order.  
10 
Look at page – BOSASA Bundle 1 page 87 there is a – 
there is something there called Purchase Order what is 
that? 
MS PIETERS:  That is an official Purchase Order which we 
had to complete and when you ordering stuff so that it 
could be attached to the invoice in order that payments 
could be processed. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And I see there is a deliver address 
there.  Whose address is that? 
MS PIETERS:  Ms Sandy Thomas. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then in the middle of the Purchase 
Order details what is written there?  Can you read it for the 
record? 
MS PIETERS:  I wrote: 
“One ladies’ hamper containing primarily 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 18 of 270 
 
chocolates and then also some nuts, dried 
fruit etcetera and a thank you card.  And in 
inverted commas I wrote:  “Dear Sandy your 
thoughtfulness is most appreciated.  God 
Bless, Angelo.” 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And who is Angelo you are referring to? 
MS PIETERS:  Angelo Agrizzi. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:   I see in your email on page 88 that 
you again state what you saw in the other email where you 
say: 
10 
“Do not address it for BOSASA Management 
only Agrizzi.” 
MS PIETERS:  That is correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Was it again to follow instructions that 
you should not mention the name of BOSASA? 
MS PIETERS:  That is correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you have an understanding of why 
there seemed to have been an emphasis on the part of Mr 
Agrizzi that when you sent these cards there should be no 
20 
reference to BOSASA? 
MS PIETERS:  Yes, my understanding was that it was not 
to compromise the individuals being in the positions that 
they were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 19 of 270 
 
MS PIETERS:  Of high profile. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright.  Thank you.  Mr 
Notshe. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Now – these hampers; birthday 
hampers was this one occasion or did it happen almost 
every year? 
MS PIETERS:  Yes it was a common occurrence because I 
had saved it on my cell phone and I had set reminders in 
my calendar to do it every year so that I would get a 
reminder and then automatically send the order through to 
10 
the procurement department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  But you think it – if you started 
sending these hampers and cards from around 2010? 
MS PIETERS:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not before? 
MS PIETERS:  It is possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe one year before? 
MS PIETERS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But not many years before? 
MS PIETERS:  It is possible that I sent it before I just – I 
20 
cannot… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Cannot remember.  Yes. 
MS PIETERS:  Yes I cannot substantiate that at this stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now from the time – from 2010 or 
whatever the time is when you started up to the time that 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 20 of 270 
 
Mr Agrizzi left or you left I cannot – I do not know who left 
first.  Do you know whether you sent these every year to 
Ms Mokonyane and to Ms Thomas or there may have been 
some years when you did not send? 
MS PIETERS:  Yes there may have been some years when 
I did not send or forget. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PIETERS:  As in the instance with 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS 
PIETERS: 
 
When 
Mr Agrizzi 
contacted 
me 
and 
10 
reminded me that I forgot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MS PIETERS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Did these hampers and these presents 
who paid for this? 
MS PIETERS:  Sorry? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Who paid for these hampers and 
presents? 
MS PIETERS:  BOSASA did. 
20 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  I see. Now I see there was an incident 
where you – where you say you neglected to send the 
hampers to – you forgot to send hampers to Ms Thomas.  
Can you tell the commission about that? 
MS PIETERS:  Yes it was towards – well – it being the end 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 21 of 270 
 
of the month I was rather busy at that stage with month 
end reports etcetera and that is how it came about that I 
was – had forgotten and Mr Agrizzi reminded me. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And then you sent the hamper? 
MS PIETERS:  Correct. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair this is the evidence of the 
witness and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thanks.  On page 87 Ms Pieters the 
card that was to be sent to Ms Thomas was to read: 
“Dear Sandy your thoughtfulness is most 
10 
appreciated.  God Bless Angelo.” 
Now I know that that – or maybe I should not say I 
know.  Who chose those words?  Was it Mr Agrizzi or 
yourself? 
MS PIETERS:  Mr Agrizzi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you by any chance know what the 
context was relating to him wanting to say to Ms Thomas: 
“Your thoughtful is most appreciated.” 
Do you understand if there had been some recent 
interaction between them in terms of which Mr Agrizzi 
20 
thought Ms Thomas was somebody who was very thoughtful 
and so on?  Do you happen to know that or is that 
something you do not know? 
MS PIETERS:  He did not tell me – it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 22 of 270 
 
MS PIETERS:  Obvious from the words that there was 
something done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Something that had happened. 
MS PIETERS:  But I do not know what. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  No that is alright.  Now in 
terms of interactions between Ms Thomas and Mr Agrizzi 
do you know whether there was a lot of interaction in terms 
of telephone calls to each other at work?  I am not talking 
about cell phones – at work land – using landline where – 
did they interact regularly or as far as you know or not? 
10 
MS PIETERS:  A lot of people phoned Mr Agrizzi directly 
on his phone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, directly on his phone; cell phone. 
MS PIETERS:  Yes.  On his cell phone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PIETERS:  So not many calls came through on the 
office line. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the landline. 
MS PIETERS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.

MS PIETERS:  So I cannot say how much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PIETERS:  But I know he was inundated with calls from 
a lot of people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  Would that apply also to 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 23 of 270 
 
any calls that may have happened between Mr Agrizzi and 
Ms Mokonyane?  In other words, you – you do not know 
because if there were any, they would have been to his cell 
phone and not the landline? 
MS PIETERS:  Yes they would have been to his cell phone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Does that also apply in terms of 
any interactions – or you would not know any interactions 
between Ms Thomas and Mr Gavin Watson and Ms 
Mokonyane and Mr Gavin Watson you would not know 
about those? 
10 
MS PIETERS:  No I would not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Do you know anything about 
any groceries that BOSASA may have bought and have – 
and caused to be delivered to Ms Mokonyane’s house?  Do 
you know anything about that that Mr Agrizzi may have 
been involved in? 
MS PIETERS:  No that he would have dealt with Alistair 
Esau in the kitchen staff. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you… 
MS PIETERS:  Directly. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would not have been involved in 
that? 
MS PIETERS:  No I do not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you do not know anything about 
those? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 24 of 270 
 
MS PIETERS:  I heard about things like that.  I mean there 
is a lot of talk in the street yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PIETERS:  But… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you never got involved? 
MS PIETERS:  It is possible that I did get documents to 
sign.  A lot of things came to me to print. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PIETERS:  And I had to give it to Mr Agizzi to sign and 
then take it to the accounts department. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS PIETERS:  There was a lot I did not take a mental note 
of everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS PIETERS:  And there was stuff that yes, I had to have 
signed and take it places. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  So if you were involved in any 
way it would have been very limited involvement.  It would 
not – you would not have been too involved in those 
things? 
20 
MS PIETERS:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Alright.  Anything arising? 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  No, no nothing Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Thank you. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 25 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Ms Pieters for 
coming to give evidence.  You are now excused. 
MS PIETERS:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Chair that is the witness for – from my 
side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  And otherwise we… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I will adjourn before we start with the 
next – witness for the day. 
10 
ADV NOTSHE SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning, Ms Gcabashe.  Good 
morning, everybody.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Good morning, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tell me, are we about to be ready? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Yes, I believe we can start Chairman 
with the preliminary matters.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Chairman, this morning we are 
leading the evidence of Ms Seipati Dhlamini.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   A little closer? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 26 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know... they have moved the mic 
from where they normally have it to the other side and since 
this morning, I do not seem to hear people standing there in 
the way I have been hearing them.  I do not know if it has 
got anything to do with the positioning. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  H’m.  That is better. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Chairman, this morning’s session 
deal with the evidence of Ms Seipati Dhlamini.  She is the 
former CFO, Chief Financial Officer of the Department of 
10 
Agriculture and the Department of Agriculture and Rural 
Development in the Free State.   
 
She is here to give evidence on the Vrede Integrated 
Dairy Project.  I do not know if you want me to speak louder 
Chairman or if I am audible enough? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, I can hear you.  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Ms Dhlamini is ready to take the 
oath, Chairman.  After that, I will deal with the bundles. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, please administer the oath or 
affirmation. 
20 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record. 
WITNESS:   Seipati Sylvia Dhlamini. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objections to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
WITNESS:   No. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 27 of 270 
 
REGISTRAR:   Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
WITNESS:   Yes. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you swear that the evidence you are 
about to give, will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing 
else but the truth?  If so, please raise your right hand and 
say, so help me God. 
WITNESS:   So help me God. 
SEIPATI SYLVIA DHLAMINI:  (d.s.s.) 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you.  Thank you, Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you may proceed. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Chairman, Ms Dhlamini has made 
two statements.  The first statement is contained in a new 
bundle that we have prepared for you overnight, Chairman 
which we have labelled Estina Bundle 01 and in Estina 
Bundle 01, you have Exhibit HH16.  H for happy.   
 
HH16 which contains the original affidavit submitted by 
Ms Dhlamini.  We ask that that be admitted into the record 
as soon as she has confirmed the content and that she 
deposed to it. 
20 
 
The second exhibit Chairman is Exhibit HH16.1 which 
consists of the supplementary affidavit that we received 
yesterday with its annexures.   
 
The supplementary affidavit – because the annexures 
are rather voluminous – is split into two files Chairman.  So 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 28 of 270 
 
as and when it becomes necessary, I will indicate when we 
are dealing with Estina Bundle 01 which is the first file which 
has both the original affidavit and the supplementary 
affidavit. 
 
And then I will also indicate when we are dealing with 
Estina Bundle 02 which really just has the remainder of the 
annexures to the supplementary affidavit. 
 
Mr Dhlamini, I hope I will be able to guide you through 
these documents.  And if you do not understand where I am 
taking you to, please you will indicate. 
10 
MS DHLAMINI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Chairman, the other thing I would 
like to point out to you is, that in terms of the new numbering 
that has been introduced into the Commission’s records, we 
have numbering on the left-hand side of Estina Bundle 01 
and 02 which we trust aligns with the new systems. 
 
So in Estina Bundle 01, the numbering on the black... 
the black numbering runs from 01 through to page 415, 
Chairman. 
 
And then when we get to Exhibit HH16.1’s annexures, 
20 
which will be in Estina Bundle 02, again, that numbering 
Chairman will have the black numbering and the red 
numbering but we will try and stay with the black numbering 
and that starts again from 01 through to the end. 
 
So each file has its own numbering Chairman but as we 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 29 of 270 
 
go along, I will indicate what we are using. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   I prefer to stay with the black 
numbering Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think let us do that. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   It seems to make a little bit more 
sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   I am afraid the new area... I am not 
used to this.  It is rather crowded. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So bear with me Chairman.  I was 
used to the other building. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes-no, that is fine. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   We had lots of space to move 
around. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
EXAMINATION BY ADV GCABASHE SC:   Ms Dhlamini, can 
you please pick up Exhibit HH16 which is your first affidavit.  
You will find it in Estina Bundle 01.  I know there are very 
20 
many files behind you because they are reference files and 
related files but I will take you through what we need.  So do 
not worry too much about the numbered files we have here. 
MS DHLAMINI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Chairman, before I forget.  There are 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 30 of 270 
 
also our reference bundles that we have included a couple 
additional documents to.  I simply ask that the reference 
bundle as currently constituted be accepted and be admitted 
to the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are those reference bundles that were not 
admitted previously? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   They were Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   We have simple... in fact, we have 
simple added one or two documents relating to the functions 
10 
of a CFO to the last bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja.  Well, if they were admitted, they 
will remain admitted.  If there are new documents that, when 
that referred were not therefore part of what was admitted, 
those may have to be admitted separately and either be 
included in those bundles or put in separately but you can 
apply your mind during the break and so. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   I shall do that Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   The one new bundle that you do have 
20 
is a bundle we thought we should prepare just out of an 
abundance of caution and we are calling it the Transcripts 
Bundle.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, ja. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   There are certain evidence that was 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 31 of 270 
 
led that we... first with Ms Dhlamini.  So we have tried to 
extract 
just 
excerpts 
from 
those 
particular 
transcripts 
because they are rather voluminous. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   We have put them in their own little 
file which we are calling the Transcripts Extracts File. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Just for your ease of reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And it contains all our transcripts 
10 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So that will be a completely new file. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   That we think is likely to be used for 
both today and as you to deem fit to deal with the stream. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So that one, we might just to... we 
might just have it as a reference bundle or as a bundle but 
the idea might not be to admit the transcripts, I guess.  It is 
just that it should be available for questioning and so on. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   That is correct, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So we might just place on record that 
there is such a file.  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you.  So I place on record that 
we do have a file with transcripts from various witnesses. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 32 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   That we have extracted and placed in 
that file so that we can show Ms Dhlamini where we are 
getting the propositions, we are putting to her from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Do you have a name for it, like 
bundle what or reference file what or file what? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Chairman, it has been labelled 
Exhibit HH, Transcript Extract.  HH is the Vrede Dairy File. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   For the HH file is the Vrede Dairy 
10 
File. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Should we call it Bundle HH or what 
do you think?  Because I say we do not intend that contents 
be admitted as an exhibit.  It just for convenience.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   I am very happy with that Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
 
Let 
us 
call 
it 
just 
bundle 
...[intervenes]  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Bundle HH. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Transcripts ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Transcripts Extracts. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Extract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes, okay alright.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 33 of 270 
 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Ms Dhlamini, I am back with you and 
I really just want you to confirm that both affidavits that you 
submitted are yours, that you have deposed to them, when 
you deposed to them, et cetera.   
 
So I will take you through this very slowly.  If you turn to 
page... and we are using the black numbers on the left-hand 
side, Ma’am.   
 
So if you page to page 3.  I will not call it 003, I will just 
call it page 3.  It is the first page of your affidavit that you 
submitted 
to 
the 
Commission 
which 
is 
dated 
the 
10 
17t h of December.  Is that your name that is reflected on that 
first page, page 3? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Is this your affidavit, Ma’am? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   You are familiar with the contents 
thereof? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   If you look at page 35 of that 
document Ms Dhlamini, there is a signature on that page.  Is 
20 
that your signature? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson that is my signature.  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And I note that the date that is 
written there, it just simple says the 17t h day of December.  
Will you confirm that it is 2019? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 34 of 270 
 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson that would be the 
17t h of December 2019.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you very much, Ma’am.  If we 
then look at the second statement that you submitted 
yesterday.  That one you will find on page 42 of the same 
bundle.  Again, that is your name on the page, on page 42?  
MS DHLAMINI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   The black numbers. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson that is my name. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   If you then go to page 56... 
10 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Do you confirm that that is your 
signature? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson that is my signature. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Do you confirm that you have 
deposed to this and you are familiar with the contents of this 
affidavit? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And that you included these 
annexures and the annexures that are annexed hereto? 
20 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you very much, Ma’am.  If I 
can just give you a short road map...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You want me to admit it? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   If you would, please Chairman.  My 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 35 of 270 
 
apologies.  If you would admit Exhibit H ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The first one, you want it to be admitted 
and marked as exhibit what?  The one starting at page 3? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   It is marked HH16, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavit of Ms Seipati Sylvia Dhlamini 
appearing at page 3 or starting at page 3 of Estina Bundle 
01 is admitted and will be marked as Exhibit HH16. 
AFFIDAVIT OF SEIPATI SYLVIA DHLAMINI AT PAGE 3 OF 
ESTINA BUNDLE 01 IS ADMITTED AND MARKED AS 
EXHIBIT HH16 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then the second one? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And then the second one is HH16.1, 
Chairman and that is the one that starts at page 42. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavit of Ms Seipati Sylvia Dhlamini 
starting at page 42 of Estina Bundle 01 is admitted and will 
be marked as Exhibit HH16.1. 
AFFIDAVIT OF SEIPATI SYLVIA DHLAMINI AT PAGE 42 OF 
ESTINA BUNDLE 01 IS ADMITTED AND MARKED AS 
EXHIBIT HH16.1 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you, Chairman.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  There is this other one that is 
separate.  I do not want to deal with it now in terms of its 
admission or will that come later? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Chairman, that is the original one 
that we got a while ago. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 36 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was admitted? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   That is going to be admitted as 
HH15. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright.  Okay.  Oh, is that this 
...[intervenes]  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So we have simply put it in a bigger 
file Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh ...[intervenes]  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   But you have the original one.  We 
have just put it there in case you had ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, it looks like ...[intervenes]  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   ...markings or questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  No, that is fine.  It looks 
thinner but... okay. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   It was.  We were really happy with it 
until we go the second one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  H’m. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Ms Dhlamini, just to give you a sense 
20 
and also the Chairman a sense of what we are dealing with 
today.  You are the CFO and we are really going to try and 
focus on your role as a CFO, your responsibilities as the 
CFO and all relevant prescripts that you would have been 
aware of as the CFO.   
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 37 of 270 
 
 
Other witnesses have come to give evidence on a range 
of matters relating to the Dairy Project.  We are really going 
to endeavour to try and keep our focus in relation to your 
evidence on your role as you supported the head of 
department, Ms Dhlamini.  Are you happy with that? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I am happy Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Can we start by finding out what your 
current occupation is? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chair.  Chair, I am currently working at 
the Department of Cooperative Government and Traditional 
10 
Affairs in the Free State Province.  The position I hold is of 
an 
Executive 
Director-General 
which 
the 
position’s 
responsibilities in the main is to provide both interventions 
through the municipalities.   
 
And currently, I am acting as the CFO.... I have been 
seconded to the local municipality as the Acting CFO.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you.   When did you actually 
join the Free State Government?  I think it was in 2007?  
Please assist us and just explain? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chair I joined the Free State 
20 
Government in December 2007.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And what position did you hold 
there? 
MS DHLAMINI:   When I joined the Fee State Government, I 
ran it as the Chief Financial Officer, CFO for the department 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 38 of 270 
 
of then was, Local Government and Housing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just pull the mic a bit closer to you. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Oh.  Sorry.  Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And who was the MEC of Housing 
and Local Government when you were there? 
MS DHLAMINI:   When I joined in 2007, the MEC was Mr 
McGregor.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And he was followed by? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Sorry, Chair? 
10 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And after him while you were still 
there? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Just repeat, Chair? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   You... I ask only because I thought 
that Mr Zwane was MEC of that department at the time that 
you were there. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Oh. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   If I am wrong, just correct me and 
give us the facts. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Oh, okay Chair.  As I stated, in 2007, when 
20 
I joined the department the MEC was Mr Mafereka.  Mr 
Zwane joined the department in 2009 after the election.  
When the new government came in then Mr Mafereka did not 
come back but the MEC then became Mr Zwane.  That was in 
2009. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 39 of 270 
 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So you were serving in that 
department as the CFO? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I was serving in that department Chair as 
the CFO. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And Mr Zwane was the MEC of that 
department? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Mr Zwane was indeed the MEC for that 
department. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you.  I simple mention it 
because I know we will come across Mr Zwane again in a 
10 
few minutes time.  So it is common cause that you were also 
the 
CFO 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Agriculture 
and 
the 
Department of Agriculture and Rural Development? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And that is where again Mr Zwane 
would have come within your orbit.  Is that correct? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Mr Zwane then came.  He also found 
me in the Department of Agriculture in 2011.  I joined the 
department of... or I was transferred to the Department of 
Local Government but by the time I get transferred it was 
20 
now the Department of Local Governments and Traditional 
Affairs and Department of Human Settlements.   
 
Then I was transferred in December 2010 to Agriculture 
and 2011 Mr Zwane was also appointed the MEC for that 
department, Agriculture and Rural Development. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 40 of 270 
 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So you arrived at Agriculture before 
Mr Zwane arrived there? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I arrived before Mr Zwane arrived. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you.  Very briefly, can you just 
tell the Chairman what your qualifications are?  You are a 
CFO.  What are the qualifications that you hold? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I have qualified in a BCom Degree.  My 
major subjects are Accounting and Management Accounting.  
I further studied but could not complete with the Institute of 
Management Accountants which is in the UK.  I also studied 
10 
at the University in Canada and I did a course which is 
equivalent to a masters in Investment Appraisal.  Thank you, 
Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Yes, thank you.  So you are very 
qualified, quite frankly? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, in terms of the requirements of the 
post of a Financial Officer, I am properly qualified. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And you have vast experience 
because of your service in this particular role? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, I have vast experience in the service 
20 
because I joined the government in 1996 and worked for the 
Provincial Treasury of the Free State.  In 2007, I became the 
CFO in the Northern Cape Department of Treasury and I 
moved again from the same year as only March after 
December.  December, I joined the Free State Government in 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 41 of 270 
 
Local Government and Housing as the CFO. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So ...[intervenes]  
MS DHLAMINI:   My role as a CFO started in 2007. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So one can safely say that when it 
comes to understanding the legal framework that regulates 
and governs anything to do with procurement, you would 
know everything you need to know about that? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Can I just ask you one question just 
as an exercise really?  The Premier of the Free State in the 
10 
period that we are really just interested in, which is 2011 to 
2015 or 2010 to 2015, was Mr Magashule.   
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, it was Mr Magashule. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Did you work in his office at any 
point in time? 
MS DHLAMINI:   No, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you.  You were an Executive 
within the Management Committee of DARD.  DARD being 
the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.   
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, I served as a CFO.  I served in the 
20 
Executive Management of that department. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And I just want to make it clear for 
the record that we will at some point going to refer to Exco.  
That reference already be to the Provincial and Legislature 
Executive Committee.  Is that a totally different structure? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 42 of 270 
 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, it is a totally different structure Chair 
but I am not sure if Chair you want to refer to Exco as for the 
legislature or Exco as the structure that is consistent of the 
Premier and the MEC’s, all the MEC’s?  That is then different 
from the legislature. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   For our purposes and just for clarity 
Ms Dhlamini, we are really referring to the first, where is the 
provincial legislature because we are going to be talking 
about the resolution that cabinet signed, the Exco Resolution 
that dealt with Vrede. 
10 
 
And that really is our interest in making sure that on 
record there is no confusion between our reference to Exco 
and when we are talking about the Provincial Legislature 
headed by the Premier and your Executive Management 
Committee within the department which would have been 
headed by Mr Zwane as the Head of the Department. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think there may be confusion there.  
The... as I understand the position, unless you said one 
thing while in your mind you had something else in mind.  
The... there is the executive council of the province.   
20 
 
The executive council of the province is led or chaired 
by the premier and the other members of that council are the 
MEC’s.  Those are the only members of the executive 
council.  So some people might call it Exco.  I do not know.   
 
But constitutionally that is the executive council of the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 43 of 270 
 
province.  That is like the cabinet of the province.  And then 
there is the provincial legislature.   
 
Now again whether the provincial legislature would have 
its own Exco but I doubt that it would involve the premier or 
any MEC.  H’m. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Chairman, in context, the relevance 
of this is related to the Exco minute that authorise the 
implementation of the Vrede Dairy Project.  And that was a 
cabinet discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is the executive council? 
10 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So that would the executive council 
of... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   That is really what I was trying to 
clear up.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so when you refer to Exco, that is the 
structure you are referring to? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   That is what we will be referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   I just did not want there to be 
20 
confusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, no.  That is important.  So I 
know also when you say Exco in this context, you are 
referring to the Provincial Executive Council. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   I thank you for assisting in clearing 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 44 of 270 
 
up this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  No, that is fine. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you, Chairman.  Again, just I 
am really just probing your competency, your experience, et 
cetera at this point Ms Dhlamini.  You were also a member of 
the Chief Financial Offices Forum which was convened and 
coordinated by the Provincial Accounting General, is that not 
correct? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Now, this is a forum that would have 
10 
to facilitated the work that you did as CFO, all of your 
CFO’s.  Am I right? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And it also allowed you to ask and 
debate operational questions and issues that concerned 
you?  You could debate the at this forum? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   You were also able t have direct 
access to this forum to the Provincial Accounting General 
especially the black person may have queried a certain non-
20 
compliance by a department for instance your department? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Again, I am just putting on record 
what we understand you to have been familiar with at the 
time.  I am correct in saying you were not a member of the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 45 of 270 
 
Provincial Treasury Committee, were you? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Will you repeat Chair? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   You were not a member of the 
Provincial Treasury Committee which would have been part 
of the Provincial Treasury? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I was not, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Would you be invited to meetings of 
the Provincial Treasury Committee? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, you would be invited at some point, 
only when it dealt with budget matters.  When you are invited 
10 
to come and basically it would be the department that is 
invited to come and present the budget of the department to 
the committee.  So you... I would go there as the CFO 
together with ...[intervenes]  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   The HOD, other [indistinct] 00.01 
managers in the department.  That is how I understand it. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And the HOD would really lead the 
team and your job was to advise on financial and 
budgetary matters that were supposed to be discussed at 
20 
these meetings. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Excellent.  I am sure you will agree 
with me when I say to you that the most important 
functions of the CFO – and I know you have dealt with 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 46 of 270 
 
some of those in your affidavit but I really am just trying to 
have a broad overview of who you were professionally and 
what your competencies were.  I would like just to keep 
saying that.  The most important functions as a CFO in a 
provincial department would include financial management, 
budget 
and 
expenditure 
control, 
rendering 
advice 
to 
management especially to the HOD and, of course, to other 
managers. 
 
Risk 
management, 
asset 
management, 
information systems management and ensuring that there 
was full compliance with the financial legal prescripts 
10 
including compliance with the SCM policy document. 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct, Chair.  However, risk 
management and information management system were not 
part of my responsibility.  Risk management is a separate 
unit that reports to the HOD and information systems report 
also - in our department it was reporting under corporate 
services. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   I am comfortable with that.  I just 
want to underscore the specific legislative prescripts or 
provisions that would have assisted you in discharging 
20 
your functions.  So we know that first Section 217 of the 
Constitution 
and 
we 
really 
are 
dealing 
largely 
with 
procurement matters because the Vrede Dairy Project was 
about procurement largely or farmer support.  So Section 
217 you are happy was really the grounding provision that 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 47 of 270 
 
you had to refer to. 
MS DHLAMINI:   I am happy, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And that would then cascade down 
to the PFMA which then would further cascade down to 
Treasury regulations and structure notes. 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And is that not only you but every 
CFO was obliged to be familiar with all those provisions? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct, Char.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   I want to focus for a minute on 
10 
Section 38 of the PFMA just for one minute because I want 
us to have a common understanding that the entire Section 
38 was applicable to the functions that you discharged, am 
I correct? 
MS DHLAMINI:   If you look at the entire Section – can I 
refer, Chair? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Please. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Because it is confusing, sometimes it 
talks about part 2 of the PFMA. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   I have a slightly newer copy of the 
20 
PFMA than you do.  I hope that our provisions are the 
same.  I have one in my reference bundles but are you 
happy to use the one you are holding in your hand? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I think, Chair, they are still the same, it is 
just that they were not printed at the same printers. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 48 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Let us proceed.  So you have got 
Section 38(1) which runs from – (1) runs from (a) all the 
way down to (n) and then you have got (2), 38(2) which is 
particularly 
important 
in 
this 
particular 
investigation 
because it says that: 
“An 
accounting 
officer 
may 
not 
commit 
a 
department, 
trading 
entity 
or 
Constitutional 
institution to any liability for which money has not 
been appropriated.” 
10 
You are comfortable that this applied to the work that you 
did.  That was the question. 
MS DHLAMINI:   I am comfortable, Chair, that it applies.  
However, there are other elements in this section that they 
may not -  certainly not be my core responsibility like you 
would release this, an internal audit which is separate to 
this, also risk management but in annexure it applies. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Yes.  And then the other important 
one I think we should just agree on is that Section 44 and 
45 of the PFMA would also have been relevant to the work 
20 
that you did because 44 allowed the accounting officer, 
that is Mr Thabethe, as the HOD to delegate certain 
functions to you.  So the financial functions would be 
delegated to you.  Are you comfortable with that? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I am fine with that, Chair. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 49 of 270 
 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And then Section 45 actually tells 
you 
what 
your 
responsibilities 
would 
have 
been.  
Responsibilities of officials who have been delegated 
certain responsibilities.  You are comfortable with that? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Basically, Section 45, Chairperson, talks 
to responsibilities of other officials and in this case, yes, I 
would also fall under other officials.  I will explain that 
matter when we deal with the budget. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   That is fine because what will be of 
particular importance when you get there – and I am happy 
10 
we will deal with that later - would be 45(b) which says that 
those officials or that particular official is responsible for 
the effective, efficient, economical and transparent use of 
financial and other resources within that official’s area of 
responsibility. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So the broad proposition you have 
here.  You have to say yes and not nod, hey, you must 
remember that.  Then the last one which I think is also 
important – not as important as the others, but relevant, 
20 
would be Section 66 and 68 of the PFMA because these 
say they would apply to any transaction that binds or may 
bind an institution and in essence Section 66 prohibits the 
department from entering into any transaction that binds or 
may bind the department unless such transaction is 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 50 of 270 
 
authorised by the PFMA, so it has a tangential relevance to 
the 
circumstances 
under 
which 
you 
could 
bind 
the 
department.  Can we proceed?  
MS DHLAMINI:   We can proceed, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   We are briefly going to look at what 
different 
witnesses 
said 
they 
understood 
your 
responsibilities to be and this will relate to some of the 
testimony that has been given before this Commission.   
The context really is that a material part of the 
advice that you would have given, and you will explain as 
10 
we go along, this is just giving context either, either in 
relation to the appointment of the implementing agents or 
the approval of proposals placed before HOD by Estina or 
any recommendations on any deviations from SCM policy 
or the approval of any agreement.  Those are matters that 
you were involved in either directly or indirectly.   
 
So the testimonies that I am going to be reading to 
you, the questions I will be asking you, will relate to what 
others thought your goal was. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Thank you, Chair. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Can we just start with looking at 
the SCM policy document which will be found at reference 
bundle A.  So if you look at the bundles behind you. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Reference bundle A? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Reference bundle A and if you turn 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 51 of 270 
 
to page 333, it is right at the end, should be right at the 
end.  So this is the supply chain management policy 
documents which was signed by Mr Thabethe, as the HOD, 
on the 1 April 2012. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chair, let me get to it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Do the best you can to raise your voice 
so I can hear you, Ms Dhlamini.  Did you say 333, Ms 
Gcabashe? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   On the top right hand side, 
Chairman, yes.  Oh, it is because the reference I want to 
10 
take her to, my apologies.  My apologies to the Chairman 
and to you, Ma’am, the document itself starts at page 325 
but I want to take you to page 333.  Yes, that page, it 
starts …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, the relevant is 333? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Yes, it starts at 325. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   But the first page I want to take her 
to is page 333 of that document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
20 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Page 333, you are there? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I am there, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, thank you. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And I know that you have dealt with 
this, especially in your first affidavit, Ma’am, but I really 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 52 of 270 
 
just want to have an overview, I am not going to stop you 
from going –we are going to deal with your affidavit later – 
from going back to those particular areas you wanted to 
emphasise.  But for current purposes, clause 2.1.4 on that 
page deals with the role of the accounting officer, that 
would be the HOD, and it says that: 
“The HOD can do various things including sub-
delegating powers and duties to the CFO and SCM 
practitioners to discharge SCM functions.” 
You do not take issue with that? 
10 
MS DHLAMINI:   I do not take issue with that. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   If you go over the page to page 
334, you get the role of the CFO, sub 2.2 deals with all of 
the things that were expected of you.  Can you please just 
read those into the record because that is particularly 
important to this investigation. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Paragraph 2.2: 
“Role of the Chief Financial Officer, ensuring that 
the department’s procurement processes are in line 
with the applicable legislation, ensuring that the 
20 
department’s 
procurement 
policy 
is 
effectively 
implemented, ensure that officials implementing, 
applying and management the SCM policy are 
trained 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
prescribed 
requirements, guiding and monitoring the supply 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 53 of 270 
 
chain management  unit in the operation, serves as 
a member of the Bid Adjudication Committee.” 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you, Ma’am. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Thank you, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   In addition to that, you then have at 
2.5 the delegation by the HOD which would be consistent 
with Section 44 of the PFMA and that they are referring to 
clause 2.6.1.  I just point these out to you so that when we 
have the discussion about your role you these in mind what 
this document says your role was.   
10 
 
If we go over the page to 335 we there see at 
clause 3.3: 
“Procurement 
above 
the 
transaction 
value 
of 
500 000” 
Which speaks to competitive bids being invited for all 
procurement above 500 000.  Now we have already said 
that you have to make sure that the prescripts of this 
document must be complied with and I know you will deal 
with the exceptional cases, I will not stop you, I am just 
going through the general position.   
20 
 
Can we then go over the page, at clause 3.5.1 there 
is a provision that says that: 
“Any reason for deviating from inviting competitive 
bids should be recorded and improved by the 
accounting officer.” 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 54 of 270 
 
You are comfortable with that.   
We then move on to page 349, Ma’am, 349 and at 
349 you have got clause 2.19 which speaks to the 
appointment of consultants.  To the extent that that may be 
relevant I just wanted to point it out to you because you 
may want to speak to us about who may or may not have 
been a consultant as opposed to an implementing agent 
when we get to that part. 
We then move on to page 352 which speaks to 
irregular expenditure and payments which is another 
10 
critical 
element 
to 
the 
investigation 
we 
have 
been 
conducting.  It is clause 3.4 and it spells out what irregular 
expenditure might be and again, of course, anything that 
does not fit with prescripts as set out in this document 
could constitute, might constitute irregular expenditure.  
MS DHLAMINI:   Alright. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   I then you to page 356, I will not 
dwell on it, I simply point out that this part deals with 
ethical standards and then we go to the last page, which is 
359, which is of particular importance which under Goals 
20 
and Responsibilities.  This is what Mr Thabethe put into 
this document, 359.  It reads as follows: 
“Responsibility for the implementation of this policy 
rests with the Chief Financial Officer with the 
assistance of the senior manager supply chain 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 55 of 270 
 
management.” 
You are happy that that is what is written here? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Okay, that is going to become an 
important provision in relation to whether you were the 
custodian or not the custodian of this policy document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Must we put that file away for now? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Just to the side for now, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Chairman, I do not know if you 
10 
want to us to go just a little beyond quarter past or if you 
want us to take the short adjournment now and come back 
or you want us to …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am easy, I am easy.  What is – from 
your side, do you want us to go up to half past and then 
take the tea break or should we take it now? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Chairman, we are going to the 
transcripts now so maybe we should just take a short 
adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And go to the – we will need the 
transcripts possibly as we come back. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja, 
okay, 
we 
will 
take 
the 
tea 
adjournment, it is now quarter past, we will resume at half 
past.  We adjourn. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 56 of 270 
 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may proceed. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you, Chairman.  Chairman, 
you will need for the next couple of questions the bundle, 
the transcripts bundle.  You will also need Mr Thabethe’s 
first affidavit which can be found in the old EXHIBIT 
HH10(a). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Or what we can do, because I do 
not have too many files here, as and when you refer to a 
10 
particular one you will announce and you will give it to me. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  For now, just I just deal – it is in 
bundle 01?  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   I think let us start with  - if you 
could be handed Mr Thabethe’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Which is in HH10(a). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And it is page – the black numbers, 
it would be page 9. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Paragraph – I beg your pardon.  
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 57 of 270 
 
Chairman, I do beg your pardon, I do have three files here.  
It is page 13, MRT13, if it is Thabethe we are looking at, 
MRT13 at paragraph 37.4.  MRT13.  You have Mr 
Thabethe’s affidavit there, Ma’am?  H10(a) 
MS DHLAMINI:   I have it, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you.  What he says at page 
13, paragraph 37.4 and 37.5 - essentially, I think aligns to 
what we have discussed on the responsibilities of a CFO, 
so – and you will confirm if this is correct.  He says, for 
instance, that: 
10 
“All payments which were made in respect of the 
Vrede Dairy Project including payments to Estina 
were authorised by the provincial treasury after 
having 
been 
duly 
verified 
by 
me 
and 
the 
department’s Chief Financial Officer.  The Chief 
Financial Officer had to verify and confirm the 
correctness of the invoices, had to do a tax 
clearance on the payee and had to manage the 
payments in accordance with the approved budget 
before any payment would be made.” 
20 
Now 
that 
would 
fall 
squarely 
within 
the 
financial 
management portfolio that you would hold, am I correct? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Then the following paragraph says 
– again, this is Mr Thabethe saying: 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 58 of 270 
 
“I did not perform any function and did not take any 
decision in respect of the implementation and 
execution of the Vrede Dairy Project without having 
followed the prescribed departmental processes or 
without having first obtained the required approvals 
and authority from the MEC Agriculture and the 
Exco.” 
Now here again, when he speaks to the prescribed 
departmental processes, you would be the person advising 
him on how to comply with those, that is part of what you 
10 
do.  Yes or no? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, I think for me this statement 
is too broad especially that when it refers to approvals and 
authority from the MECs and Exco.  If it has to be confined 
to my responsibility then it will be confined within the 
confinement of the PFMA and the PFMA, solely the 
accounting, it is very clear, HOD is the accounting officer.  
So once you bring the MEC and Exco into the PFMA 
matters then you are starting to deal with issues of 
interference.   
20 
So we have – Section – paragraph 37.5, I am not 
agreeing with I hundred percent.  Yes, the processes of the 
department with regard to financial management issues, 
because there is a lot of processes, that is why I am 
saying, Chair, this statement is too broad, there is a lot of 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 59 of 270 
 
processes that are happening.  
For instance, when you deal with projects, it is a 
process.  When you identify the project, it is process, 
which process the CFO might not be responsible for or 
might not even participate.  Hence I am saying this 
statement is too broad and too big for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what he is saying here, he refers to 
functions 
that 
he 
performed 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
implementation and execution of the Vrede Dairy Project 
and he says there is no function and there is no decision 
10 
he took in respect of the implementation and the execution 
of the Vrede Dairy Project, one, without having followed 
the prescribed departmental processes or to - without 
having obtained the required approvals and authority from 
the MEC Agriculture and the Exco.   
Now you have made the point that the MEC and 
Exco, if I understood you correctly, ought not to be 
involved in the decision relating to the implementation of a 
project such as that.  Did I understand you correctly? 
MS DHLAMINI:    Chair, that is not what I am saying.  What 
20 
I am saying is, with regard to all sectors of financial 
management which are within the confinement of the 
PFMA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is the role of the accounting officer. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 60 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And are you saying that in regard to that 
role there is no approval required from the – required by 
the accounting officer from the MEC or from the executive 
council.  Is that what you are saying, he must just do his 
job, or she must do her job? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Okay, what I mean, Chairperson, is yes, 
there might be other – I am aware of other processes 
whereby all the projects for instance before they can be 
implemented they would be approved by the Exco or the 
MEC because we will then, with regard to the MEC, as we 
10 
prepare the budget we will present the projects to the 
MEC.  MEC will say it is okay and there is another process 
of the Exco and the Budget Lekgotla where in the Budget 
Lekgotla 
you 
will 
then 
present 
the 
project 
of 
the 
department, then the Exco would agree to that, it is part of 
the budget, the Budget Lekgotla. 
 
What I meant here, especially I was preparing two 
processes.  When HOD is saying: 
 I did not perform any function and did not take any 
decision in respect of the implementation and 
20 
execution of the Vrede Dairy Project without having 
followed the prescribed departmental processes 
or…” 
And then he said processes or: 
“…without 
having 
first 
obtained 
the 
required 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 61 of 270 
 
approval and authority from the MEC” 
Yes, the latter part I agree with it and hence I am saying in 
terms of processes of the department, yes, he was 
following the processes of the department and I can only 
talk 
to 
those 
processes 
with 
regard 
to 
financial 
management and issues around that involves into the 
PFMA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so you are saying you would limit 
your comment. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   To those processes. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Anything outside of that you – well, you 
do not have – you do not have an issue with him saying he 
did not implement any decisions of this project without 
seeking the required approvals, authority of the MEC or 
Exco.  You do not have a problem with that either.  All you 
are saying is, the ones that you are definite about in terms 
of compliance are the ones relating to the financial 
management processes.   
20 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is exactly what I am saying, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Now Ms Gcabashe’s question 
was whether in following – insofar as Mr Thabethe says in 
this paragraph that the functions he performed and the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 62 of 270 
 
decisions he made in regard to the implementation of this 
project, 
he 
followed 
the 
prescribed 
departmental 
processes.  At least in regard to that, he was asking would 
he have complied or followed those processes on your 
advice and I understood her to be asking that.  In other 
words, you were giving advice as to what should be done 
in regard to the processes on financial management, at 
least. 
MS 
DHLAMINI: 
  
Chairperson, 
can 
you 
clarify 
that 
question?  Maybe I am missing something. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I think what you said is, with 
regard to financial management, processes relating to 
financial management, of this project, in the department, I 
understood you to say those, you can testify to those, that 
those were complied with. 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is what I am saying, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now here he is saying he complied 
with those and as I understood Ms Gcabashe’s question, it 
includes asking whether in complying with those, he was 
acting on your advice or guidance or not? 
20 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, in dealing with that matter, 
we will have to unpack them.  As I said, processes, there 
are a lot of processes.  Unless we unpack those processes 
that he is referring to …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, those processes. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 63 of 270 
 
MS DHLAMINI:   …then I can say with this process yes, he 
complied …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You – okay, okay. 
MS DHLAMINI:   …with my advice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is what I meant.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So your answer would be, in regard to 
some processes it would have been with your guidance or 
advice but in regard to others, it might not have been with 
your advice. 
10 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is exactly what I want to say, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Of what I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Gcabashe? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And we are going to unpack them 
because 
we 
are 
going 
to 
talk 
about 
the 
deviation 
memorandum, those submissions, where your signature 
appears under recommended, we are going to talk about 
the agreement, again where your signature appears, and I 
20 
know you say you signed as a witness, etcetera, etcetera.  
So you are correct when you say you are more comfortable 
in giving specific cases.  We will be getting to those, I was 
really just trying to give you that broad overview before we 
deal specifically with deviations, for instance, and your 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 64 of 270 
 
role in that. So we will get there and if you are 
comfortable, Chairman, there are examples that we will 
place before her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, that is fine but before you 
proceed can I clarify this one point?  Ms Dhlamini, Mr 
Thabethe here says every function he performed as I 
understand 
it 
and 
the 
decision, 
he 
made 
in 
the 
implementation of the Vrede Dairy Project he, among other 
things, obtained required approvals and the authority from 
the MEC and of course, Exco.  Now on your understanding, 
10 
in regard to a project like this, would not the approval that 
may be required from the MEC and maybe the executive 
council be limited to approving that the project – approving 
the project, as such, but when it comes to the various 
functions and decisions to be made in implementing it, 
would that not be left to the accounting officer and his 
management and the politicians would no longer be 
involved in that? 
MS DHLAMINI:   You are correct, Chairperson, that is how 
it works. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DHLAMINI:   MEC, Exco, they approve the projects to 
say the department can implement this project, they not 
the budget – the financial implication of the project but 
when it comes to specifics in terms of implementing, 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 65 of 270 
 
making the project to work, that is the HOD and his 
management. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So would it be correct then to say if this 
statement by Mr Thabethe is factually correct, then it would 
mean that the MEC and the executive council got involved 
in various implementation decisions in respect of which 
they should not be involved because that should be for the 
management and the accounting officers and not for the 
politicians?  If this is correct, if this is what it means? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson, if this statement is 
10 
correct, that is what it would mean. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you, Chairman, and we will 
come back to this issue of the relationship between the 
executive, as in the MEC and the administrative staff, when 
we talk about the first payment of 30 million because in 
your affidavit you say MEC Zwane asked you to go and see 
the finance people about that payment.   
So that is exactly the kind of example that the 
Chairman has in mind, when MEC instructs you to go and 
20 
ask for money, that now he is delving into implementation, 
go and get money for this project.  We will come back to it 
because it is a specific set of questions.   
I just want to foreshadow it so that you know that I 
will be linking the Chairman’s question with that example 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 66 of 270 
 
where the MEC actually told you to go to Treasury and get 
the first 30 million.  Are you happy with that? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Oh, okay, Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   I just want to come back very 
briefly again to Mr Thabethe’s reliance on your as the CFO 
and if you look at the transcripts bundle, the thin little 
transcripts bundle at page 20.  There is a discussion that 
he was having with the Chairman and as I was probing him 
where he actually said – and it is page 20, it only one 
number there, it is written in red, where he actually says at 
10 
line – from about line 13, he says he cannot be a super 
human being, not when he has an expert on his team – I 
am paraphrasing - , such as the CFO.  I am simply showing 
you where I get it from and here he was essentially saying 
that he relies on you when it come to taking judgment calls 
that relate to finance.  That is the essence of what he says 
in this part of the transcript.  I am simply consolidating 
what he has said in the affidavit, he had a debate with the 
Chairman and here he says that you are in a better 
position to understand what, for instance, Treasury would 
20 
want, what the auditor general would want and this is 
correct, it must be correct, that he would rely on you for 
this financial advice. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, it is correct, Chairperson, he could 
rely on me but as we deal with these issues, I would show 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 67 of 270 
 
that there is instances where he did not rely on me hence I 
will emphasise the fact that he could but not always that he 
relied on me. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Okay.  Again, I am going to come 
back to this because here we were talking about the 
monthly and quarterly reports that were submitted.  I know 
you want to deal with them, you have dealt with them in 
your supplementary affidavit.  Please bear this in mind that 
his view was as he interrogated the month-end quarterly 
reports submitted by Estina you were an important source 
10 
of guidance to him because you are financially astute.  We 
will come to that when you deal with your supplementary 
affidavit. 
 
I then briefly want to take you to page 23 of the 
same transcript bundle and Dr Masiteng, we also asked 
him about the competencies that a CFO would have and 
there you have from line 10 or from line 6 really where he 
summarises that: 
“An accounting officer should appoint a CFO with 
relevant experience…” 
20 
Etcetera, etcetera.   
“…to 
manage, 
interpret, 
analyse 
information, 
working capital, assets.” 
Etcetera.  I do not know if you want to read it but it really 
confirms what we have been dealing with all along, what 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 68 of 270 
 
your 
competencies 
ought 
to 
have 
been. 
 
Are 
you 
comfortable that he confirms that or would you like to read 
it? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I am comfortable, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Then I want to very briefly just to – 
so I do not have to necessarily come back to this bundle 
too soon – take you to page 72 of the same bundle and 
there we have the testimony of Mr Dumisani Cele, page 72, 
from about line 9 to about 14 where he specifically says 
that you, the CFO, are the custodian of the SCM policy, it 
10 
is one of the prescripts, one of the policy documents that 
you would be giving advice on and again, this links into the 
advice you are giving to the HOD and, of course, to other 
managers as well.  
 You have disputed this in your affidavit that you 
are the custodian of the SCM policy, so maybe you want to 
explain what you meant when you said you are not the 
custodian and to assist you, you deal with this in your first 
affidavit under the – black numbers, page 9 going through 
to page 11 of that document and because this is your 
20 
explanation I think it is correct for us to place it on record 
that this is how you viewed your role now that you know 
what Dr Masiteng, what Mr Thabethe and Mr Cele believes 
your role was. 
 
So if you are at your paragraph 7.1, 7.2 – are you 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 69 of 270 
 
there, Ms Dhlamini? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, yes, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you.  I just want to give you 
the opportunity to explain to the Chairman, you do not 
have to read it but just to explain to the Chairman why your 
view was that you are not a custodian of the SCM policy. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Thank you, Chair.  Chairperson, generally 
the policies of the department, the custodian is the HOD 
because the HOD is the one who approves the policies.  
However, 
those 
policies 
might 
impact 
on 
different 
10 
managers or different responsibilities and with that regard, 
that is where they are being implemented.  
Hence is not in the policy, the supply chain 
management  policy as Advocate Leah has illustrated, I 
think it is almost the last page of the policy, it says the 
implementation is the responsibility of the CFO and 
assisted supply chain management.   
That is where I am coming to in this when I say - I 
am not the custodian but I am the implementer of this 
policy 
and 
furthermore, 
I 
said 
even 
other 
managers 
20 
implement this policy because Section 45 of the PFMA 
gives 
responsibility 
– 
assigns 
responsibility 
to 
other 
officials and that other officials will be inclusive of me also 
which then I would explain to Chairperson why I am saying 
because in terms of other officials, where do I sit?  I sit 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 70 of 270 
 
whereby I approve roles in the department, I run a unit, 
which is my primary responsibility to ensure that the 
activities of that unit are happening which is financial 
management in general, I have done, I have my budget.  
Section 45 of the PFMA applies to me in that regard. 
And then I have these other roles that I am – this 
other cap that I am wearing which is in terms of the 
Treasury 
regulations 
which 
says 
I 
must 
assist 
the 
accounting officer in terms of his responsibility.   
So when you read Section 45 of the PFMA it talks 
10 
about other managers also implementing efficient, effective 
and transparent financial management and that is inclusive 
of supply chain when you implement it.  Hence I am saying, 
yes, the implementation, the monitoring of this policy 
would fall under – as a guidance would be under the CFO 
but it does not necessarily mean I assume exclusive 
responsibility because those who budgets in terms of 
Section 45 of the PFMA, as and when they implement that, 
they ought to know this policy, they ought to be able to 
implement this policy and I think it is even in the policy 
20 
where it says as a – I think it is part of my responsibility, I 
ought to assist and train those who implement this policy 
and that has happen.   
That is what I meant, Chairperson, when I said I do 
not assume exclusive responsibility of this policy and I am 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 71 of 270 
 
not the custodian. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, when I say that distinction you 
sought to make, I was not sure what the point was that you 
sought to make because you made the point clear that part 
of your responsibilities as CFO was to see to it that the 
SCM policy is implemented properly, as I understood, is 
that right? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is right, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so in the context of what we are 
dealing with, one of the issues is whether that policy was 
10 
properly implemented.  You have to establish what the 
policy is, you have to look at what happened and then say 
did what happen – did what happened comply with the 
policy when it was implemented.   
So it seems to me that if you are responsible for the 
proper implementation of the policy, that is the important 
part, so I was not sure what the point is about being or not 
being a custodian but from what you are saying, it seems 
that all you are saying is the person who must approve 
policies for the department is the accounting officer and 
20 
that is the person you call the custodian.  Is that right? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, but as far as implementation, 
you readily accept that it was your responsibility to ensure 
that there was proper implementation of the SCM policy. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 72 of 270 
 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and you make the point that there 
was responsibility on other people to ensure that there was 
compliance as well but in the end I think at the top of – 
below the accounting it was you. 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Yes, thank you, Chairman.  And in 
your affidavit at paragraph 7.6 you essentially say in 
different language exactly what the Chairman is saying 
10 
because you say here that any document with financial 
implications, those submissions have to come to the CFO 
for recommendation.   
 
So 
again, 
when 
they 
come 
to 
the 
CFO 
for 
recommendation, your task is to make sure that the 
policies of the organisation, certainly the supply chain 
management policy and then the legal prescripts had been 
complied 
with. 
 
That 
is 
what 
part 
of 
making 
a 
recommendation would entail. 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct, Chairperson, especially 
20 
when it deals with issues of financial management. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Yes. 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Absolutely.  Chairperson, I believe 
that we now have a base from which we can move on to the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 73 of 270 
 
next area. 
And the next area we are moving to, Ms Dhlamini, 
really deals with what we, the legal team, call a top down 
initiation of this Vrede Dairy Project. 
 
We are aware that the project itself, Mohuma 
Mobung, initiation started in 2010.  That is correct, is it 
not? 
MS DHLAMINI:   It started in 2011. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   No, no, Ms Dhlamini, it started in 
2010 because the idea was conceived by the MEC, MEC 
10 
Zwane, in 2010 on our records. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Let me – Chairperson, let me explain it 
…[intervenes] 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   My apologies, Ma’am, in 2011. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   2011. 
ADV 
GCABASHE 
SC:   Page 
11. 
 
I 
am 
going 
to 
...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it is page 11. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Yes.  No, no, no.  I am with you.  
20 
Because when we had Ms Rockman, she spoke about a 
presentation of September 2011 that spoke to the Mohuma 
Mobung concept.  So I immediately agree with the 2011.  
Can we tick that one, 2011? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson.  Let us... it started in 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 74 of 270 
 
2011. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And the important element to this is, 
it was conceived by the MEC.  At the time it was MEC 
Zwane.  Is this correct? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And one of the projects within 
Mohuma Mobung was the Vrede Dairy Project? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Along with a range of others, 
piggery, hatcheries, a range of other projects? 
10 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   There was no budget from your 
perspective as a finance person, no budget for the Vrede 
Dairy Project as a project in the 2011/2012 financial year?  
You probably budgeted for it from 2012 onwards and correct 
me if I am wrong. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson in 2011/2012, we did not 
have any budget for Vrede Dairy. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Yes.  Now, Vrede Dairy went all... I 
beg your pardon.  The budgetary period would have been 
20 
from April 2011 to March 2012? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Can you repeat that Chair? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   The period, the financial year. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   April to March, every year.  April to 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 75 of 270 
 
March.   
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson our financial year runs 
from April to March. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So come March 2012, you had no 
specific budget for the dairy project? 
CHAIRPERSON:   End of the 2011/2012 financial year, in 
other words.  By the end of the 20911/2012 financial year, 
you were using the budget that you had prepared much 
earlier which did not include the Vrede Dairy Project. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, for the year 2011/2012 that March 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DHLAMINI:   ...we did not have a budget for Vrede Dairy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV 
GCABASHE 
SC:   Thank 
you. 
 
That 
is 
what 
I 
understand Chair. 
MS DHLAMINI:   But in the meantime, in that period, MEC 
Zwane went out to Vrede to speak to the people of Vrede, 
Thembalihle Township about this project.  You know about 
that? 
20 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   In... in the year 2011/2012? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Correct, Ma’am. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Chair, I was not aware.  I am not 
aware that he was talking to people about it in that particular 
year. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 76 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   I say this because Mr Thabethe’s 
evidence was that certainly by June 2012 when the first 
agreement was signed, he had already accompanied MEC 
Zwane 
to 
Vrede 
to 
speak 
to 
beneficiaries, 
to 
invite 
beneficiaries to the project.   
 
So I know that definitely by June, on Mr Thabethe’s 
evidence, some work had been done in just at least talking 
to people about this project.  You were not part of any of 
those discussions? 
10 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, I was not part of those 
discussions. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   What we also know and disputed, if 
you have facts on which you can dispute this, is that when 
Mr Thabethe arrived in August of 2011, he is the one who did 
the desktop study on an integrated dairy project.  Would you 
know about this? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I would not have known Chairperson for the 
simple reason that he would not report to me on the work the 
does.  He rather report to the MEC on the work that he does.  
20 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   No problem.  Do not forget, the 
context here is, this was a top-down initiation of project, not 
a bottom-up initiation of a project.  This is why I am giving 
you a perspective and these are facts that are on record. 
 
Mr Thabethe also gave evidence that in March he went 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 77 of 270 
 
to Indian to go and speak with Paras because he thought 
they would make a good strategic partner. 
 
So already in February/March, he was travelling to India 
to go and speak to Paras.  Did you know about that trip? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I was aware of that trip of the HOD to India. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Are you also aware that he did not 
take a single official from the district services with him on 
that trip? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I am aware Chairperson that he went alone. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   You did not go alone.  He went with 
10 
Mr Narayana.   
MS DHLAMINI:   Okay Chairperson, I wanted to say from the 
department.  When I say alone, I meant to say from the 
department ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ja, he was the only one from the 
department. 
MS DHLAMINI:   He was the only one from the department. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And the motivation you gave to the 
premier in a submission/memorandum that was given to the 
20 
Premier, I think it is dated the 28t h of February 2012, was 
that there were three dairy projects that he was looking into, 
Qwaqwa, Lesotho and Vrede. 
 
And there was R 17 million budget that was available to 
deal with feasibility studies, et cetera to kick-start these 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 78 of 270 
 
dairy projects.   
 
I am simple summarising what he said to the premier 
which enabled the premier to sign off on him going to Indian 
to go and explore the dairy farm option with Paras.   
 
I do not know if you are aware of that particular 
memorandum and the quantum or the amount of R 17 million 
that he mentioned or that the MEC mentioned in that 
particular memorandum? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, I was not... I am not aware of 
the memorandum that went to the premier.  And also, as the 
10 
CFO, I was not aware of the R 17 million.   
 
Maybe it would help me if I can be given the details to 
say, was he saying the R 17 million was in the 2011/2012 
financial year or the R 17 million was in the 2012/2013 
financial year?   
 
That would help me if... then I would know if we had that 
budget or not if I had the specific of which financial year is, 
he referring to. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   We will come back to that because 
you are going to take us through the various allocations from 
20 
your supplementary affidavit.  You have annexed various 
financial documents.   
 
For current purposes, the proposition is simple this that 
what was told the premier was there is money that we want 
to spend on dairy farming, dairy projects.   
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 79 of 270 
 
 
At that time, they had free mind and this was part of the 
motivation for him to go to India to go and explore the 
possibility of this dairy project.   
 
That is really the essence of what I am putting to you.  
Are you happy with that? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I hear you Chairperson.  I am not aware of 
the R 17 million. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   That is fine.  The other important 
element is that in his affidavit to this Commission, Mr Zwane 
confirmed that he suggested that Mr Narayana accompany 
10 
Mr Thabethe because of the local cultural issues that might 
arise in India.   
 
Again, the only issue I bring to your attention is, nobody 
from District Services was involved in going to look for a 
strategic partner for the Vrede Dairy Project. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chair I am aware of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you have expected that Mr 
Thabethe would have taken with him some or other official or 
officials from the department when he went on such a trip?  
Would that be in your expectation that he would bring one or 
20 
more official s with him? 
MS DHLAMINI:   To be honest Chairperson I would not... I 
did not know at what point do they this... a decision is taken 
to say, there is a trip that goes overseas and these are the 
officials that have been... that are being taken.   
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 80 of 270 
 
 
I was not aware of the criteria because sometimes the 
limit of the number of people who undertook outside of the... 
we call it outside of the country trip, will also be... if... will 
also be determined if we have the budget we can carry... we 
can carry all those people.  So I would not have known the 
criteria that is used. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay alright. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you.  Then my question I 
suppose is, seeing the MEC, MEC Zwane was so involved in 
initiating and promoting this project, my question to you is, is 
10 
it usual for a MEC to get this engaged in promoting a 
particular project?  Because it is associated with him.  His 
home was Vrede.  He went to look for beneficiaries, et 
cetera, et cetera. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, the MEC would promote all 
the projects that they approved, that are part of our budget.  
As to this change at which you would to do that, I guess it is 
up to him but all the projects he would own them up, all of 
them. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Maybe I should pose the question 
20 
differently.  It is in the initiation.  Is it usual for an MEC to 
initiate and then champion a project in the same manner in 
which the Vrede Dairy Project was initiated by MEC Zwane 
and championed by him? 
MS DHLAMINI:   No, not as far as I know. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 81 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And maybe a follow-up question would be.  
During the time that Mr Zwane was MEC of Agriculture and 
you were the CFO of that department, is there any other 
project that was... that he initiated in the same way as he 
initiated this one?   
 
In other words, as Ms Gcabashe says, a top-down 
approach where the initiation comes from the MEC and he 
then appears, as opposed to a project that comes from the 
officials, management and his approval is sought if that is 
necessary. 
10 
MS DHLAMINI:   Maybe Chairperson, to give context to this 
from where I am sitting, I would say initiating dairy as a 
project, I cannot confirm to say it was initiated by MEC 
Zwane, the project Vrede Dairy under Mohuma-Mobung. 
 
But Mohuma-Mobung as a strategy and within the 
framework within the department was initiated by MEC 
Zwane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Exco, the specifics of the project, that 
followed within that Mohuma-Mobung Concept.  Who initiated 
20 
it, I cannot really say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DHLAMINI:   But when Advocate Leah was talking about 
top-down and to an extent and then I agree.  It is when he 
was saying Mr Thabethe is the one who started to do a 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 82 of 270 
 
desktop. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DHLAMINI:   And advocate saying, if I heard him, I heard 
her correctly, is saying, Mr Thabethe said that in his 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Then I would take it that, yes he started 
that project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay maybe ...[intervenes] 
MS DHLAMINI:   The Vrede Dairy project. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay maybe I misunderstood Ms 
Gcabashe.  I thought she was talking about what was 
initiated by the MEC Zwane but maybe accept Vrede Dairy 
Project whether she may have been talking about the 
strategy.  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   No, Chairman you did not understand 
me.  The Mohuma-Mobung Concept was indeed conceived by 
MEC Zwane.  I think we have made common cause on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And then we moved on from that to 
20 
say the Vrede Dairy Project, judging by the conduct – I am 
now explaining my question – judging by the conduct of the 
MEC, 
it 
was 
championed, 
this 
specific 
project 
was 
championed by him.   
 
He went out to Vrede.  We have that testimony on 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 83 of 270 
 
record.  To go and look for beneficiaries, to talk to 
beneficiaries, et cetera, et cetera.   
 
If we even take the instruction, he gave you, he involved 
himself personally in making sure that this project moved 
forward if I can use that word very broad Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS DHLAMINI:   In that context, I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You... and you accept? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I accept. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
10 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   In fact... because this is such a 
central issue.  I think we can agree that would normally 
happen and I am not saying always happen but normally 
happen. 
 
Is if District Services, which is in charge of farmer 
support, would bring a project and it would be cascaded up 
until it eventually gets to the HOD.  That is what normally 
happens.  Is that not correct? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Yes.  In this instance, Dr Takisi 
20 
Masiteng who was the Chief Director at the time at District 
Services, says in his transcript.  I will not go to it.  We do 
not need to go the transcript each time, Chairman but the 
reference is there if we need to check on the validity of the 
proposition. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 84 of 270 
 
 
He says that he did not know about Mr Thabethe going 
to India.  He had nothing to do with the appointment of 
Estina as an implementing agent for the Vrede Dairy Project. 
 
And the first time he really got involved with this project 
was when he had returned from China and was asked to 
prepare, what we have come to call the second deviation 
submission.  Would you agree with that? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, number one, I would not know 
why Dr Masiteng would say he did not know that HOD went 
to Indian but what I expect him to know is HOD was not 
10 
around in the department because...  
 
I just cannot remember when he came because once he 
is not there, somebody is appointed to act as an HOD.   
 
So.  And I cannot remember who was appointed to act as 
an HOD at that particular point in time, so we would know 
that HOD is not there.  Maybe yes, he is right, he did not 
know the specifics of the trip that HOD undertook.   
 
Secondly, on the issue of whether Dr Masiteng knew 
about this project or not.  I also do not understand why he 
said so because the record will show as at the time when we 
20 
conclude the budget for 2012/2013 financial-year, Vrede 
Dairy was there in the list of projects.   
 
And our policy would show that it says the District 
Services during the plan when the budget is planned, District 
Services will provide the CFO with the list of projects.   
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 85 of 270 
 
 
So part of that list that was provided and ultimately 
approved and became part of our budget for 2012/2013.  
Vrede Dairy was there with only a budget of R 9 million.   
 
So I would not know from which angle did Dr Masiteng 
said he was not aware of the project.  What I am aware is 
that he was no there when Estina / Paras came to make a 
presentation which changed the whole shape of the project.   
 
When you have only R 9 million budget, then it grew up 
to 
570 
budget 
of 
which 
342 
was 
required 
from 
the 
department.   
10 
 
In that presentation, yes he is right, he was not there but 
honestly to say he did not know about Vrede Dairy Project at 
all, I do not know why he said so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So clearly your expectation is that he 
would have known? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Because the list that comes into the budget 
is provided to the CFO when the CFO prepares the budget 
by District Services. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DHLAMINI:   And besides that.  Those projects – 
20 
because they were funded by the conditional funds which is 
...[indistinct] and grant. [00:19:24] and Dr Masiteng was the 
account manager.   
 
He is the one who would go to the national and present 
that.  He is the one who would go to what we call National 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 86 of 270 
 
Assessment of Panel, who would look at those projects that 
we want to fund with the grant and approved them.   
 
So I would have expected him to have said:  I used 
Vrede Dairy at the time when it had only R 9 million because 
it was part of our projects. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Can I make sure that the Chairman 
understands this fact, Ma’am?  And this is what Dr Masiteng 
says.  Just to go to the CASP example.  He went to ask for 
money for the Vrede Dairy Project in January of 2013.   
10 
 
So he does not deny his involvement as of the time of 
the deviation memo going forward because the deviation 
memo is a 2012 document.   
 
What he says he was not part of was the development, 
anything to do with the development of this project up to the 
time that he signed that memo on the 26t h, I think, of May 
2012.   
 
So I just do not want us to confuse issues.  He did go to 
CASP to ask for money for the Vrede Dairy Project in 
January 2013.  That is clear evidence that is on record.  
20 
Both from him and from Ms Mayisa.  We are talking about 
these early stages where this project was being developed. 
 
And with District Services was not involved in trying to 
deal with how this project should develop, should evolve, 
who should be involved, which implementing agent should be 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 87 of 270 
 
appointed, et cetera, et cetera.   
 
That is what we are dealing with.  Those where the 
decisions that were taken is a different level. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Okay, Chairperson.  What I was saying 
Chairperson.  Advocate Leah is talking about Dr Masiteng 
went National in January 2013.  That is when we are dealing 
with the planning and the preparation of the budget for the 
2013/2014 financial-year which will start the 1s t of April.  But 
what I explained is, in that year of ‘12/’13 which is the year 
...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of 2012/2013 financial-year? 
MS DHLAMINI:   2012/2013, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Which is the year, the financial year that in 
January of that financial year, he went and present this.  But, 
however, I am saying, already at the beginning of 2012/2013 
financial year Vrede Dairy was part of the project.   
 
Maybe he did not know but I am saying the list that is to 
be provided to the CFO.  When the CFO implement and 
prepare the budget, it comes from National.   
20 
 
Maybe he could explain how the Vrede Dairy Project for 
that particular year with a budget of R 9 million found itself 
in the budget, in the list of the projects. 
 
Because the 2013 presentation that he went and asked 
for is after Vrede Dairy has already been up scaled to be 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 88 of 270 
 
another project.  That is when he presented the project and 
he got R 53 million.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So ...[intervenes]  
MS DHLAMINI:   And that R 53 million would be implemented 
or take and used in the financial year 2013/2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So are you saying from early in 2012 or 
rather for the best part of 2012 calendar year which falls 
within the 2012/2013 financial-year for that period there is a 
lot of activity that happened with regard to the Vrede Dairy 
Project. 
10 
 
And you are saying that part of what happened were 
preparations 
that 
would 
inform 
the 
budgeting 
for 
the 
2013/2014 financial-year. 
 
And you are saying that some of the information that 
would come to you ultimately as the CFO for budgeting 
purposes would have been prepared by his unit or his 
section and that would have included references to this 
project. 
 
And you are surprised how that information it could have 
found its way to you without him knowing about this project.  
20 
Is that what you are saying? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is exactly what I am saying, 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Hence I was trying to explain Chairperson 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 89 of 270 
 
to say, probably what Dr Masiteng did not... was not part of, 
which I agree he was not there ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   At the presentation. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Is when the presentation was done.  And 
that presentation is the one that necessitated this project to 
ultimately to be up scaled as another project but as a small 
project.   
 
Maybe let me use that word even if it is not the correct 
word.  As a small project with only R 9 million budget.  It was 
in the budget.  It was appropriated.   
10 
 
And it went through District Services.  It was under the 
budget of District Services.  So hence I am saying, I do not 
know 
why 
he 
would 
say 
he 
was 
not 
aware 
of 
the...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Of the project. 
MS DHLAMINI:   ...of it.  But I would accept if he said... I am 
not saying I am not accepting what he said but I would rather 
say I can say yes if you are saying when it became a mega 
project, I was not there.  There I am saying he was not there.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.  Okay.  Ms Gcabashe. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   I will simply give you a quick 
example of the first deviation you know that somebody else 
find because he was acting.  Masiteng was not part of that.  
He did not know about that.   
 
So that is a quick example of an instance where a 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 90 of 270 
 
document came from his unit that he knew nothing about.  I 
really just to give you that context.  That is the first example.   
 
The second being.  This is why I wanted us to be clear.  
Your financial year start in April.  We will be dealing in a few 
minutes with that first document that came from Estina which 
was an April 2012 document.   
 
So the documentation that was being prepared around 
the Vrede Dairy Project was documentation that was sitting 
at a high level.  It was not sitting at the District Services 
level.   
10 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, yes I... in that regard, yes I 
agree because even the presentation was started from the 
HOD.  So the notion that says it was driven from the top, I 
think it is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Last issue on this aspect.  District 
Services is essential to the registration of beneficiaries.  Is 
that not correct? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   I just wanted us to tick that box that 
20 
District Services would be essential to the registration of 
beneficiaries.  Let us talk about implementing agents 
because that is a very important topic.   
 
So I am moving away from the top-down bottom-up issue 
to a different issue.  This Commission has heard various, so 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 91 of 270 
 
to speak, to implementing agents.   
 
I really want to be brief because we have quite a bit of 
evidence on this but I think it is fair for you to give us your 
understanding of two things.   
 
One, when did you start using implementing agents?  
First question.  I will break on my question.  So when did you 
start using implementing agents? 
MS DHLAMINI:   We started using implementing agents in 
20... in the financial year 2011/2012. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Right. 
10 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is when we started implementing 
agents.  Because in 2011/2012 financial-year, I said I was 
transferred to Agriculture in 2010 which is the financial-year 
2010/2011 and then we got audited.   
 
And one of the issues which was a burning issue was 
issues of asset management especially those assets that will 
be sitting in the farmers.  So the problem here Chairperson 
was before then the grant were classified as goods and 
services or capital expenditure.   
 
The grant were classified as such and you procure... say 
20 
you procure a tractor for a farmer.  Because you procure it 
under capital expenditure of the department that tractor must 
get into the asset register of the department.   
 
Now you come the time of the audit.  This tractor is 
sitting in the asset register of the department but this tractor 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 92 of 270 
 
is not in the department.  This tractor is somewhere in 
QwaQwa and it has a bar code and it has been working for 
years or for months when as you want to verify the 
completeness of your assets register completeness is you 
can find all the assets that you have listed.  You want to 
check that.  All the assets you have listed in your asset 
register they are all there.  Now you must check that.  Then 
he said oh there is this tractor; I want to see it; I want to 
verify it and then you take the Auditor General to QwaQwa 
and see here is the farm.   
10 
Sometimes you get to that farm they say no it has 
been leased to another farm.  You go to that farm.  
Ultimately you find it.  The problem now is after you have 
found it now that bar code is no longer there because it is a 
small thing.  Now you cannot see it anymore.   
Now as you saying but you cannot convince that this 
is the tractor.  Yes I can see the tractor.  The only thing that 
will convince him is when he sees the bar code.  That the 
bar code in the asset register correlates with the bar code on 
the tractor.  But that bar code is no longer there.  So that is 
20 
where the problems started.   
Then in – in that particular year then the Accounting 
Officer then was Dr Mohae took a decision to say we would 
rather use implementing agent and that in the financial year 
also where we went to Treasury and explained this that I am 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 93 of 270 
 
explaining to the Chairperson around the complexities in 
managing the assets that would be in the asset register of 
the Department that does it somewhere in the farmers.  And 
that is where we started to change the classification of – the 
classification of goods and service of the grant from being 
goods and services to being transfer payments which is 
transfer payments to farmers.  Because if you – the 
conditions of the – the grant are saying they are for the 
farmers it is for summer support so they are not intended for 
the use of the Department.   
10 
They are not intended – even those assets are not 
intended to be the assets of the Department.  They are 
intended rightly so to go to the farmers because the money 
used is supposed to support the farmer to buy cattle, to buy 
fodder, to buy feed, to buy all those things.  So that in 2011 
Chair 2011/2012 financial year where we started to use the 
implementing agents.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Is it correct however that an 
implementing agent has no role in the absence of the 
beneficiary?  Mr Thabethe liked to call them the farmers.  So 
20 
it is the same term – farmer/beneficiary is that correct? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Ja no the implementing agent has no role in 
– in the beneficiaries.  Their goal is only to assist us 
implement those projects like let us say we want to – we 
want to put up a chicken house he will help us to build that.  
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 94 of 270 
 
So basically, they do not really have a role in.  Unless I do 
not understand whether it is in identifying or – or what – 
what does that mean Chairperson? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  No what I wanted to understand from 
you is the only reason you bring in an implementing agent is 
so that they can do something that is going to benefit the 
farmer.  Is that clearer? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Can you repeat that Chair. 
ADV 
GCABASHE 
SC: 
 
The 
reason 
you 
bring 
an 
implementing agent to do work that the department should 
10 
be doing is so that the beneficiary; the farmer can benefit 
from whatever this implementing agent is doing.  Am I right? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Whether we use the implanting agent – 
maybe let me ask – answer it that way. Whether we use the 
implementing agent or not implementing agent Chairperson 
the farmer would still benefit because whatever product that 
you come up with whether you buying cattle with that part 
and it is for a particular farm they will ultimately go to that 
particular farm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think – I think maybe Ms Gcabashe is 
20 
looking for what I am looking for too and maybe you have 
explained it but maybe I just did not hear it or understand it 
properly.  What was the justification or the department to say 
let 
us 
bring 
in 
implement 
– 
an 
implementation 
or 
implementing agent?  What was the justification?  What was 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 95 of 270 
 
the motivation?  I know you told me about the issue of the 
code and the tractor in QwaQwa or whatever but if that is – 
was the justification please repeat it?  If that was just one 
example but the justification was broader just tell me? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Oh I – thank you Chairperson I think now I 
understand that.  What is needed here is the justification.  
The justification – one of the just – or one of the reasons 
was the other problem that we are faced with is the issue 
around – was the issue around fruitless and wasteful 
expenditure.  Was the issue about irregular – irregular 
10 
expenditure? 
 
Because 
I 
remember 
definitely 
at 
that 
particular year when I arrived District [00:06:05] would be 
the one who source your – your – who source the quotations 
when they buy those things.  Sometimes you – will come that 
time that the AG is going to audit some of this – some of this 
either – some of this goods and services would have not 
been delivered would say there is – I remember there was 
one particular project where it was said they bought some 
machines for those beneficiaries to do some salt – it was a 
salt project. They were going to manufacture a salt.  But at 
20 
the end of the day they did not receive those.  So those are 
some of the reasons why a decision was taken to say we 
going to – going forward use the implementing agents and 
they 
would 
then 
be 
held 
accountable 
with 
all 
the 
expenditure.  But the farmers still benefit. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 96 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so what gave rise to the idea of using 
an implementation agent was that there were challenges with 
regard to managing fruitless and wasteful expenditure.  Is 
that right on the part of the department when before they 
came up with this idea of implementation agents? 
MS DHLAMINI:  I am sorry Chair to explain Chair that is 
correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was correct? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now precisely what was the problem?  Why 
10 
was it difficult to manage and control and prevent fruitless 
and wasteful expenditure before you had implementation 
agents?  Why was it a problem – a difficulty? 
MS DHLAMINI:  The problem Chairperson was these projects 
are implemented at different – we are five districts in the 
province.  They were implemented all over in all those 
districts and you find that one district have a lot of projects 
and the – the officials sitting in those districts would be the 
ones who would implement – would be the one who would 
source – would be the one who sourced quotations as and 
20 
when they procure.   
So 
it 
was 
really 
a 
very 
cumbersome 
process.  
Because now you start to lose track of this – this 
expenditures of the processes if the processes was really 
properly followed.  And at that time when AG comes then he 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 97 of 270 
 
picks up all these things to say but in this case these people 
have received – they did not receive three quotations or – 
there 
might 
be 
– 
there 
was 
a 
whole 
lot 
of 
issues 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the position that officials of the 
department in different parts of the province were not able to 
ensure that either there was no fruitless and wasteful 
expenditure or that if there was fruitless and wasteful 
expenditure it remained within acceptable levels?  Is that 
what the problem was? 
10 
MS DHLAMINI:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DHLAMINI:  And the other problem was in this instances 
the very same officials they procure they even receive the 
goods and services before they go to the farmer.  It is them 
who signs the receipts to say these goods and services 
being cattle or whatever have been delivered. So basically, 
what happens is they start a process and finish the process.  
So there was an issue around what we call segregation of – 
segregation of duties. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  But would those officials have 
received proper training for managing fruitless and wasteful 
expenditure?  Or was the problem that they were not 
properly trained to deal with – or to manage fruitless and 
wasteful expenditure? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 98 of 270 
 
MS DHLAMINI:  Chairperson I cannot say why it cannot – it 
was not properly managed.  And I also cannot say they were 
not properly trained because let us take for instance the 
issue of fruitless and wasteful expenditure.  It is a simple 
thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DHLAMINI:  When they – when I buy ten pants and the 
service provider brings ten pants. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DHLAMINI:  And I signed off to say – or brings an 
10 
invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DHLAMINI:  That says I have delivered ten pants I 
should have ensured that ten pants were delivered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Not that at the time when AG comes AG 
says ja but you – you paid for ten pants, you signed for the 
invoice but your ten pants are not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DHLAMINI:  It is a simple thing. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Or you would expect anybody to know about 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DHLAMINI:  And to be able to manage it. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 99 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  You see I am concerned about the 
justification 
or 
motivation 
for 
using 
implementing 
– 
implementing or implementation agents simply because as I 
understand it the implementation agents would charge for 
their – for their services, would they not? 
MS DHLAMINI:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And therefore, if you use your own officials 
then you do not pay for extra services.  You use the money 
that 
otherwise 
you 
are 
now 
going 
to 
use 
to 
pay 
implementation agents you use it for other projects.  So – 
10 
but – but you accept what do you say you do not know why 
the officials were not – were failing to manage fruitless and 
wasteful expenditure properly and you cannot say they were 
not trained to deal with that.  And you say actually it is a 
simple thing it is just making sure that if you buy X number 
of items make sure that you receive X number and you keep 
proper records of that and you make sure the items are 
there.  Is that right? 
MS DHLAMINI:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – but the – the benefit that the 
20 
department saw in using implementation agents to overcome 
fruitless and wasteful expenditure that the officials could not 
manage.  What was the benefit?  How – how was that going 
to be controlled better if you do it this way? 
MS DHLAMINI:  I think the benefit Chairperson yes we then 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 100 of 270 
 
did not have fruitless expenditure, we did not have irregular 
expenditure.  We also have the quality also of – of the 
products that we getting especially with regard to the 
infrastructure was better than what we were getting when we 
were using our own – our own officials.  Because even if our 
own officials the issue was probably – because you still use 
– you still use contractors.  You still appoint somebody to 
come and do – and do the work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The [00:13:45] gets them moved. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Yes I think the issue also goes to monitoring 
10 
that with our own officials also monitoring was not really – 
was not really good.  But with the comings in of the 
implementing agent monitoring became better.  They would 
still have – it did not do away hundred percent with the 
challenges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DHLAMINI:  But we could get a better – better products. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what do you say to somebody who says 
therefore this idea of implementation agents was brought up 
because management – the management of the department 
20 
failed to do their job namely ensure that the officials in the 
various parts of the province did their job themselves in 
terms of making sure that fruitless and wasteful expenditure 
was managed properly.  What do you say to that criticism? 
MS 
DHLAMINI: 
 
I 
would 
agree 
with 
that 
criticism 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 101 of 270 
 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Because that is the criticism you will also 
find in the – in the auditing – in our audit reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes okay. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Thank you – thank you Chairman.  A 
couple of issues arising from the questions the Chairman has 
asked you and the one is the conclusion that one easily 
comes to on the explanation that you have given is that 
using 
implementing 
agents 
allowed 
the 
department 
to 
10 
abdicate its responsibility to keep an eye on the  
1. How government monies were being spent. 
2. What assets government actually had at the end of the 
day? 
3. Whether it was getting value for money from the 
projects that the implementing agents were taking care 
of. 
What is your comment? 
MS DHLAMINI:  My comment Chair would say no the 
department did not adjudicate its – its responsibility.  Hence 
20 
I said challenges were – challenges are there and they are 
still there.  But monitoring was happening though not at the 
speed at which it was supposed to.  So to say the 
department we are abdicate if the correct wording with its 
responsibility I would say – I would say not really.  Not 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 102 of 270 
 
really. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Okay we move on to one or two 
issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh before – before you do that Ms 
Gcabashe I want to follow up on your question.  But once 
there was an implementation agent or implementing agent I 
keep on forgetting what you call them. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  They call them implementing agents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Implementing agents. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Yes Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Once you had an implementing agent you 
as the officials; the management of the department you were 
monitoring the implementing agent and not the officials of 
the department in the various parts of the country you were 
expecting the implementing agent to be the one that would 
do your job as management of – of monitoring those 
officials, is that not so? 
MS DHLAMINI:  No the implementing agents Chair would 
implement the projects and officials in the department will 
monitor the work of the implementing agent.  They will get 
20 
reports. They would go and check the projects.  That the 
projects are in accordance with the specifications that were 
given to the implementing agent.  So monitoring as I said 
monitoring was still there.   
Probably what might have improved it is the service 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 103 of 270 
 
providers that the implementing agent would then use in 
implementing those projects. They would have delivered the 
tar product.  Because now – okay let me explain it this way.  
When you use an implementing agent say you want to put up 
a boiler house the implementing agent will appoint a – the 
contractor who will build the – and if – the responsibility of 
that implementing agent to make sure that the boiler house 
is built in terms of the specifications, your quality and 
everything and the work of the department is to get the 
reports, monitor the implementing agent, get the reports from 
10 
the implementing agents and if they are not happy interact 
with the implementing agents with those reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is part of what I do not understand.  
You see where is my legal background?  If you put me in an 
IT sector where I have no knowledge of anything but maybe I 
am the Chairperson of the Board or whatever I might say we 
need or I need somebody with the IT expertise and 
experience who will monitor these people who are – or this 
company that is providing IT services to my company 
because without the expertise I would not know when they 
20 
do something wrong. I would not know when they – their 
work is below the acceptable standard so I need somebody 
who knows what is to be expected from an IT company that 
is doing A, B, C, D.  Okay. And they must advise me.  Now 
with you you are the Department of Agriculture.  The person 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 104 of 270 
 
– the people who are in the management of the department a 
lot 
of 
them 
are 
supposed 
to 
be 
people 
who 
are 
knowledgeable on agriculture.  Okay.  Now you are supposed 
to implement and monitor the projects that you do.  They fall 
within your sector.  Okay.  Now I am talking about 
management not about you in particular.  Okay.  Because 
you might not have the agricultural expertise.  You have the 
financial expertise but the HOD has got the agricultural 
expertise and so on.  Now this is a job that you can do as 
management or this is the job you are supposed to be able 
10 
to do and to monitor and implement but you go and look for 
somebody else to come and do essentially your job as 
management of the department. Why?  And you are going to 
pay more money but you are being paid to do exactly that job 
as management; why are you doing that? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Chair I hear what you are saying and I 
accept what you are saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chair if we might just go 
on just a little longer if you do not mind; just into a little bit 
20 
of the lunch hour?  If that is in order? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay what is your suggestion? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Can I have another ten minutes? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Thank you. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 105 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Because I just want to finish this 
implementing agents section. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  If you do not mind? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright okay. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Thank you.  Ma’am you see the 
difficulty as the Chairman points out but just in terms of what 
I have heard of the other testimonies of witnesses is this.  
You – you abdicate your authority because what the 
10 
implementing agent then does is appoint the sub-contractors 
that they prefer to appoint.  It does not mean that those sub-
contractors 
are 
going 
to 
be 
compliant 
with 
our 
BEE 
legislation our preferential policy framework, documentation 
etcetera.  You as the Department say we are not the 
implementing agent it is the implementing agent who has 
sub-contracted.  And that is why I say you abdicate the 
responsibility conferred on you in legislation to make sure 
that certain transformative steps take place even within the 
agricultural industry. 
20 
MS DHLAMINI:  Chairperson I hear that and I accept that. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  I will give you a very quick example 
on the Estina Project because we will not go into too much 
detail we have done that already. Very many of the people 
that were brought to work in this country came from India.  
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 106 of 270 
 
Whether it was from Mr Prasad or Mr Yathabo [?] the 
consultants who prepared that – there is a R5 million 
feasibility study we have heard about that was prepared by 
people who are not South African.  So a lot of the money we 
may find time later on to go through this – a lot of the money 
that you were paying to Estina actually went to consultants 
who were coming from everywhere else but South Africa.  
You accept that?  I am talking about Estina and the Vrede 
Dairy Project. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Chairperson because I did not see who was 
10 
implementation and monitoring of that project was not my 
responsibility and I did not have the – I did not see those but 
I take it that Advocate has checked and I – I accepted it. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  In fact those facts are in the accounts 
that you would have looked at – the quarterly and monthly 
accounts and some of the invoices that would have been 
presented to you I presume so that you could authorise 
certain payments.  But you are correct this is fact that we 
have on record.  Can I ask you this related question?  What 
is the difference between an implementing agent and the 
20 
managing agent and I ask because Estina was appointed as 
an implementing agent and the managing agent? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Chairperson I clearly cannot – cannot 
answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 107 of 270 
 
MS DHLAMINI:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  But you will agree there is a 
distinction between the two? 
MS DHLAMINI:  I think there should be but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  She might not know. 
MS DHLAMINI:  I do not really have the – I do not really 
have the definitions of the two unless the definitions of the 
two just to be put before me. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Again, it comes back to what you 
were paying people to do. And when I say you, I mean the 
10 
department.  What the department was paying people to do.  
So Estina is one example where they were appointed both as 
an implementing agent and a managing agent.  The FDC 
Free State Development Corporation is another example.  
They went – they were appointed – they were charging a ten 
percent management fee for the work they were doing.  At 
the same time, they were getting capital amounts to 
implement the Vrede Dairy Project.  You understand what I 
am saying? 
MS DHLAMINI:  I understand Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:  So for instance, so for the FDC the 
management fee would be ten percent.  I am not sure 
whether you can quantify even if you look at the document 
Estina submitted how much was paid to them for managing 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 108 of 270 
 
the project. It may be something you want to look at when we 
look at the – at the quarterly reports that you – your 
appendage to your supplementary affidavit. 
MS DHLAMINI:  What did? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  The reason this becomes such an 
important issue and it is something the Chairman has 
traversed with other witnesses it is because of the manner in 
which you then paid implementing agents.  You paid them by 
way of transfers.  Transfer payments rather than paying them 
in terms of any of the other lines of expenditure.  I am 
10 
correct you paid by way of transfer payments. 
MS DHLAMINI:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  And the transfer payment is a 
payment you take the payment you pay it directly to the 
implementing agent because it is a – most of those transfer 
payments came from conditional grants. 
MS DHLAMINI:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  And the difficulty we have had at this 
commission is in how you monitored where that money was 
going to.  What that money was doing for you?  That is 
20 
where the nub of the problem is. Because you transfer, you 
have not gone through a competitive bid.  What are they – is 
the money being used for?  It is in [00:27:09] purpose as the 
PFMA puts it.  There our difficult lies.   
MS 
DHLAMINI: 
 
I 
will 
explain 
to 
you 
Chairperson.  
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 109 of 270 
 
Chairperson when the implementing agent is appointed, the 
contract signed part of that contract – they are given 
projects to say you are given these ten projects to 
implement.  Right. Now the department monitoring and 
implementation unit they will have to ensure that the money 
that was transferred was spent on those ten projects that 
were given to these particular implementing agents. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  You see Ms Dhlamini the difficulty 
with your explanation is it is very general.  You know that 
with Estina and were paid before they rendered any services.  
10 
Fact. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Fact Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  And I am not just talking about the 
first R30 million that was supposed to deal with those first 
preliminary studies.  I am talking about even the second 
amount which came to a total sum of R84 million.  Even that 
money they were paid and you do not have a proper 
accounting of where that money was spent. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Okay Chairperson let me explain this.  
Because if the transfer payment – let us start with the first – 
20 
let us use this Estina or Vrede Dairy.  You pay the first R30 
million that R30 million the first R30 million they were – they 
were deliverables attached to it to say Estina when you get 
this money these are the following things that you must do 
which was phase 1 of the project which it was attached as 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 110 of 270 
 
Annexure to the contract.  And the nature of transfer 
payments you transfer the money; it gets used and then it 
gets to be accounted after that.  That is how a transfer – 
transfer payments works. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  In fact, because you deal with those 
monthly and quarterly accounts in your supplementary 
affidavit, I want us to unpack what you are saying when we 
get there.  We will do that immediately after lunch. And I will 
tell you what the context will be just for you to reflect on.  Mr 
Thabethe of course as the HOD was – he was asked also – 
10 
the questions around this.  He took us to the agreement and 
to annexure A of the agreement which set out the milestones.  
He 
signed 
off 
on 
those 
having 
been 
achieved 
in 
circumstances where we established at this commission 
that most of them had not been achieved, so you are giving 
people money for what they say they have done when in 
fact had anybody gone to check and I would again say I 
would like to think the CFO does not sign off on anything 
until she has checked that these services have been 
rendered.   
20 
 
So the difficult is with nobody monitoring exactly 
where this money was going and what its intended purpose 
was public funds were being spent in a manner that you 
had not anticipated.  Turn to Chairperson. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Chairperson I hear what Advocate is 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 111 of 270 
 
saying, firstly Advocate is telling me that the HOD himself 
signed and say this much has been achieved.  As the CFO 
I think I have already explained at the beginning to say I 
am literally having two caps, I run the unit, that is financial 
management, I have my budget that I manage, and I have 
this other advisory role to the accounting office, so each 
and every manager, or ...[indistinct] manager have the 
budget, the person who is supposed to sign on that budget 
is the owner of the budget, in this case I would not have 
known why those milestones were signed off by the HOD, 
10 
because I would have expected those milestones to have 
been signed off by the District Services in particular the 
District Director, so I would not know why he signed for it, 
and any other service or any other invoice or any other 
report that would come of any other expenditure that would 
happen under Vrede Dairy would have been signed off by 
the District Services because that is the program that 
manages that expenditure, every CFO I manage my own 
budget, my own little budget which mainly I use it for 
stationary, travelling of my officials, so that is how it works 
20 
and even the council policy is very specific in those areas 
to say who is supposed to do what, otherwise if the CFO 
starts to do that then you’re starting to manage other 
people’s budgets and they may not be held accountable in 
terms of Section 45 of the PFMA. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 112 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in principle if when a certain 
document is brought to you and it has got the HOD’s 
signature but you know that it is supposed to also have 
other signatures, isn’t the position that you will say but 
where – why is so and so’s signature not here, would that 
be what you would ask to say, this document is supposed 
to have been signed by three people, now it has got one 
signature, so in principle you would want to enquire would 
you not? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson I did not enquire because 
10 
overall accounting officer the budget belongs to the 
accounting office overall, so even if I have my own little 
budget if he feels that Madam CFO I want to take say one 
million from your budget and I am going to use it he can do 
that, because it is his budget, he has just given me that 
but at the end of the day that budget belongs to him as an 
accounting officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Chairman I think when we come 
back, we will then look at those, first we are going to look 
20 
at the agreement and the milestones and what Mr Thabethe 
signed off on, that is one area we are going to look at.  
The second area we are going to look at is the monthly and 
quarterly reports which you have annexed, which we had in 
any event in our bundle and the payments that were made 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 113 of 270 
 
to Estina in terms of those reports, that comes to that 
monitoring function and your approval of the payments, 
that’s the second issue. 
 
The third issue we are going to deal with will be the 
R30million, 
the 
first 
R30million 
that 
you 
asked 
the 
Provincial Treasury to pay in on the 15 t h of June and the 
basis on which you asked for that.  Those are three 
important areas that I think we will cover after lunch, that 
are important to the role that you discharged the CFO.   
 
Chairman maybe we should then take the lunch 
10 
adjournment and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no that’s fine, just before we do 
that Ms Dhlamini I am going back to a question that you 
and I discussed earlier on.  It seems to me that the 
justification and the motivation for using implementation 
agents certainly in regard to this project was not that the 
department did not have the expertise or people who could 
implement the project.  It seems that it was simply that the 
department or people within the department who were 
supposed to implement the project or projects such as 
20 
these, because of problems that may have arisen before, 
no longer had confidence that they could do that properly 
and therefore thought they should bring in implementing 
agents to do what actually was a job for which they were 
being paid. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 114 of 270 
 
 
Is that a fair proposition? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson that fair proposition – that 
proposition is fair with regard to other projects, probably 
Vrede Dairy also but with regard to Vrede Dairy there were 
other elements Chairperson, you might be aware from 
documents that one of the things it was said is Vrede Dairy 
is also going to invest in that project, they are going to be 
an investor in that project whereby the department is going 
to put up a dairy parlour, which is where you will milk and 
they would put up a processing plant which is where you 
10 
would do your butter, your cheese and all those things, so 
it was likely not the same as others, so I think that’s where 
the complication came with regard to Vrede Dairy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in so far as Estina’s role was the 
implementation of the project that was something that 
could have been done by the officials even if PARAS/Estina 
was going to invest in the project, is that right?  
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, and – yes Chairperson, however also 
the magnitude of the project I think necessitated the skills 
that really highly qualified officials or people who have 
20 
managed that, and looking at the – looking at the 
background that were given around PARAS especially to 
say it is the largest dairy in India, you stated that the skill 
that they are having is far above the skills that our officials 
are having and also with regard to the processing plant 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 115 of 270 
 
that 
they 
were 
going 
to 
put 
up, 
but 
I 
am 
mindful 
Chairperson that yes our officials could still have done it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But when you give the answer that you 
have given me and you say the skills required for the 
recommendation of this project were higher or much higher 
than the skills that officials of the department had are you 
saying that on the basis of a clear knowledge of skills the 
department’s officials, relevant officials had or are you just 
saying that when you look at the project and you think we 
didn’t have officials who had these required skills.   
10 
 
In other words, are you saying that having applied 
your mind to what skills the officials in the department, 
relevant officials had? 
MS 
DHLAMINI: 
 
 
Chairperson 
I 
am 
saying 
this 
in 
comparison to what we are told what is PARAS, how long 
they have been in the business, and ja if I compare that 
skill with what the department was having I presumed that 
they might have better skills than what we had. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes so in other words  your answer is 
when you give me that answer it is not based on you 
20 
having applied your mind to the skills that the relevant 
officials of the department had, you look at what was said 
about PARAS and you say probably they had better skills. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm, okay, alright. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 116 of 270 
 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Chairman if I might just ask Ms 
Dhlamini to reflect on this aspect arising from what you 
said, we traversed this with other witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   We had VKB expert, we have VKB 
expertise in the country and there are other organisations, 
agricultural entities that do the kind of work that PARAS 
was invited to come and do. There is also the issue of 
whether Parlamat, DairyBelle, some of these other dairy 
producers were invited, we have traversed that, and here I 
10 
am just dealing with the skills issue that you raised and the 
Chairman raises in the context of officials but I am raising 
it in the context of using local people as opposed to 
bringing expertise from outside. 
 
So that’s just something to reflect on, we will touch 
on it very shortly and then I would like you also just to 
when you talk about Estina being a big investor I will be 
showing you a document that says just before the first 
30million was paid into their account they had R16 in their 
bank, R16 and some cents in their bank.  This all goes 
20 
back to what you were supposed to interrogate at every 
level of this project as the CFO, not as the HOD, as the 
CFO, and these are the kinds of examples that I will be 
placing before you after lunch. 
 
Chair I just wanted to get that context. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 117 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes thank you, we are going to take the 
lunch adjournment, the time is twenty past one, we will 
resume at twenty past two. 
 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue.  But before we 
continue.  Let us talk about some practicalities.  I do not 
know what your own assessment is Ms Gcabashe, whether 
10 
we will finish it by four or not, but I want to talk about a 
situation where four o’clock we are not done.  I just want to 
indicate that from my side I would be available to sit beyond 
four o’clock and want to check whether everybody is fine 
with that. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Chairman, all of us including Ms 
Dhlamini’s legal team will be available. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Ms Dhlamini, you are able, are you 
not? 
20 
MS DHLAMINI:   I am available, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you, Chairman.  Chairman, I 
thought that - because this is an important part of Ms 
Dhlamini’s evidence - we should go to her Exhibit HH16.1.

Ms Dhlamini, page 15.  And talk about your role in verifying 
the payments for the Vrede Dairy Project. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Which page, Chair? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   One... I beg your pardon.  It is page 
53.  The black numbers.  You are correct to ask.  Page 53 of 
the black numbers, Estina 01.   
MS DHLAMINI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Estina 01. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Estina Bundle 01? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   01. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Page 53. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And page one five? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   No, sir.  It is 53. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Five three? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Five three. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Now just as a quick bit of 
background to this section.  I had a range of questions but I 
actually do not think it is necessary to go through all of 
20 
them, Ms Dhlamini.  You confirm that you attended a 
presentation by Estina on the project? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chair I confirm. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So you learnt all about that project at 
that presentation? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 119 of 270 
 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Had you heard about it before that 
about Estina’s involvement?  Let me be specific, before that. 
MS DHLAMINI:   No, Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Good.  What was the expectation?  
What were you supposed to do with the information you were 
given on that day? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, on that particular day nothing 
was expected of me because after the presentation the 
decision was... the economists must go and look at that 
10 
presentation 
which 
I 
presume 
would 
have 
had 
their 
problems.  So it was referred to the economists to have a 
look at it. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Were any particular documents given 
to you on that day? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, I really cannot remember.  
What I remember, the presentation was a PowerPoint 
presentation. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Were you expected to interrogate the 
two gentlemen who were making the presentation at all?  So 
20 
by way of example where they will bring in an investment of 
R 224 million?  Were you expected to engage them on that? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I was not expected Chairperson.  I was just 
invited to the meeting to come and listen to the presentation. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And then, were you also not 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 120 of 270 
 
expected to ask about a feasibility study, a business plan or 
any of those particular milestones at that meeting? 
MS DHLAMINI:   As far as I know, I was not expected. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Last one on this aspect.  This is just 
to give context on how you analysed the submissions on 
invoices.  The last one relates to... they, of course, have a 
memorandum of understanding that they have signed on the 
11t h of April 2012.  It is a memorandum of understanding 
between Estina and Paras.  Do you know about that 
memorandum of understanding? 
10 
MS 
DHLAMINI: 
  I... yes, it 
was mentioned 
in the 
presentation that there is a memorandum of understanding.  
I got to know the actual documents when the submission 
came to me because there was reference to that and in 
ascertaining that, I did ask for that memorandum. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So you took this information and 
simple held onto it after you left that meeting on the 
15t h of Ma 2012? 
MS DHLAMINI:   You say, I took it and...? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   The information and just held onto it 
20 
essentially. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Ja, I listened to the presentation.  I held on 
the information and ja.  Until the submission came.  That is 
when then I looked at it in more details. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   That submission, is that the one on 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 121 of 270 
 
page 59 of your bundle, the same bundle, Estina 01, page 
59?  Is that the submission you are referring to? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Page...? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Five nine. 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is the submission, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And what exactly were you expected 
to do here, Ma’am? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, as I have already alluded to, 
that every submission in the department that has got a 
financial implication will be send to the CFO.  You will find 
10 
the CFO signature in all the submissions.   
 
As long as there is a financial implication where the 
department would have to spend money, you would find the 
signature of the CFO.   
 
So basically, with regards to this submission, I would 
then... I was expected to confirm the availability of the 
budget.  That is in the main.  To deal with the financial 
implication thereof. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you, when a document or a project 
that has got financial implications or a document that talks 
20 
about something that has got financial implications that gets 
brought to you, when it comes to you, are you expected to 
simple indicate whether there is budget available? 
 
Or are you supposed to go beyond that including, yes 
there may be budget but this is not the way to use money?  
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 122 of 270 
 
You are wasteful.  You will be wasting money if you do it this 
way, for example. 
MS DHLAMINI:   It depends.  Chairperson, it depends on the 
kind of submission what you are expected to do.  Let us take 
for instance a submission where we are appointing officials, 
first appointments.  
 
That submission has got financial implications.  All what 
I am expected to do is to confirm that the budget is there  
That is what my signature is as a recommendation talks to.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  H’m.  But would you, for example... 
10 
so from your answer, it seems that you are saying it depends 
on the document.  Sometimes all you would be required is to 
indicate whether there is a budget and nothing more.   
 
But there may be another situation where the document 
is presented to you, requires you to do more than just to 
simple say, there is budget. 
 
Including saying, although there is budget but you will 
be wasteful if you use this budget for this.  Am I right to 
understand your evidence in that way? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is not really what is required of the 
20 
CFO Chairperson.  Because as I have indicated that Section 
45 of PFMA gives a responsibility to different programme 
managers when they are implementing their budget for them 
to know better what they want to use their budget for. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So are you saying, as CFO it does not fall 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 123 of 270 
 
within your responsibility when a document is presented to 
you that has got financial implications to say, but if you use 
this budget in this way or for this purpose you will actually 
be using taxpayers money not properly or effectively or 
efficiently? 
MS DHLAMINI:   When you put it that way Chairperson, yes.  
One of the things you check as the CFO, is this money the 
way it is being supposed to be used?  Is it according to how 
it is has been appropriated?  Is it according to the intended 
purpose?  You would also look at those things. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you, Chair.  If you then look at 
page 61 where your signature appears. 
MS DHLAMINI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Are you telling the Chairman, this 
Commission, that what you were approving were the financial 
implications of this project?  Or what you are recommending, 
in fact, is a recommendation from you, was what is written 
20 
above your signature?  One: 
1. 
It is recommended that the project is granted 
to accept the proposal from Estina with regard to 
Vrede Dairy Integrated Project. 
 
The first thing you are recommending. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 124 of 270 
 
2. 
You are recommending approval that the 
department enter into a partnership with Estina to 
implement the integrated dairy project in Vrede. 
 
I just want to be clear about what you are recommending 
for approval here. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Chairperson, in 
the main, I focused on the first bullet point where it says:  
“Accept the proposal from Estina with regards to the Vrede 
Dairy Project”.   
 
And the proposal in the main seeks to say they are going 
10 
to... they seek to partner with the department.  They seek to 
invest in the Vrede Dairy but, however, it gave figures to say, 
this is the budget that would be implemented.   
 
So if you accept this proposal it means you are saying 
there is that budget that the three... I think it was 300 and 
not... No, I think it was R 342 million VAT inclusive.  That will 
be required from the department in totality.   
 
But with regard to this particular submission, what was 
required immediately was the R 30 million.  So I looked at 
both the financial implications in totality and for the purpose 
20 
of this particular submission.   
 
And I recorded that Chairperson, at the time when this 
submission or when this proposal was brought to the 
department, Vrede Dairy was budgeted only R 9 million.   
 
So clearly, yes, the R 342 million was not there.  The 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 125 of 270 
 
R 30 million was not there.  So what I did before I signed 
this submission, I went to the HOD.   
 
I discussed with the HOD the financial implications in a 
way that I am advising him of the financial implication of 
this.  And indicating to him that the department does not 
have this... of this project, has not been budgeted to that 
amount of money.  It only has R 9 million.  
 
And the answer I got form the HOD is, he will be 
prioritising the budget in order to accommodate this project 
and I accepted it.   
10 
 
Before I accepted it, what I did, I checked.  If he is 
saying he is going to reprioritise, firstly, I need to check.  
Does the department over the MTEF period, which is a 
period of three years, does it even have that kind of budget?  
If he reprioritise, will it be able to accommodate this project?   
 
And when I checked the budget that was available, I 
realised, yes it is possible if he reprioritise.  It will be able 
to... he will be able to accommodate this project.   
 
And furthermore, with regard to the R 30 million.  I also 
said in this financial year we do not have that R 30 million.  
20 
We only have R 9 million.  And the same answer was to say 
he is going to... there will be a reprioritisation of the budget.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Okay and ...[intervenes]  
MS DHLAMINI:   And to this effect, Chairperson.  In my 
affidavit, I have attached a document that shows that the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 126 of 270 
 
budget was indeed reprioritised and it... then this project 
was able to be accommodated.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Can I raise two issues from your 
answer? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   The first one is.  If you look at bullet 
point A which is... or the first one, which you say is the first 
one which you focused on:  “...accept the proposal from 
Estina with regard to Vrede Dairy Integrated Project.” 
 
Were you not committing the department to providing 
10 
funds that you had not appropriated or that you had not tried 
to provide for as required by Section 38(2) of the PMFA?   
 
Is this what you were discussing with the Head of 
Department, that you were now looking at a three year 
period, you were being asked to provide R 342 million, you 
had not made any provision for that at all?  Why were you 
approving that first bullet point? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Okay, Chairperson, as I have already 
indicated, that I have asked the HOD and the HOD said I 
will reprioritise.  In reprioritising means he will take money 
20 
from either other projects and fund this project.  Now that 
is in the first financial year.  
 
The second and the third financial year, my role 
now is to ensure that this project is budgeted for and we 
are not going to – the department is not going to 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 127 of 270 
 
reprioritise any further and as I said, I looked at the budget 
that was available over the MTEF, if it will be able to 
accommodate the reprioritisation that HOD is talking about 
and I was satisfied that it will be able to accommodate it. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Please take us the document you 
say is in this bundle that shows that that reprioritisation 
was possible.  Is it the one on page 316? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I will tell you now-now, Chairperson.  I 
want to go to the specific budget voted that will be able – 
which will be easy to understand, Chairperson, hence I am 
10 
struggling a bit to get there.  That will be page 143 of my – 
of you call it HH16.1.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   That is the black number you are 
reading, nè? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is the black number I am reading, 
Estina 01143. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Yes, that says annexure S5. 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is the document. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Yes and then over the page? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Oh, let us go to page 147 that says four 
20 
receipts and financing.  4.1, Summary of receipts, the 
following sources of funding are used for the vote.  If you 
go to that particular paragraph, Chair, you would realise 
that that is conditional grants.  There is a line that says 
equitable share. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 128 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Just on the equitable share, the 
department had 360 – okay, you have column one, two, 
three, four, five, six, I want to Chairperson to focus on the 
last three columns of that table. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, under midterm estimates. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Under summary of …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Medium term estimates. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, under medium term estimates. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
10 
MS DHLAMINI:   We are on 2012/2013, that is when the 
project started. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Under the equitable share alone the 
department had 360 for 2012/2013.  ’13/’14 363 million.  I 
am not reading the entire – I am just… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you are rounding off. 
MS DHLAMINI:   I am rounding off and ‘14/’15 the 
department had 358.  Just only on the equitable share but I 
am not going to focus on the equitable share, Chair, I am 
20 
going to focus on the conditional grants. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS 
DHLAMINI: 
 
 
Because 
those 
were 
the 
funds 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The figures here are in millions, hey? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 129 of 270 
 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The figures here are they in millions? 
MS DHLAMINI:   They are in millions.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes …[intervenes] 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Can I ask you just to pause while 
you are at the equitable share, Ma’am, because we are 
then saying that those three sets of figures for 2012/2013, 
2013/2014, 2014/2015 represented the equitable share that 
would 
be 
given 
to 
Agriculture 
for 
all 
projects, 
for 
10 
everything under Agriculture.  Please correct me if I am 
wrong. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, the equitable share, Chairperson, is 
for all – in the main it is for the running of the department.  
Yes, you might have some monies that might go to the 
projects but in the main we would use it for compensation 
of employee and the running costs of the department. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   That is correct, so you really could 
not rely on those amounts for one dairy project and I 
accept that you are comfortable with that proposition 
20 
because you were about to take us to the other sources of 
money.  
 
The point I really make is that it is very important 
for the record to reflect that the amounts you have just 
given to the Chairman represented all the money that the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 130 of 270 
 
department would have had at its disposal to do the work it 
is enjoined to do for those financial years.  That is an 
important point.  Proceed, Ma’am? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I take you accept that proposition? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I accept the proposition but I want to 
clarify further, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright. 
MS DHLAMINI:   By saying in that equitable share you 
would find compensation of employee when you classify it 
down and you will find goods and services.  The portion of 
10 
goods and services, even there HOD could still tap on that 
portion.  The part that he could not touch is the part that 
would have talked to – the part that was talking to 
compensation of employees.  That he could not touch but 
the other …. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Portion. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Portions, he could also tap into that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, oaky. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Can I add the rider in that case that 
what you would also have to be careful about is your own 
20 
SCM policy which, of course, cascades down from the 
Treasury regulations especially 16A, that any procurement 
over 500 000 must go out on a competitive bid.   
 
So if you were looking at this money, knowing full 
well you had not gone out on a competitive bid, not by the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 131 of 270 
 
26 May, anyway - you did not at all but that is further point 
– you had to be aware that as you were discussing the 
issue with the HOD, this money, if you were going to tap 
into it, must be used in compliance with all the legal 
prescripts including the supply chain management policy 
document.  They are real constraints, you cannot just 
spend money, you had to do it in a specific way. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Thank you, Chairperson.  If …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I just want to know, are you 
accepting the proposition, are you not accepting or you are 
10 
accepting with an explanation?  I just want to know so that 
as we move forward, I know what you attitude is to what Ms 
Gcabashe has put to you. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Okay, Chair, I am accepting with a further 
explanation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Let us say for instance HOD decided to 
say from goods and services I am going to take 10 million 
and I am going to take it to Vrede Dairy, that would then 
mean he is changing the classification because Vrede 
20 
Dairy is being appropriated under transfer payment.  Now 
we will be increasing the transfer payment and if you 
increase transfer payment you would then go to Treasury 
for 
approval 
or 
you 
will 
wait 
for 
the 
Adjustment 
Appropriation Act because now it is a new Act, after the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 132 of 270 
 
main Appropriation Act.   
 
So you could still do that but there would be those 
two conditions to be met.  Either you will wait for the 
Adjustment Appropriation Act or he goes to Treasury and 
ask to increase the transfer payment and now when it gets 
into Vrede Dairy now, you would then apply the prescripts 
that applies to transfer payment because it would have now 
been reclassified into transfer payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Continue, Ma’am. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   You were going to go to the next 
source of funding. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The next source of funding, Chairperson, 
was the conditional grants and these conditional grants 
that we have, CASP, Ilima/Letsema, mainly CASP and 
Ilima/Letsema and Land Care.  Those were the grants that 
were meant for farmers, that were for the purpose of 
support to the farmers, that were for the purpose of 
support to the farmers.   
20 
So even in that – and those conditional grants had 
194 million, 206 million and 212 million over a period of 
three years which clearly exceeds on that note alone, 
clearly exceeds the 300 million – 342 million that is 
required. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 133 of 270 
 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Again, can I ask you to reflect on 
this proposition.  Those conditional grants you had to go 
and motivate for, I am correct? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Those conditional grants would tell 
you how much you can actually take and use on a specific 
project.  By way of example, how much you can give to 
Vrede Dairy Project, am I correct? 
MS DHLAMINI:   You are correct, Chair, but let me explain 
it a bit to say they would not say how much you can.  
10 
Rather, I would be comfortable to say how much would 
have been budgeted on those conditional grants for a 
project because there is no specific formula that says if 
you come with Vrede Dairy this is how much you can take.  
That would come from the business plan that would 
have been prepared by our planning section in the 
department to say the department wants to do Vrede Dairy 
and when they do their estimates we have all – they will 
have the information what does it entail in the Vrede Dairy 
and they would then say this is the amount of money that 
20 
would be needed.  So that would that be the amount that 
would have been budgeted for projects and approved. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Can I again just get clarify from 
you because we know as a fact that when Dr Masiteng went 
to CASP to make the presentation for money, the CASP 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 134 of 270 
 
grant that was approved was for 53 point something 
million.  That is a far cry from the 206 that – I beg your 
pardon, from the 140, that is the line item here under 
2013/’14.   
 
The simple proposition is, you may wish for one 
thing but you would get something different. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson, Advocate is right.  
However, we are talking – I thought we are going to start 
with 2012/2013 because ‘13/’14, when you go there, there 
is another Appropriation Act for ‘13/’14 which will then 
10 
show yes, at the point when we were dealing with the 
planning and the budget process from CASP, 53 million 
was approved for this project but the 114 was budgeted, 
then I was going to indicate when I go to the next 
appropriation where the 60 million came from in the that 
particular year. 
 
Chair would remember at the start I said for the first 
year, when the project starts, 2012/2013, that is where the 
reprioritisation happened but for ‘13/’14 and ‘14/’15 the 
budget was there, it was budgeted for fully. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   If we go back to where you wanted 
to be Ms Dhlamini which is 2012/2013 what you have to 
remember is, the document that we’re interrogating is the 
approval document, you signed that on the 26 t h of May 
2012. 
 
You 
are 
already 
in 
the 
new 
financial 
year 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 135 of 270 
 
2012/2013, you are approving a project that says you need 
to find R340million there’s no feasibility study, no business 
plan you have not even signed an agreement yet with 
Estina, are you saying that despite those constraints you 
were comfortable with saying to – in your discussion with 
the HOD, saying to him, I think this is doable irrespective 
of the fact that our base documents that we need are 
nowhere in sight, we just don’t have them? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Thank you Chairperson, to start with you 
would not have signed – the first thing you must accept, if 
10 
the proposal comes, you must first accept the proposal 
before you can sign an agreement, secondly, on the issue 
of the feasibility study, part of the project money, when you 
plan the project, the total funding of that project would 
include costs for your feasibility study and cost for your 
impact assessment EIA, Environmental Impact Assessment.  
So – and there would be other costs that are preliminary 
costs, even before you put – if it’s a structure that you’re 
going to put up, even before you put up that structure, you 
would have incurred those costs, so they form part of the 
20 
costs of the project? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   But ma’am it is also correct that as 
you would be looking at those costs at this stage of the 
proposal stage, because we are currently looking at 
proposal 
through 
to 
what 
you 
thought 
would 
come 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 136 of 270 
 
available, that’s really what we are discussing. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   In the budget, even as you’re 
looking at that proposal there were no – there was no 
detail that you were familiar with, with regard to how much 
the feasibility study would cost, what exactly they would be 
doing, all of the types of detail that, essentially led to that 
agreement of the 5 t h of June 2012 being found to be 
invalid. I don’t really want to focus on that right now; all 
I’m saying is that the same issues would have arisen had 
10 
you discussed this proposal with the State Law Advisors as 
you discussed it with Mr Thabethe. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Thank you Chair.  Chair, you would only 
know about those details after you have commissioned the 
project.  When the project has started, because the first 
thing, when it has started and you have  transferred – you 
have made the first transfer payment, they would use that 
money for feasibility study, they would use that money for 
Environmental Impact Assessment and the like and the 
like.  Hence the final contract that was signed had that 
20 
Annexure A that would say as a first phase of this project 
the following should be done.  So that R30million would be 
used for that and it’s basically an estimate, it does not 
necessarily mean it will – those things will, exactly cost 
that or – they can be ore, they can be less it’s just an 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 137 of 270 
 
estimate that you are saying, as a start of this project this 
is how much I’m transferring so that you can begin with 
your – the feasibility study and all that. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Please continue, Ms Dhlamini, you 
were taking us through the rest of these figures. 
MS DHLAMINI:   And then I was saying, Chairperson, if 
you look at that, because that where I was saying, I looked 
at this budget to check as to – over the period of three 
years does this budget cover, can it cover, if HOD 
prioritises, can it cover the R342million and I was satisfied 
10 
that it can do that, hence I then – after my discussion with 
him, I then signed the submission and I further said, 
Chairperson, now is the first day 2012/2013 that will be the 
prioritisation but going into 2013/2014, 2014/2015 I must 
make sure that we are no longer going to do the 
prioritisation but the budget is there the project is funded 
properly, during the budget process each one must make 
himself clear to say, this is how much I’m going to give for 
Vrede Dairy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Help me with something here.  I would 
20 
have thought that before there is approval that the 
department goes into a partnership with Estina, in regard 
to this project, the feasibility study would have preceded 
that stage so that if the feasibility study revealed that this 
project would not be viable then he would not enter into 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 138 of 270 
 
the partnership – the department would not enter into any 
partnership with Estina and that you would only enter into 
a partnership with Estina after the study had revealed that 
this project would be viable? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Ideally, Chairperson, it would have 
happened that way but like I said at the beginning to say, 
Vrede Dairy was already in the budget, it was already in 
the books with a budget of R9million.  So, I did not have 
the specifics as to what was the intention of the R9million, 
I don’t have those specifics, those specifics would be with 
10 
the Project Managers or the District Directors. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It just seems strange to me that you and 
the HOD approve that the department should enter into a 
partnership 
with 
Estina 
for 
a 
specific 
project 
in 
circumstances where, as I see it, you haven’t done the 
right homework and for me the right homework includes a 
feasibility study to say, will this project be viable, you 
understand where I’m coming from? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I understand where you are coming from 
and I accept that Chairperson but as far as I can know, all 
20 
the projects that were started, part of the first monies that 
would be spent on issues like feasibility study.  I’m not 
thinking of any project where it was in the budget and 
there was the feasibility study before the budget was put 
aside because it’s part of the planning, you plan to say, I’ll 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 139 of 270 
 
put this much and you know that you might – one of the 
things it’s feasibility study that you’d do, Environmental 
Impact Study and all those things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmm, Ms Gcabashe. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you Chairman.  I don’t know 
if there is anything else you want to point out in respect of 
the provision you believed would be available? 
MS DHLAMINI:   No there’s nothing more I want to – that I 
want to point out Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Okay so we’re back to – we were 
10 
just sketching the background factors that you were aware 
of at the time that you then had to start making these 
particular payments.  Let’s go to that because we’ll then 
come back to deal with the very first payment of R30million 
but take me to the payments that you had wanted to 
indicate. I don’t know if that’s the one that starts at  flag 
number 13 which is at page 312, is that where you want us 
to go to? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I’m going to tell you. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Unless you want to look at your 
20 
affidavit ma’am, which is, again page 53 and just go 
through, in summary what you say here, it’s up to you, I 
just want you to explain your role in verifying the 
payments, whether you do it by way of a narrative, which is 
what you’ve got in your paragraph 12 or whether you want 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 140 of 270 
 
to actually indicate on the Annexures you’ve put in here, 
we are in your hands. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chair, I prefer to go to the Annexure, I’ll 
explain it better that way. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And that’s Annexure number? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That’s Annexure S13. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Yes, and S13, Chairman, you will 
find – it starts at page – Estina 01, 312 the actual figures 
start on the following page, 313.  We are in your hands 
ma’am. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson if 
you go to page – lets skip page 313, basically it’s – it’s 
just our records, let’s also skip page 314, because it’s just 
a record.  If you go to page 315, that’s the actual payment 
– it’s written there, sundry payment advice that’s the actual 
payment that needs to be approved when a payment is 
done.  The person would realise from that page that there’s 
no signature – those three signatures, none of them is my 
signature.  You have the first signature, its A C Meyer, the 
20 
second signature, which had been verified, is S M K 
Schalkwyk and the last signature is for Mr Thabethe as the 
HOD who has authorised the payment.  This takes me back 
to two things that I’ve already…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry – oh this is the payment of the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 141 of 270 
 
R30million – no R30 000 what is it? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   R30million Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, this is the payment of R30million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And just for clarity, this is the first 
R30million that you paid in – it eventually was paid in July 
of 2012 even though it was requested in June of 2012? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That’s right, that’s right Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And this is the R30million, if I 
10 
recall correctly, from what you said before lunch, this is the 
R30million that was supposed to cover the preliminary 
exercises, feasibility study etcetera, etcetera, all the ones 
that are on Annexure A of the agreement? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You mentioned that you…[intervenes]. 
MS DHLAMINI:   So, I was saying, Chairperson, this then 
takes me back to two things that I’ve spoken about. 
Section 45 of the PFMA which gives responsibility to other 
officials in the department that would then give – what 
20 
gives effect to that in the budget is, every Programme 
Manager – the budget is divided into programmes, so those 
programmes has got Programme Managers, mainly the 
Programme Mangers would be the Executive Management.  
In this case this budget would have sat under programme, 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 142 of 270 
 
Farmer 
Support 
Development 
which 
the 
Programme 
Manager is Dr Masiteng.  So, on this particular day Dr 
Masiteng was not there, Mr van Schalkwyk was acting so 
hence he signed there as the person who verified and 
checked the payment. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Did you speak with Mr van 
Schalkwyk about why he was approving this payment, 
before you recommended it onto the HOD? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, I didn’t speak to Mr van 
Schalkwyk because this particular payment did not come to 
10 
me and – because the person who compiled this particular 
payment was Ms Alta Meyer who was, I think by then was 
acting District Director Thabo Mofutsanyane and then from 
there it went to the HOD and HOD authorised it.  The only 
time it came to my attention is when it came with the 
certificate that I needed to sign to go to Treasury. Now I’m 
going to talk very technical things.  When you make a 
payment…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry before you do that, I just want 
to ask this question but you must tell me if it’s a question 
20 
that will be explained as you go along, okay.  You 
mentioned that – you make mention of the fact that your 
signature doesn’t appear here in this document, is there a 
particular significance to that, or not really? 
MS DHLAMINI:   The reason why I’m showing that my 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 143 of 270 
 
signature does not appear here, is because – hence I said 
it gives effect to Section 45 of the PFMA where the 
Manager, manages his or her own budget.  So, this is the 
budget of the District Services, they managed the budget 
they don’t really have to ask me how they use their budget. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS DHLAMINI:   So, it was not necessarily a requirement 
that it must come to me and I will explain why others came 
to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
MS DHLAMINI:   The second thing that I wanted to show, 
which is what Advocate Gcabashe talked about at the 
beginning when we were starting – when we were referring 
to, I think the task of Mr Thabethe and Dr Masiteng were 
Dr Thabethe said he was relying on me and at that point I 
made a comment to say, not always because he could sign 
this payment without coming to me.  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Can you then explain, and I know 
I’m jumping issues a little bit but I know you are able to – 
because this is what you did, you can explain it.  Can you 
20 
then explain why it is that you then went to treasury to ask 
for this payment, was it because you were the only person 
who could sign that certificate? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Okay, let me explain that, that the 
Chairperson stopped me at.  When you make a payment in 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 144 of 270 
 
the Department, any payment that is above R1million, it 
must go via Treasury, any payment that is less than a 
million – I think a million and above, it goes to Treasury 
less than a million, that’s what we call, interface.  You 
capture it into our financial system, it automatically 
interfaces 
with 
the 
bank 
and 
the 
bank 
will 
pay 
automatically the intended beneficiary but any payment 
that is a million and above, it will then go to the Provincial 
Treasury.  There’s what we call BCT, it’s Bus Credit 
Transfer, that’s why I was saying, Chairperson, I’m going 
10 
to talk to technical things now that might not, maybe make 
sense to you. So, there’s that document that would come, 
when the payment is above – is a million and above, that 
document would come from this – the system generated 
forms or documents that would come.  That would need the 
signature of the signatories, each and every bank account, 
it has got signatories – there’s officials are designated to 
be signatories, that would need that but except that there’s 
also a certificate that the CFO must sign.  That certificate 
goes to Treasury, together with that payment, together with 
20 
supporting documents so that Treasury can instruct the 
bank directly, that’s what we call direct transfer.  Treasury 
could then instruct the bank to say, transfer this money 
into this particular intended bank, beneficiary payee’s 
account. 
 
The 
certificate 
that 
I 
sign, 
as 
the 
CFO 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 145 of 270 
 
Chairperson, would be found on Estina 01, 328, it’s an 
example of that certificate but any payment that comes – 
this particular certificate does not relate to this payment 
per se but all the payments that are above one million – a 
million and above would come with a certificate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where is that certificate again 31..? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   328. 
MS DHLAMINI:   328. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Estina 01, 328. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I just want to, just see – yes you 
10 
may continue. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And if you check that certificate, is 
that certificate payment confirmation. 
“It is hereby confirmed and certified that the 
payment listed above were duly authorised by 
mandated 
officials 
in 
the 
department. 
 
The 
payments are for expenditure, in checking up on 
this with the vote of the Department, that’s in terms 
of the Appropriation Act offsetting this payment will 
not result in unauthorised expenditure for the 
20 
Department.  The expenditure was accurately and 
correctly allocated and classified under correct 
budget allocation.  Payments against earmarked 
funding and conditional grants where relevant for 
expenditure incurred under specific purpose for 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 146 of 270 
 
which the funds were appropriated for”. 
 
Basically this is what I confer, and this is what I 
was trying to explain, that my duty, when the submission is 
there, has got financial implications it’s to ensure there is 
a budget – it’s to ensure that you – by approving this 
expenditure you are not going to cause unauthorised 
expenditure, it’s not going to exceed the budget and it’s 
allocate properly in the system.  Meaning you are not 
paying against – say you budgeted a laptop but you are 
paying for the pen, you are not paying a pen against a 
10 
laptop, that is what we call, allocated properly in the 
system.  So those are the things that we need in finance 
but we deal with these issues after the payment advice has 
gone through and authorised as such and that process will 
always and always starts with the budget owner, thank you 
Chair.  Furthermore, Chair if you go to…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry the budget owner would, in 
effect, in terms of the programme be the same as the 
Programme Manager, in the case of a programme, a 
particular programme? 
20 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Yes, by programme I mean the 
…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The project. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Not the project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or unit. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 147 of 270 
 
MS DHLAMINI:   I’ve made example to say the budget is 
divided into programmes and then we have a programme 
called, Farmer Support and Development. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS 
DHLAMINI: 
 
 And 
the 
budget 
Manager 
or 
the 
Programme 
Manager, 
the 
correct 
wording 
to 
use 
is 
Programme Manager. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MS DHLAMINI:   The Programme Manager for that 
particular budget is Dr Masiteng, which means that budget 
10 
falls under District Services but below Dr Masiteng, also, 
there’s a further …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Official. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Officials, your Senior Management, so in 
District Services you’ll – when you get into the system, 
you’ll find that there’s a budget for Thabo Mofutsanyane, 
the responsible official for that budget is the District 
Director but Dr Masiteng plays and overall – plays and 
overall role on that budget.  If you come to my unit, which 
is Financial Management, you’re going to see the budget 
20 
for Supply Chain Management. The responsible official for 
that budget is the Senior Manager Supply Chain, that’s how 
the budget is configured but I play an overall responsibility 
for that particular budget. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the budget owner would be who? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 148 of 270 
 
MS DHLAMINI: The budget – that’s why I’m saying the 
budget owner becomes…[intervenes].   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   You refer to budget owner as well. 
MS DHLAMINI:   The budget owner will be the Director 
Supply Chain Management because my office, also, as the 
CFO has its own budget. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Dr Masiteng’s office also has its own 
budget. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, thank you. 
10 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  So ma’am what you’ve been 
explaining to us is the line of responsibility for compiling, 
submitting approvals for payments and where you fitted in 
to that particular payment, it did not fit at all, it had 
nothing to do with you, your signature is nowhere there, 
am I correct?  
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, that’s what I was explaining. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   In relation to that particular 
payment? 
MS DHLAMINI:   In relation to this particular payment. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And you know that we’re going to 
come back to it when we deal with the Anna Fourie issue, 
we won’t deal with it now because what we were trying to 
get to, step by step, is – I have it here as – those monthly 
and quarterly reports that you have Annexed, because the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 149 of 270 
 
question really, was, when these payments were made to 
Estina, what invoices were submitted to you, or what proof 
that services had been rendered were submitted to you 
prior to your singing off on any payment to them, that’s 
really where we are.  So, I think we should go to – back to 
13 where we were, flag 13 page 313 is where the 
documentation starts and you said we can ignore that for 
now and we will and I’m actually going to ask you then to 
look at specifically the account I want you to look at will 
under flag 14 of the reports, under flag 14 which starts at 
10 
335 and if you go over the documentation there, what I 
really am interested in are the figures that are part of the 
August 2012 to September 2013 cash flow report and 
projections page 341 is the front page of that report and 
they are telling us here that these projections cover the 
period 2012 – August 2012 to March 2013 in relation to the 
application of funds and then projection – cash flow for the 
period…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
I’m 
sorry 
Ms 
Gcabashe, 
I 
think 
somehow, I have lost the page numbers, I am at 341 
20 
because I thought you said …[intervenes]. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Estina 01, page 341 Mohuma 
Mobung Vrede Dairy Project, Estina 01, 341. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   its report number 1, if you look 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 150 of 270 
 
below the picture, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   You’ve got cash flow report and 
projections. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   August 2012 to September 2013, I 
was simply reading that introductory little paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   You are with me Ms Dhlamini? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I’m with you Chairperson. 
10 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Now the reason you have Annexed 
these documents is to say to the Commission, you had 
regard to these documents? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson 
before we deal with this matter if it’s acceptable then I first 
refer the Chairperson to the transfer payment policy so 
that when I say certain things, Chairperson, understands 
where I’m coming from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, is that fine Ms Gcabashe? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   That’s fine, no problem. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let’s do that. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Okay, let me check where is that. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   It will be flag 11. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Flag 11? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Flag 11 and I found this document 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 151 of 270 
 
quite interesting Ms Dhlamini its not one that we had been 
favoured with as the Commission so I did have a look at it, 
a very quick look at it.  I found that it seeks to be 
consistent, of course, with the Treasury regulations, I’m 
correct, I’m at page 299, you’ll tell me if you want to start 
it at the beginning but I thought page 299 sets out what 
we’ve actually talked about already.  Treasury regulation 
8.4 and it’s – particular 8.4.1, 8.4.2, 8.4.3 and 8.4.4 I don’t 
think you want to start here, or you want to go somewhere 
else?  This particular section gives us a background to 
10 
what your obligations are. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson I’m 
going to move straight to where Advocate is leading me to 
but before I move to that, I need to read paragraph 1 of 
this policy which is page – Estina 01, 298. 
CHAIRPERSON:   298, yes. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Paragraph 1, introduction: 
“In particular the official must take effective 
and appropriate steps to prevent within that 
official’s 
area 
of 
responsibility 
any 
20 
unauthorised irregular, fruitless and wasteful 
expenditure and any under collection of 
having to.” 
 
That is the opening paragraph.  We go to – yes where 
Advocate Leah was leading me to which is page Estina 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 152 of 270 
 
01 300.  Paragraph 6. – Paragraph 8.6.1. 
“Any 
provincial 
accounting 
officer 
transferring 
a 
grant 
from 
the 
Provincial 
Revenue 
Fund 
to 
a 
Municipality 
in 
accordance with assignment in terms of 
Section 156.4 of the Constitution 1996 Act 
number 108 of 1996 or a delegation – a 
delegation in terms of Section 238 of the 
Constitution 1996 other than an agency 
payment in terms of Section 238 of the 
10 
Constitution must comply with the relevant 
provision of the annual division of revenue.  
Local 
Government, 
Municipal, 
Finance 
Management Act and Section 9 and 10 of the 
Municipal systems and other relevant.” 
 
That is the – the – it is where you leading me. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  No, I was not. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Or I got lost. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  I was on the page before that.  But let 
us just quickly interrogate this. 
20 
MS DHLAMINI:  Oh you are on page… 
ADV GCABASHE SC:    Is this where you want to be 
because I think you – you… 
MS DHLAMINI:  No I was going to move straight to – I was 
going to move straight to the responsibilities of the objective 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 153 of 270 
 
of the policy and straight to the – the – I was going to move 
straight to Paragraph 4. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Paragraph 4 on page? 
MS DHLAMINI:  That is page – same page Estina 01 300.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Let us do that; let us go to where you 
want to be. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Let us start first with the objective of the 
policy.   
“The purpose of this document is to provide a 
policy framework for all responsible officials 
10 
who have a formal administrative duty to 
manage transfer payments that are made to 
external entities.” 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Now the definition of external entities 
includes a party such as Estina. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Am I correct?  Thank you. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Thank you. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Continue. 
MS DHLAMINI:   
20 
“This 
policy 
is 
applicable 
to 
all 
gifts, 
donation 
and 
sponsorship as defined in 2 above and as such is applicable 
to all departmental officials.  The scope the provision of this 
policy shall apply to all departmental officials and duly 
appointed 
programs/sub-program 
and 
responsibility 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 154 of 270 
 
management.” 
 
So 
that 
program 
and 
sub-program 
is 
program 
managers and sub- program managers.  In this case 
Chairperson program manager would be Dr Masiteng a 
district director will be a sub-program manager.   
“And responsibility management who are 
responsible for the management of transfer 
payment to external entity.” 
 
I will skip that accounting policies there at 5.1.  I will 
move to 5.2. 
10 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Those are the responsibilities … 
MS DHLAMINI:  No let us … 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Transfer payments. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Let us skip the 5.2. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Because those are aligned really to 
8.4.1. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  What is written here. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Under 5.2 is exactly what 8.4 
20 
Treasury Regulation 8.4.1. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Yes that is what it says. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  That is correct. 
MS DHLAMINI:  So I will skip. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  And we dealt with that this morning. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 155 of 270 
 
MS DHLAMINI:  I will skip that now. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  So you want really to look at 5.3 over 
the page.   Page 301.  I certainly have an interest in that 
because the CFO is mentioned there. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Oh where the CFO is mentioned. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Yes 5.3. 
MS DHLAMINI:   
“Annual allocation of transfer payments.  The 
program manager or district director shall 
provide the CFO with a detailed listing of the 
10 
proposed receipts of transfer payments for 
the following financial year during the budget 
planning.  This list shall be supported by 
relevant business plan.” 
 
By this receipt of transfer basically it is the project.  
The projects Chairperson. 
“In 
cases 
where 
the 
transfers 
are 
not 
budgeted for in terms of the budget process 
but rather to be implemented in the current 
financial year Treasury approval is required 
20 
to increase transfers and subsidies and the 
program manager and the relevant district 
director will be responsible for the monitoring 
of the use of the funds in terms of Paragraph 
5.1.1 of this policy.” 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 156 of 270 
 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Then 5.5.2 is also particularly 
relevant to your tasks. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  At the bottom of that page. 
MS DHLAMINI:   
“In terms of Treasury Regulation 5.1.3 the 
CFO shall ensure that the budget submission 
includes appropriate supporting information 
in respect of institution and public entities 
receiving this – ja it is supposed to say 
10 
receiving transfer payments on that vote.” 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Yes.  CFO and then you – if I – when 
I looked at it I thought over the page 5.6 was relevant.  I do 
not know if you find it equally relevant to your task? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Sorry Chairperson, where are you? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  I am on page 302 and really the one 
that I thought was particularly relevant is the one that reads: 
“The 
department 
must 
comply 
with 
the 
following 
requirements 
prior 
to 
effecting 
payment to a qualifying institution.”  
20 
And at B well first this says Treasury Regulation 8.4.1 and 
8.4.2 should have been complied with and then it goes on to 
say at B. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 157 of 270 
 
“The relevant approval has been obtained 
from Provincial Treasury in cases where a 
new transfer has been introduced.” 
So you are quite right.  This is a comprehensive transfer 
policy document.  Is this the point you are making? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  This is the document that guides the 
work you do as you effect transfers? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  And you are saying that you acted in 
10 
terms of this particular document? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Please show us now how you did that 
if we go back to Item 13 if that is – if you are ready to go 
back to 13? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Yes let us go back to … 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Item 13. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Okay before I go to that Chairperson let us 
read under 5.6. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Yes Ma’am. 
20 
MS DHLAMINI:  Let us read Paragraph D. 
“The responsible manager authorising the 
payment 
shall 
ensure 
that 
appropriate 
supporting information has been obtained to 
satisfy himself/herself that transfer payment 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 158 of 270 
 
is valid, the amount is correct, all conditions 
and objectives have been met. The contract 
agreement duly signed by all relevant parties 
and attached to the payment documents.  
The qualification institution aware of the 
statutory department institution as respect of 
the previous financial year subsistence.” 
Here they are talking why – if it is in case of Municipalities 
or of – or schools.  Maybe before I go there.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:  You want to look at… 
10 
MS DHLAMINI:  You go to Rules and Responsibilities. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
MS DHLAMINI:  It says there: 
“Rules and Responsibilities that the policies 
adhered 
to. 
 
Responsibility 
accounting 
officer, 
program 
manager, 
sub-program 
manager, district directors and chief financial 
officer ensure compliance to the contract or 
agreement.  Program manager and relevant 
district director.” 
20 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Do not go away.  You want to read the 
very last paragraph on that page which is relevant again to 
you directly. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Okay. 
“In 
preparing 
the 
annual 
report 
of 
the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 159 of 270 
 
department a Chief Financial Officer shall 
include information on transfer payment per 
organisation for the entire financial year as 
well as a report on compliance with Section 
38 day of the PFMA.” 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Ma’am.   
MS DHLAMINI:  Then we can go back Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  To black number 13 which we will find 
on page 313. 
MS DHLAMINI:  We were on black – we are on black number 
10 
13. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Black 13 yes.  Because you are now – 
in fact we are going to 14 my apologies because the page I 
really want to take you to concertina our discussion.  We had 
started at page 341 so that is Estina 01 page 341. 
MS DHLAMINI:  341. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  And – and my question to you at the 
time was, did you have regard to this report at any point in 
time? 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is report 1 of the Mohuma Mobung 
20 
Vrede Dairy Project? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  This is labelled as Report 1 but 
Chairman it deals with cash flow report and projections and 
it deals with the period August 2012 to September 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which would be a twelve month period? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 160 of 270 
 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Which would be a twelve month 
period but yes there are some others that we… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh no actually I think my – my arithmetic 
is wrong.  It would be thirteen months or twelve months 
would end in July I think.  Am I wrong? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  I think we are going to agree with you 
Chairman whether you are right or wrong.  We are agreeing 
with you whether you are right or wrong.  No Chairman but it 
is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It says August 2012 to September 2013 
10 
that cannot be twelve months.  I was wrong. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  No, ja but I was just saying that for 
purposes of where I am going to Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  It is not particularly material because 
she is very… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  For the record it is Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  But for her purposes Ms Dhlamini she 
20 
knows what we are looking at. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Ja.  You okay Ms Dhlamini?  And so 
the question again third time did you have regard to this 
report? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 161 of 270 
 
MS DHLAMINI:  What is the question Chairperson? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Did you have regard to this report?  
You have annexed it so there must be a good reason that 
you put it in here. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Yes I – I have looked at this report. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  At what point? 
MS DHLAMINI:  At the point when I was signing – you would 
realise that on page 01 339. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
MS DHLAMINI:  There is a sundry payment. 
10 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Advise of R34 – to R34million. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Of the R34million. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Which the sundry payment was compiled by 
Doctor Masiteng. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Rightly so as the Program Manager. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Yes. Correct. 
MS DHLAMINI:  And because it was – it was compiled by 
Doctor Masiteng as a Program Manager hence it came to me 
20 
as the CFO to verify it.  Because now it is being compiled at 
a higher level.  If it was compiled by Alta Meyer Doctor 
Masiteng would have – would have checked it and verify it.  
So it came to me to check and verify and that checking and 
verifying includes the things that I have indicated Chair when 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 162 of 270 
 
I was reading – when I was – when I was indicating the 
certificate.  It is in line with that certificate that I sent to 
Treasury.  But also it is to make sure that there is this 
budget, the budget is there.  How the budget works 
Chairperson.  This pro – in this instances we want to pay 
R34million.  Vrede Dairy was budgeted that is – it has 114 in 
this particular – in this particular year. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  No, no, this is the payment that you 
had requested in June – oh sorry it says here the 5 July 
2012.  I am reading up here.  2012.  It was requested in 
10 
2012.  It was paid in 2013 but it was requested in 2012 and 
the reason it was requested in 2012 is because it is – it was 
for the period 2012/2013.  That was the first R114million that 
Estina was expecting to get from the department.  So this 
R34.9 million – R34 950 000.00 was part of that R84 000,00 
that was broken up into three tranches.  Tell me if I am 
losing you but I think you and I are on the same page on this 
payment. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Okay I hear you Chairperson what you are 
explaining you are explaining in terms of Estina’s report. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Yes.  Well two things.  I wanted to 
understand whether you had read the Estina Report and 
interrogated it?  You brought us to this payment to say well 
number 1 they were asking me to make this payment.  That 
is why you brought us here.  And I was then saying to you, 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 163 of 270 
 
yes this is a payment that was part of the R84million that 
had not been budgeted for for the period 2012/2013.  This 
R84 million plus the R30million that you paid on the 9 July 
2012 would have made up the total.  The 84 plus the 30 
would have made up the total 114. 
MS DHLAMINI:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  So you are being asked and just the 
last little link is this R34 950,00 was only paid in April of 
2013 after the 2012/2013 financial year had ended. 
MS DHLAMINI:  That is correct Chairperson. 
10 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Okay but you were starting to provide 
for it here by way of this particular sundry payment advice? 
MS DHLAMINI:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Lastly can you explain to the 
Chairman why this becomes a sundry payment advice and 
why it is not a more detailed payment advice so that we 
know exactly where this money is going to and what it is 
going to do? Whether it is going to serve at its intended 
purpose to quote 38.2 of the PFMA? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Chairperson it is a difficult question I am not 
20 
sure how I am going to explain it because this sundry 
payment advice is the form that – that is used in the 
department when you make a payment.   Maybe if Advocate 
can rephrase the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it may be that she is putting that 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 164 of 270 
 
question because what is in her mind about the meaning of 
sundry is the same as what is in my mind namely it is like 
there are funds that are for specific purposes or items and 
what is left when you have allocated funds for certain items 
whatever is left is for sundry.  That is what is in my mind.  It 
might not be correct.  It is like the residue if you know what I 
mean.  It is like when you have allocated funds to all the 
important items and there is still money left that is for 
sundry.  I must be very wrong. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Thank you – thank you Chairperson.  I hear 
10 
what the Chairperson say so I am going to clarify.  I am 
going to try to get clarity from Advocate Leah here to say… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – but maybe to be fair because it was 
Ms Gcabashe’s question she might be able to say no actually 
that is not what is in her mind.  So I might be leading you 
astray with that clarification.  Ms Gcabashe. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Chairman I fully – you and I were on 
the same page in relation to that.  But I think to explain it in 
a little more detail to Ms Dhlamini.  If you look – so you have 
got to the top it is written Sundry Payment Advice.  And then 
20 
immediately below that you have got Transfer Payment for 
Vrede Dairy Project.  What we are interested in as a 
commission is in finding out whether you as the CFO who 
informed yourself about this payment knew where this money 
was going to so that you could tick and say good this money 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 165 of 270 
 
is going to where it was intended to go to do the work it was 
intended to do.  That is why – what you do in government. 
MS DHLAMINI:  No Chairperson in terms of how Advocate 
Leah is putting it I would say yes because when you go to 
the budget, when you go to the – yes when you go to our 
budget schedule B5 of our budget you would find that it says 
Vrede Dairy and if you go into the system itself where it is 
captured it is captured as – as Vrede Dairy.  So money is – 
was being paid for the purpose of the Vrede Dairy Project.  
That is how it is in the system.  That is how it is budgeted 
10 
for. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  So this is one of those areas where if 
the Chairman would like to make a recommendation on how 
these payments are labelled one of things we are going to be 
doing as the commission is making recommendations arising 
from the evidence we have collected from various witnesses.  
So 
maybe 
this 
is 
too 
general. 
Maybe 
one 
of 
the 
recommendations we should be making is that there should 
be a clearer note on what this payment is for; where it is 
going to so that there is a link between the payment and the 
20 
intention of the funder.  I do not know what your view would 
be on that?  Whether we should not make a recommendation 
that this is too unclear – opaque is the word I want to use. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Specifically Chair what you want to say is 
you want to see this payment saying you paying R34 million; 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 166 of 270 
 
R2 million is for the tractor; R3 million is for the cattle.  Is it? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Not necessarily but if you are saying 
that this is to purchase agricultural machinery. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Implements yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Implements but at least we know that 
this is intended to do just that. It is not supposed to go and 
buy wheat or maize it is going for implements.  But if you 
then go further Ma’am and you go to page 344 and say to 
me, I can show you where this money was going to because 
there are a lot of numbers on this page and this is the 
10 
supporting document I relied on.  Maybe that is the complete 
answer to my question.  So if you then look at – you see 
what you have on page 342, 343 is a summary.  A narrative 
what happened to the monies. I am interested in 344 which 
sets out the actual figures. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Thank you Chairperson.  Basically that is 
what it means to say this money that we are paying it will be 
– because if you look at this report it shows the source of 
funding, the funding that came, the money that was paid and 
how the money was used.  So basically, it answers the 
20 
question that Advocate Leah was asking to say she wishes 
that the payment advice would be specific like in this case 
so that we can be able to tick the box to say you paid this 
much, this much is used.  I understand. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  We traversed this document with Mr 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 167 of 270 
 
Thabethe and this is where he was saying he relied on you 
and your expertise.  In that sense and the sense of your 
expertise.  The difficulty with this document and the others 
reflect the same flaw right through.  So I am not going to go 
to them we have dealt with this with Mr Thabethe.  But I 
simply want to point out to you that if you say you 
interrogated this document first we said to Mr Thabethe the 
opening balance zero.  Is there any significance at all if you 
look at August 2012 to March 2013 where you opening 
balance is there any significance at all to the fact that there 
10 
was zero – there is nothing entered there under opening 
balance.  Can you assist us in understanding that? 
MS DHLAMINI:  The significance – okay this cash flow is a 
cash flow and cash flow projections.  It shows the budget of 
the – it shows the budget of the – what do you call this?  The 
budget of the project.   At the beginning the project does not 
have any money. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  But that is not correct.  That is not 
correct because if you then go down to that R30 million 
which is grant due from DARD for 2012 you see that 
20 
number? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Yes.  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  That is the same R20 million that has 
a history that you went to ask for on the 15 June 2012 and 
did not get.  That was eventually paid on the 9 July 2012 and 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 168 of 270 
 
that was given therefore to Estina.  So that grant due from 
DARD for 2012 R30 million was paid to them by the 
department.  So that R30 million should be sitting up at the 
top if there had not used it at all.  Are you with me? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Hundred percent Chairperson.  It would 
have been – I think the way the report is written that is what 
is misleading in the explaining the opening balance.  This 
opening balance the way I have interpreted it – it at the 
beginning of the project but you are right Chairperson.  
However – however if we saying it is the first – or let us take 
10 
it because this report starts August.  The 1 August we had 
already paid the R30 million right.  So what was supposed to 
have been shown is to say the R30 million came on – came 
in July.  You would have opened in July with zero.  You have 
received R30 million and then you spent the R30 million. 
After spending the R30 million in July in August how much 
was left?  That much that was left was the one that was 
supposed to have appeared there as an opening balance.  
You are right Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  But you realised that at the time you 
20 
were interrogating the document not just today? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Can you say it louder Chairperson? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  What you are explaining to me where 
we agreed it is something that you yourself realised when 
you looked at this document in 2012/2013.  It is not 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 169 of 270 
 
something you are only realising now that we are discussing 
it today. 
MS DHLAMINI:  No I realised that but the other – but the 
other thing that I considered is to say this report starts 2012.  
There are figures that was supposed to have shown 20 – for 
July 2012 which does not appear here. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  In fact, if I can take you to – to my 
bundle which really speaks to some of the numbers you have 
here and break down some of the numbers for you.  It might 
be of some assistance to the Chairman.  Before I do that 
10 
though I just want to – to find out when you look at 
application of funds – so again sundry creditors you have 
R499 000.00 confirmed purchase orders.  Did you interrogate 
what that R89 million was buying?  Was it your duty to do 
so? 
MS DHLAMINI:  It was not my duty Chairperson to ask those 
questions.  Those questions were supposed to be asked by 
the Project Manager.  As I have already indicated or the 
policy has clearly stated that they are the ones who monitor 
this transfers.  They are the ones who were supposed to get 
20 
those details. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  When we then look at the tractors 
that were bought I had really just look at them at the 
cumulative amount for 2012/2013 R12 million.  Mr Basson 
told this commission that there were tractors that had been 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 170 of 270 
 
purchased by the department and he could not understand 
why R12 million if this is what was spent was being spent on 
tractors when there were tractors in Vrede that had been 
bought by the department.  The question is, would you 
interrogate that?  Would you check on what the department 
had provided just before the implementing agent arrived and 
then say to the implementing agent, now do not forget we 
have already provided 50 tractors.  We have already 
provided etcetera, etcetera.  So when you start preparing 
your accounts take into account the fact that we have 
10 
already given you certain things.   
MS DHLAMINI:  That would have been what the Program 
Managers or the District Directors were supposed to have 
done not the CFO. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Not the CFO’s responsibility? 
MS DHLAMINI:  It is not the CFO’s responsibility. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Can we very briefly because I – I 
believe that we have sufficient information on some of that.  
But I just want to very briefly take you to our Reference 
Bundle D.  Reference Bundle D. 
20 
MS DHLAMINI:  Is this one that is put here? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Ah-ha.  Which – it has the same 
reports and if you just go to page 1 – page 1403 Reference 
Bundle D.  Here we have a breakdown. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Chair what page Chairperson? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 171 of 270 
 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  1403.   
MS DHLAMINI:  Oh okay.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:  So here we have a break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We looking at the red numbers now they 
are no black numbers here? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Ja they are the only ones that are 
there.  These are old Reference Bundles Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Page 1403.  If we look at the top 
again you know that opening balance where they – they did 
10 
not make an entry.  Can I just say that this is a quarterly 
progress report just to be clear so that I am not confusing 
you.  If you look at page 1397 you see the title “Quarterly 
Progress Report September 2012”.  But you will find that 
some of the figures are similar and I am really just focusing 
on that R30m million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  So that R30 million is there again 
grant received from DARD R30 million.  Total R30 million in 
July is that what that is.  And that is correct because they 
20 
got that money from you in July. 
MS DHLAMINI:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Then they reserve that for parlour 
equipment R29million of that.  You see that? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I see that, Chairperson. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 172 of 270 
 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   The reason I want to know whether 
you would have interrogated any of these figures is because 
Mr Thabethe told us that the first R 30 million – and I think 
you agreed with him in your evidence before lunch – your 
understanding was that it was supposed to pay for the 
feasibility study and all those preliminary studies and 
documents and business plans that had to be prepared. 
 
Here you find that the R 29 million of the R 30 million, 
R 29 million is put aside for pale equipment.  You would not 
have known about that?  You think it is District Services who 
10 
should have interrogated that? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I would not known about that, Chairperson.  
District Services was supposed to know about it.  However, 
the reports that are attached in my affidavits are the reports 
that I got via District Services. So what I am not sure of is 
whether they have seen this particular report because I am 
also seeing it for the first time. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   I have no difficulty with you seeing it 
for the first time now Ma’am because we are talking about 
the same R 30 million that you say you are familiar with from 
20 
your document. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   That is why I actually focused on that 
because I know at least you are familiar with that first 
R 30 million. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 173 of 270 
 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Not only with the request but with the 
payment of that first R 30 million. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So you... and I am sure you what 
then is said to have happened to that first R 30 million that 
you thought was going to be for those preliminary exercises.  
What I understand from you evidence in any event, is that 
you are saying the bulk of the interrogation of these 
accounts rested on the shoulders of District Services.  Am I 
10 
correct? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And the only time that you would be 
involved in interrogating any of these is if District Services 
brought that issue to your attention?  I am summarising what 
I understand you to say. 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Now, I think we will then leave it at 
that Chairman, unless there are questions you want to raise.  
We have dealt with a lot of this material with some of the 
20 
other witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   I just want to, again for the sake of 
completeness, the same reference bundle actually with... Ms 
Dhlamini, I had promised you that I would show Estina’s 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 174 of 270 
 
bank account and the R 16,98 that was reflected in that bank 
account.  So if you go to page... same bundle, Bundle D, 
page 1453.   
MS DHLAMINI:   1453... 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And this is really just so that I can 
close on this matter, 1453.  And it is just to say to you that 
when we looked at this, the transfer of that R 30 million on 
the 9t h of July was a significant amount that went into this 
account because on the 4t h of July, just above that, the 
amount there in the account was R 16.98.   
10 
 
And the only reason we raise the issue is to say, would 
this have been a significant issue for you to interrogate, 
considering 
that 
you 
were 
thinking 
of 
giving 
Estina 
R 340 million of government’s money to use?  One.   
 
Two, you knew that you were transferring this money 
directly into Estina’s account.  Would you have been 
something that would have worried you had you seen this? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, these are some of the things 
that I have said.  Because this is a project and it was 
implemented... it was not money by myself.  So...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, please face this side.  This is quite 
important.  I want to hear.   
MS DHLAMINI:   Oh.  Okay, Chairperson.  What I am saying 
is, because I was not the manager of this project, I would not 
have known the distance.  And as I said, the policies were 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 175 of 270 
 
very clear, we are supposed to manage this project.  Thank 
you, Chair.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And then it is just again to tidy up to 
the loop.  I had promised you that I would show...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But before you do that it would be part of 
the responsibility of a CFO of a government department in a 
situation such as this to ask the question:  This entity that 
you people want us to... want the department to have a 
partnership with, have you done homework about it?   
 
What... who are the type of people?  Who are the people 
10 
who own it?  What is their background?  What is this entity 
involved in?   
 
If we put in... if we give it X million rand today, are we 
not going to wake up tomorrow and find that it is liquidated?  
I would have thought that that is part of interrogation that a 
CFO must direct his or her mind to.  Is that not correct? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Thank you.  Thank you, Chairperson.  
Chairperson, when this project was done, we... in hindsight 
you must still remember that, yes there was a top of Paras 
here, a huge company.   
20 
 
And obviously you would - because HOD went and meet 
with this people – you would take it that that due diligence 
has been done already.  So hence I could not prove those 
questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay is your answer therefore that:  Yes, 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 176 of 270 
 
that is the kind of interrogation one would expect from a CFO 
of a department? 
MS DHLAMINI:   But not... yes, but not to an extent that you 
would also ask to say ...[intervenes] ‘ 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, let me say this.  Let me say this.  At 
this stage, I am just talking general, okay?  Then we can talk 
specific.  If you say:  Yes, that is the kind of interrogation 
that 
one 
would 
normally 
expect 
from 
the 
CFO 
of 
a 
department.   
 
And then we can say:  In this case, did you do it?  You 
10 
say:  No, I did not do it.  Or yes, I did it.  If you did not do it, 
you say:  These are the reasons why I did not do it.   
 
So I think at a general level is the kind of interrogation 
that would be expected from the CFO.  Is that right? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Ja.  Thank you, Chairperson.  Indeed, that 
is what... because you also have to understand the entity 
that you are dealing with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DHLAMINI:   So you would ask those questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  In this case, you did not ask those 
20 
questions. 
MS DHLAMINI:   In this case I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what are the reasons why you did not 
ask the questions? 
MS DHLAMINI:   The reasons why I did not ask Chairperson, 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 177 of 270 
 
because from where I was sitting, we... my focus was more 
on Paras because it was a company that was said to be the 
one that is going to provide the technical.   
 
Even this project, they are the ones who are going to 
invest.  So where I was sitting, we are dealing with Paras 
and Estina.   
 
So hence I could not really ask those questions.  Let 
alone that HOD had already met with those people.  So I 
took it that that due diligence has been done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But is it not correct that the HOD did not 
10 
have anything concrete about the... about Paras other than 
maybe this maybe reputation into that it is a very big dairy 
company in India?   
 
There was nothing concrete that he had that he showed 
you about this Paras.  It was just general talk.  It is a very 
big dairy company in the world, in India and nothing more.   
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, I find it difficult to answer that 
question because he went there physically.  So probably... 
hence I took his words to say this is what happened.  
Because he went there.  He saw this Paras. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
but 
remember, 
if 
it 
is 
your 
responsibility as the CFO to make sure that if you are going 
to use taxpayer’s money as a department to... when you are 
going to give it to a certain entity, certain homework must be 
done.  You must satisfy yourself that that homework has 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 178 of 270 
 
been done, is it not?   
 
Otherwise, you must say:  I am sorry.  As CFO I cannot 
approve this until this homework has been done.  If you are 
satisfied, you will have to do it without my signature.  I am 
not satisfied.  And I am the CFO.  
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, what I was satisfied with is 
basically the coming in of Paras.  That made me comfortable 
in this whole project.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But my question is, what was there that 
was concrete about Paras that was placed before you?  Or is 
10 
the position not that you just had this general talk that it is a 
big company.  It is a dairy company in India.   
 
It is number one or number two or number 3 in the world 
in terms of dairy production.  But in terms of exactly who 
they were, who runs them, what their situation is.  You did 
not have anything, did you? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I did not, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you did not have anything about them. 
You did not have anything about Estina.  And yet, you are 
happy to approve a project that would involve the department 
20 
in such a lot of money. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Maybe the other thing that we need to 
correct Chairperson is that I did not approve the project.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe let us not... maybe saying 
approve the project might be inaccurate.  But is the position 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 179 of 270 
 
not that no money would have been used - maybe a above a 
certain amount, I am not sure – would have been used for 
this project without the CFO of the department saying yes 
this can be done? 
MS DHLAMINI:   No, this project would still have been done 
Chairperson without me saying yes it can be done.  Like I 
said, my... in the main, my role is to deal with issues of the 
budget.  It would still have been done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but in that case, if you did not... if 
you did not go along.  If you thought that this was a reckless 
10 
way of spending taxpayers money and you did not want to 
attach your signature to it, if it could be done, it would be 
done without you being involved.  The HOD would have to 
take full responsibility.  He would not be able to say:  I did 
this with full guidance from the CFO.   
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, HOD still has the power to 
overrule me.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Hence I have indicated even to say there is 
in instances where he has done that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But in this case, he did not overrule 
you.  You had no problem with being ...[intervenes]  
MS DHLAMINI:   The only ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...a party to it. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Sorry, Chairperson.  The only thing that I 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 180 of 270 
 
am saying that I did not do is maybe asking those pertinent 
questions that the Chairperson is putting to me to say you 
ought to have say:  Give me something concrete.  That is the 
only thing I did not do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Ms Gcabashe. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you, Chairman.  Ma’am, I then 
just want to... I made the comment before lunch that one of 
your responsibilities is to make sure that our BEE policies 
10 
and our PPFA, Preferential Policy Framework Act, all of 
those pieces of legislation are complied with.  If you will go 
on the same Bundle D go to page 1375. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Page? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   1375.  And as you keep your finger 
there, if you also then go to 1379.2.  Just keep both pages.  
The 
simple 
point 
I 
have 
made 
to 
you 
before 
lunch 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, Ms Gcabashe.  Did you say you 
must start at 1375? 
20 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   1375, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Right.  And then also what page? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And then we also look at 1379.  That 
is 1379.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 181 of 270 
 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And the simple point I made to you is 
that a lot of the money that you gave to Estina actually went 
to companies that were not South African companies.  So at 
1375, you have a $5 million invoice that is for: 
- drawing up and presenting a comprehensive 
feasibility study,  
- developing the project report and templates and 
systems to ensure compliance by the contractors,  
- developing and implement systems to manage the 
entire project cycle,  
10 
- disbursement for professional fees.   
 
$5 million dollars.  In anybody’s world it is a lot of 
money to pay to consultants when we have our own local 
people who could have done this work.  VKB happens to be 
the example I gave you earlier on.   
 
So that is the first one I want to point you to.  Same 
point, if you look at 1379.2.  You have the timesheet of some 
very learned sounding people.  A few doctors here, et cetera.  
“Project deliverable.  Project feasibility study.” 
 
So what I have assume is that that $5 million Dollars US 
20 
paid these people.  Now I am very sure that none of them 
were South African.   
MS DHLAMINI:   [supressed laughing] 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So again a lot of money going out of 
the country where the expertise that they had, I am very 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 182 of 270 
 
sure, we could have found in the country.   
 
So as the Chairman put it earlier, had officials being 
doing this work, we would not be paying $5 million US 
Dollars for a feasibility study.  I do not know if you have any 
comment at all on this particular aspect? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I do not have a comment, Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   I had also said to you earlier on that 
there was that memo to the premier that had the R 17 million 
budget item on it.  And you wanted to believe it was budget.  
You just wanted clarity on what the R 17 million represented.  
10 
You will find that at page, same bundle, 1323.  And that will 
be at paragraph 2.3 which reads...  Are you at 1323? 
MS DHLAMINI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   It is a memo, a copy of, to the 
premier, 
the 
Honourable 
E 
S 
Magashule, 
Free 
State 
Provincial Government.  Are you there? 
MS DHLAMINI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Have you got the document? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Ms Gcabashe. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Yes, sir? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay the page number was not clear.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Legible? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I am there.  Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Are you there, Ms Dhlamini? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I am here, Chairperson.. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 183 of 270 
 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   At paragraph 2.3.  This is what I 
wanted to clarify because you asked the question.  It reads 
that: 
“The 
allocated 
budget 
of 
R 17 million 
for 
the 
completion of three dairy plants would only be 
sufficient to cover the initiation phases of the 
project.  Hence there is a need for a strategic 
partner to partner with the department for the 
completion of the project within the specified period 
comprehensively cover the value chain in terms of 
10 
markets, 
further 
inputs 
and 
other 
unintended 
occurrences...” 
 
So I was just pointing out that it says here the allocated 
budget of R 17 million.  I hope that satisfies your question.  
You wanted to know what the R 17 million mean. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Just repeat your question. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Look, she... Ms Dhlamini had asked 
for me to explain what the R 17 million represented. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So I am pointing out that it is an 
20 
allocated budget.   
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, I was not aware of this 
budget. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Yes, and in nowhere in this 
documentation is this budget reflected either.  As you 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 184 of 270 
 
correctly say, it was R 9 million and then another R 3 million 
for Vrede.  At most, there was about R 12.5 to R 13 million 
for the Vrede, the little bit of Vrede Dairy Projects, the 
different parts in the financial year 2011/2012. 
MS DHLAMINI:   That will be ‘12/’13. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   ‘12/’13?   
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   My apologies.  You are correct.  It 
was 2011/2012 there was nothing.  ‘12/’13.  Next there were 
would have been R 13 million.  So you know nothing about 
10 
the R 17 million having been budgeted for? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thanks.  That helps to clear that one 
up.  Then I think we should very briefly deal with that 
deviation.  That deviation that has created so many 
questions from everybody.   
 
You had... annexed to your documents, the approval 
which we have dealt with.  By the deviation memo that we 
are interested in now is on page 1349 and it runs up to 1352 
of the same reference Bundle D.   
20 
MS DHLAMINI:   Can you repeat the pages Chair? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   1349 and the second page, the 
signature page is 1352.   
MS DHLAMINI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Now this is the deviation memo and I 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 185 of 270 
 
will just quickly summarise.  That doctor Masiteng said he 
was asked by the HOD, Mr Thabethe to prepare.  The 
approval that you had referred the Chairman to earlier on 
that you signed off on the 26 t h of May, had not included a 
deviation.   
 
So this is the first document that includes a proposal 
that you deviate from your supply chain management 
processes.   
 
The 
question 
for 
you 
Ma’am 
is. 
 
What 
did 
you 
understand that you were recommending when you signed 
10 
this document and the signature?  Your signature, you will 
find on page 1352.   
MS DHLAMINI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So this is the recommendation.   
“It is recommended that approval is granted by the 
Head of the Department to: 
1. 
Accept the proposal from Estina Paras with 
regards to the establishment of integrated dairy in 
Vrede. 
 
That is similar to the approval document that you had 
20 
signed upon. 
2. 
Enter into a memorandum of agreement with 
Estina Paras to implement the dairy project in 
Vrede. 
 
That is a new one. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 186 of 270 
 
3. 
To deviate from the normal supply chain 
management processes and procedure and appoint 
Estina Paras to implement establish the integrated 
dairy in Vrede. 
 
I just want you to help us understand your role.  Was it a 
broad or narrow role?  Take us through that please, Ma’am.   
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, as I have indicated that every 
submission that has got a financial implication will come to 
the CFO.  I had already dealt with the financial implication of 
this project.  I wish not to repeat it if the Chairperson 
10 
agrees.   
 
I will only deal with the deviation part of this project 
especially, it is also my role to ensure compliance in terms of 
the supply chain management policing through supply chain 
management.   
 
So in looking this deviation where it will be saying or 
where the purpose is to deviate from the normal supply chain 
management processes and procedure to appoint Estina 
Paras to implement.   
 
One of the things when you deal with the deviation, you 
20 
deal 
with 
deviation 
in 
terms 
of 
Treasury 
Regulation 
...[intervenes]  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   16A. 
MS DHLAMINI:   16(4) ...[intervenes]  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Capital A. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 187 of 270 
 
MS DHLAMINI:   I think 16(4)(a) right in conjunction with 
supply chain management policy.  I am aware Chairperson 
there was Circular 6 of 2006... 7 and 8 or 6 and 7.  I cannot 
remember. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   I think it is 2008 if my memory 
serves me well. 
MS DHLAMINI:   I think it is 7 and 8.  6 or 7 and 8.  Yes, 
Chairperson.  Both three, they talk to how you handle the 
deviation.  It says when the... I wish to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   If you want to have a look at the relevant 
10 
document, you... feel free. 
MS DHLAMINI:   I wish to read, Chairperson if I can be 
provided, if I can be assisted?  There is a Treasury 
Regulation ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MS DHLAMINI:   ...in one of these documents.  I do not have 
it with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think... counsel will assist you.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So you are looking for the practice 
note? 
20 
MS DHLAMINI:   No, the practice note Chair will still talk the 
same language as the Treasury regulation as the policy.  
What I wanted to read into record is that paragraph of the 
Treasury Regulation.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you saying that if Ms Gcabashe has 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 188 of 270 
 
got the Treasury Note, the wording would be the same? 
MS DHLAMINI:   The wording would be the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you do not mind reading the Treasury 
Note? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, if the Treasury Note... that Treasury 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Note with the information. 
MS DHLAMINI:   ...which refers to in the note. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DHLAMINI:   The wording would be the same.  I can still 
10 
read from it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Thank you, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   If I may just ask for a two minutes’ 
indulgence Chair to find it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Okay.  I think counsel for... is 
giving assistance.  Or not really? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   While Advocate Molefe finds it for us, 
maybe I can ask you one or two questions and we will come 
back to that.  All I want to know really is, did you read the 
20 
submission closely before you signed it? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I did read it Chairperson.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   You did? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I did, Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And did you try and find out – I am 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 189 of 270 
 
using one example right now – for instance about the land in 
Vrede?  Now the Phumelela Municipality only signed off on 
the land lease in December of 2012.  We are here in the 
period May/June 2012.   
 
So it is one thing for the department to have identified 
land.  There was no certainty that you were going to get that 
land.   
 
Are those the kind of questions you would be asking of 
the Chief Director or anybody else?  Are you gentlemen sure 
that this things is going to work because we will get this 
10 
land? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I would not have asked those questions, 
Chairperson.  As I said, I would have look at the financial 
implication of this submission.  I would also look at the 
reasons why they want to deviate.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And then the other one would, of 
course, be Paras.  Because of you look at the memorandum 
of understanding between Estina and Paras.  Paras was very 
clear that there was not going to be partnership, it was not 
going to be a JB.  They were coming in as a sub-contractor.   
20 
 
They were happy to work on the Vrede Dairy Farm 
Project but as a sub-contractor.  Is that what you understood 
Paras’s role to be when you were signing off on this, that 
they will be brought in as sub-contractors? 
MS DHLAMINI:   To be honest Chairperson, I asked for the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 190 of 270 
 
memorandum.  I looked at it but I did not go into all the 
details of that memorandum but I have seen that there was 
that memorandum.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Well, 
when 
you 
are 
supposed 
to 
recommend or approve such issues with such financial 
implications, why do you not go into details in reading such a 
memorandum? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, it is because what I am 
looking at is the financial implication for the department, 
what the department would spend on this project.  But I 
10 
must say maybe on hindsight I was supposed to go into 
deeper details of that memoranda which I did not do. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:    So you were looking for Treasury 
Regulation 8 or were you looking for Treasury Regulation 
16? 
MS DHLAMINI:   16, Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   16.  It is in the legislation bundle, 
Chairman, but because it is a legislation bundle it is not 
numbered, it has not got page numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I think you do not have to give it to 
20 
me, if somebody will read aloud that will be enough. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   I can.  Can I give it to 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   To the witness, ja.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   To the witness. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 191 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Is that the document you are 
looking for? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So 16 reads: 
“Public, private partnerships.” 
Is that correct? 
MS DHLAMINI:   No, it is 16A 6.4, it deals with supply 
chain management. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  This one, I have got it here, I will 
10 
find it.  You are looking at 16A?  
MS DHLAMINI:   Ja, we are looking at 16A which deals 
with supply chain management. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   I have it, yes. 
MS DHLAMINI:   I am going to read 16A 6.4: 
“If in a specific case it is impractical to invite 
competitive 
bids 
the 
accounting 
officer 
or 
accounting 
authority

must be recorded and approved by the accounting 
officer or accounting authority.” 
I have appended my signature on the signature – on this 
submission on the basis of this particular clause in the 
Treasury Regulation. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 192 of 270 
 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   But can I ask you to pause just 
there?  The HOD had not approved it yet, the accounting 
officer had not approved it yet.  The accounting officer was 
waiting for recommendation from you. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Can you repeat your question, I did not 
get it? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   The accounting officer had not 
approved it yet.  The accounting officer was waiting for a 
recommendation from yourself. 
MS DHLAMINI:   I am saying, Chairperson, I have signed 
10 
the recommendation on the basis of this particular section 
of the Treasury Regulation. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And what I am saying to you, 
Ma’am, is this says where it is approved by the accounting 
officer.  At your level, at the point at which you are 
recommending, he has not or she has not as yet approved 
it but you are applying your mind as the CFO to whether or 
not the HOD should approve it.  So the fact is you look at, 
are 
very 
different 
because 
you 
are 
making 
a 
recommendation and if the HOD then approves it then the 
20 
HOD can rely on this provision, maybe. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Oh, I – thank you, Chairperson, I think I 
understand that my – simply the advocate is saying my 
signature came before the HOD’s signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 193 of 270 
 
MS DHLAMINI:   True.  That is true, Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And with that your consideration of 
relevant and material facts relating to this deviation came 
before the HOD made up his mind finally.  Technically, 
anyway, that is how I see it. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Which brings us back to – I will use 
the Chairperson’s word, justification.  What was then your 
justification because you cannot rely on 16A 6.4. 
MS DHLAMINI:   As I have already even alluded in my first 
10 
affidavit, when I looked at this approval and this deviation.  
Honestly, I was looking from the point of view of Estina 
Paras arrangement.  I am mindful of what the Chairperson 
has questioned me to say but you did not have concrete 
information.  With that in mind, but I am saying my main 
interest was with the investment that Paras was going to 
bring in the Vrede Dairy in the Free State and also – yes, 
in the main it was because of the investment that was said 
to say they are going to invest into that project and if that 
project could have materialised the way it was intended, I 
20 
was also looking at the opportunities that if that project get 
off, get implemented, there will be issues of job creation 
for the community of Vrede and Vrede, it is a very rural 
area and there is no issues of – or job opportunities, there 
is not a lot of job opportunities in that area, in that town. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 194 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well …[intervenes] 
MS 
DHLAMINI: 
 
 
So 
I 
look 
at 
those 
things 
and 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I do not understand your answer, 
Ms Dhlamini. or your explanation of your decision because, 
as I understand it, we are looking at whether this was a 
case where deviation should have been recommended, is 
that right? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is right, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now whether a company is going 
10 
to bring investment and whatever, is it of any relevance to 
the question whether what you have before justifies 
deviation? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Okay, Chairperson, maybe let me answer 
it directly because what I was trying to explain is, it says if 
it is not practical to invite bids, the reasons should be 
recorded why you are deviating.  So I am saying with 
regard to the reasons that were recorded here, I looked at 
the explanation of the job opportunities that the Vrede 
Dairy Project is going to bring in that area, I looked at the 
20 
issue of the investment that Paras was going to bring and 
because Paras was coming with an investment, for me it 
makes it not practical to subject somebody who is going to 
invest into a bidding process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Dhlamini, are you sure that is the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 195 of 270 
 
answer you are giving me? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, that is the answer that I am giving 
you, Chairperson, to say I was specifically concerned with 
the investment that Paras was going to bring and looking 
at that to say the submission says Paras is going to invest 
and for me it is not practical to subject that to bidding 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Ms Dhlamini, I am not looking 
at that provision in front of me, so I am relying on what you 
read.  As I understand it, it says if it is not practical, I 
10 
assume to do an open tender, is that correct?  In effect 
that is what it means.  Then you may deviate. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, if it is not practical. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I have a look at that provision 
please so that I do not mislead you. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Chairman, the quickest way simply 
to give you my PFMA.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is fine, that is fine. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Are we talking about 16A, 6.4? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one that she red. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   The one that you are relying on. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, 16A, 6.4. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thanks for the indulgence, 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Thank 
you. 
 
16A.6 
deals 
with 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 196 of 270 
 
procurement of goods and service and 16A.6. 6 says: 
“If in a specific case it is impractical to invite 
competitive 
bids, 
the 
accounting 
officer 
or 
accounting 
authority 
may 
procure 
the 
required 
goods or services by other means provided that the 
reasons for deviating from inviting competitive bids 
must be recorded and approved by the accounting 
officer or accounting authority.” 
Do you agree with me that what this provision says is that 
you may, as an accounting authority, accounting officer, 
10 
deviate from inviting competitive bids if it is impractical to 
invite competitive bids?  Do you accept that that is what it 
means? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now what is your understanding of 
what it means to say it is impractical to invite competitive 
bids? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I am saying from my understanding of 
what 
made 
this 
to 
be 
practical 
is 
the 
fact 
that 
…[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What made it to be…? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Impractical, not practical. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Not practical, is the fact that Paras was 
going to – it is said that Paras was going to invest 200 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 197 of 270 
 
Ma’am in this project.  So what I am saying, Chairperson, I 
found it not practical from the point where I was sitting to 
say how do I subject and investment to a bidding process, 
maybe there is a way I would learn but at that point in time 
I found it not practical. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Dhlamini, impractical it cannot 
physically be done or it cannot – it is difficult to do and 
what this is talking about is inviting – it is impractical to 
invite other people to put in bids.  Now you could have said 
we are going to invite other people, other entities to put in 
10 
their bids and Para/Estina will put in their bids.  If it turns 
out that it is – their bid is the best bid then that is fine, 
there was nothing impractical about inviting other bids 
here.   
 
You could send out a notice and say this is what we 
want to do, all those entities who think they come in and 
do this, they must put in their bids and Paras and Estina 
could feel free to also put in their bid.  There was nothing 
impractical, I do not understand your answer. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, maybe I am coming from the 
20 
background that says already through the consultations on 
Mohuma Mobung, HOD had indicated that at some point 
this concept was bounced with other entities in the country 
of presenting Mohuma Mobung as a strategy.  So in getting 
the funding for different projects, Vrede Dairy being one of 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 198 of 270 
 
those.  Surely the entities will be those who are in dairy 
business like your Parmalat, your Nestle and the indication 
from the HOD was he has already made that presentation 
and nobody shown interest hence he went outside the 
country to go and look for the investment.  Really, I looked 
at this division from that point of view that HOD went all 
over, all out, to go to outside the country to get investment 
because he could not get that investment in this country. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But coming back to whether it was 
impractical to invite other entities to put in their bids, do 
10 
you not accept that there was nothing impractical about 
that? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is why I am saying, Chairperson, I 
was looking at the point of just an investment, somebody 
has already – is already saying I am going to invest, so 
from the point of view where I am sitting, is if I – let us say 
you invite those, this person might say but I have already 
volunteered to do that, he might not even have interest any 
longer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you …[intervenes] 
20 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is how I look – that is from the angle 
that I looked at. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But, Ms Dhlamini, you tell them here we 
do things according to the law and the law says we must 
invite competitive bids unless it is impractical to invite 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 199 of 270 
 
them.  I find nothing impractical in this case to invite 
competitive bids and you, Paras and Estina, are free to put 
in your bid as well. 
MS DHLAMINI:   You invite, Chairperson, competitive 
bidding, bids, when you acquire a service. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now you are going to something else 
and we will go to that, I am talking about whether it was 
impractical to invite competitive bids, that is what we are 
dealing with now.  Are you still insisting that it was 
impractical to invite competitive bids in this case? 
10 
MS DHLAMINI:   I looked at it as being impractical, 
Chairperson, as I said that because I was looking at the 
investment part of it, nothing else. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Do you accept my understanding 
of what impractical means? 
MS DHLAMINI:   No, I understand, I understand, the 
Chairperson’s… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it your understanding as well or do 
you have a different understanding of the word impractical? 
MS DHLAMINI:   It is also my understanding that when you 
20 
say something is impractical it means it is not practical to 
can invite the bids. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Now let us take it step-by-
step, is there anything that could have prevented the 
department from issuing whatever documents it had to 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 200 of 270 
 
issue to invite competitive bids.  Practically, is there 
anything that would have prevented them from doing that? 
MS DHLAMINI:   No, there is nothing that could have 
prevented the department to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and if the department had done that 
then if nobody showed interest except Paras and Estina 
then you would have complied with the law because you 
would have invited bids and only Paras and Estina showed 
interest, is that right? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is right, Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if other entities put in their bids 
within the time that you would have stipulated, including 
Paras, then those bids would be adjudicated and if Paras 
and Estina won, so be it, is it not? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is so, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So given that you accept that the things 
that the department would have to do in order to invite 
competitive bids could have been done and whoever was 
interested could have put in bids.  Do you still say it was 
impractical for the department to invite competitive bids. 
20 
MS DHLAMINI:   Okay, it was not impractical for the 
department to can do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DHLAMINI:   But I am saying in these particular 
instances the company Paras has already shown interest 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 201 of 270 
 
and that is company that HOD wanted to deal with that he 
has already sourced the investment form.  So I am saying 
when I was looking at the submission with the background 
that they give to say because there is already an interest 
shown in this regard.  That is what made me to accept this 
deviation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you are not saying to me, are you, 
that if a particular entity has already shown interest then it 
is permissible to deviate from inviting competitive bids.  
That is not what you are saying or is it what you are 
10 
saying? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Ja, that is not what I was saying.  I am 
not saying it is permissible but …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what is the relevance of that part of 
your evidence, why are you telling me that in the context of 
me 
wanting 
to 
find 
out 
whether 
there 
was 
proper 
justification for deviation in terms of this provision because 
that is the provision you referred us to, to say you acted in 
terms of this probably. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, as I said to say yes, I hear 
20 
your explanation of the impracticality, the deviation – that 
how you explain it, but I am saying that is how I viewed it, 
to say there was already a company that is here that want 
to invest and I looked at the prospects of the investments, 
what is it that it is going to bring and I then realised that 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 202 of 270 
 
on this basis there is reasons that are recorded why HOD 
is deviating from the SCM processes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So tell me if I misunderstand your 
evidence, but what you are saying is, your approach or 
your understanding was that you allowed or the department 
was allowed to deviate from inviting competitive bids where 
there was an entity that had already shown interest.  That 
is 
what 
I 
understand 
you 
to 
be 
saying. 
 
Is 
my 
understanding correct? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson, shown interest to 
10 
invest. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, to invest.  You accept that that is 
not in the clause that you said you rely on? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was your own thing. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you, Chairperson, I will just 
pick up on one last issue but I think it is a point that you 
have conceded in your concluding paragraphs of your first 
20 
affidavit where you agree, Ms Dhlamini, that you ought to 
have informed the Provincial Treasury and the Auditor-
General within 10 days of the deviation, that you had in 
fact deviated.  You concede that you – I think the word you 
used here is you erred in not doing that.  You confirm that 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 203 of 270 
 
that is your view, that you should have informed those 
particular parties. 
MS DHLAMINI:   That I conceded, Chairperson.  No, we did 
not do it. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And you ought to have done so. 
MS DHLAMINI:   We ought to have done it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And why did you not do it? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, it is one of things that 
becomes an oversight in the processes.  As I have already 
alluded to, that in finance, in the unit that I had, you had 
10 
supply chain management and you have another unit.  So 
this would have been reported by that unit and most of 
those reports where you report, they necessarily not come 
to me because there is format in which they are reported.  
So not always that – maybe I have taken it for granted that 
it has been reported, like any other deviation.  Hence, I am 
saying it is one of those oversight things that would be part 
of one stop when you are ensuring that something should 
happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you – I take it that you would accept 
20 
a responsibility for the fact that there was no compliance 
with that part because it was part of your responsibilities, 
as I understand the position, to ensure that there was 
proper 
implementation 
of 
supply 
chain 
management 
policies. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 204 of 270 
 
MS 
DHLAMINI: 
 
 
Can 
you 
repeat 
your 
question, 
Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you accept the responsibility for not 
checking that that approval from Treasury was obtained 
because it was your responsibility as CFO to make sure 
that the SCM policy of the department was properly 
implemented. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   In this case, Chairperson, it is not 
a matter of getting an approval to Treasury, it is a matter of 
reporting that there is this incident in the department 
10 
where we have deviated, so you place on records and you 
even give the record – it is not necessarily that you are 
seeking the approval of the Treasury, it is part of the things 
that you must report that has happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So but you take responsibility for the 
fact that that was not done? 
MS DHLAMINI:   No, I am taking the full responsibility that 
it was not done, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And you realise that it is – one 
20 
could interpret that as the project then, the money spent 
on the project, being irregular, fruitless and wasteful or 
irregular expenditure because you did not follow all the 
steps you were asked to follow in terms of the prescripts.  
Would that be irregular expenditure? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 205 of 270 
 
MS DHLAMINI:   No, this element would not cause 
irregular expenditure, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Why not, Ma’am? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Because it is not – what causes irregular 
expenditure is it you contract in a particular law, that 
reporting within 10 days, it is not in any law. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   It is in the practice notes.   You 
would agree with me? 
MS DHLAMINI:   [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   In fact it is practice - National 
10 
Treasury practice note 6 of 2007 and 2008. 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct, Chairperson, but it has to 
be reported under noncompliance not a contravention – 
contravening any particular law because the law we mean 
the Act that would have been gone through the parliament.  
That is what gives rise to irregular expenditure but the 
reporting issues, they are just to be reported under 
noncompliance, they do not cause irregular expenditure. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   That is fine, we will be taking a 
view when we make our submissions but it is good to hear 
20 
your view on whether it would or not constitute irregular 
expenditure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry …[intervenes] 
MS DHLAMINI:   Maybe I need to – maybe I need… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, continue? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 206 of 270 
 
MS DHLAMINI:   Maybe I need to indicate, Chairperson, 
that this matter of irregular expenditure, noncompliance, it 
was discussed at length in one of our CFO forum, to that 
extent, it is just that I do not have that document with me.  
To that extent we were given guidelines from National 
Treasury especially when you are dealing with financial 
statements to say what do you regard as noncompliance, 
what do you regard as contravention of the Act, of the law, 
which would give rise to irregular expenditure. 
 So I am confidently talking about this matter 
10 
because there was guidelines in that regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I would imagine that there is a 
reason why there is a provision or requirement that you 
should notify Treasury and if you do not notify Treasury 
you are in breach of that provision of the note but it seems 
that what you are saying is, if you are in breach of that 
provision 
of 
the 
note, 
that 
does 
not 
influence 
the 
expenditure 
to 
be 
irregular, 
what 
influences 
the 
expenditure to be irregular is if you are in breach of 
something of a higher legal status, then the Treasury note, 
20 
namely maybe a regulation or an Act of Parliament or 
maybe you are even saying as long as what you have 
breached is not an Act of Parliament, if it is a regulation, if 
it is a Treasury note, that does not affect – that will not 
make the expenditure to be irregular.  Is that what you are 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 207 of 270 
 
saying? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja,  Well, I guess the legal attorney, we 
will look at that. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   We will make submissions on that, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Chairman, unless you have any 
other questions, I would like to move on to the next section 
which is my penultimate section. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  There is one which I 
think we should deal with but maybe that you plan to deal 
with it later.  Ms Dhlamini earlier on seemed to want to 
deal with it, namely the question whether what they were 
doing in terms of – was it the implementing agent issue? 
Whether that was getting services, obtaining services?  
Maybe I should ask.  You remember you have made the 
point in your affidavit that when Mr Thabethe came to you 
with the first contract which talked about services you said 
no, you did not go along and when he came back with 
20 
another one which I think said partnership or something 
like that, you had no problem, you remember that? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Gcabashe is that something you want 
to deal with later, that justification or whatever that she 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 208 of 270 
 
wants to…[intervenes]. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Yes, it arises in a very narrow 
sense, Chairman, when we deal with the agreements that 
were 
signed. 
 
Ms 
Dhlamini 
has 
talked 
about 
three 
agreements and as you point out, we know of two but that 
area is part of what I was going to explore under the Anna 
Fourie interaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  And the basis on which they 
thought, they had a valid agreement 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m quite happy that we deal with it later 
but 
I 
was 
just 
concerned 
whether 
– 
unless 
I’ve 
misunderstood something in her affidavit, Ms Dhlamini, why 
you were going to this provision that we have just dealt 
with, if you thought that this transaction did not involve the 
procurement of goods and services or is there something I 
misunderstood about what you were saying? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That’s exactly what I said, Chairperson, 
to say, basically the arrangement between Estina and – 
Estina Paras and the Department was really a partnership 
20 
agreement where we are putting up a dairy and the 
Department provides the dairy parlour and Estina provides 
the processing plant.  That’s how I viewed it, that’s why I 
was saying to the Chairperson, I approved this division on 
that basis that it deals with investment and opportunities 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 209 of 270 
 
that the investment would come with 
CHAIRPERSON:   But my question is, why go to that 
provision that, as I understand it, deals with goods and 
services, obtaining goods and services if it’s got nothing to 
do with obtaining goods…[intervenes]. 
MS DHLAMINI:   I realise that I caused confusion by going 
to that particular practice note Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Not practice note, Treasury regulation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry just start that sentence fresh, 
10 
there’s something I missed. 
MS DHLAMINI:   I’m saying, Chairperson, I realised that by 
talking to that Treasury regulation, yes, I caused a 
confusion, when my view on the submission was on the 
issues around the investment and the partnership between 
the Department and Estina Paras. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you had raised this view much 
earlier that when this proposal was brought to you, isn’t it, 
or do I misunderstand you?  This was in, what is the date 
for this, it looks like there’s no date for this proposal of 
20 
deviation. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   The first one was the 26 t h of May, 
Chairman, 2012.  That’s the first one that did not have the 
deviation then the next one, I think, is the 5 t h of June 
2012. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 210 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one we’re looking at is at 1349, 
that’s the one we were looking at. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   The one that has the deviation in it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   That’s the one of June 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, did it come before those contracts 
that Mr Thabethe gave you? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   It came…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or it came after? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   In fact, the first contract, according 
10 
to Ms Dhlamini’s affidavit was signed on the 5 t h of June. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Then the second contract was 
signed on the 5 t h of June and the 7 t h of June, according to 
her and you correct me if I’m wrong.  Then the third one, 
Chairman, is the 5 t h of July, the one we had always thought 
was there and that’s the one that’s operative right now, 
was the second contract, so that’s really the third one, 
according to her records which is the 5 t h of July. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, in terms of sequence where would 
20 
this proposal fit in terms of those dates, in terms of those 
contracts Ms Dhlamini are you able to say, did it come 
before the contracts or it came after, this proposal for 
deviation? 
MS DHLAMINI:   This particular proposal for deviation 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 211 of 270 
 
came after two contracts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DHLAMINI:   There was – and the last contract, which 
is the contract that was implemented, that came after this 
particular deviation was – or this particular submission was 
approved. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so it came at a time when you had 
already formed a view that we are not here dealing with 
obtaining goods and services? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That was my understanding, Chairperson, 
10 
of – from the presentation, from the proposal that was 
presented to me, that was my understanding that we are 
not dealing with acquiring goods and services, hence when 
the first submission – the first contract came, where he 
asked me to witness it, I looked at the heading, even 
before I could get into the details, I looked at it and it said, 
provision for services.  I then said to him, if you’re dealing 
with provision, we must be clear, what is it that needs to 
happen.  If we are dealing with provision of services here, 
then you must advertise a tender.  Then – in any case, 
20 
actually that contract was already signed, so HOD was 
presenting it to me as part of, I think, management, so that 
I know that there’s that contract also but I couldn’t accept 
that because what – let me not say I couldn’t accept, what 
I said to him, I said, HOD if you are acquiring services 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 212 of 270 
 
here as the heading says, then you must advertise a 
tender.  Then he went back and he came back two days or 
a day or so later with the one that talks to partnership, 
which that one, that talks to partnership then was talking, 
really, to the first submission that was approved. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what I don’t understand is, having 
taken the view that we are not, in regard to this project, 
acquiring goods or services, therefore, Supply Chain 
Management policy doesn’t apply.  How it comes about, 
that, when this proposal is brought to you, you don’t adopt 
10 
that attitude, you go to a provision that deals with Supply 
Chain Management, acquiring goods and services and you 
look at that provision that we’ve dealt with and you say, 
this is the clause I’m using. 
MS DHLAMINI:   That’s why I’m saying, Chairperson,  
maybe I shouldn’t have referred to that submission – to 
that particular paragraph that deals with deviation because 
that has always been my attitude towards this project that, 
it’s not the acquisition of goods and services, this matter of 
deviation came with – came as an advice from the State 
20 
Law Advisors after reading all those contracts that we are 
having.  Hence, I think in Dr Masiteng’s affidavit or either 
transcripts, he also explained this thing.  There was the 
first submission that was written by him which did not have 
the deviation paragraph by then, because there was that 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 213 of 270 
 
advice from the State Law Advisors, through the HOD and I 
was in that meeting also, where they said there should be 
that deviation submission that HOD must approve that’s 
why HOD then said to Dr Masiteng, Dr Masiteng must 
include that deviation paragraph in the proposal and the 
recommendation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is my understanding correct, that you 
can’t explain how you applied a provision relating to 
obtaining goods and services in regard to a project in 
respect of which you had taken a clear position that it did 
10 
not involve acquiring goods and services, you are not able 
to explain, how it came about that you applied that 
provision, is that right? 
MS DHLAMINI:   To an extent, yes, Chairperson but I think 
again, where this provision applies and if you look at the 
Supply Chain Management policy and even that circular 
that I referred to, the impracticality part of it, it would then 
say e.g. I think that is where I was coming to, to say, for 
example if you say it’s impractical for example it should be 
like, its emergency or it’s a sole providing and all those but 
20 
my argument has been, it say, for example, which means 
the list is not closed, the list is open there might be other 
things that necessitate that you deviate and in this case, 
for me, what necessitated us to deviate is the element of 
the investment that Paras was bringing in this project. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 214 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it may be well that the two most 
senior – well, maybe I’m wrong, CFO – is CFO at DGG 
level? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson, it depends. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DHLAMINI:   But I’m at a DG – I was at a DGG level. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were at a DGG level, I mean, the 
two most senior – two of the most senior officials of the 
Department don’t appear to have been applying their minds 
properly in this case, Mr Thabethe and yourself in terms of 
10 
some of the issues that one would expect you to be able to 
explain very clearly.  The explanation you give here, seems 
to have some difficulties. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, obviously I have applied 
your mind in this submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You applied your mind? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, maybe we should take a short 
break, I see we are at four minutes past five.  Let’s talk 
about how far we are still going to go, I’m still able to sit 
20 
further, what’s your estimate of how much time we need? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Chairman we have just two 
principle issues to cover from the affidavit of Ms Dhlamini, 
the one is – MEC Zwane asking her to go and ask for the 
R34million and the other is really her interaction with Ms 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 215 of 270 
 
Fourie and tied to that of course was the State Law 
Advisor ’s criticism of the agreement that she calls the 
partnership agreement that they were then given.  Those 
are the principle issues, the other matters, Chairman, are 
matters that we have traversed with other witnesses.  I 
would take thirty to forty-five minutes…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Should be enough at least at the latest 6 
o’ clock we should be done? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   I believe so Chairman, then I think 
my colleague would just like to cross-examine, beg your 
10 
pardon, to re-examine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no…[intervenes]. 
ADV 
GCABASHE 
SC: 
 
 
On 
one 
or 
two 
matters 
but…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that’s fine we can still go on until, 
let’s say about quarter to six, 6 o’clock, is that right, okay, 
Ms Dhlamini is that fine? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That’s fine Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, we’re at five past five, I’m 
sorry let’s take about 15 minutes, let’s come back at twenty 
20 
past five, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us proceed.  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Chairman if I might just deal with 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 216 of 270 
 
the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   May I return your...[intervenes]  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Yes please Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you send me an invoice for it. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you very much.  Ms Dhlamini 
I think we should just tidy up your paragraph 9 onwards in 
the original affidavit of December 2019.  You will find that 
at Estina 01, page 18 and there you relate the events of 
the 15 t h of June.  Could you please just very briefly walk 
us through what happened then and you…[intervene]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry.     
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Chairman.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think my registrar was not listening to 
you Estina Bundle 01.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Bundle 01 and it is page 18, Estina 
01 page 18 it is paragraph 9 of Ms Dhlamini’s original 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Counsel for Ms Dhlamini do you have an 
estimate of how much time you might need for re-
examination?  Just switch on the mic.  
20 
ADV H KOOVERJIE:   Chair I do not think I will be longer 
than ten minutes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright thank you.    
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you Chair can we proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 217 of 270 
 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Ms Dhlamini you were going to 
explain what happened on the 15 t h of June and you know of 
course because you got the Rule 33 notice in relation to 
Ms Anna Fourie’s testimony that she says that you are the 
person who came to ask for the R30million to be paid to 
Estina on that particular day.  Please just explain your 
version of that day to the Chairman?  
MS DHLAMINI:   Thank you Chairperson.  Chairperson on 
the 15 t h of June 2012 in the afternoon I think it was after 2 
o’clock I received a call from MEC Zwane who was the 
10 
MEC 
for Agriculture 
and 
Rural 
Developments 
in 
the 
department and he asked me or he instructed me to go to a 
meeting to meet MEC Mohae who was the MEC for the 
Provincial Treasury.    
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Can I ask you just to pause there 
please Ms Dhlamini.  Was it usual for MEC Zwane to phone 
you and give you an instruction to go and speak to another 
MEC?  
MS DHLAMINI:   It was for the first time that happened.  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Please continue.  
20 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson we – my office was 30 
kilometres outside the town Bloemfontein and where MEC 
Mohae was he was in town and I was still in the office 
because it was on a Friday, it was still a working day.  So I 
left my office and I think I arrived at the hotel Anta Boga 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 218 of 270 
 
because MEC did indicate that MEC Mohae is at Anta Boga 
Hotel.  
          So I arrived at the hotel and on my arrival at the 
hotel I cannot remember who I asked but I asked – I 
indicated that I was looking for MEC Mohae and I was 
taken to a room in the same hotel.   
          Upon my arrival in that room I found a MEC Mohae, 
I found the then HOD for – we use to call him CEO for 
Treasury Mr Gomongwe.  There was Ms Fourie in the room, 
there was also Mr Mabisha in the room.         
10 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Before you proceed just clarify this 
did MEC Zwane tell you what you were going to discuss 
with MEC Mohae?   
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, he just said it is regarding the 
payment for Vrede Dairy.  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Was that it, no further explanation? 
MS DHLAMINI:   There was no further explanation.  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   You had no idea that you were 
going there to try and secure the payment of R30million on 
that day? 
20 
MS DHLAMINI:   I have no idea that I was going to secure 
but maybe let me explain first to say when he said it is with 
regard to the payment to Vrede Dairy who I knew we had 
already made a payment to Vrede Dairy.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   No, no you had not made a 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 219 of 270 
 
payment – unless I have misunderstood your affidavit.  You 
had made a payment request not a payment but if I have 
got it wrong please correct me Ms Dhlamini.   
MS DHLAMINI:   Let me correct you Chair let me correct 
advocate here.  Advocate when I say we had already made 
a payment when we say payment it is when it has already 
been processed in the department approved, captured in 
the system.   
          You have all those documents that I indicated 
earlier on because remember when we were dealing with 
10 
the payment, the certificate, ABCT.   
          Then 
that 
means 
payments 
is 
done 
in 
the 
department but there is still another leg which is the leg 
that I did explain to say if it is million and over it will have 
to go to Treasury to finalise that payment.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   But surely that is processing the 
payment it cannot be called the making of a payment.  
MS DHLAMINI:   Okay let me argue…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   All you had done is you had done your 
part of the processing of the payment.   
20 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  
MS DHLAMINI:   I agree with you.  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And let us just finish that last bit 
of, had you been directly involved in preparing the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 220 of 270 
 
documentation that was necessary to process that payment 
through Provincial Treasury? 
MS DHLAMINI:   The only paper that I have signed is the 
certificate but that certificate when it comes to me because 
I need to confirm certain activities, certain things.  It 
comes as a package of the whole payment.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And do you read that entire 
package? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, you will have to go through that 
entire package to check that the things that you are 
10 
confirming 
like 
the 
supporting 
documents 
is 
properly 
authorised.  You have to read the entire package before 
you sign that certificate.  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Do you keep a copy for your 
records? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I was not keeping copy for my records 
Chair because I had a finance unit so after I have signed it 
I would then take it to the finance unit which will then take 
it back to Treasury.  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So even in the finance unit you 
20 
would not keep a copy of what you were sending through to 
Treasury? 
MS DHLAMINI:   No they would keep that copy.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   They would in your finance unit 
make a copy and keep it and then send the original through 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 221 of 270 
 
to Provincial Treasury?  
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct Chairperson or otherwise I 
stand to be corrected in this fact whether we keep the 
originals and we send the copies to Treasury but either 
way it is either we left with the copy but the whole package 
would have been sent to Treasury.  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And all of this would be done 
without the HOD Mr Thabethe being involved at all? 
MS DHLAMINI:   After he has approved the payment yes all 
those things of course that you see in the system would 
10 
have been done outside the HOD.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Please continue so you then found 
MEC Mohae and other officials at the hotel.  
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, I then found MEC Mohae and other 
officials at the hotel and MEC Mohae then indicated to all 
the officials that they are there including myself that he 
had a discussion with MEC Zwane.    
          I may not say the exact words of how he put it but 
he indicated that there was a discussion between him and 
MEC Zwane where a payment that was supposed to have 
20 
been made for Vrede Dairy has not been made.   
          So the reason why I was – then he asked me do I 
know anything of that I said yes I am aware and the reason 
why it has not been paid it is because at the time when we 
processed that payment in the department we have not 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 222 of 270 
 
made a requisition, we did not have enough cash.  We had 
a budget but we did not have enough cash in the bank and 
normally the process would be at the point when you are 
confronted with that situation you write a submission to 
Treasury when you send it together with those documents 
that you requested that they increase your cash in your 
bank account.  Which means the bank account of the 
department.   
          That we had done I think by Wednesday I had 
already received the response from Treasury that they do 
10 
not have sufficient cash they cannot assist the department 
to finalise that payment.  
          Then I left it there I informed the HOD that that 
payment could not be finalised because there is no cash 
we will have to wait until the department have – when they 
submit the next Treasury requisition for the following week, 
then we would wait for that.  Then we will make provision 
in that, well in that – I think it is even the next month 
because we were submitting on a monthly basis.         
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Can you just help me understand 
20 
this please.  Had you budgeted for that R30million that you 
were requesting and if so where were you getting it from or 
were you planning on finding some other means of 
collecting that money?  Just clarify that one point.   
MS DHLAMINI:   I cannot remember – I am not sure if 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 223 of 270 
 
Chairperson would remember when we were dealing with 
the R30million I have indicated that reprioritisation was 
made.  When we had only R9million reprioritisation was 
made and then R21million was found and the budget was 
then allocated properly, it was taken from other projects 
into that particular project.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So the R21million came from other 
projects?  
MS DHLAMINI:   Other projects.  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Under Mohuma Mobung.  
10 
MS DHLAMINI:   Under - you know Chairperson it is 
difficult to say under Mohuma Mobung because there were 
other projects, let me say yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There were other projects under the 
department…[intervene]  
MS DHLAMINI:   Because actually what I want to say is we 
had a list of projects…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on Ms Dhlamini we 
cannot all talk at the same time.   
MS DHLAMINI:   Oh we had a list of projects in terms of 
20 
Table B5 of the budget which was part of the projects.  So 
mostly the projects that fell under Mohuma Mobung were 
high impact projects but you had other projects small 
projects.  So moneys were taken from those projects and 
we take them to Vrede Dairy that is what we call 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 224 of 270 
 
reprioritisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I had not understood you earlier to say 
reprioritisation happened before the R30million was paid.  I 
have not understood you to be saying that but is that what 
you are saying now?        
MS DHLAMINI:   That is what I am saying because if that 
reprioritisation did not happen before the system would not 
have processed that budget.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  
MS DHLAMINI:   And even where myself as the CFO I 
10 
would have caused unauthorised expenditure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that is alright.  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   But again, can you explain to the 
Chairman how the R30million that you had budgeted for 
could be converted into cash because you are now asking 
for a cash cheque on the version of Ms Anna Fourie? 
MS DHLAMINI:   It would be converted into cash not a 
cheque cash but a transfer from a bank account, the 
department’s bank account into Estina’s bank account, 
which is the intended payment.  The payment was for 
20 
Estina.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think Ms Gcabashe’s question is 
before you can transfer money from your accounts as the 
department into Estina’s accounts there must be cash in 
the account.   
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 225 of 270 
 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, there must be cash that is the cash 
that I said we have made a submission to Treasury when 
we were sending, those payments – those documents that 
we have processed that accompanied that payment.  We 
have made a request; we call it cash requisition.  In this 
case we were requesting them to increase our cash so that 
the cash in our bank can be able to accommodate that 
particular transaction.    
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Now when had you indicated to 
them that you would require this cash to be in your bank 
10 
and when you say your bank you mean in the departments 
bank so that the department could then do the transfer.  
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, I mean the bank account of the 
department.  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   When did you ask them to make 
sure it would be available in the department’s bank 
account? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Hence I said Chairperson we made the 
request. The request was not approved and when the 
request was not approved Treasury could not process that 
20 
payment because there was no cash in the bank.  
ADV GCABASHE SC:   The question though is what did 
you say to them when you requisitioned the cash?  Did you 
say to them we would like that cash to be in our bank 
account on or before the 15 t h of June 2012?  I do not know 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 226 of 270 
 
I am asking the question.  
MS DHLAMINI:   No you would not say that Chairperson 
because the payment was done on a Monday.  We got the 
other documents that accompanied that payments on a 
Tuesday then we sent them to Treasury that is when we 
ask for cash requisition.  That cash if it is approved it 
would have been made available on a Thursday because on 
a Thursday that is the day that Treasury process all those 
payments that are above a million.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So what you are saying is when you 
10 
send to Treasury various documents which I take to have 
included the certificate of confirmation that you signed.   
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you send those documents 
included in those documents was a request from your 
department to Treasury to say in order for this payment to 
go through, we request you to give us more cash into our 
account.  Is that right?    
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And you appreciated that if Treasury did 
20 
not approve then there would be no payment.   
MS DHLAMINI:   I appreciated that Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And in asking for that cash did you 
explain to Treasury that they should take that money from 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 227 of 270 
 
budget item X which is where you say you had hoped to 
find this money.  Did they know where it would come from? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson it is a different process all 
together it does not deal with the budget what advocate is 
talking about is the budget.  The cash must come from – 
maybe I must, I should have explained that how the 
configuration of the bank account of provinces.  There is 
what we call the revenue fund, that is where all the monies 
that came from National Treasury even from national 
departments your conditional grants, they all get into the 
10 
revenue fund of the department of the…[intervene]     
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Of the province.  
MS DHLAMINI:   Of the province which is administered 
by…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Treasury.   
MS DHLAMINI:   The Treasury.  For you to spend your 
budget you need cash.  You would have your own bank 
account which we call PMG account.  The department will 
have that but it does not necessarily mean when you have 
R500million budget it is already a cash in your bank.  For 
20 
you to access your cash you will need to give Treasury 
your cash projections.   
          How are you going to need that on a monthly basis 
but you would indicate it on a weekly basis.  Say week 1, I 
need R5million, week 2, I need - of a particular month.  For 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 228 of 270 
 
the whole month maybe, I need R30million that is what 
happens.   
          So it has got nothing to do with the budget and 
where the budget would come that process is the process 
that happens in a department and by the time the 
documents goes to Treasury that process is concluded 
hence 
the 
payment 
could 
be 
processed 
within 
the 
department.       
ADV GCABASHE SC:   We will continue because we know 
that when Ms Fourie was here, she explained that there is 
10 
a process even in requisitioning for cash and your correct 
cash then would normally be paid out on Thursdays.  She 
went through that in her evidence.   
          But she also went on to say that when you arrived 
there was of course a discussion, you had to go to the 
Treasury offices and when she checked you required the 
payment of R30million, cash of R30million in the provincial 
revenue account there was only 5 or R6million and she 
then told you that they did not have any cash in that 
revenue account.  Is this correct?   
20 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is not correct Chairperson because it 
was not in Ms Fourie’s responsibility.  All this documents 
and the cash requisition went to another unit in Treasury 
that we call assets and liability.  Which is the unit that was, 
the head – Mr Mabisha was the head because the official 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 229 of 270 
 
there has resigned.   
          So it was not in Ms Fourie’s responsibility so she 
would not have told me unless she would have asked the 
officials 
in 
assets 
and 
liabilities 
specifically 
cash 
management if there is money in the bank account.  If the 
revenue fund has money but as I have indicated they had 
already indicated to me that there is not sufficient cash 
that they can transfer into the account of the department 
which I accepted and appreciated.   
          Although I did not ask how much because it was not 
10 
of my interest to know how much they still have that would 
be uncalled for, for me to ask them how much do you have.  
No, I accepted the fact that they explained to me that the 
cash is not there and maybe Chairperson I need also to 
indicate that in my career I did work in that unit in the 
Provincial Treasury of Limpopo.   
          So I knew exactly when they say the cash is not 
there, I knew exactly what it would take for them to have 
that cash in the revenue fund so that they can transfer into 
the PMG account of the department.  Hence, I accepted 
20 
when they told me that they do not have cash.          
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So who exactly told you that there 
was no cash? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson I may not be able to answer 
that question now because it is something that is written.  
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 230 of 270 
 
You made that submission in writing and it goes through 
the channels but when it comes back sometimes it does not 
even come directly to the CFO it would come to the unit in 
finance and they would inform me as the CFO those 
officials who works with me, who works under me, who 
process the payments.  They would have told me that 
Treasury has replied and indicated that there is no cash.     
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So Ms Dhlamini why were you 
meeting Mr Mohae, why were you talking at all to Ms Anna 
Fourie and the other officials? 
10 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson as I have indicated I was 
sent by MEC Zwane to go to the meeting.  So and he just 
said it is connection with the Vrede Dairy payment.  So I 
went to the meeting to listen what is it that – what MEC 
has discussed with MEC Mohae.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh you had already been told, you were 
already aware that Treasury said that there was no cash at 
the time when MEC Zwane asked you to go to that 
meeting?   
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay.   
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And so you then did what? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Then I arrived at the meeting, then MEC 
Mohae explained why I am there it is as a result of his 
discussion and MEC Zwane’s discussion.  Then MEC 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 231 of 270 
 
Mohae asked me around the issues of the budget and do 
we have a budget for this.   
          There was a couple of things I may not remember 
them from the top of my head and I explained everything.  
Whatever that he asked me I answered and he then said to 
the officials is there any other thing that you want to ask 
the CFO, nobody asked me anything.  And then he further 
says CEO is there any reason why you cannot assist the 
department, right.   
          I have already explained even to him why Treasury 
10 
could not process that payment that they have indicated to 
us as a department that they do not have the cash in the 
bank.  But he then asked the CEO if there is anything – if 
they cannot still not assist the department.   
          That is where Ms Fourie came in.  I do not know 
what was in her mind.  She then said to CEO, CEO we can 
look at this matter provided we go to the office, the CFO 
signs a certificate that confirms that there is a budget and 
all those things.   
          But I have already signed that certificate that says 
20 
this payment would not post unauthorised expenditure.  By 
saying it will not post unauthorised expenditure it means 
the budget is there but she insisted, she indicated let me 
not say she insisted, she indicated that she would want to 
develop the certificate that I must sign.   
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 232 of 270 
 
          On that basis then the CEO said CFO, Ms Fourie, 
Mr Mabisha go back to the office and deal with this matter.  
By the time we left Anta Boga Chairperson it was already I 
am sure like 4 o’clock after four or just before four around 
that time because by the time we get to the offices there 
was nobody.  People have knocked off because in the 
provincial government we knock at 4 o’clock.  Myself and 
Anna Fourie, Ms Fourie may her soul rest in peace.  Myself 
and her we went to her office and Mr Mabisha] went to his 
office where Ms Fourie said go to the office and get all 
10 
those documents that CFO has already brought here.   
          We sat in Ms Fourie’s office waiting for Mr Mabisha 
to come with the documents.  Mr Mabisha did not pitch up 
Chairperson.  After a long time, I said and Ms Fourie is 
also not developing the certificate that I would not even 
know what was really was – what was going to be the 
content because it was her who was going to develop that 
certificate. 
          So we sat in her office she is not developing the 
certificate, we waiting for Mr Mabisha, Mr Mabisha is not 
20 
coming. After 
some 
time 
and 
it 
is 
substantial 
time 
Chairperson, I then said to Ms Fourie I think that Mr 
Mabisha is not coming but honestly it is Friday and I have 
other things, I am leaving because indeed I had already 
packed my bag I was going to go home.  
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 233 of 270 
 
          I was on the N1; my office was on the N1 so from 
there 4 o’clock I was going to go home so I had to come 
back to town.  So when Mr Mabisha is not coming fourth, I 
decided to say I am leaving because I still have my other 
things and then I left.  I did not even have a handbag 
Chairperson when I went there if my memory serves me 
well I just went as I was. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Now I must say Ms Dhlamini that 
the version that Ms Fourie gave to the commission is 
consistent with the version that she gave to the police 
10 
investigators when this particular matter came up for 
hearing in relation I think to the NDPP case.   
          All I am saying to you essentially is she has given 
two consistent versions of what happened on that day and I 
suppose my question to you is are you saying that we 
should accept your version because both versions that she 
gave one much earlier than the one she gave here last 
year are incorrect.                          
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson I would say Ms Fourie did not 
give – Ms Fourie did not give constant versions because if 
20 
she had given constant versions in the ENS report, I went 
through the ENS report with my legal team, she started 
where I have started, where she indicated that MEC Zwane 
said I went to the meeting and then we met with MEC 
Mohae, but at the commission she did not say that.  
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 234 of 270 
 
 
I also went through the transcripts because that was 
not in her – in her affidavit.  He said it in his interaction with 
the commission.  She did not start that – that – she is not 
that pro – she did not start that process at the point where 
we met with the MEC.  Which is one of the things that made 
me a little bit angry with her to say, why was she not telling 
the entire truth of what has happened? Because she – she 
displayed me as this bully or this powerful person who came 
to the meeting and take them out of the meeting. That is how 
she displayed this whole matter at this commission.  And 
10 
certain things that she talked about that I requested the R5 
million; I said – or they offered me to give me R5 million 
cheque and I said I do not want it it is R30 million or nothing.  
There is no such a thing Chairperson.  It is even not 
possible.  You can call any CFO we will tell you it is not 
possible to even get – it is not even easy to get a cheque of 
R10.00.  So honestly, I do not know where she got all those 
things.  And like I am saying I went there knowing exactly 
that the unit that this we have cashed has already indicated 
that there is no cash.  So if you know and we are sent back 
20 
to the office I was still surprised what they are going to do.  
So – but like I am saying I would not know how much they 
have in their bank account.  So I – I do not agree with what 
she said at this commission. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  If I might just say that I – I have here 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 235 of 270 
 
statement that she made in 2017 which is the statement she 
made to the police which she then spoke to when she came 
to the commission.  And in that statement, she does say 
something you dispute in your affidavit that at the office you 
produced the contract between the Free State Department of 
Agriculture and Estina as well as a payment document 
request from Free State Department of Agriculture for an 
amount of R30 million.  The documents were assessed and 
certain questions were asked to the CFO which some of 
those questions were related to the contract produced by the 
10 
CFO.  She was unable to answer satisfactorily.  You are 
saying this is incorrect? 
MS DHLAMINI:  This is so much incorrect Chairperson 
because by the time I went to the meeting the documents I 
did not come carrying documents.  The documents were 
already in Treasury.  I had already known that there is no 
money.  So it is not correct.  If she had got hold of those 
documents she might have requested it from the unit that 
was dealing with cash.  She did not get those documents 
from me.  And hence we could not me and her could not do 
20 
anything on that particular Friday because we are waiting for 
Mr Mabija to bring the documents.  Thank you Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Anyway that – that deals with your 
version of what happened on that day and I have put the 
version of Ms Anna Fourie to you.  Can I just wrap this up by 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 236 of 270 
 
asking?  You then say that you briefed Mr Zwane on the 
outcome of that meeting, is that correct? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Yes I did Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Why did you brief Mr Zwane and not 
the HOD? 
MS DHLAMINI:  I was not briefing Mr Zwane I was giving 
feedback because he has sent me.  Common cause said if 
you send somebody somewhere to do something he must 
give feedback.  It was on those basis that – that was on 
those basis that I have given him the feedback because I 
10 
was sent by him not the HOD.  The HOD was already aware.  
At the time when Treasury indicated to us Chairperson, I am 
sorry Chairperson by addressing Advocate.  At the time when 
Treasury responded to us to say there will not be cash, I 
immediately informed the HOD that this payment would not 
go through. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  You see your report gives one the 
impression that Mr Zwane was getting involved in the 
implementation of the Vrede Dairy Project.  And yet in his 
affidavit he disavows or he says he had nothing to do with 
20 
the implementation of the Vrede Dairy Project.  Would you 
agree however that where he instructs you to go and make 
sure that money is paid or to go and try and secure funds to 
be paid to Estina he is now stepping out of his political MEC 
arena and stepping into the administration – into operational 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 237 of 270 
 
matters that deal with implementing the project? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Chairperson I – I do not know whether I 
should answer that question to say he was – he was getting 
into implementation.  But does the facts that happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Well maybe you want to ask this 
question?  You would be aware would you not be of whether 
the political head of the department namely the MEC can get 
involved in operational matters as opposed to being involved 
in policy formulation and such matters?  Would you know 
whether he can come in – in the department and say, and 
10 
start getting involved in basically operational matters? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Chairperson it – it will depend at what level.  
But like in this case he is saying go to the meeting.  That he 
can do. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Hm.  I am sorry what did you say? 
MS DHLAMINI:  I am saying in this case he sent me to a 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS DHLAMINI:  And I am not sure if that is regarded as part 
of operational because the meeting was between him and the 
20 
other political – political head. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no but the question is at a general level 
at this stage according to your knowledge is an MEC 
supposed to be involved in the operational matters of the 
department? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 238 of 270 
 
MS DHLAMINI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or is that something you do not know? 
MS DHLAMINI:  No he is not supposed to except giving 
strategic direction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DHLAMINI:  And a political direction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Then there are just one or two small 
little issues I want to raise with you.  You know Mr Cele 
10 
when he was here gave evidence and I know it is in the ENS 
investigation report as well that when he came to see you at 
your offices as part of that investigation team you warned 
him and said he should be careful in the Free State.  He will 
be killed.  And in Sotho something along the lines that 
[African language] or something along those lines.  Do you 
recall saying that to him?  Warning him really.  It sounded 
like a friendly warning. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Chairperson I do not remember saying that 
to Mr Cele and I would say I am – I would not even have said 
20 
that.  If I said that I would have said it in English because 
since I have been engaging with Mr Cele I was of the 
impression that he does not even understand the Sotho so it 
was impossible that I would give him a warning in the 
language that he would not understand.  Thank you. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 239 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you saying you do not remember 
giving him that warning if it was a warning or are you saying 
you do remember that you never gave him such a warning 
and therefore you deny his evidence that you gave him that 
warning? 
MS DHLAMINI:  I deny his evidence.  No I cannot deny his 
evidence because it is his evidence. But my version of the 
story is I did not warn Mr Cele of any Basotho [African 
language].  I have not said that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say it in English? 
10 
MS DHLAMINI:  I did not say it in English.  I did not say it in 
Sesotho.  I did not warn – I did not even give any warning to 
Mr Cele.  The only thing that I know I have said to Mr Cele – 
Mr Cele came to me with a letter from National Treasury that 
was informing the department written to the Accounting 
Officer informing the department of the investigation just 
going to – that National Treasury is intending to do.  All what 
I said to him I said – he gave me – I said okay I can accept 
the copy but you must know the protocol.  You must go to the 
HOD.  That is all – the only thing I said to him is to say, take 
20 
this thing to the HOD. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So you saying Mr Cele just made this 
evidence up that this is what you told him? 
MS DHLAMINI:  I do not know where he got it Chairperson.  I 
did not say it. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 240 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Ms Gcabashe. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  I also then 
want you to confirm that when – you have referred to the 
first agreement with Estina – service agreement or provision 
of services.  You have referred to the second agreement 
which you yourself call a partnership agreement.  I – I will – 
the Chairman has dealt with the first one can I just say in 
respect of the second one – you accept that the state law 
advisors were given a copy of the second agreement?  Anna 
Fourie’s evidence was that they got it from Provincial 
10 
Treasury and that that agreement was found to be invalid.  
You accept that?  There are two propositions so make sure 
you want to accept both. 
MS DHLAMINI:  I accept that Chairperson that after the state 
law advisors engaged with the second affidavit they then 
advised the department that it is not – or they – I cannot 
remember whether they said it is not valid but they then 
proposed to assist drafting a better affidavit because… 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Agreement. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Agreement yes agreement – agreement 
20 
Chairperson because their even – their main – main concern 
was the first one was not even really looking after the 
interest of the department. Which I accepted because there 
are better positions the legal people who can do that. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  You had not come to that conclusion 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 241 of 270 
 
prior to the state law advisors telling you that? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Honestly speaking I have not come to that 
conclusion at that point in time. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  And just for the record Mr Venter 
gave evidence here and he said they had not seen the first 
agreement or the second agreement before the 18 June 
2012.  You would accept that? 
MS DHLAMINI:  That is correct. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Then the last item I think I want to 
ask you about is the following.  You know when – when Ms 
10 
Mchiza was here she told us that when this – the bad press 
around the Vrede Dairy Farm came through the media one of 
things they did was go to the Dairy Farm go and visit.  Did 
you ever go representing the department to go and find out 
what it was that people were complaining about?  Whether 
there was something the department needs to do about this 
contract, this agreement you had with Estina? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Chairperson on my own I had not gone to 
the Vrede Dairy and the reason being I think it is because of 
the kind of – the volume of the work that I was dealing with.  
20 
Because if my memory serves me well when these things 
came, we were busy with the adjustment budget.  We were 
busy with the [00:44:55] hearings.  There were a couple of 
things that CFO had to deal – had to deal with so on my own 
I did not have time at that point to go to Vrede Dairy. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 242 of 270 
 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  The – in the evidence of Ms Rockman 
as well she explained that Provincial Treasury also got very 
worried when all this bad press about the Vrede Dairy 
operations became topical.  They too took more than one 
visit to go and establish what monies were in fact being used 
for the right reasons.  Again it is another unit that took the 
trouble of going to the Dairy Farm to try and find out if 
government’s money was being spent for the intended 
purpose.  You confirm that you did not do – do that? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Chairperson I confirm that I did not do that 
10 
due to the volume of my work. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  Ms Dhlamini those are the principle 
issues that we as evidence leaders had wanted to raise with 
you.  There may be other matters you want to bring to the 
attention of the Chairman because in your paragraph 13 on 
page – Estina 01 page 56 you say that you are aware that 
there may be other aspects which you have not dealt with in 
your affidavit of course and you will address the commission 
on those aspects to the extent that you have knowledge of 
those aspects.  This is just an opportunity to – we are giving 
20 
to you in case there are important matters that you would 
have preferred to raise here that you do in fact want to raise. 
MS DHLAMINI:  Thank you Chairperson.  The only aspect 
that I may not have dealt with is even if I did not go to Vrede 
Dairy at that point in time when there was all those articles – 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 243 of 270 
 
media articles and all that but subsequent to that I did go to 
Vrede Dairy with the delegation from National Treasury.  I 
did go to Vrede Dairy accompanying our MEC – MEC Mamiki 
Qabathe then when he has just joined the department when 
she was taking a trip through all the projects.  So all what I 
am saying is even if I did not go at that point in time but at a 
particular point in time, I did went to the Vrede Dairy and see 
the project. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  The – the issue is you are aware that 
the beneficiaries who were supposed to benefit from this 
10 
project have not had any value at all from even that indirect 
association with the Dairy Project you are aware of that? 
MS DHLAMINI:  I am aware of that Chairperson that they 
have not benefited yes. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  And you are aware of the fact that 
when you started working on this particular project and you 
brought in an implementing agent the idea was that there 
would be beneficiaries who would benefit? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:  But not one cent of the monies that 
20 
government has spent on this project has benefited any of 
those people who are on those beneficiary lists? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Chairperson the reason that I am saying I 
am aware they have not benefited because at that point 
when I leave the department the project has not come to its 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 244 of 270 
 
logical conclusion.  And I can only suspect that after the 
project would have been precluded – completed properly 
they would then have started to reap the benefit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When did you leave the department? 
MS DHLAMINI:  I left the department in 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Would you not have continued to be 
aware even if not in detail about what was happening in your 
previous department about a project that you were so 
involved in? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Chairperson I really did not follow up to say 
10 
how – after Estina pulled out of the project I did not – or 
really – I am not aware how would the department is 
intending to bring back the beneficiary.  But I still believe 
that at the ultimate end when they have got it right it is going 
to be handed over to the beneficiaries.  Because it cannot be 
owned by – it cannot be owned by the – by the department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us go back to that issue that you had 
raised about Estina or about implementing agents when you 
said that – when you involve an implementing agent that is 
not obtaining services or obtaining good.  You remember that 
20 
issue?  Do you remember that issue? 
MS DHLAMINI:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Just so that we are on the same 
page.  As I understood you you were saying where the 
department would involve an implementing agent there is no 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 245 of 270 
 
need to involve the Supply Chain Management Policy 
because the department is not offering goods or services, is 
that right?  Was my understanding of what you – of the point 
you were making correct? 
MS DHLAMINI:  No Chairperson there is implementing 
agents that we appointed through a proper process of Supply 
Chain where we advertised the tenders. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS DHLAMINI:   But in this particular project with regards to 
Estina, hence I have been emphasising the fact that from the 
10 
point of view and my understanding of this project, this 
project was not supposed to be a relationship of an 
implementing agent but was supposed to be a partnership 
between the department and Paras Estina in putting up the 
dairy, the Vrede Dairy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let me make sure I understand.  You 
are 
saying 
that 
where 
the 
department 
brings 
in 
an 
implementing agent, that does not exempt the department 
from complying from its supply chain management policy.  Is 
that right? 
20 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is what I am saying, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  In this case, I thought that is what 
you were saying.  So what are you saying as to why supply 
chain management policy was not applicable as far as you 
are concerned? 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 246 of 270 
 
MS DHLAMINI:   In this case it is because Chairperson, this 
partner, this arrangement was supposed to be a partnership 
arrangement because they were going to invest money and 
we are going to put up... they are going to put up the 
processing plant and we are going up to put the dairy 
parlour. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS DHLAMINI:   So it really was a partnership agreement 
than an implementing agent.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But if I recall correctly from what Ms 
10 
Gcabashe was saying earlier on, was Estina not appointed 
as an implementing agent? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is what the contract say but 
Chairperson you will remember that I had referred to the first 
contract that HOD brought to me which the contract then 
said they require... it was saying provision of service which I 
advised him to say if it is a provision of service it becomes... 
it must be a tender process.   
 
And I am still saying, even now that I did not look at the 
arrangement as Estina providing service to the department  I 
20 
saw it as a partnership.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but the ultimate contract that was 
signed ...[intervenes]  
MS DHLAMINI:   The ultimate contract that was signed said 
implementing agent and HOD, sign it as is. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 247 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And ...[intervenes]  
MS DHLAMINI:   And that is despite that I have already 
warned him or advised him of the ... with the first contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But before it was signed, you said it is... 
you went along with the contract, is not it, when the last 
contract was brought?  You had no problems with it. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Unfortunately, he brought it to me already 
signed.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but that would not have prevented 
you from saying:  But I see this is a... you are appointing this 
10 
entity as an implementing agent that still brings in the supply 
chain management policy.  Even if he had signed, you could 
still state that position to say it is wrong.  If you are 
appointing them as implementing agents, then the supply 
chain management policy applies.   
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, you will remember I referred 
to two submissions that Dr Masiteng did which the first one 
did not have a clause of deviation which that clause really 
seeks 
to... 
that 
clause 
really 
seeks 
to 
address 
that 
implementing agent part of it.   
20 
 
And HOD refused to take that and then they insisted on 
the second one that has got the deviation.  But I have been 
very clear in myself that I do not see this thing as an 
implementing agent thing.  I see it as a partnership 
agreement.   
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 248 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but my questions is.  When the last 
contract was brought to you by the HOD and you realised 
that it referred to Estina being appointed as an implementing 
agent, one would have expected you to say but HOD, I have 
already told you that as far as I am concerned, you cannot 
appoint Estina as an implementing agent without following 
the supply chain management policy.   
 
As far as I am concerned, it is a partnership.  Therefore, 
if you are going to do this, you must know you are doing it 
on your own part.  As far as I am concerned, the contract 
10 
should not be appointing Estina as an implementing agent. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, I did not follow that matter.  I 
did not have that matter further because I had already 
spoken to HOD about that matter and made myself very clear 
from the onset.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. Anything further? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   No, Chairman.  Thank you very 
much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Nothing.  Yes.  Counsel for Ms Dhlamini, 
do you want to re-examine?  They will sanitise the podium 
20 
before you do so.   
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   Good afternoon, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Good afternoon.   
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   Chair, I just want to place 
my name on record.   
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 249 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, please.  Actually, I remember.  I think 
long afterwards started that we should have allowed you to 
place yourselves on record in the morning. 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   No.  Thank you, Chair.  It is 
Harshila Kooverjie and I am here together with my two junior, 
Mr Makhlashe.  Sorry, Chair  I just have a problem with 
pronunciation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   Chair, firstly before we start, 
we would like to on behalf of Ms Dhlamini, thank you for  
10 
your indulgence so that we could be here today and that she 
could assist the Commission properly prepared.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   She also, in order to 
expedite my questions to her which are very limited, they 
concern only the supplementary affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   I would like to ask the 
evidence team just to help me with the paginated pages 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   ...because I do not have 
your paginated pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   So when I refer to an 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 250 of 270 
 
annexure for a section of the affidavit, they can... it will be 
for ease of reference to immediately go there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  I think somebody in the 
legal team, when you indicate what paragraph or whatever, 
then they will indicate what page of the paginated bundle 
that would be.   
RE-EXAMINATION BY ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   Thank 
you, Chair.  Ms Dhlamini, I am just going to touch a little bit 
on your role in the context of this project.  And in that 
regard, I would like to touch a little bit on the budget and 
10 
then on the payments.   
 
I think you have covered all the other aspects.  And if 
there is anything else you would like raise in addition to that, 
I think you may do that.   
 
But this purpose of this exercise is just to clarify some 
of the issues that you have explained to the Chair or that 
some of the questions that have been asked by the evidence 
leader.   
 
I think the first document I want to refer you to is 
Annexure S13 which is the submission.  The submission to 
20 
accept the proposal from Estina with regard to the Vrede 
Integrated Dairy Project.  Page 313.   
 
No.  Sorry, Chair.  Actually, the submission that is 
attached to S13, it is I think six pages towards... from the 
end.  Sorry, I do apologise.  It is not the first page.   
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 251 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the one at page 318? 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is written Chief Director District 
Services? 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Dated 26 May 2012.   
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   Yes.  And Chair, I think it 
is... is it Exhibit HH16?  It is in the bundle.  The affidavit is 
H. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you tell me the date of the submission.  
10 
It is 26... the one I am looking at is 26 May 2012 and it starts 
with subject to accept the proposal from Estina.   
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   Yes, Chair.  That is the one.  
And I see your pledges... can I give you the last three digits?  
It is page 280 in red or do you want the one in black? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, the black one.  318. 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   318.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   Ms Dhlamini, yes I just want 
to ask you general questions around this specifically.  You 
20 
had already in your testimony... I just want her to find the 
document, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  It is page 318 of Estina Bundle 01. 
MS DHLAMINI:   I have got it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 252 of 270 
 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   This concerns the issue of 
the budget which you have already raised and it is the 
2012/2013 aspect for the reprioritisation.  This was a 
submission in that regard.  Is that correct? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct. 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   Ms Dhlamini, you have also 
mentioned that this was a budget that was managed by the 
Chief Director District Services.  Is that correct? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   You can look at the Chair 
10 
when you answer. 
MS DHLAMINI:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   Ms Dhlamini, the question 
that I actually wanted to get around you is.  Did you prepare 
the 
submission 
or 
were 
you 
part 
of 
preparing 
the 
submission? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I did not prepare the submission.  I was not 
part of the preparation of the submission. 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   You, however, recommended 
20 
it? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I, however, recommended it, Chairperson. 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   Yes.  Now when it came to 
the actual shifting of the grant funds, were you part of... or 
were you... or did you compile the shifting of the grant 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 253 of 270 
 
funds?  Because if we look at page 321 Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   Can you explain this 
document, Ms Dhlamini. 
MS DHLAMINI:   I have the document, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS DHLAMINI:   I was not part of this reprioritisation.  This 
document was not prepared by me. 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   What is this document, Ms 
Dhlamini? 
10 
MS DHLAMINI:   It is a request for the shift of grant funds.  
It was prepared by the Chief Director itself.  It was prepared 
in the Chief Director itself. 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   So it is the responsibility of 
the Chief Director to prepare the shifting of the budget? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, Chairperson because it is their budget.  
That is what... they manage it. 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   And there was also a 
reprioritisation of the funds which is not attached to this 
document.  You said in your earlier testimony that the HOD 
20 
said that he will reprioritise the budget.   
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct, Chairperson.  There was 
another document that was sent to Treasury where the 
projects were reprioritised.  I was also not part of that 
reprioritisation.  
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 254 of 270 
 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   So what was your role Ms 
Dhlamini then in respect of this submission in recommending 
it? 
MS DHLAMINI:   My role really is to look at, as I said, the 
financial 
implications 
and 
my 
recommendation 
would 
basically talk to issues of whether the budget would be there 
or the budget would not be there.   
 
And as HOD said, I will reprioritise, as I have explained 
Chair, whether indeed the department would be able with the 
reprioritisation, would be able to carry this project. 
10 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   Now Ms Dhlamini, just in 
order to understand the context within which you had 
prepared... with which you had a hand in the budget.  I would 
like to just refer you to the transfer policy which is on... I will 
get the relevant document and then I will refer back to the 
Chair and yourself to the document.   
MS DHLAMINI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   Yes, it starts at page 296.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   Ms Dhlamini, in your 
20 
affidavit as well... that is on page 296.  In your affidavit you 
said your role is secondary insofar as the monitoring of the 
project was concerned.  Now if we have regard to... Chair, I 
just want to get my passage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 255 of 270 
 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   If we regard to page 302.  
Ms Dhlamini, can you perhaps read Clause 5.5.5 and explain 
what you understand by that?  And your explanation should 
explain also to the Chair why you say your role was 
secondary.   
MS DHLAMINI:   Clause 5.5.5 of the transfer payment... 
policy for transfer payment.   
“The responsibility for the monitoring of the contract 
or agreement is the programme manager and the 
relevant District Director...” 
10 
 
What I understand by this Chairperson is, for instance 
this contract that we had with Estina, it would be monitored 
and managed by the programme manager and the relevant 
District Director which is the District Director in Thabo 
Mofutsanyana District because that is where the project was.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Monitoring in its context would mean after 
the contract has been concluded the monitoring would relate 
to the implementation of the contract.  Is that right? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV HARSHILA KOOVERJIE:   Now Ms Dhlamini, we are 
going to touch on the payment aspect and I think that is set 
out below on the same page under paragraph C and D.  I 
would like you to maybe just read that, not into the record or 
explain to the Chair what you understand by C and D and the 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 256 of 270 
 
role of you and the role of the programme manager.   
MS DHLAMINI:   The department... okay, it says here.   
“The department must comply with the following 
requirements 
prior 
to 
effecting 
payments 
to 
a 
qualifying institutions.   
 
C says that: 
“The relevant programme manager has authorised 
the payment thereof in terms of the appropriate 
allocation and according to financial delegation.   
 
D says that: 
10 
“The responsible manager authorising the payment: 
- 
Shall 
ensure 
that 
appropriate 
supporting 
information has been contained to satisfy himself or 
herself, 
- 
 That the transfer 
payment is 
valid, the 
amount is correct,  
- 
The condition and objective have been met, 
- 
The contract or agreement duly signed by all 
relevant 
parties 
and 
attached 
to 
the 
payment 
documents.   
20 
- 
The qualification institution is aware of the 
statutory and departmental criteria.   
- 
The institution has respect of the previous 
financial 
years 
assistance, 
complied 
with 
the 
statutory and departmental requirements.”   
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 257 of 270 
 
 
These two paragraphs Chairperson, they seek to say the 
programme manager ought to have talked to the entity where 
the money has been transferred and make them aware of 
certain things, certain of the responsibilities that they need 
to meet.   
 
And 
furthermore, 
like 
for 
instance 
when 
the 
payment comes, I may have checked, as I checked some 
payment.  As I indicated, some payment I have verified and 
checked but the primary responsibility for the validity 
whether it was for the – the money has been used for the 
10 
intended purpose and all those, rests with the programme 
manager and the relevant district director. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But would you not have a role being 
required to either receive reports insofar as the financial 
aspects are concerned with the project, received any 
reports on the financial aspects and also would you not be 
required to interrogate whether what – whether they were 
doing effective monitoring to make sure that taxpayers’ 
money is used properly and effectively? 
MS DHLAMINI:   The responsible manager ought to have 
20 
done all those things, Chairperson.  If there is any other 
thing unto - on the financials, he would then write to the 
CFO because they were supposed to give the CFO the 
report also.  So that is when they would then seek even my 
advice in dealing with those issues. 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 258 of 270 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but the question I am putting is, if 
they were supposed to write reports to you about those 
aspects it seems to me that if, for example, you were not 
getting reports, it would be incumbent open you to say 
where are the reports?  Or, if there was just silence, you 
would say hang on, you are supposed to be giving me 
reports, where are the reports?  Am I right? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, my take is, if there are 
silence it means they are happy with what they – or what 
they get over their monitoring, they do not have other – 
10 
they do not have issues that they want to raise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But would they not – ultimately, would 
somebody not ultimately report to you as CFO in terms of 
how the financial aspects in terms of implementation were 
going and if there was silence, would you not be saying but 
I cannot just be satisfied with silence, I need to get 
positive – reports that positively say A, B and C have been 
done so that I can have peace of mind that taxpayers’ 
money is being use properly? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, as I have indicated that I 
20 
would have taken it that they have engaged the reports 
that I would get from the Estina and they are happy with 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but they might be happy but are you 
not also supposed to be happy and can you be happy with 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 259 of 270 
 
silence?  I am thinking that at CFO level you are having 
oversight in the department with regard to the financial 
aspects of various projects.  I may be wrong but that is 
what I am having in mind and that it should not be enough 
for you to just sit back when there is silence but that you 
should be – you should sit back if you are receiving reports 
that give you peace of mind but not when there is silence 
because when there is silence something terrible could be 
happening with taxpayers’ money in the implementation of 
the projects. 
10 
MS DHLAMINI:   Chairperson, I concede on that fact that 
probably I should have not left them where there are 
silence, I should have asked them and pushed them to 
provide reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Dhlamini, 
just on this point, if I just read (c) and (d), what I do 
understand is that the responsible authorises the payment, 
am I correct? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct, Chair. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Okay, now earlier on you explained 
to the Chair regarding your role in when you verify the 
payments.  Can you give an explanation of what that 
means and maybe in doing so, you can relate to the 
certificate that you referred to which you would submit to 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 260 of 270 
 
Treasury.  Maybe before you do that, I would like to refer 
the Chair to that document in the event that you refer to it.  
It is annexure 13A but it is page 327, Chair.  So I think you 
need to explain firstly your role and what you understand 
in verifying and then you said that the certificate related to 
how you would then verify or it is a consequence of your 
verification. 
MS 
DHLAMINI: 
 
 
This 
certificate, 
Chairperson, 
my 
signature on the payment advice basically certifies these 
elements that are written here which elements include – 
10 
this expenditure would not – I think I did I did read it, the 
payments is that once duly – was duly authorised by 
mandated officials in the department, they payments are 
for expenditure incurred in accordance with the vote which 
is the Appropriation Act or setting off these payments will 
not result in unauthorised expenditure meaning there is a 
budget for this, expenditure was accurately and correctly 
allocated and that is under the correct budget allocation.  
That is basically when you capture it in the system, that is 
properly captured, and this payment is going against the 
20 
correct line item and payments against earmarked funding 
and conditional grants.  Yes, Chairperson, that is – that is 
basically what my signature seeks to say when I verify and 
check. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Again you also just explain – so 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 261 of 270 
 
what you are saying here is that what you confirmed and 
certified, what you verified was essentially what you would 
have confirmed and certified in this certificate, is that 
correct?  That is that the payments were authorised by the 
mandated officials? 
MS DHLAMINI:  That is correct, Chairperson. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   That means? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That means the person who authorised 
the payment has the correct financial delegation to can do 
that. 
10 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Now having said that, Ms Dhlamini, 
you 
also 
said 
something 
earlier 
to 
the 
Commission 
regarding that everyone has – that programme managers 
have their own budgets, that they have to deal with and 
plan.  What was the scope of your budget and you were 
responsible for specifically? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Yes, what I have explained, Chairperson, 
is the budget is divided into programmes.  I have my own 
budget and you would find it under programme one, 
administration.  When you go to details of that programme 
20 
you will find as financial management unit which is the 
entire finance department.  The budget that is sitting there 
is my overall and primary responsibility and you have – I 
would then have sub-programme managers who will also 
have the budget and my scope really was very small in that 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 262 of 270 
 
regard, because you would realise – I do not think we have 
ever even got to 50 million as a budget because basically 
it is salaries and running costs of the unit and if there is 
any major payment, it will be the payment that we make to 
the Auditor-General. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So that would be directly under 
your responsibility? 
MS DHLAMINI:   That would be directly under my 
responsibility, that will be the budget that I will – I can do 
shifting, move it, all these things that I was explaining, I 
10 
can reprioritise, I can authorise somebody to travel to 
Gauteng but I cannot authorise somebody in – in, for 
instance, Dr Matiseng’s unit to travel to Gauteng because 
then I will be giving – I will be authorising a spending in 
another programme which is not my responsibility. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So that then, in other words, I am 
now – that would now explain to the Chair your role that 
was secondary in this particular budget – this particular 
project insofar as budgeting is concerned and monitoring. 
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   The last question, Chair and Ms 
Dhlamini, concerns the issue of payments.  I am going to 
ask this very broadly because I may not – maybe I am – 
you have not explained this properly to the Chair and you 
can then just directly – you can deal with the issue in that 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 263 of 264 
 
regard. 
 
Were you the only one in the position of the CFO 
who would have verified the payments?  That is now the 
payments that we are talking about that you have attached 
to your supplementary affidavit and in respect of the Vrede 
Dairy Project? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I was not the only one who could do that.  
As I have indicated, Chair, the first payment, for instance, 
it was compiled by Alta – Mrs Meyer, and it was verified by 
the Acting Chief Director.  My secondary role that my 
10 
advocate is talking about is when I would be also re kind of 
checking by singing that certificate that goes to Treasury 
to make sure that we prevent unauthorised expenditure and 
the question she is asking is there are instances where I 
have verified and instances where I have checked and 
verified is instances where the payment was compiled by 
the highest official in the programme which is the – which 
will be in this instances Dr Matiseng because he cannot 
take that to a lower level, always the higher level will be 
the one that will check and verify. 
20 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   So would it be correct then to say – 
or maybe I will put the proposition to you, that was it a 
requirement 
that 
your 
verification 
as 
CFO 
was 
a 
requirement for the payment to be effected? 
MS DHLAMINI:   Not it was not necessarily a requirement 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 264 of 265 
 
that every payment must be verified and checked by the 
CFO. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   The last final question, Ms 
Dhlamini, I have referred to annexure 12.  Chair, it is page 
306. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you 306? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   306, yes. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Annexure? 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   12. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Is it not 303? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is 306. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Oh, 306, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Can you explain what this 
document is and what the effect of this document is?  It is 
not addressed to you, it does not have your name on, but 
you furnished it as part of your supplementary affidavit and 
gave an explanation. 
MS DHLAMINI:   This particular document, Chairperson, it 
is addressed from the office of the HOD, from the office 
20 
manager, office of the HOD, Mr Gama, is the one who 
signed, to the Acting – the A there stands for Acting.  The 
Acting General Manager Agricultural Development and 
Support and the Acting General Manager District Services.  
It says: 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 265 of 266 
 
“Colleagues, Vrede Integrated Dairy Project visit by 
Indian experts.  Following the presentation made by 
Paras and Estina (Pty) to the department, please 
note that the Indian delegation will be arriving in 
the 
country 
to 
visit 
the 
project 
on 
Thursday 
21/06/2012.  You are therefore expected to provide 
a detailed situational analysis of the project site 
including engineering support, irrigation, study soil 
testing, pasture location, climate and any other 
support required by the delegation.  You are further 
10 
requested to compose a team to assist the project 
led by Alta Meyer to be assisted by economists, 
engineers and other agricultural scientists relevant 
to the task.  Please coordinate with the district in 
terms of logistics and support needs.” 
So basically, Chairperson, it shows that I did not really 
have a role in this whole thing of Vrede Dairy except 
dealing with the budgets. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   You – there is a reference to Ms 
Alta Meyer, can you explain to the Chair what her position 
20 
is?  Her job description starts on the next part.  I do not 
expect you to read it, you can maybe explain it to the Chair 
maybe and it starts basically on page 308. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Ms Alta Meyer, Chairperson, was at that – 
was – or is appointed in the department as a project 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 266 of 267 
 
coordinator, so she coordinates projects in the district.  
That is her job.  What I am not sure of is – because at 
some point I am aware that she was Acting District 
Director.  I am not sure with regard to this submission or 
document on 306 whether it was in her capacity as the 
project coordinator, in her capacity as the Acting District 
Director but basically, she is the one who deals with 
projects in the district. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   And it includes the compliance with 
procedures, the policies, legislative prescripts and ensure 
10 
that effective management and information, marketing and 
reporting on all issues relating to projects is covered, am I 
correct?   
MS DHLAMINI:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Chair, I do not want to – wish to 
take this any further, I think I am done with my question, I 
would just like to ask Ms Dhlamini if there is anything that 
she might just want to just extend on this point or issue. 
MS DHLAMINI:   I think, Chair, my advocate has covered it 
sufficiently. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MS DHLAMINI:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV GCABASHE SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Just one last issue, Ms 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 267 of 268 
 
Dhlamini.  You know, that Friday when MEC Zwane asked 
you to go and meet with the MEC of Finance about that 
payment of R30 million, I think Ms Fourie or another 
witness did say that the whole thing seemed to be very 
urgent.  I certainly got the impression that there seemed to 
be some urgency that payment had to be done by – I do 
not know whether the following day or by Monday but there 
was something urgent.  Was that your impression at the 
time as well, that there was some urgency about this 
payment? 
10 
MS DHLAMINI:   Ja, Chairperson, as I have senses that 
because you would remember even in Moremi’s thing there 
has been to say certain things needs to happen otherwise 
Paras might pull out of the arrangement.  So I also thought 
as such that it is urgent so that the project can kick-start 
and the milestone will be achieved according to the 
timelines. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But why would Paras pull out if payment 
was not made within a few days, do you know? 
MS DHLAMINI:   I am just thinking of it, Chairperson, to 
20 
say because of the milestone.  As I have indicated, 
Chairperson, what I have explained to HOD, we might want 
to wait for a month for this payment to be processed 
because I would only accommodate it when I submit my 
monthly cash projections which would be around the 25 
02 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 259 
 
Page 268 of 269 
 
April month and it would then be paid in the first week of 
the new month.  Yes, Chairperson.

clarification.  You understand that?
