HEARING RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Good 
morning 
Ms 
Gcabashe, 
good 
morning 
everybody. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Good morning Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes I am Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Let us proceed. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Thank you.  Good morning again Mr Dhlamini, 
good morning Ma’am. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Good morning. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Mr Dhlamini we… 
CHAIRPERSON:  The oath, the oath that you took yesterday Mr 
Dhlamini continues to apply until you have finished your evidence. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Microphone. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  I confirm Your Worship. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Thank you.  We were actually on page 7 of 
your statement and we had dealt with most of what is in paragraph 25.  
But one aspect you had not dealt with was the very last sentence that 
deals with the sale of milk produced at the dairy farm.  Could you just 
speak to the issue very briefly thank you?   
20 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Correct indeed I would see the 
milk that is produced from the dairy farm.  It will be sold in the 
townships same street where I reside and there was also – I had a shop 
at Prinsloo Street in Vrede.  There was an Indian guy – an Indian shop 
there I would see them delivering milk there.  It will be sold from there.  
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 3 of 217 
 
As well as the cattle feed was – it was sold or sold there at 
Thembalihle Township as well.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Was is it about these activities that you want 
the Chairman to note?  What is your concern or what are you happy 
about in relation to these activities? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Regarding the activities of 
selling  
1.  The cow feed or fodder and the milk when they came to sell the 
food – the cow feed as well as the milk to us we questioned that 
as to how can you sell our – basically our products to us.  I mean 
10 
we are part of the dairy project ourselves and yet you are selling 
these things to us. 
2. We also heard that there is no money in the dairy product and we 
were wondering why we are not receiving any proceeds out of it 
or any money out the project because we were part of the project 
as well. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So the long and short of it is you were not 
sure that these were legitimate activities.  I am looking at the very last 
sentence of paragraph 26. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Correct it was not legitimate 
20 
activities because they were selling it – they were selling it at night. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And this was while the farm was under the 
management of the FDC? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Correct those were hired. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes.  Let us come to your – the concluding 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 4 of 217 
 
paragraphs Mr Dhlamini and 28 deals with your interaction with the 
Public Protector.  Please tell the Chairman about that? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Although I do not remember 
the day precisely as to what date it was but she phoned me and 
requested me to invite the other beneficiaries. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Who phoned you? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  I got a call from one of the 
employees in the Public Protector’s office.  She said she was working 
the Public Protector’s office.  She is the one who phoned me. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Was it the Pretoria office or the Provincial 
10 
office in Bloemfontein? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  From Pretoria. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes continue.  And this would roughly have 
been when? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  It was just recently when she 
took down our details. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Had there been no contact before 2018/2019?  
I am trying to interpret your Manje, Manje I am assuming you mean 
2018/2019? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that question is quite important because I 
20 
noted yesterday that when he was talking about 2015 he said Manje 
now. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  2018 she called me it was in 
November.  She informs them that they were coming.  That I must call 
the other people.  I then phoned the other people informing them about 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 5 of 217 
 
the visit of the Public Protector and then later she called me and she 
requested me to postpone the meeting. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  The Public Protector called you? 
INTERPRETER:  Sorry there is a last part that he said I did not get it. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Okay she said she requested 
me to postpone the meeting because she had a lot of work to do.  She 
was supposed to visit somewhere else. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And this is the Public Protector who was 
communicating this to you? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  2018 November.  That is 
10 
correct the call that I received in 2018 November it was the Public 
Protector herself. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Continue. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Okay the second time I then 
received a call from a person who is working from the office of the 
Public Protector informing me that I should invite the other people or 
the parties who are affected in this and she gave me the date as well.  
But we had a misunderstanding on the phone because I had a problem 
of using my phone contacting them.  So I raised this issue of not being 
happy using my phone to contact them. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Continue. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  We then had an agreement 
that they will pay back my airtime on their coming they will replace my 
airtime by buying it.  Okay so what happened is coming to the issue of 
the date now they wanted to relate – or to tell the people the date so 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 6 of 217 
 
they phoned people individually.  So these people that they were calling 
did not want to listen to them they said we do not know you, who are 
you?  We know Mr Dhlamini.  So they had to call me back to explain to 
them as to who are they and why they were calling them. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes did that meeting take place? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  That is correct the meeting did 
take place at Mhlabunzima Hall. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Do you recall when this year that meeting 
took place? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  When? 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  When? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Though I do not remember but 
it was this year.  She promised us that she will be back to us in three 
months’ time to give us a report back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Gcabashe do you want to do like yesterday give 
that spelling for Mhlabunzima Hall for the benefit of the transcribers? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Oh Chairman let me write it down.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I can give it 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Please do it Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  M for Mary H l a b u n z i m a.  Mhlabunzima. 
20 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Mhlabunzima Hall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe Mr Dhlamini can confirm if that is correct 
because he would know? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Correct Your Worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 7 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Thank you Chairman.  So back to paragraph 
28 and what you relating to the Chairman.  I see you mentioned here a 
May 2019 meeting but I do not want to confuse issues. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Can you just assist the Chairman in – and 
confirm whether that is the date on which you had this meeting or 
whether that is a different date? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  That is correct it is the date. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And who was present at that meeting? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Busisiwe Mkhwebane herself 
10 
was there and the others who are working with her.  There are many. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And from the community? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  All of the beneficiaries were 
present except the ones from Memel they were not there. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So the beneficiaries from Warden attended as 
well? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Correct Warden beneficiaries 
were present. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Continue I am looking at your statement, 
continue? 
20 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  I was the first one to be asked 
questions.  I was the first one – the first person that they spoke to 
asking me questions. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Was this in the open meeting now? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  That is correct it was inside 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 8 of 217 
 
the hall. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Continue. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Others did not speak to them 
in an open hall it was done within the hall but privately.  At or in 
conclusion of the meeting I thanked her and I also informed her of the 
fact that we were not trusted anymore that she will come back to us 
especially looking at the first report that she gave out we do not know 
how did she get to that because she did not consult us regarding the 
first report. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Are you talking about the final report that was 
10 
published in February of 2019?  I beg your pardon it is 2018. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us just go back to the question – to your answer 
to the question before this one.  I understood your answer to be that 
when you thanked her at the meeting you told her that you had come to 
a point where you did not trust her.  Is that what you are saying – you 
said or were you saying you did not trust that she would come back to 
you? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  I was saying I was not – I did 
not trust her anymore – her as a person. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us clarify that further.  Did you mean that as 
you were speaking at that meeting you did not trust her anymore or did 
you mean that before that meeting you did not trust her? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Even now I do not trust her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when you spoke to her and thanked her what were 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 9 of 217 
 
you conveying to her?  Were you conveying that you did not trust her 
as you were speaking or were you conveying that prior to that meeting 
you did not trust her or was it both? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  It is both Your Worship.  In 
that meeting itself we – I – we were not trusting her.  Even when she 
was saying she was coming to attend the meeting with us Your Worship 
we did not trust her as members of the association. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you say that is still the position now? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay do you want to elaborate on why you did not 
10 
trust her or why you do not trust her? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  The first report which was 
published or issued how did she get the facts?  How did she arrived at 
the facts which were contained in the report?  Who did she speak to or 
investigate? 
 
How 
did 
she 
conduct 
her 
investigation 
without 
consultation? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes did she not speak to the beneficiaries? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  No it was for the first time of 
her to come this year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had nobody from the Public Protector’s office spoken 
20 
to the beneficiaries before the first report was issued? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  No Your Worship what 
happened is we even went to her office together with Mr Maimane.  I 
was in the – I spoke personally spoke to her in the office with her and I 
even requested because we came with other people.  I requested her to 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 10 of 217 
 
go and explain to the people and tell them as to when is she going to 
visit us in Vrede. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us just make sure we are talking about the 
same period.  We are talk – we are talk – are we talking about the 
period before the – she released the first report on the dairy farm? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Correct Your Worship before 
the first report was released we did visit her office together with Mr 
Maimane in Pretoria. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you say you also went there with other 
beneficiaries? 
10 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  That is correct we were fifteen 
in the combi that we were travelling in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that time was her investigation still going on or had 
it been completed as far as you know? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  According to her she said she 
has investigated the matter.  Mr Maimane must proceed and open up a 
case and she will assist with whatever is needed from her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Okay.  I am trying to understand the basis for 
you to say as a beneficiaries you did not trust her and you still do not 
trust her.  Just tell me any other thing that forms the basis for you 
20 
saying you do not trust her or you did not trust her? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  We heard that she came and 
visited the Vrede Dairy Project.  We heard that from the employees of 
the project but she never came to us.  She went there but never came 
to see us.  We were perturbed as to why did she not come to us.  Why 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 11 of 217 
 
did she visit the project itself without coming to us and speak to us so 
that really surprised us all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must just tell me if my understanding is wrong.  
From what you say I understand you to be saying the reason why you 
did not trust her was that you felt excluded from her investigation? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  That is correct Your Worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Thank you Chairman.  Mr Dhlamini would it be 
correct to say that the expectation of the Public Protector was that Mr 
Maimane was going to collect statements from you and submit them to 
10 
her office?  I have read that in court papers that she has submitted.  Do 
you know anything about that? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  We were surprised – perturbed 
again because when we were in her office she said she was only aware 
of 35 beneficiaries.  She said she had no knowledge of the other 
beneficiaries it was for the first time of her to learn about the other 
beneficiaries. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes but my question was, do you know 
anything about her expectation that Mr Maimane was going to collect 
statements from you and forward them to her office? 
20 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  No I do not know. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Did Mr Maimane at any point say to you that 
he would collect your statements and forward them to the Public 
Protector’s office? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  No he did not utter those 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 12 of 217 
 
words. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Did anybody else offer to collect statements 
from you and forward them to the Public Protector’s office? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  No I do not remember that 
because I remember I had a conversation with her on the phone and 
she said she was coming to collect the statement and I said but why 
because the Hawks came and collected the statement.  Why do you not 
go to the Hawks and get the statements from them? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So first things first.  At the end of the meeting 
in May you had communicated your grievances to the Public Protector, 
10 
is that correct? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  That is correct we did. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Certain individuals… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I guess what you mean is before the end 
of the meeting you had told the Public Protector the grievances not 
after the end of the meeting? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  When she came to – when she 
came to visit us she was asking us questions and they were writing 
down what we were telling them as to what happened.  There was also 
media present.  So they were writing down what we were telling them. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So by the end of the meeting you had told her your 
grievances? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 13 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Then in addition to that you say you had a 
subsequent discussion with her and during that discussion you referred 
her to the statements you gave to the Hawks? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  That is correct.  It was now at 
the time when I was speaking to her telephonically when there was this 
misunderstanding between ourselves and her.  It was yes that time I 
told her about that. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Please explain the misunderstanding?  I do 
not – just locate it for us?  Was it before the May meeting or after the 
May meeting, the misunderstanding? 
10 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Firstly she promised to visit us 
in November 2018. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  I – that time I phoned her 
using my airtime.  She postponed the meeting then I had to call the 
other people and inform them that she was no longer coming.  The 
second time that is when there was this misunderstanding between us 
that I used my airtime to phone the people and yet she postponed the 
meeting you did not come.  What did not sit well with me is that when 
she speaks to me Your Worship she spoke to me like anytime when I 
20 
call I should find you on the phone if I want to speak to you.  I did not 
appreciate the manner in which she was addressing me. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And that discomfort of yours came from a 
telephone discussion before the May 2019 meeting? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 14 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But you buried the hatchet at the meeting of 
May 2019?  You resolved your issues? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Correct.  
Indeed she came and we had a discussion with her to dissolve or 
resolve the issues but we informed her that we do not trust her 
anymore. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes.  If you would then move from that point 
and explain your interaction with the Hawks. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes.  
The Hawks came and visited Vrede.  They were together with NPA.  
10 
They went to the dairy farm project and I was at Shoprite Taxi Rank.  
They did not inform me that they were coming to visit the dairy that 
they were looking for me.  Firstly they did not inform me about their 
coming to the dairy and that they were looking for me. 
The next thing I heard that the Vrede Police Officers were 
looking for me.  I went to them.  They told me that they have shut down 
the dairy project and they together with the NPA and they have 
compiled all the assets which are they.  They have a list of the assets.  
They have compiled the list and from there they left.  They went to 
Pretoria. 
20 
They then – once they were at Pretoria I then received a call 
from the Brigadier of the Hawks.  They were informing me about the 
date.  I still have it. 
INTERPRETER:  The witness is making reference to an SMS regarding 
the date. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 15 of 217 
 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  The 25 t h 
… 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Which year? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  The 
meeting was to take place on Saturday and Sunday 25 January 2019 
and indeed people attended the meeting to give out the statement.  
Okay.  Lindiwe Masiteng did not attend the meeting to the point that 
they applied for a warrant.  They applied for a warrant to obtain the 
minutes of the meeting – documents of the meeting because they will 
have meetings without us. 
10 
So they needed those meetings – minutes of those meetings.  
Oupa Mahlaba was not - did not attend the meeting as well because he 
has got businesses or tenders.  He was working outside Vrede.  So 
they did not find him.  It was a Saturday and a Sunday and people who 
were present there it was people coming from Memel and … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Warden. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Warden.  
Memel and Warden as well as people from Vrede and after that they 
left.  I do not know what happened thereafter. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Can we just interrogate that?  Is there 
20 
anything else you want to add to that meeting?  I want to ask you a 
couple of questions. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  On 
25 January 2019 I called the Hawks Brigadier because we were being 
threatened by death in Vrede.  So because of the threats we – I then 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 16 of 217 
 
called Brigadier – date 25 January 2019.  I am also in the taxi industry.  
So one of my colleagues forwarded me a video your worship which also 
– it is more like threatening my life. 
It was talking about me like threats to my life and I even 
phoned Mr Ntombela on 11 June telling him about this video which was 
- the content was threatening my life. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Mr Dhlamini – Mr Dhlamini I want you to 
continue with this evidence but it is slightly different to the meetings 
with the Hawks.  Please allow me just to ask you one or two questions 
about the meeting with the Hawks.  Do not forget what you are about to 
10 
tell the Chairman and then we will come back to where you are right 
now if that is fine.  The meetings with the Hawks you say was very well 
attended. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Did you have officers who were physically 
writing down statements from each individual member who was there 
who wanted to give a statement? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
correct.  There were officials from the Hawks who were taking down the 
statements.  They were at the Vrede Police Station.  The police officers 
20 
who were stationed at Vrede Police Station did not want to take down 
statements.  They were the ones who were taking – the Hawks were 
taking down the statements – the officials. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  You say the Vrede Police did not want to take 
down statements? 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 17 of 217 
 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  They 
did not – it seems like they had a discussion between themselves that 
they wanted to use the police station for that activity specifically 
because those who are working at the Vrede Police Station they were 
busy with other duties apart from this.  So it looks like there was a 
discussion. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Are you aware of the number of statements 
the Hawks were able to get from the beneficiaries? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  They 
gave me the list of the beneficiaries who were present there when 
10 
statements were being taken down.  So I do believe I trust that they did 
get all their statements. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Roughly how many names are on the list if 
you can recall? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
82 
beneficiaries. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So that means there would approximately 
have been 82 statements that were made and then taken by the Hawks. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
correct and may I place it on record Chairman that three of the 
20 
beneficiaries have already passed on by the time statements were 
being taken down.  So they were represented by their children who 
were present when statements were taken down. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Then can you explain to the Chairman who 
Lindiwe Masiteng is? 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 18 of 217 
 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI 
(through 
interpreter):  
Lindiwe Masiteng was one of the people we nominated to be in the 
committee together with June Mahlaba and Titus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you have moved – if you are moving away from the 
meeting I want to ask some … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  No Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not moving away yet? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Not yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Not yet Chairman.  The – the – so the 
10 
members of the committee were Lindiwe Masiteng, June Mahlaba and 
(indistinct) Ngqusini? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Your evidence is that Lindiwe Masiteng was 
the recording secretary? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  She was 
the Deputy of June Mahlaba. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And you then make reference to the Hawks 
asking for the minutes of any meetings they may have held? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  They 
20 
were asking me about the whereabouts of Lindiwe.  I told them that I 
saw her.  She walked passed there and then I phoned her.  They were 
asking me about the whereabouts of Lindiwe and then I saw – I saw her 
walking past there and then I phoned her and she said she was busy 
doing laundry.  Then we took a car and we drove to her place of 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139

residence or at her house. 
I then pointed out where she stays.  They then went and 
applied for a warrant of search so that they can obtain those minutes.  
Then the next thing I saw her.  She came with – together with the 
Hawks and she was scared.  I managed to speak to her and she said 
Mr Dhlamini we are being arrested and I asked her what have you done. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  What was her response? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I – she 
said she did advise Oupa that they should come back to us and give us 
report backs and not – the report backs instead of taking decisions on 
10 
our behalf and Oupa did not want to heed to advice or listen. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Now Oupa Mahlaba is June Mahlaba who was 
the Chairman of the committee you had selected? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Last two questions on this aspect.  Did the 
Hawks tell you why they wanted your statements? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes they 
did indicate that they are taking down our statements regarding the 
dairy – the Vrede Dairy Project. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And did they tell you why they wanted any 
records that Lindiwe Masiteng the Deputy Chairman might have? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Correct 
because in – in the document that has the list of the members it was 
clear that who was the Chairperson, the committee that is, who is the 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 20 of 217 
 
Deputy, who is the Chairman of the committee.  So yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I think a last relevant fact to what we are 
talking about is the following.  Mr June Mahlaba the Chairman will come 
to the Commission and tell the Commission that the committee did not 
meet.  They had no feedback to give to the membership.  I just want to 
place that on record. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That 
would be a lie.  A blue lie. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman I think in respect of the Hawks I 
have exhausted the questions I would like to ask. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  No thank you.  Did the Hawks take a 
statement from you? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you sign the statement? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  It was 
read back to me and then I attached my signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was – was that during the meeting or was it later 
after the meeting? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  My 
statement was taken down on a Saturday because on Sunday I was 
20 
busy with the list because what happened is we were grouped as per 
language – Zulu, Sotho, Afrikaans.  So I was assisting in those – in that 
activity specifically.  My statement was taken down on a Saturday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the Saturday when you were meeting the 
Hawks on Saturday and Sunday – the Saturday you are talking about? 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 21 of 217 
 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  It was 
not a meeting.  It was about taking down of our statements Saturday 
and Sunday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Now are there statements by other 
members – other beneficiaries that you actually did see which had been 
signed that were taken by the Hawks? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Correct.  
When I entered the room where they were working from I saw the 
others because already there were other beneficiaries who were inside 
there.  So I saw their statements.  They were on the table.  I saw them 
10 
on the table. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You – you were not given copies when the 
Hawks left of any of the statements? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there would have been many statements by 
beneficiaries by the end of that meeting on Sunday – on Sunday.  I 
know you say there was no meeting but by the end of that session on 
Saturday and Sunday there would have been many statements by 
beneficiaries that had been taken.  Is that right? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Correct 
20 
because there was a queue of the beneficiaries who were lining up for 
their statements to be taken down and comparing the queue as well as 
my list of the beneficiaries they were all attended to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And before the Hawks left on that occasion did they 
indicate to you what they were going to do with the statements or what 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 22 of 217 
 
their plan was or when they would report back to you or when they 
would tell you anything about what they were going to do with the 
statements? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Since then have there been any communication 
between the beneficiaries and the Hawks as far as you know? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Except 
when I – I called them regarding the threats, no there has never been 
any communication. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Thank you Chairman.  Chairman maybe I 
should just place on record that we have been communicating with the 
– with the Hawks.  I know yesterday you had asked the department to 
give us documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  We have been talking to the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  We will continue to talk to them Chairman.  
We have not been very successful but we will continue … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  To speak with them … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  About records that they have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If there are difficulties I must be informed.  If there 
are difficulties in getting anything from them let me know. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 23 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I will do so at the end of these proceedings 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Mr Dhlamini let us go back to the threats 
because that is important information as well.  You … 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  You started saying on that very day on the 
25 t h you got threats.  Please just set that out succinctly as a separate 
area of – of interest for the Chairman. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  There 
10 
were people who would directly say to us we must be killed whatever 
they are looking for they will not get it.  Though I am not going to 
mention names but others will utter those words directly threatening us 
directly in our faces that we have to be killed. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Are you able to disclose the names of those 
people to the Chairman? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before he does so maybe he should not do so 
unless you have heard the names and we – we give them notice. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Maybe you should just write the names down 
because I am not familiar with … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Those particular names Chairman and we can 
then put in a supplementary affidavit … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  To deal with the issue. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 24 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Maybe what we can say is he can – he can tell 
us what was said without saying who said it and then after he has given 
evidence he can give the names to the legal team and then we will take 
it from there. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  They 
said we must be killed because we are making the other people who are 
part of the project as well wiser. 
INTERPRETER:  I do not know if I am putting it write your worship.  Ja 
that is why we should be killed. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Aware of their rights. 
10 
INTERPRETER:  Thank you very much. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  We are 
making them aware of their rights that is why we should be killed. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And when – when you refer to “we” you 
mentioned Ncongwane’s name? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Ja, 
myself and Mr Ncongwane we are making the other group wiser or 
aware of their rights.  In the video that I made mention of there is a 
person there who is saying they have hired a killer – someone to kill me 
in the video.  This – there is a person who is saying Mr Dhlamini should 
20 
be killed and then this person heard about this threat and then he then 
said give me this job. 
I will do it and then this person then responded by saying it is 
okay I will arrange a meeting between yourself and the people who 
want this person to be killed.  This person works or is a municipal 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 25 of 217 
 
official.  So he is part of the group that wants us to be killed.  I can 
give this video as well for you to view it but I think I made a mistake by 
giving this video to the Hawks because the person in the video we stay 
in the same township with … 
INTERPRETER:  Sorry I did not get the last part. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Well I 
was going to actually investigate or find out myself from this person to 
show me the people who are hired or was supposed to kill me.  I – I am 
– I do realise that there is police to protect us but - or the law to 
protect us but I do not think it is effective or it is working in our favour.  
10 
It is so sad Chairman that you would know that these people are 
making threats to your life or this person is threatening to – to kill you 
and nothing – the law is doing or it is difficult for you to hand over this 
person to the law for the law to deal with this person. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Mr … 
CHAIRPERSON:  When did you give – when did you give the video to 
the Hawks? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I can 
make reference to my phone your worship because I did forward this 
video to Mr Ntombela.  I even called him.  I had a conversation with 
20 
him.  He said I must take care of myself … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please just repeat that.  I want to hear the Zulu part 
as well.  Yes. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I should 
take care. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 26 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Now I 
am going to church.  I am armed your worship because I have a 
firearm.  So I had to carry my firearm with.  Then I took a decision that 
time your worship that anyone who comes closer to me even if it is in 
the farm I will not die alone.  That is what I said to my children. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So let us try and locate the month when you gave the 
video to the Hawks.  As I understand it your meeting with the Hawks 
was early this year, was it January or thereabout? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  11 June 
10 
2019 when I forwarded the video to the Hawks, it was the 11 t h of June 
2019.  I remember very well because this person replied, there is a 
response from this person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Mr Ntombela? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes, Mr 
Ntombela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you just forward the video to the Hawks and 
spoke to them on the phone or by SMS or they also met with you and 
took a full statement about the (indistinct)? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  What 
20 
happened is, Your Worship, I used another phone to call him, whilst on 
the other phone the video was streaming for him to listen to the 
conversation or the content of the video so it was a telephone 
conversation using two phones Your Worship.  Even when Busisiwe 
Mkhwebane was there I streamed this video for everyone to listen it 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 27 of 217 
 
was in a hall and people were in attendance and I wanted people to 
hear because they were talking about me in the video. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say up to now, the Hawks have not taken any 
statement from you – written statement from you about the threats? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know if there’s anything at all that they have 
done after they received the video concerning your threats? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  No, 
nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the person you have been communicating with in 
10 
regard to the threats is a Mr Ntombela? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
correct Your Worship, it is Mr Ntombela from the Hawks, as well as at 
Vrede Police Station, the station commander, he knows about the 
video. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So did you also show the video to the station 
commander at Vrede Police Station? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I made 
him to listen to the video Your Worship during the passing of Mr – it 
was the funeral of Mr Ngwenya, so I made him to listen and in –they 
20 
were saying whose next and they saying somebody – another will bite 
the dust if it’s not myself it’s going to be Mr Ncongwane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what – is that part of what is said in the video? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  No what 
I’ve just said now Your Worship, it’s something which was said during 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 28 of 217 
 
the funeral of Mr Ngwenya, that who is next, in the video itself Your 
Worship, what is contained there is that Mr Dhlamini should be killed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the persons who are having this conversation are 
shown, they can be seen on the video? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  It’s just a 
recording that does not show a person Your Worship but it’s a 
recording, this person was driving and there’s a recording of this 
person as they are conversing and mention their name, this person is 
mentioning his name, he says his name is Zwakele. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, thank you. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I heard evidence sometime back in regard to  the 
aviation work stream of reports that had been made to the police a few 
years ago of threats that were being made to the owner of the company 
called Koreneka and I was told nothing had been done for a long time 
about the threats to her.  So it’s very concerning if threats are made to 
the lives to people, they report to the Law Enforcement Agencies and 
nothing happens and the Law Enforcement Agencies don’t report back 
to the people what they are doing about those threats, nobody gets 
arrested, nothing happens.  So I think after this you’ll – as you said 
20 
you’ll arrange for a supplementary affidavit by Mr Dhlamini where he 
will detail everything about the threats and who he reported to where 
he will include the names that he is not mentioning now and then the 
people’s names who are mentioned can be given Rule 3 notices and Mr 
Dhlamini might have to come back when he can mention the names 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 29 of 217 
 
after they have been given notices and it will be necessary to – for the 
Commission to establish from the Hawks what’s going on about the 
threats and about the complaint that Mr Dhlamini brought to their 
attention and what have they done.  So we’ll need to – the legal team 
will need to try and get facts as to what’s happening both in regard to 
the Koreneka as well as Mr Dhlamini’s matter, thank you Mr Dhlamini. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman, Mr Dhlamini just 
to summarise this aspect of your evidence, my question is, are there 
other people outside of yourself and Mr Ncongwane who you know have 
also been threatened? 
10 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Correct, 
beneficiaries from (indistinct) they do mention the fact that they are 
getting threats as well but they are afraid to talk about it but yes they 
are getting threats.  We also know of other people who died or who 
were killed, apart from Mr Ngwenya, there was another gentleman who 
was investigating the dairy – the Vrede Dairy Project, he was killed 
before 
he 
could 
even 
reach 
Bloemfontein, 
10 
kilometres 
to 
Bloemfontein.  Those that killed – they believed he was dead at the 
scene and yet he was now in hospital that’s where he gave out his 
statement whilst he was in hospital, to the police.  He was on the 
20 
media, the newspaper (indistinct) as well as on TV, even today I 
haven’t heard what the law enforcers – what steps they have taken.  It 
hurts, it’s really disturbing I don’t want this to happen to my family 
members.  If this can happen to my family members I’ll either be in 
prison or I’ll be dead myself. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 30 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You are relating what happened to Moses 
Chauke in the last account you’ve just given? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In respect of the funeral you attended of 
Philemon Ngwenya, was he not a beneficiary? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  He was a 
beneficiary, he was there when we were talking or discussing.  He died 
after being threatened, being told that he will die.  The first person to 
threaten him was Tuto Khanye, then when he uttered or threatened his 
life we were all there and the media was there.  People, the community 
10 
members would hear this directly from the people who are responsible 
for this because in Vrede once you mention the dairy project you won’t 
sleep in your house…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, hang on, I think the interpretation wasn’t 
complete, let him just repeat what he said, he said something about Mr 
Sebenzi Zwane. 
INTERPRETER:  My apologies. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  My 
apologies, if in Vrede, you have spoken about the dairy project or 
Sebenzi Zwane you won’t sleep in your house, you’ll have to run away 
20 
from your house because they will chase after you or threaten to kill 
you.  The reason why this issue is now before the Commission it was 
because of myself and Mr Ncongwane, we had to brave ourselves and 
come before the Commission and report before everyone is being killed 
or everyone is killed.  They do utter words like we have to be killed, 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 31 of 217 
 
they don’t have any regard for us…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry before you proceed Mr Dhlamini, you said 
something, I’m not sure what it means and I don’t think the interpreter 
also understood what you meant (isiZulu language spoken) 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  We are 
not scared of them we said we should be killed but we are not scared of 
them.  We know when our time comes we will die. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let’s just connect that properly so you were 
saying that certain people tell you that you should be killed but you are 
not scared of them. 
10 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Correct 
Your Worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes then proceed. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Now I just want to clarify, Tuto Khanye 
you have mentioned in your evidence earlier, yesterday. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   He’s one of the people who works in 
Agriculture your evidence is that he’s one of the people who Mr 
Sebenzi Zwane uses to collect formation from Vrede? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  That is 
20 
correct he is his spy or Mr Sebeni Zwane’s spy. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Then my last question is, are you – have 
you been taking protective measures, other than carrying a firearm are 
you able to take protective measures to look after yourself? 
MR 
EPHRAIM 
MAKHOSINI 
DHLAMINI 
(through 
interpreter):   
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 32 of 217 
 
Anything, for instance if I’m about to hold or call a meeting I will inform 
the station commander. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Dhlamini are there any – no before we 
go there, there are two people’s names that have popped up the one is 
Mr Chandrama Prasad who’s also referred to as CP, do you know that 
name at all? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  In 
passing, no I don’t know this person – him, but I heard about his name. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You’ve heard about his name in relation to 
what? 
10 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I heard 
that he’s a problem as to exactly what problem he was causing I 
wouldn’t be able to tell you but I heard that he must be removed or his 
troublesome, he must be removed. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Where does he work? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I have no 
knowledge as to where he works. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Or where did he work? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):    I’m not 
sure. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That’s fine, no not a problem, that’s fine.  
The next name is Mr Willie Basson who will be coming to give evidence 
here, do you know Mr Willie Basson? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes I do 
know him he’s a resident or he works in Vrede, that is correct. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 33 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes I just wanted to identify, to 
understand who you know.  So it’s Mr Basson you know, you don’t 
really know much about Prasad and you certainly knew Philemon 
Ngwenya. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Very 
well. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And then you have told the Chairman 
about Moses Chauke what you know of what happened to Moses 
Chauke? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No that’s it, I’m just summarising. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Are there any other matters you would like 
to bring to the attention of the Chairman as we close? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes there 
is another farmer, from Warden.  He was shot from – there was a black 
car which were shots that were fired from a black car, he died – he died 
and he was buried but the case did not proceed.  It was those people, 
once you talk about the activities or work which is done in the 
Agriculture these people will interject and fight you.  There was also 
20 
another gentleman from Warden who was killed…(intervention). 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That’s the second one now, you have 
talked about the first person from Warden, you’ve heard about the first 
person – or you’ve told the Chairman about the first person from 
Warden who was killed, and you’ve associated a black car with that 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 34 of 217 
 
particular assassination? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):   Correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Do you know the name of he deceased in 
that case? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I may not 
remember his name but I have family members and other farmers from 
Warden who can give me his name and I do believe Mr Ncongwane 
knows his name as well. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    And then the second person you’re about 
to tell the Chairman about, who was that? 
10 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  The 
second one is the one who was investigating the issue of the Vrede 
Dairy Farm who did not even arrive at Bloemfontein. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   That’s Chauke? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes, the 
third person is Ngwenya. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Any other matters Mr Dhlamini? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Nothing 
else. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman unless you have other 
20 
questions, I have exhausted all the ones I have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you.  Mr Dhlamini you said you showed the 
video to the station commander at Vrede Police Station is that correct? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess one you had shown him the video and it was 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 35 of 217 
 
clear from the video that your life was under threat, the police should 
have done something about it, but I want to find out whether you did 
ask him to do anything about these threats? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I did tell 
him Your Worship, but nothing much in terms of the response that I got 
from him except that he said, here are my numbers, if you have a 
problem contact me but you should also protect yourself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did they open any file so that they would undertake 
an investigation into these threats? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  There 
10 
was no record, when I was having a conversation it was just a one-on-
one conversation, there was no record of it, it was never written down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was – were you showing him the video at the Police 
Station? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes he 
was listening to the video at the Police Station. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it only the two of you or were there other people 
that were with you? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  It was 
just the two of us because I did even inform Mr Ncongwane that I’m 
20 
going to show (indistinct) the video at the Police Station. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say that he makes some notes during the 
conversation or as he was watching the video? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he not take any statement from you? 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 36 of 217 
 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  No he 
didn’t. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he not ask any police officer under him to take a 
statement from you? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  No the 
answer is no but what he said – not on that day but on another day 
that, did you inform the Hawks about this incident? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have recollection of more or less when it was 
– which month it was when you showed the station commander the 
video? 
10 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  It took a 
while, I think it was about three months after the incident of receiving 
the video that I’ve shown the station commander.  The person that I 
informed, immediately, Your Worship about the video it was Mr 
Ntombela, I forwarded the video to him and told him about the video. 
CHAIRPERSON:  My recollection is that you said it was in June this 
year when you – I think 11 June when you informed Mr Ntombela about 
the video, when you sent it to him, is that correct? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  I made 
reference to my cell phone messages, Your Worship, so yes indeed it is 
20 
the 11 t h of June 2019. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that would mean that it was after the 11 t h of June 
2019 when you had a meeting with the station commander at Vrede 
Police Station and showed him the video, is that correct? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  Yes 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 37 of 217 
 
Chair it as after the 11 t h of June 2019 that I had a meeting with the 
station commander of the Vrede Police Station, though I did not note 
down my activities but the last date that is reflect – or the last entry 
that I see on my phone is the one that is guiding me as to  when the 
activities or the last date when I received the video. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So after you had shown the station commander this 
video and you had a discussion, has he followed up in any way with you 
or sent any of his police officers to take this issue of the threats 
against you further? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  No. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you have not received any report – report backs 
either from the Hawks or from him about what they may be doing about 
these threats? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINI DHLAMINI (through interpreter):  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say that one of the persons or that the 
person who was meant to carry out the threats or to kill you, lives in 
the same area as yourself? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He has not been arrested? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  No he works at the 
20 
municipality. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Right now do you move around without any 
protection from the police or the state? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  I think I can protect myself 
better than them because whatever I told them they did nothing about 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 38 of 217 
 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you wish anything to be done to have these 
threats investigated? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Okay correct Your Worship 
threatening to kill someone or killing someone is an offence so they 
should have investigated the matter.  Come to us and look at the video 
and the name is being mentioned in the video so that they can follow up 
and to even find out who issued that instruction that this should be 
carried out, the threats. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
10 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  I am – with due respect the 
South African Law Enforces are taking time to attend to matters like 
this.  So I have my way that I can deal with this issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – would you like the commission to speak the 
Law Enforcement Agencies in order to see what protection can be given 
to you? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Yes if there is anything that 
they can assist me with they can do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I would like the legal team to and the 
administration and the investigators to do what they normally do when 
20 
people who appear before the commission are under threat to see what 
can be done.  And also to establish why Mr Dhlamini has not been 
given any report backs either by the Hawks and the Station Commander 
at Vrede Police Station about the threats to his life that he has brought 
to their attention and what is being done about investigating these 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 39 of 217 
 
threats and if there is enough evidence arresting the people concerned.  
And then once the legal team has spoken to them it must please report 
back to Mr Dhlamini it must not do like the Hawks and the Station 
Commander at Vrede.  It must report back what transpired in that 
discussion and I must be kept informed.  Is there anything else you 
want to tell me concerning the either threats to your life or threats to 
anybody in the – in the – in your organisation relating to the Vrede 
Dairy Farm before we conclude? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Yes.  My request Chair is that 
– we request that this dairy project issue be finalised – be dealt with 
10 
and it be finalised because people in our area they now live in fear. If 
the government is taking a decision of not funding that project anymore 
and shut it down so be it because it is clear that this project was never 
meant for the benefit of us as the community of Vrede.  But it was for 
just criminal activities or criminals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say it was meant for thieves? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  That is correct.  Using us our 
names 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  So that they can get the 
20 
money or the funds from the government.  Our lives are now in danger 
because of this.  Looking at the percentage – the share percentage it 
was clear that we were being deceived.  Why we were not given 100% 
of the shareholding.  If this was for the benefit of the farmers why 
should it be for the – the government should profit from it if it is meant 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 40 of 217 
 
for the farmers.  Even right now the dairy project is functioning and 
there are a whole lot of activities that are happening there like stealing 
off the stock and stuff and we know we have cases.  Nothing is 
happening in that dairy – there is no success that will come out of that 
project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What would the beneficiaries like to see happen with 
this dairy project? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Most of the people or 
beneficiaries have no interest anymore in this project because it 
started off on a very bad footing and a lot of people are losing their 
10 
lives because of this project.  So they have no interest anymore. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay.  Is that all you still had to say? 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Mr Dhlamini I want to thank you for having come 
to the commission to give evidence.  Especially when you came to the 
commission despite threats to your life.  There are many people in the 
country some of them in high positions in government entities I believe 
who must know a lot about issues that this commission is investigating 
including state capture and serious corruption. Who despite my calls 
are not coming forward to tell the commission and the nation what they 
20 
know.  But they would all pretend and like everybody to believe they 
support the work of the commission and yet they withhold very crucial 
information that is relevant to what the commission is investigating.  I 
have no doubt in my mind that some of them would be past and present 
high officials within government.  And maybe some fear that they may 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 41 of 217 
 
lose their jobs.  And I do not want to make light of any fear for loss of 
jobs by anybody.  But I do want to highlight the appreciation of the 
commission for somebody like you who despite threats to their lives 
decide that they will come to the commission and help the commission 
even if they know that their lives may be under threat.  So I just want 
you to know that the commission fully appreciates what you have done 
by coming forward to give evidence despite all of these things.  And I 
thank you also for the role you have played to try and make sure that 
various bodies know what you know about the dairy farm project.  The 
commission may not be able to reach any conclusion about the dairy 
10 
farm project for quite some time but I want to assure you and all the 
beneficiaries that the evidence that will be given that you have given 
and that will be given by other witnesses to the commission in regard to 
this project will be taken into account and considered and findings will 
be made in the end.  Thank you very much once again then Mr Dhlamini 
you are excused.  As I indicated earlier on the legal team will ask to 
talk to you in order to prepare supplementary affidavit and I have no 
doubt you will continue to cooperate with them. 
MR EPHRAIM MAKHOSINO DHLAMINI:  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much you are excused.  We will take 
20 
the tea adjournment it is twenty past eleven.  We will resume at twenty 
five to twelve.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.

ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Mr Ncongwane do you confirm that your 
statement is in English but you are able to read and understand the

MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE 
(through 
interpreter):  
Correct. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 45 of 217 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  Chair, may I propose that 
this bundle containing Mr Ncongwane’s statement be marked as 
EXHIBIT HH3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The file containing the affidavit by or statement by 
Mr Meshack Mpaleni Ncongwane will be marked EXHIBIT HH3 and I 
think we must just for the sake of helping the transcribers spell Mpaleni 
and Ncongwane.  Mpaleni is M-P-A-L-E-N-I.  Ncongwane is N-C-O-N-G-
W-A-N-E.  Thank you.  You may proceed. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Ncongwane do you 
confirm that the document that is appearing on EXHIBIT HH3 pages 1 
10 
to eight is the statement that you made for the Commission? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE 
(through 
interpreter):  
Correct. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And that the signature on page 8 is your 
signature? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE 
(through 
interpreter):  
Correct. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Mr Ncongwane would you 
please tell us where do you live? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  I stay 
20 
at Thembalihle township number 2325 Khanye Street Modise Section in 
Vrede. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And what do you do for a living? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  I am a 
farmer.  I have cattle and I also produce milk. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 46 of 217 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Mr Ncongwane I believe you are 
aware that the reason for you being here before the Commission it to 
give us the information that – relating to your connection with the Vrede 
Dairy Project.  Would you please then give us the background 
information that connected you to this Vrede Dairy Project? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  I was 
interested in dairy or working with milk.  It all started by me attending 
the meetings with other farms in Qwaqwa regarding dairy or milking. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes proceed. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  Each 
10 
month we will hold workshops.  On another day in this five months or 
six months we – we then went to Bethlehem where we met up with 
commercial farmers. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So Mr Ncongwane if I may can you just 
explain which year are you referring here to now?  Is it …? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  From 
early 2011. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes you may proceed. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  Well we 
– like I said we attended workshops.  So in one of the workshops that 
20 
we had with the commercial farmers from country lane who are on – 
who are dealing with dairy as well we were then told or advised that if 
you have cattle and you have about 25 cattle and you want to invest 
with those 25 cattle your shares are much better than if you have less 
than 25 life five which are not yielding any - much money. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 47 of 217 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  So were you intending to have shares 
with those commercial farmers? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE 
(through 
interpreter):  
Correct. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Then proceed.  What happened from 
there? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  What 
happened is we then had a meeting.  We sat in a meeting with the 
farmers from Qwaqwa.  We formed a cooperative.  We then named that 
cooperative as MPO - Emerging Milk Producer Organisation.  After we 
10 
have found this cooperative I then went back home.  On my arriving at 
home I met up or there were men who were also interested in the very 
same dairy project. 
I then said to them we need a place where we can work or 
have our activities there.  We need to go and request from the 
municipality a venue or a place where we can work from.  After we have 
agreed with this I then wrote a letter.  I then took it to the town council. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Mr Ncongwane which town council now are 
you referring to?  Is it Vrede or Qwaqwa? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  Vrede 
20 
Town Council. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Proceed. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  I then 
handed over the first letter that I have drafted to the Mayor. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And who was the Mayor at the time? 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 48 of 217 
 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  It was 
till Mr John Motaung. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Is he still a Mayor to this day? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  That is 
correct.  He is still a Mayor. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Proceed. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  I then 
waited for a period of about two months.  I then returned back to him to 
get feedback.  On my arrival there I then learnt that the feedback that I 
was expecting was not available yet or was not ready yet.  I drafted a 
10 
second letter. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Is this still in 2011? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  That is 
correct.  After a month I went to collect the response of the second 
letter that I had drafted.  I then discovered that there was a report back 
on my request or of my letter.  The response that I got or the report 
back that I got my statement was not clear or understandable; because 
I had an interest of this – of this thing to succeed I then approached 
Mr Bheki Radebe.  He is a Member of Parliament. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Is that the Free State Provincial Parliament 
20 
or the National Parliament? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE 
(through 
interpreter):  
National.  I then showed him this draft or this letter that I have written.  
He perused it or read it and he said no it is understandable.  It is clear 
and then I asked him as to what is it that maybe I should correct from 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 49 of 217 
 
the statement and his response was I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who had told you that they were unable to understand 
your statement or your letter? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  The 
Mayor Mr Motaung. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was this a letter – again let us just get that 
clarification - or was it a statement? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  It was 
a letter that I had drafted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you – had you written the letter in a language that 
10 
Mr Motaung did not understand? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  It was 
in English.  The letter that I have drafted it was in English – the second 
letter that I have drafted.  It was in English and the heading of it – it 
was the Requisition of the Land. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the letter that you had written to Mr Motaung was 
in English? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  That is 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was it Mr Motaung who told you that he could not 
20 
understand the letter? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ask him on that occasion what it is that he 
could not understand so that you could explain it to him? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE 
(through 
interpreter):  
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 50 of 217 
 
Unfortunately I did not ask him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  You can proceed.  You – you were at a 
time when Mr Radebe said he did not see anything that anybody could 
not understand in your letter and then what happened? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  I then 
took this letter went back to – with this letter to Mr Ralebenya who is 
an administrative officer at the town hall.  He then – he then said to me 
after reading – after reading this letter he then said he is – he is of the 
opinion that there should be a supporting letter for the people who will 
be funding this project. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Did – then what happened from there?  
Did you get …? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
I 
basically lost hope.  I then left it like that. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  After 
that – after that had happened then I heard that they will start up a 
dairy project in Vrede. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Sorry.  What I want to know these 
letters that you were sending to the municipality and to the town 
20 
council was it – when exactly in 2011?  Was it before November or after 
November 2011?  If you may remember. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  It was 
in November. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Then the information that you 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 51 of 217 
 
had about the opening of the dairy in Vrede when was this? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  It was 
at the beginning of the year 2012. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And where did you hear this news? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  I would 
hear about it because we were attending meetings in the area or the 
place where we stayed. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  The – the funding or the - the 
information that they said you should have supporting documents for 
funding what – what was this funding? 
10 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  Well my 
understanding - it is just my opinion of what he said to me.  My 
understanding was that he meant by funding that I should have people 
who will by cattle for me because his statement was it is pointless to 
give or provide land to a person and yet that person is – has no plan – 
or does not have anything to do or will do in the very same or any 
activities that he will perform in the land. 
So rather provide it if you know that this person has cattle 
and he will use the land. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Sorry you said you attended meetings.  
20 
So other than being a farmer at Vrede were you involved with any of 
the farmers’ organisations? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  At that 
time I was Chairperson of an organisation called NAFU. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And what does that stand for? 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 52 of 217 
 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE 
(through 
interpreter):  
National Agricultural Farmers Union.  It is NAFU. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  NAFU and what position did you hold there? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  I was a 
Chairperson for Vrede. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Mr Ncongwane you then in the 
statement that you furnished us you detail the number of meetings that 
you attended that were called by the Government Officials in Vrede 
around 2012.  Some of it overlaps with what Mr Dhlamini has already 
testified about but I want you to try and follow the chronology of events 
10 
starting with the first meeting that you attended.  Yes even if you … 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):   
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry Ms Buthelezi.  I just had a look at the 
statement.  It does appear to me that most of the things that he says in 
the statement are the same as things that Mr Dhlamini has told me 
about and I am under the impression that he was listening to 
Mr Dhlamini’s evidence. 
So I think what we may have to do is just confirm whether he 
heard all of Mr Dhlamini’s evidence about what happened and check 
whether the – there is anything in particular that he heard Mr Dhlamini 
20 
say that is not in accordance with his recollection and then he can tell 
us that and then after that you can look at each meeting and just see if 
there is anything different that he says that Mr Dhlamini did not tell us 
or that does not – is not in accordance with what Mr Dhlamini told us.  
So we do not have to go through the whole thing again. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 53 of 217 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Understand Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Mr Ncongwane you have listened to the 
evidence of Mr Dhlamini.  I believe you were here inside the hearing 
venue.  You heard him detailing the – the number of meetings that you 
attended as … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Let us first check.  Were you hear 
throughout the time yesterday and today when Mr Dhlamini gave 
evidence? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  Yes I 
10 
was present. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you were listening to his evidence? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  Yes I 
was listening. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And will you be able to say if there is something that 
he said which does not accord with your recollection?  Okay.  I am 
sorry.  I think I need to put that … 
INTERPRETER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Afresh.  When you were listening were you able to 
pick up things that he was saying that does not accord with your 
20 
recollection?  Okay no that is fine. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  I – from 
the first (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am confusing you Ms Interpreter.  I know I am 
confusing you and Mr Ncongwane.  Okay.  At this stage I just wanted to 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 54 of 217 
 
establish whether he would be able to say yes there maybe or there 
might not be.  She – Ms Buthelezi will ask her about the specific 
meetings if there is something that he did not recall having happened 
the way that Mr Dhlamini said.  So I just wanted to have an idea that he 
thinks he will be able to – to indicate if he is asked. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  I can 
respond to that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh excellent. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  There 
are (intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Then you maybe you can take 
it from there Ms Buthelezi. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you so much Chair.  Mr Ncongwane 
then can you just highlight those events that you recall that were not 
either placed on record by Mr Dhlamini or where you understood things 
differently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe – maybe – I am sorry.  Maybe you can go 
according to first meeting, second meeting. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If he is able to and there may be things where he 
20 
says I do not remember whether they happened at the first meeting or 
second meeting but let him be able to deal with them in terms of first 
meeting second meeting and so on. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 55 of 217 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  We will start from the first meeting. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  With 
regard to the first meeting Your Worship he was able to explain 
everything that happened or that transpired in the first meeting. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Is there anything you wish to add with 
regards to the first meeting? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  There 
is nothing to add. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and this first meeting are you in the 
position to tell us when it was? 
10 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  It was 
– the meeting was early 2012 and my apologies Chair, may I place this 
on record, most of the community members who were involved or 
beneficiaries in this project, were elderly people. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry was there something you wanted to say 
about them being elderly people or you just wanted to make that point 
only? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  As I 
have indicated that most of the beneficiaries were elderly people and 
20 
we grew up in the farms so when this project was initiated we did not 
know that it will end up before the Commission and as a result we were 
not keeping record of the activities of this project and we did not even 
nominate a committee of individuals who will keep record or record 
every activity around this project.  When the committee that Mr 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 56 of 217 
 
Dhlamini made mention of in his testimony was nominated or elected, 
that’s when we had hope that there will be record of each and every 
activity that might be needed around this project that they will keep, 
basically record of everything.  That is why other things like dates and 
years we are unable to remember as to exactly when did it happen but 
there are other things where we sit down and we try to recollect of 
when was the first meeting and who was there or who was hosting the 
meeting we would then remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  Yes, you can continue if you have 
not yet finished. 
10 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  So 
those who were more older than us or the elderly people will be 
assisted by us those who used to attend meeting and opinions and 
share the opinions with them.  Regarding the date, my apologies to you 
Chair if we do not remember the dates, the background information that 
I gave you is to clarify the issue of the dates and the years that events 
took place but as for everything that he has said Your Worship, it is 
exactly as he has explained it Mr Dhlamini, the only issue will be the 
dates and the year.  There was a misunderstanding where Alta Meyer 
was interior coordinator but he made a mistake around her position, 
20 
she was working at the Agriculture Department, she was the colleague. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she was a coordinator there? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. Okay she will now lead you on – on 
the various meetings but she will ask you whether there’s anything else 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 57 of 217 
 
you wanted to say about the first meeting and when she’s done then 
she’ll go to the next meeting. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  I 
understand. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Mr Ncongwane, on the first 
meeting is there anything that you would like to add other than what Mr 
Dhlamini has told the Commission? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  No. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you and the second meeting? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  The 
10 
second meeting I was not – I was not in attendance but most of what 
was discussed there, I got it from Mr Dhlamini. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and what he relayed to the Commission 
is everything that he reported to you about the second meeting at the 
time? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  Indeed. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you, since you’re not there then let’s 
move to the third meeting.  Is there anything that you’d like to correct 
or to add with regard to the third meeting, this is the meeting where, 
according to your statement where your ID documents were asked for 
20 
by Ms Alta Meyer. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):    It is 
exactly like Mr Dhlamini has explained it Your Worship – Alta, I mean 
Chair, Alta Meyer came and requested the ID documents and they were 
handed over and everything was just happening in a hurry. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 58 of 217 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and do you remember, roughly when it 
was, it’s not on your statement but if you could – even if it’s a year or a 
month of that year, or was it the beginning of the year or towards the 
end of the year? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  If I’m 
not mistaken it was right at the beginning – in the year 2012 that is 
when this project was initiated. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Did you say at the beginning of the project, 
or the beginning of the year? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  It was 
10 
the beginning of the year and right at the beginning of the project or 
when the project was initiated. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes and what was happening with regards 
to the project at that stage, do you know if there was any construction 
that was started? 
MR 
MESHACK 
MPALENI 
NCONGWANE 
(through 
interpreter):  
Personally, Your Worship, if I say I did see the construction I would be 
lying but I heard that there was a construction which has started 
regards towards this project, but personally I did not see that. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And you also mention the committee, the 
20 
committee 
that 
Mr 
Mahlaba 
spoke 
about 
on 
paragraph 
13…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Dhlamini. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Sorry Mr Dhlamini, when you deal with the 
second meeting – with the third meeting was this the day in which this 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 59 of 217 
 
committee was elected?   
INTERPRETER:  Okay I see the witness is taking out a piece of paper 
I’m not sure whether he’s making reference to that but he says, yes in 
that third meeting the committee was selected or elected and it was 
selected by Alta Meyer herself in the third meeting. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  If I remember the evidence of Mr Dhlamini 
was that you nominated the people that were in the committee? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  As 
people who had expertise or skills in the farming we assisted in the 
election of this committee together with Ms Alta Meyer. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let’s get that clear because earlier on I 
understood you to say Mr Alta Meyer selected that committee, did I 
hear you correctly? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  Alta 
Meyer is the one who collected the ID’s from us, Alta Meyer is the one 
who elected the committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well to – it’s the second time you say she elected or 
selected the committee but you have also said you are the people who 
elected them but I think you said together with her, let’s try and get this 
clear.  Did Ms Alta Meyer say to you at that meeting, as beneficiaries, 
20 
you people need to elect a committee or did that come from you, the 
beneficiaries, that there should be a committee that must be elected?  
Let me repeat, did Ms Alta Meyer say to you, that you as the 
beneficiaries should elect a committee or was it you who came up with 
the idea that a committee should be elected? 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 60 of 217 
 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  She, 
Alta Meyer, came to elect the committee she is the one who selected 
the committee. 
CHAIRPESON:  Did she, in that meeting tell you the names of the 
people who should be members of that committee without you, the 
beneficiaries, having made that decision yourselves? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  She 
said she came for the election of the committee with our assistance, 
therefore we should nominate the names or pick – ja nominate the 
people or the names of the people that we want to be in the committee.  
10 
So she only came for the names of the people that should be in the 
committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did she say you must decide who must be in the 
committee and she would take those names? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  That is 
correct, we nominated the names of the three people who were to be a 
part of the committee and we also gave them the positions there, it was 
the Chairperson, secretary and treasure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Ms Interpreter you may just have to think about 
the correct word when you nominate it means that somebody else will 
20 
still decide if you select or elect you decide. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  We 
selected them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and did Ms Meyer accept the names that you, the 
beneficiaries, selected? 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 61 of 217 
 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  That is 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From what you have now clarified, it seems to me that 
you shouldn’t have said that Ms Meyer elected or selected the people 
because you are the people who decided on the three people to form 
the committee. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  That is 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you understand the difference now? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  Yes I 
10 
do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Ms Meyer simply took the names that you gave 
her? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair for the clarification and we 
now know that Mr June David Mahlaba was the Chair, who was the 
secretary? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  Lindiwe 
Masiteng. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And who did you elect as a treasurer? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  James 
Ngqousini. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  I will spell it for the record Chair, it’s 
Ngqosini (name spelt). 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 62 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let’s proceed. 
ADV 
ZINHLE 
BUTHELEZI: 
 
Thank 
you 
and 
what 
was 
your 
understanding for the selection of this committee, what was it going to 
do for you guys? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  They 
were going to be our representatives whenever there’s meetings with 
agricultural – agriculture officials they are our eyes and ears on any 
activities around this project and come back and report to us. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And did that happen? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  It did 
10 
not even happen, even once. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you, in the same…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you – I’m sorry did you continue to see members 
of this committee over time and if you did, did you not ask them, what 
is happening you’re not reporting back to us, why? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):   May I 
place in on record Chair that Lindiwe Masiteng, the Chairperson, she 
had a business, she was selling food, so we would meet her on that 
level when we’re interacting in her business she will say, there are 
things to tell you, but we’ll sit with Alta and there are things we must 
20 
tell you but there’s not time here to sit down and tell you about those 
things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What about the other members of the committee, did 
you see them from time to time and ask them, why are you people not 
reporting back to us, what is happening? 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 63 of 217 
 
MR 
MESHACK 
MPALENI 
NCONGWANE 
(through 
interpreter):  
Unfortunately the only member of the committee I would see or interact 
with it’s Lindiwe Masiteng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Mr Ncongwane so the two other 
members, Mr Mahlaba and Mr Ngqousini were they locals, were they 
from Vrede or were they from the other parts of Mpumelela 
Municipality? 
INTERPRETER:  What’s the other place? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Or were they from either Warden or Memel? 
10 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  They 
are also from Vrede. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why did – if they were also staying within Vrede why 
didn’t the leadership of the Vrede chapter of the African Farmers 
Association go to one or both of the and confront them and say, why 
are you people not coming back to report to us? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  It was 
not easy for them to come to us because they were basically giving us 
– running away from us so it was not easy to have this conversation 
20 
with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So they were avoiding you in other words? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you and in the same paragraph 13 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 64 of 217 
 
you mention that you – when you did not get any reports you became 
concerned and you reported – or you took your concerns to the media, 
when was the first time you reported this matter to the media? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  Around 
2013. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And what was happening, what was your 
main concern when you raised this issue with the media in 2013? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  The 
person who brought the media to us it was Dr Radebe from DA he’s the 
one who came with Mail & Guardian. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember Ms Buthelezi we just want to see what it is 
that he wants to tell us that’s different from what Mr Dhlamini told us, I 
mean a lot of these things are unlikely to be controversial. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you, I’ll proceed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so just focus on establishing from him those things 
that he wants to tell me which Mr Dhlamini might not have covered or 
those things that Mr Dhlamini covered but he has a different 
recollection of what happened, otherwise I don’t want us to go through 
the same thing in circumstances where it’s unlikely to be disputed. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  Other than what we have 
20 
already told us, with regards to the third meeting and the election of 
beneficiaries what else would you like to tell us, wasn’t told by Mr 
Dhlamini when he gave his evidence earlier on? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  I 
remember the visit by DA the year was…(intervention). 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 65 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second, she’s asking you, only in 
relation to the third meeting. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  Okay I 
wanted to tell the Chairperson about the other things that I know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no the question was whether there was – 
there’s anything that Mr Dhlamini did not cover in relation to the third 
meeting or that he covered but you have a different recollection in 
regard to the third meeting, once you have dealt with that she will move 
on to something else. 
MR 
MESHACK 
MPALENI 
NCONGWANE 
(through 
interpreter):  
10 
Everything is covered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I think move on to the fourth meeting. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes let’s move to the fourth meeting.  Yes 
this is when – the meeting that was also attended by Ms Alta Meyer, is 
there anything that you would like to add from what Mr Dhlamini told us 
already? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  The 
fourth meeting is about the FDC, isn’t it? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  In that 
20 
meeting I was not present, I was in Durban. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   So what is contained in this statement it’s 
what was reported to you by Mr Dhlamini, is that correct? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  Yes 
correct. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 66 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay  then let’s move to the fifth meeting, did  you 
attend the fifth meeting? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  At the 
time when Mr Ace Magashule was in the meeting? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NCONGWANE (through interpreter):  Nothing 
much was said – nothing much was brought or said by Mr Magashule on 
that day, it is exactly like what Mr Dhlamini has explained it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Though 
10 
I was amongst the group which was there on the day of the meeting 
with Mr Magashule but I am one of the people who remained behind 
because of the transport.  So I did not go to this dairy itself – the 
project – where the project was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was not enough transport? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  There 
was not enough transport. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  Then you deal with other 
meetings that followed.  The first one being the meeting it was with 
20 
MEC Mamiki Qabathe.  Is there anything you wish to add? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  No.  
That is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And then the next meeting that you deal 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 67 of 217 
 
with is a meeting with Mr – you saying it is Modiba but Chair the correct 
surname it is Madiba.  It is an official from the Department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Let us ask him this question.  You – you 
have confirmed that you listened to Mr Dhlamini’s evidence you 
remember that? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Yes I 
did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are other meetings that Mr Dhlamini spoke 
about.  Did you – is there anything that he said about those meetings if 
you did attend them that does not accord with your recollection or that 
10 
he did not cover that you wish to cover? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  What I 
can talk about Your Worship it is the meeting with Mr Madiba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the correct spelling? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It is M a d i b a it is not M o – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  Thank you tell us about that 
meeting? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Okay 
what happened is to talk about the meeting with Mr Madiba.  There was 
a venue where the meeting was held but he delayed coming to the 
20 
venue where the meeting was to take place.  He started at the Mayor’s 
office in the Town Hall for private meeting which lasted about one and a 
half hours.  And then after that they then all came together.  It was Mr 
Madiba, the Mayor, Mr Kolbene and the other officials were there.  The 
meeting was called or hosted by us.  Myself and Mr Dhlamini so we 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 68 of 217 
 
called him into a meeting.  On his arrival at the venue he then took 
over the meeting as if he was the one who called the meeting.  That did 
not sit well with us.  Then there was now – it was now time for 
questions then Mr Dhlamini asked the question, who called the 
meeting?  Is it you who called the meeting or is it us who called the 
meeting?  Because we had an agenda.  We had questions that we 
wanted to put in that meeting.  After that question was asked they then 
admitted to say, okay let us proceed with the meeting in the way that 
you have planned it or according to your agenda.  It was at that stage 
unfortunately when Mr Dhlamini then walked away from the meeting.  
10 
We then asked the question, are we still beneficiaries to this project 
and if indeed we are still the beneficiaries then I personally have a 
question?  Even if I am being told that you are no longer beneficiaries 
to this project I still have a question to ask.  Then I then requested Mr 
Madiba because he is the one that we have invited into the meeting 
that please consider that there is elderly people in this meeting.  Then 
we requested him not to be political when responding to issues.  Just 
respond clearly without being political about the issues that we want to 
get clarity on.  And then one of the community members asked a 
question from Vrede asked a question as to whether is this project a 
20 
government project or is it a community project?  His response was no 
it is a government project.   
INTERPRETER:  I [indistinct] clarity Your Worship I did not understand 
this. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  And 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 69 of 217 
 
then the next question after the question which was asked is one 
person from or community member from Memel asked a question if are 
we still beneficiaries?  Or each time when there is a Chairperson is 
coming to attend – Chief Directors attending a meeting we will have to 
reregister our names or register our names each time that they come or 
are we beneficiaries towards this project?  Or each time when new 
people come to a meeting – Chief Directors come to a meeting we have 
to reregister as beneficiaries. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Mr Ncongwane please make us understand 
what Mr Madiba said to you on that meeting? 
10 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  He 
explained as to what is a beneficiary. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  He even 
explained as to the fact that he was still new in this position of being a 
Chief Director so he is not familiar with the activities around that 
project.  Those are the only two issues he touched on not any other 
matters. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So the issue of the beneficiaries 
reregistering when a new Chief Director is appointed where did that 
20 
come from? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  It is 
because of what he said Mr Madiba himself that he was new in the 
position so he did not – he was not familiar with the activities around 
that project hence that question came up.  He even said that there 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 70 of 217 
 
should be a screening – screening of the beneficiaries to be done like 
is there – are there any elderly people in – amongst the beneficiaries 
are those – that have cases?  And if there are those who are employed 
– employed somewhere else. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and what else transpired during that 
meeting? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Not 
from Mr Madiba there was nothing else that happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you or anybody among the beneficiaries ask him 
why he needed beneficiaries to be screened and why it was relevant 
10 
whether beneficiaries were elderly people and whether some of them 
were employed elsewhere.  Did you ask him what was the relevance of 
those factors? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  My 
question was when should this screening should have taken place or 
has taken – ja should have taken place because already at that time 
the dairy was running or already functioning so I wonder if I get it right 
Your Worship so can I just? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I think he said the dairy had been running for 
three years. 
20 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Three 
years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say that Mr Ncongwane? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Yes I 
said so. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 71 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was the answer that you were given? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Nothing 
further was said and there was not response – nothing further was said 
after that and Mr Madiba was first to attend that meeting we called. It is 
not like he came there voluntarily into a meeting we had summoned him 
to attend or called him to attend the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we will go – we will go back to what was 
discussed at the meeting and how the meeting ended.  But let me find 
out.  What was the purpose for you calling him to the meeting? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  We – 
10 
we had concerns like time – the concern was the time that has lapsed 
of the FDC having consulted or come to us – visiting us or coming back 
to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say that your concern was the time that had 
lapsed since the FDC had taken over but without them having consulted 
with you? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  They 
promised to come back to those who were in the meeting two weeks – 
in two weeks’ time and they did not return. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And about how much time had lapsed by the time you 
20 
called Mr Madiba to come to the meeting? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Quite a 
while Your Worship – a year I am assuming it is a year because these 
meetings were not sitting constantly after one – each – or after each 
meeting.  So it was almost a year or a year. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 72 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or more than a year? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Another 
problem that – or concern that we have was about the people who took 
our ID’s we did not know where were they going to use our ID’s or what 
exactly were they going to do with our ID’s.  And – because we are not 
benefiting anything from that and the concern was what if thereafter we 
have a problem with SARS since they took our ID’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is with the South African Revenue Service? 
10 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  So you wanted Mr Madiba to come and 
explain or give you answers to these questions? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ask these questions? 
MR 
MESHACK 
MPALENI 
NC0NGWANE 
[through 
Interpreter]:  
Regarding the concern that we have with South African Revenue 
Service no.  We only asked if – are we still beneficiaries to this project 
or not? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and what else was discussed at the meeting you 
20 
have not covered yet and how did the meeting end? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Nothing 
much was discussed after that.  What he suggested that since he was 
new in his position rather we reregister as beneficiaries and then we 
have the next – the meeting be postponed until December. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 73 of 217 
 
ADV 
ZINHLE 
BUTHELEZI: 
 
Did 
you 
agree 
to 
reregister 
as 
beneficiaries? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  It was 
at that stage when this person or community member from Memel asked 
the question.  Is it going to be a position where – a situation where 
when there is a new Chief Director we will have to reregister as 
beneficiaries or what is going to be the position? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes but was the issue resolved or the 
meeting was postponed without having resolved the issue? 
MR 
MESHACK 
MPALENI 
NC0NGWANE 
[through 
Interpreter]:  
10 
Resolving this question or dissolving the meeting? 
ADV 
ZINHLE 
BUTHELEZI: 
 
Yes 
of 
being 
beneficiaries 
and 
reregistering? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  There 
was no response towards that question.  What was said is that we will 
have further discussion when we meet again. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did another meeting take place between the 
beneficiaries as an – and Mr Madiba? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  There 
20 
was – not in that year until the following in March we then approach 
Agriculture or we went to Agriculture to find out as to what is 
happening.  So we went personally there to find out what is happening.  
That was the last time.  We did not get any response on – when we 
went there to find out as to what was happening in March. No response 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 74 of 217 
 
that we got and that was the last time we saw Mr Madiba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  You said – at that stage it has been 
three years since the dairy started operating.  Should I assume that it 
was around 2016? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  I hope 
so because the FDC was there in 2015.  I think so but the words he 
uses I hope so because FDC was already in existence by 2015. 
ADV MUZI SIKHAKHANE:  Okay thank you.  Then there is another 
meeting that you make reference to that was attended by Doctor 
10 
Masiteng.  It is in paragraph 20 of your statement.  You are saying it is 
2013/2014?  I believe you wanted to make a correction there. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  I wish 
to correct the date that date is not correct.  The 2012/2014 date is not 
correct. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And what could be your estimate there? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  I think 
it was somewhere in 2017.  Wait, wait.  Not 2017 no, no, it is not 2017.  
I think it was somewhere in 2018. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So it is very recent? 
20 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Correct 
it is just recent. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  We understand that you are not 
committing to times as you have explained earlier that you were not 
keeping records.  But I am interested of whether Mr – did Mr Dhlamini 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 75 of 217 
 
cover everything that happened during this meeting with Doctor 
Masiteng? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Yes he 
explained everything. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Did you attend this meeting? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Yes I 
was. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And then you then deal with the meeting 
that was with the DA.  Do you remember when this meeting was? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  The 
10 
first meeting we had with DA it was in 2015 23 August that is the first 
meeting we had with DA.  They asked us as to whether were we aware 
of the name of the project initially when it was initiated, what was the 
name of the project? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes so the information you giving us now 
was not covered by Mr Dhlamini is that correct? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes proceed. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Okay 
the first name was Mahoma-Mobung and that was the first name of the 
20 
project and then now there was a second name which is Vrede Dairy.  
Then the third name was now Community Dairy.  All these name when 
they were changed we were not aware.  Basically we were never 
consulted about the name changing of this dairy project.  One minute 
we would see that it is Mahoma-Mobung the next thing it is Vrede Dairy 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 76 of 217 
 
Product and the next thing it is Community Dairy.  As to why – what was 
influencing the changes of the names we did not know.  And then DA 
told – Mr Roy from DA then told us that there were Indians who were 
involved in this project.  They left the project in 2015 but he told us 
that they have shares into the project to the amount of 2.5 million.   
INTERPRETER:  Your Worship I need clarity now in terms of this 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  You had a meeting with Mr 
Jankielsohn, Mr Roy Jankielsohn, is that correct? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  That is 
10 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What did he say to you? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  He 
explained to us about the – when this project was initiated it was not 
legitimate.  It was not done procedurally.  They did not follow procedure 
because it was supposed to be initiated from the Parliament like first.  
It was first supposed to be is it promulgated in Parliament first?  I am 
not sure if the term is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Approved. 
MR 
MESHACK 
MPALENI 
NC0NGWANE 
[through 
Interpreter]:  
20 
Approved in Parliament first since it was a big project.  Okay 
Mosebenzi Zwane and them those who were leading the project they 
took the list to Parliament but I am not sure Your Worship I need clarity 
whether the list is the list of beneficiaries?  The proposal – they were – 
they took the proposal to Parliament those who were leading the project 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 77 of 217 
 
they then took it to Parliament Mosebenzi Zwane was one of them.  
Alright.  When this draft of a proposal to taken to Parliament they – it 
was then discovered that those – the beneficiaries in that project were 
Indian people.  He then – Roy Jankielsohn noticed that from this 
proposal draft it was the Indian people who were going to benefit from 
this project but not black people from South Africa.  It was when Mr 
Jankielsohn questioned as to why are the beneficiaries of this project 
are Indian people where are the black people?  Only to discover that 
there were none.  When Mr Jankielsohn was informing us about this 
information it was at the stage when these Indian people were leaving 
10 
the project.  And then he informed us that these Indian people since 
they are leaving the project their shares that they got from this project 
are 2. – According to him 2. Something million.  And then he was asking 
from an office that dealt or was dealing with the shares and said, where 
are the shares of the black people?  It was basically the shares of the 
black beneficiaries and then they said here they are they were 91 
million for the black beneficiaries.  That was the meeting we held with 
DA the year 2015 in August. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes Chair I could see we are already into 
lunch. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I – that is fine but I want us to finish with the 
witness. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  The witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that when we come back we have another witness. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 78 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  Yes.  Was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that all you wanted to tell us about that meeting? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  That is 
all yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Is there anything else that Ms Dhlamini did not 
cover that you think is important to tell me? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  No.  We 
covered almost everything.  That is the only thing that he did not 
10 
mention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Chair may I – I just need to ask 
him a few questions? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Have you ever been to the dairy farm 
yourself? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  I went 
there at the time when there was DA and Mr Maimane and then the 
following day there was going to be a visit from – no not the following 
20 
day – oh the previous day – okay I went twice.  When there was Mr 
Masiteng a day before.   
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Sorry then I do not get it. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  I went 
on the day when there was DA. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 79 of 217 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And you were saying the previous day you 
were – you had a meeting with Doctor Masiteng, is that right? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Was that the first time you were at the 
dairy? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you subsequently been to the dairy? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no subsequently.  Was that the only time you 
10 
went there or have you subsequently gone there? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Oh we 
had veld fires so we went there not as a project Your Worship. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  But on 
– as individuals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  And you – did you attend the 
20 
meeting with the Public Protector that was this year, May? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  May 
2019 – I am not sure but it was in May this year. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  2019. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:   May 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 80 of 217 
 
this year. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Did you attend that meeting?  Are you 
happy with what Mr Dhlamini told us? 
INTERPRETER:  Sorry what was the last portion of your question? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Are you happy with what Mr Dhlamini told 
us regarding that meeting? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Yes I 
am happy. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And did you make a statement with the 
Hawks? 
10 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Yes I 
did. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Do you remember when it was? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  The 
statements it was – I think there was a mistake around the dates.  It 
was last year.  It was in 2018 when the – January when we took – the 
statements were taken by the Hawks. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Oh okay thank you.  And there were media 
reports that the farmers in Vrede travelled to Bloemfontein when Mr 
Zwane was appointed as a MEC.  Did you take part in that trip? 
20 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Indeed 
it is correct.  Ja we travelled in a combi and then we went there indeed. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Why did you go there? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  We 
were happy that a person from our area or where we stay Your Worship 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 81 of 217 
 
has been nominated as a MEC maybe that will bring change Your 
Worship in our area where we stay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Butheleze. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We said we only want to cover what he thinks Mr 
Dhlamini did not cover or what he – what Mr Dhlamini said which does 
not accord with his recollection. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  I understand Chair I thought this was not 
covered by Mr Dhlamini. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us wrap up.  Let us wrap up. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It may be my mistake thank you.  And do 
you remember if the trip to Bloemfontein was before or after the dairy 
project was started? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  It was 
before. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  One last issue that I want you 
to deal with.  The threats that Mr Dhlamini testified about were you – 
are you aware of any threats that were made?  Or are there any threats 
that were made to you? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  I am 
20 
aware or I do have knowledge of the threats all of them.  Because what 
happened is when we left after we buried Mr Ngwenya we were going 
back to our homes.  Before we could even reach our homes someone 
said if I am not mistaken the two of you are in the list. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And have you personally reported to any of 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 82 of 217 
 
the law enforcement officials? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  The 
person who reported that was Mr – the threats it is Mr Dhlamini not 
myself.  I have never reported it. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  That is all Chair.  I have no further 
questions for the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I take it that you do not have any further matter that 
you want to bring to my attention other than what Mr Dhlamini has 
brought to my attention and what you have said, is that correct? 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  While I 
10 
am grateful to everything that Mr Dhlamini Your Worship has – Chair 
has said before the commission we are always together and it is exactly 
what happened.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  We are 
always together. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no that is fine.  I was saying what Mr Dhlamini 
has said and what you have said so both of you have made a 
contribution it is not like it Mr Dhlamini only.   
MR MESHACK MPALENI NC0NGWANE [through Interpreter]:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you very much Mr Mcongwane for coming 
to give evidence before the commission we are grateful for having come 
to give evidence.  Thank you very much.  You are excused.

DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  (duly sworn, states) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Thank you Chairman.  Dr Masiteng if you go 
to page of your statement - there is a witness bundle on your table.  To 
your left there are some reference files that I will point you to as and 
when it becomes necessary to do so but for now we are just going to 
have a look at the document that is in front of you.  So if you go to 
page 1 – oh Chairman my apologies. 
My colleague is reminding me that I have forgotten to 
introduce - to – to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The exhibit. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Explain that we are now dealing with EXHIBIT 
20 
HH5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The lever arch file containing the statement of 
Dr Tankisi Janki Masiteng will be marked EXHIBIT HH5. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Thank you Chairman.  I will be make … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I must just check.  Your middle name is it 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 85 of 217 
 
pronounced as Janki or Yanki? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Janki. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Janki? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Thank you Chairman.  I will also be – be 
using the reference bundles this afternoon.  We have now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which one? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  It is A, B, C and D.  They have now divided 
them into four instead of three files because they were too tight when 
10 
they were just – it is the reference bundle Chairman but we are not 
there yet.  I was just indicating that we will be going there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I want to put it closer because nobody put it closer 
for me. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman I am just very quickly definitely B, 
definitely A I know and B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got A and B. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Thank you Chairman.  From my notes those 
are the two that seem to be the critical ones. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  For this afternoons purposes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Are we going to be needing the media bundle? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  We should not Chairman.  I – I just asked the 
Registrar to leave it here in case … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 86 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But I – I doubt it very much.  I – thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Dr Masiteng if you could go to page 1 of your 
sworn affidavit and as you hold that page if you could just also look at 
page 6 of the same document and .. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – I see that it looks like there is a new hand in 
terms of what is happening.  An affidavit is a sworn statement.  So I 
see that we are having sworn affidavits.  It is double sworn. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes.  So the first sworn is tautology and as 
the legal team we did not pick it up.  Our apologies but you are correct 
10 
Chairman and I always say that as you make comments the rest of us 
pick up on things that – ja we can improve on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But that is absolutely correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes.  So it is in fact an affidavit because it is 
a sworn statement as an affidavit.  The Chairman is correct.  Could you 
confirm your names on page 1?  Is that you? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And then could you then confirm on page 6 
20 
who the deponent is whose – whose signature rather appears where the 
word “deponent” is? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  That … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Whose signature? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  That is my signature. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 87 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Is that your signature and on what date and 
at what place did you sign this affidavit? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  It was signed at Bloemfontein on 
28 June 2019. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Thank you.  You are familiar with its 
contents? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  I am familiar with the contents. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  You have of course given us a very short 
affidavit in respect of the – the matters you will be testifying to but you 
have also taken the liberty of annexing a rather voluminous annex – 
10 
annexure which represents the court papers that are part of the court 
record which you would like us to refer to. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  You confirm that you have been cited as a 
party both – well in the Asset Forfeiture Application that the National 
Prosecuting Authority brought and that you also have been facing 
criminal prosecution in respect of the criminal matters brought but that 
in respect of the criminal matter that case has been withdrawn against 
you? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And your full explanation of everything you 
did you say is in this voluminous annexure that you have … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Favoured … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 88 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  The Commission with? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Thank you.  Dr Masiteng I think it is useful 
just to start off with who you are, what you do.  Just the present before 
we delve into the past. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Who – who are you qualification wise?  What 
do you do currently? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:

much

Province.  I – in terms of the qualification I – I have a Doctorate 
Degree in Agriculture.  I have completed it in 2004 from the Central 
University of Technology. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes.  Then prior to being appointed HOD –

appointed head of department? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Through you Chairperson.  I – I am

Page 89 of 217 
 
Project matter.  So you know that is where we are going to but I think it 
would be useful for us to start at a slightly different point with first 
when you joined the department and whether it was called the 
Department of Agriculture and Rural Development when you joined.  I 
think it will be - that history will inform the Chairman of the context with 
– in which some of the decisions that we will be discussing were taken 
in. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So just tell us a little bit when you joined the 
department? 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG: 
 
Chairperson 
I 
– 
I 
joined 
the 
Department of Agriculture when it was still in the homeland.  In the 
Qwaqwa Homeland and in 1996 after the elections after 1994 we – we 
then moved into the province.  We became the Free State Province and 
one Department of Agriculture but I resigned in – in 2000 and I joined 
the - the Central University of Technology. 
At that time it was Technicon Free State as a full time 
lecturer and I re-joined the department as a Deputy Director 
responsible for extension and foot security.  That was in – in 2002 and I 
was promoted then to the Director’s position responsible for a district.  
20 
In – in the province we have four districts plus a metro but in total let 
us say there are five. 
I – I was appointed to head one of those districts which is 
Xhariep.  I was then moved into head office to be responsible for 
Farmer Support and Development and I was acting a Chief Director 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 90 of 217 
 
responsible for Agricultural Development Support the position which I 
was appointed to.  That is Agricultural Development Support but in 
2012 I was then moved - 1 April – I was then moved to District Services 
the position which I – I was holding until the 24 t h or I am still holding. 
I just paused when I was then appointed to act as a – as a 
head of the department. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So in the period 2012 to 2016 specifically you 
a Chief Director in the Department of Agriculture and Rural 
Development? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Do you know Mr Peter Thabethe the former 
HOD of the department? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, yes I know. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  You served under him? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  I served under him. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Good. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Can you just give the Chairman a short 
summary of the – his – his move – his promotion to HOD and really I 
am more interested in the organogram and how it changed because it is 
20 
important for the Chairman to be able to understand how or at what 
stage the then HOD Mr Thabethe took office. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG: 
 
Okay. 
 Thank you 
very 
much 
Chairperson.  What – what we had we had the Department of 
Agriculture.  At that time we did not have Rural Development.  Rural 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 91 of 217 
 
Development was with Public Works.  Then Rural Development was 
moved to the Department of Agriculture and then we had sort of two 
departments. 
That is the Department of Rural Development and the 
Department of Agriculture and in 2010 Mr Thabethe was appointed as 
an HOD for Rural Development.  That was in 2010 and he moved to 
Agriculture.  It was the same department we now call the Department of 
Agriculture and Rural Development but with two HODs.  We had the 
head of the Department for Agriculture. 
We also had the head of the Department for Rural 
10 
Development.  So only in 2012 he then moved to – to Agriculture.  
There was that movement.  The – the HOD for – for agriculture moved 
to rural development and the HOD for rural development moved to 
agriculture. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Who takes those decisions transferring 
officials from one post to another? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  That – that will be the – the Executive 
decision that is the movement of the HODs and that is the responsibility 
of the Premier together with the Executive Council. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you speak about two HODs one for the 
20 
Department of Agriculture.  Another one being the Department of Rural 
Development. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you talking about these two being separate 
departments or are you talking about them being sections within the 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 92 of 217 
 
same department? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  It is – it is one department with two 
HODs.  It is – it is no more the Department of Agriculture only.  It is 
now the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development with two 
HODs and one Executive authority.  One MEC but two HODs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but there cannot be two heads of the same 
department.  Was the arrangement such that one of them enjoyed the 
rank of HOD but the – there was one of them who was the HOD? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what … 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was what the position was? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  That is why we were using different 
terms. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  The one for agriculture we call it an 
accounting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes and then the rural development 
was an HOD but that was corrected … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Because then we had to have one 
department and one HOD. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So what do you have currently?  One 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 93 of 217 
 
department and one HOD? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  One HOD. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  When Mr Peter Thabethe was there - and I 
specifically want to look at the period 2012/2013/2014/2015 and 2016 - 
in that period was that transitional period where you still had the two – 
two heads of department? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes.  That was 2010/2011/2012/2013.  
No, no ja.  I think it was up to 2012 and then we had one HOD … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Which was then Mr Thabethe. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Ja. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  There was an interview and then it 
was – Mr Thabethe was responsible for them both agriculture and rural 
development. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  As the Accounting Officer? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  As the Accounting Officer now. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So 2013 he took sole responsibility for 
decisions that had to be made? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But even in 2012 he would take responsibility 
20 
for anything that happened within agriculture? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And at that time you were a Chief Director 
within agriculture? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 94 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So you reported to Mr Thabethe? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  In terms of the organogram I report to 
the HOD. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Maybe you just very quickly want to take the 
Chairman through that organogram.  I know that you have annexed it to 
your papers. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes.  In – in terms of the organogram 
that is - in terms of the organogram structure … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Just one minute – one minute. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Okay. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Page 2-6-8 Chairman and we must apologise 
for the quality of the copy Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Mr – Dr Masiteng has undertaken to try and 
find a better copy for us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Better copies, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  We – we are now telling everybody that you 
have a keen interest in them supplying us with documents and – and so 
you helped Chairman … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  By asking Mr Venter for documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 95 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am at 2-6-8. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Okay.  Now thanks Chair.  In terms of 
the organogram – organisational structure the Member of the Executive 
Council responsible for – for the Department of Agriculture and Rural 
Development is the (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I must just – I am sorry to interrupt you Dr Masiteng.  
This one – this – this copy is just so poor. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  It is a very poor copy Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not worth even looking at it.  That is just how bad 
it is. 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I cannot read much but you can explain. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is okay. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes.  The – the Executive – the 
Member of the Executive Council is actually responsible for the 
Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and it is a political 
head of the department. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And then just pause for one second so that 
we tidy this up immediately. 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  2012/2013 who was that political head of the 
department? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  At that time it was Mr Zwane. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Thank you. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 96 of 217 
 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Please proceed. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So Mr Zwane was the executing authority … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  And (intervenes). 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Followed by the HOD. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  By the HOD. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  The Accounting Officer … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Huh-uh. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And you were a level below that? 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  And then you have – yes you have 
legs.  You will have a CFO as a let us call it a Chief Directorate as a 
standalone.  It reports directly to the accounting office.  You will have 
what we call the District Services which is the Chief Directorate that I 
am – I am heading.  Then you have another Chief Directorate which is 
let us call it Agricultural Development Support and Livelihoods or let us 
simplify it by saying it is professional services. 
It is a Chief Directorate on its own.  It is headed by another 
Chief Director.  At that time it was an Acting Chief Director but there 
was a stage when there was a – a person who was transferred from 
20 
Mpumalanga to Free State who took over that Chief Directorate and you 
will also have monitoring and evaluation as a – as a Chief Directorate.  
You will also have Corporate Services. 
So in total you would have five Chief Directorates under the 
Accounting Officer. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 97 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But again context is important.  For purposes 
of the Vrede Dairy Farm matter.  The critical elements of the 
organogram that you are sketching … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And please correct me if I am interpreting 
your evidence incorrectly.  First you have got the MEC.  Well above the 
MEC of course you have got the Premier? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  With an Exco made up of MECs? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Okay.  So you have the MEC for the 
Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.  You then have the 
HOD who is the Accounting Officer.  You then have District Services 
Chief Directorate.  That is where you sit? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But you also have the CFO you have told us. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Huh-uh. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Who would report to the – the HOD. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  The Accounting Officer yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Accounting Officer. 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Are those the critical parts of the organogram 
for purposes of what we are dealing with today? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes.  There are – those are the most 
critical ones.  Then after them you will have different legs, different 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 98 of 217 
 
Director – Directorates.  For District Services you will five Directors 
because each and every district we have appointed a Director – a 
Senior Manager for that matter. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Can you tell the Chairman what the difference 
districts are within the Free State Province? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  You have Thabo Mofutsanyana. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And then pause.  Explain please to the 
Chairman is – is the town of Vrede … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Situated in Thabo Mofutsanyana? 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Thank you.  Continue. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Under Thabo Mofutsanyana you have 
Vrede Dairy and other projects and we have classified Thabo 
Mofutsanyana as our dairy hub because you also have other dairy 
projects.  The District Director at that time it was Alta Meyer as an 
acting.  That is why you will hear a lot of Alta … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Confusion, ja. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  She was acting as a District Director 
and she was not only looking after one project which is Vrede Dairy.  
She was looking at other projects but it is – it was her responsibility to 
every now and then keep in touch with the beneficiaries.  So there is 
nothing untoward over the hearing of Alta Meyer.  It was her 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 99 of 217 
 
responsibility. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Then the person who was appointed 
for the position was Mr George Madiba.  That is why you will hear again 
the mentioning of Mr George Madiba – George Madiba.  He was 
actually appointed as a District Director but Alta Meyer because she 
was a Project Coordinator then she was every now and then involved in 
the affairs of the projects and so on and so forth but you also have now 
the extension officers in all the towns. 
Vrede for instance will have its own extension officer but we 
10 
also strengthen that by appointing the foot security let us call them 
officers.  Those are at the lower level to strengthen the foot security 
more especially in this red spot sort of towns like Vrede where poverty 
is high. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Well while we are dealing with names of 
people who – who had been mentioned in witnesses’ evidence and you 
speak 
of 
extension 
officers 
and 
the 
foot 
security 
officials.  
Thuto Kganye is he one of the people who works at lower level within … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  The structure of the organisation? 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Locate him for the Chairman please. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Thuto was more of a - a foot security 
officer at the lower level and at a contractual sort of a basis.  It was 
not a permanent appointment. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 100 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And – and people like that would be 
appointed by whom? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG: 
 
They 
are 
appointed 
by 
the 
department. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  At what level is he appointed?  At HOD level 
or at Chief Directorship level or at District Directorship level?  I just 
want to know who had the authority to appoint in this instance we are 
talking about Thuto Kganye. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes.  All the appointments in the 
department are done by the HOD unless delegated depending on the 
10 
levels but even though they are delegated the HOD must know that 
there is – we are going to have let us say five in Thabo Mofutsanyana.  
We are going to have six in Xhariep and so on and so forth. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So the HOD would actually be appointing all 
Senior Managers within the Free State Administration, all Middle 
Managers and even junior officials within the Free State Administration 
in all five districts … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  That is right. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And there is a metro. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Okay.  That is why I said unless 
20 
delegated.  Now what happened is that the delegation is such that the 
HOD will be responsible for the – for the Chief Directors and – and the 
Senior Managers.  The Deputy Directors and the Assistant Directors will 
be appointed by the Chief Directors and so it goes but the information 
must be discussed at that level of the HOD to be – to be informed as an 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 101 of 217 
 
Accounting Officer that there will be appointments not necessarily 
meaning that the HOD will be sitting there conducting the interviews 
and so on and so forth. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  The other name that has come up in the 
evidence that has been placed before the Chairman is that of 
Xolisa Sibeko.  Is that a name you are familiar with also from the Vrede 
area? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  I am familiar with that.  At Vrede I 
think there – there were two people who were appointed as – as foot 
soldiers for foot security purposes … 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  But I think I must – that one I must 
verify properly Chairperson but yes I know at Vrede we appointed not 
only one person. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And you – you are taking an educated guess 
and saying it would have been Thuto Kganye … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  And … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And Xolisa Sibeko. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, yes, yes Chairperson. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  They have of course been mentioned in the 
20 
affidavit of Mr Dhlamini who gave evidence earlier today and yesterday 
… 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And that of Mr Ncongwane. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 102 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Mr Jimmy Pashell is another name that has 
come up.  Is that an official within your department as well who you 
know about? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Jimmy – Jimmy is an extension 
officer.  Jimmy is at a much higher level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And extension officer would be at what level in 
relation to a Director – a Chief Director and so on? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  You – you will have the Director.  You 
will also have a Deputy Director.  You will have an Assistant Director 
and the controls.  Then you will have the technical staff that will be the 
10 
extension officers, the (indistinct) technicians. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  While we are on this topic it would be 
interesting to understand the difference in functions of the extension 
officer and the food security officers and I say this – I really want to be 
quite frank because the evidence that has been led so far seems to 
imply that the food security officers were simply henchmen of the MEC 
and if I got that wrong I will correct it but that is the impression I have 
20 
had from the evidence that has been led. 
Please explain these roles to us because we now know they 
are located in your department – the Department of Agriculture and 
Rural Development.  We now know that you as a Chief Director know 
about these particular appointees.  Can you tell us a little more 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 103 of 217 
 
because you – you are able to and willing to? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  The extension officer is a Manager of 
that particular ward.  If we appoint an extension officer for Vrede that 
person is a Manager of that town.  Now under that you would have 
administrators but the foot soldiers they report to the extension officer 
and they are assigned with responsibilities of establishing a foot 
security gardens and other foot security initiatives. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  What qualification does one need to become a 
food what did you say? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Hm. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  You seem to say soldier.  So I do not want to 
get it wrong. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes.  On that one we – it can be at a 
Matric level plus maybe the training courses that are you are already 
having or that the department will take you through. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But will you … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  You do not have to have a formal 
qualification like an extension officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry but were you saying food soldier or foot 
solider? 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Ja, foot soldier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Foot soldier? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Thank – thank you Chairman.  I was going to 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 104 of 217 
 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman, I did want clarity on 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, it’s foot soldier. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But the official term is a food security 
officer, what’s their title. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  They are officers, they are just 
officers but at the lower level you do have a district coordinator, food 
security coordinators, those ones are almost at the similar level like the 
10 
extensions officers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe we should ask is of these people who would 
you put under the label of foot soldiers, so when you talk about foot 
soldier were you referring to a category of officers in the Department or 
were you referring to a specific person or was that just ...[intervenes]  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  A Freudian slip. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I’m trying to understand because it may be that in 
a way as acting head of the Department you see the Department as 
being in a way on or in a war, maybe against poverty, and you have got 
foot soldiers in this battle, in this war against poverty and maybe that’s 
20 
the context you are using the term foot soldiers, so I am trying to 
understand what you – who you may have been referring to. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Thank you very much Chairperson.  
The whole District Services we always refer to it as the cold face of the 
department.  Those are the people who must be closer to – those are 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 105 of 217 
 
the officials who must be closer to the people.  Now you have these 
ones that I am referring to, it is just a term that I have used. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no I understand but I wanted to know 
whether there is a category of officers that you regard as the foot 
soldiers of the department and if that is the case I wanted to 
understand that, or whether it’s not like they are – there are certain 
categories of officers that you refer to as foot soldiers, it is just a term 
that you could use to refer to anybody in the department, that is 
working for the department. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No we always refer the ones that are 
10 
actually doing this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the cold face? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and those would be extension officers? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Those will be extension officers, will 
be the food security officers, will be the animal health technicians. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Will be the soil conservation 
technicians. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Will be also, the graduate economics 
yes they are because they are at the district level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  And those are, ja those are the key 
ones, and we also have the project officers, those are the ones that we 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 106 of 217 
 
refer to as the cold face. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those are the ones who interact with the public and 
with the farmers, with the community on a daily basis? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But to extend the question the Chairman 
has just asked who would then be monitoring and overseeing projects 
in the District and I use in this instance the example of the Vrede Dairy 
Project, so of the personnel you’ve just told us about who would be 
interacting with a project such as the Vrede Dairy Project? 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Ja, what happened is this the District 
Services will only wait if the project is under construction until a 
completion certificate is issued but where a project is completed the 
District Services had to interact, that will also include the project 
coordinators and so on and so forth, but in this case of a Vrede Project 
remember an implementing agent was appointed so the District did not 
have a role as such to play, except to interact with the beneficiaries 
and also the professional services, that one that has got the engineers, 
that has got the economies, that has got the research house and so on, 
they did not have that much role to play because an implementing 
20 
agent was appointed. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Good we are going to come back to that 
when we’re looking at the agreement on Estina, I am really trying to get 
a broad sense and to understand how things would normally work within 
the Department and I just tried to fit the Vrede Dairy Project really into 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 107 of 217 
 
the normal structures but I understand what you’re saying, we will come 
back to talk about what an implementing agent is, what the qualities 
are etcetera, etcetera.  Can I then ask you to – the only official who we 
really haven’t spent a bit of time on is the CFO because we now know 
all the people who essentially would be reporting into the Chief 
Directorate, which is what you headed, and you report to the HOD, you 
also have the CFO, just tell us exactly what the functions of the CFO in 
that environment are, and if there is any difference between the 
functions today, as you have found them in that office and the functions 
in 2012, 13, 14 please just point that out to the Chairman. 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Chairperson let me try to assist then, 
please that is not my field now but I am trying to assist now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, I wasn’t sure whether you particularly 
wanted the functions or you wanted to – where in the hierarchy a CFO 
fits but you said functions? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes Chairman because he has explained 
where in the hierarchy the CFO ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And simply I’m taking the liberty because 
he happens to be the Acting HOD, and if he has been there for six 
20 
months I think he knows his namnam now.   
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Let me ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  She doesn’t necessarily need you to tabulate all of 
them, she just wants the essential ones. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Alright. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 108 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  An overview just to give – just so we can 
understand that environment, it might not be the same as another 
environment we’ve explored previously. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Let me just summarise it like this 
Chairperson, to assist.  An accounting officer should appoint a CFO, 
with relevant experience at a senior management level and to 
demonstrate capacity to interpret, an analyse and present complex 
information, manage working capital, assets and liabilities and also 
10 
meet the reporting requirements, that is the monthly reports under the 
PFMA, DORA and annual financial statement, so what is happening is 
that the responsibility of the CFO is also to manage the budget 
manager, but also at the same time to look at the assets and to ensure 
that compliance is actually done by  the department so the affairs of a 
– the financial affairs of the department is actually the responsibility of 
the CFO.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In this structure that you’ve mapped out 
for us what is the relationship between the HOD and the Premier, and I 
ask this only because we’ve had evidence placed before this 
20 
Commission that a number of functions were centralised in the 
Premier’s office and his office is a staff complement of 600 people and 
just that office, so help us understand the relationship then between 
the HOD in Agriculture and Rural Development and the Premier and if 
not – well let’s start with the Premier. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 109 of 217 
 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  HOD’s are appointed by the Premier.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What is the reporting function from the 
HOD to the Premier or does the HOD give his or her reports to the 
MEC? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  They give their reports to the MEC, 
unless requested then they can also send the reports to the Premier via 
the MEC. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can the Premier give an instruction to the 
HOD? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  The Premier can give an instruction to 
10 
the MEC. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Under what circumstances? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Let’s say it’s a – like if it is a 
technical issue like for instance if it is something that the HOD need to 
investigate and provide a report urgently to the Premier the Premier 
can go straight, but it remains the responsibility of that HOD to inform 
the MEC. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can the Premier instruct the HOD who to 
contract with? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No, it has to ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am coming back to this question from a 
different angle, but let’s leave it just – can he or she instruct an HOD 
whom to contract or transact with? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  It’s quite an interesting question 
Chairperson, but even if you as an accounting officer you still have the 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 110 of 217 
 
responsibility to say yes I understand but this one is not going to work 
or I still have to follow the following processes, and you have the 
responsibility to also report to the Executive Authority to say that there 
is this request, I still have to follow this and that and that, if you think 
that it must be taken to the executive you have that responsibility. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because the Accounting Officer is bound 
by the provisions of the PFMA. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Because the Accounting Officer is 
bound by those provisions but also the provisions does not stop any 
request if it is financial or what as long as it is written down. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No, say that again, because I don’t think 
it is correct, but just repeat that, because I will interrogate it with you 
and give you an example of why I don’t think that sounds right. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, what I am saying is 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  (laughing) I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it comes across as if it 
is a threat to implicate him. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  My apologies, Chairman he said to me I 
must not cross-examine him, I am trying to smile as I ask my questions.  
But I really am curious. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no that’s fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And I know that he has been in the 
department, he still does it, he has been there a long time, and I am 
really just tapping into that information.  Dr Masiteng you must please 
understand that I am trying to learn as much as I can for purposes of 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 111 of 217 
 
the record so that we know roughly what – how the Free State 
operated, certainly from one perspective, I am not saying you know 
everything. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, no thank you very much 
Chairperson.  What I was saying is in terms of the Public Finance 
Management Act yes it does allow the Executive Authority, in this case I 
am referring to the political heads, they can give instructions but if that 
instruction has got something to do with financial commitments it must 
be in writing and if it is going to result into an irregular it has to be 
properly packaged and now it must go to National Treasury, to 
10 
Provincial and to National Treasury.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In fact ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry is it correct to say that what you are saying 
is that apart from a situation where the instruction must be in writing 
what you are saying is that any instruction must – that is given by the 
Executive Authority to the Accounting Officer or Head of Department 
must be lawful? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and if it is not lawful the Head of Department or 
Accounting Officer is under no obligation to comply with it, do you go 
20 
that far or do you not go that far? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No, what I am saying is if it is not 
lawful as an accounting officer you have that responsibility to engage 
with your political head and say but these are the challenges that I sort 
of realise, so I won’t be able to execute as such. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 112 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, thanks. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But you tie that responsibility into 
execution or implementation of that decision by the Executing 
Authority? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  That will be before. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes, sorry Dr Masiteng, I am trying to 
draw a distinction between an instruction that is given that you will do 
this and do this right now, and an official who prepares documentation 
on instruction from somebody in authority, so I am trying to understand 
your evidence.  Are you saying that there is a difference in the attitude 
10 
of the official who gets an instruction from an executing authority and 
that of an official, one of the extension officers who is given an 
instruction does he or she have to execute that instruction or not, I am 
looking at different levels of operation. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, there will be most certainly, but 
remember in government department how it works the Premier’s 
performance agreement informs that one of the MEC, the MEC inform 
that one of the  HOD, the HOD’s one informed mine and mine informs 
the senior managers, so it sort of infiltrates down, so if I give an 
instruction in your performance agreement, let’s say for instance an 
20 
accounting officer if I give a Chief Director an instruction inside the 
performance agreement it will clearly stipulate that one of – that 
person’s responsibility is to support the accounting officer in achieving 
the following, so now what you are asking about the extent at which it 
depends for instance on the magnitude, here let’s say the instruction is 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 113 of 217 
 
to implement a one million project, it is different from an instruction to 
say go and implement a 10 000 project for argument sake and that will 
be delegated as such to the senior managers and to different levels, 
that’s what I was referring to Chairperson if I was clear. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If in your position as a Chief Director you 
gave an extension officer an instruction that the extension officer is not 
happy with would query, what does that extension officer do?  At least 
Chairman allow me to ask a compound question, and I ask this question 
Dr Masiteng, I have had discussions with you.  I ask this question in 
the context of what happened with the Vrede Dairy project.  The Chief 
10 
Director has given an instruction to do certain things, so I don’t want to 
mislead you, I want to understand when one is under some form of 
compulsion to execute an instruction and when you can say I am sorry I 
will not do it, because I do not think this is right. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  The – let’s take for instance the 
instruction that comes from let’s say from the head of the department 
and as a Chief Director I think I need X, Y and Z, it will remain my 
responsibility so that I don’t see this one, I don’t see that one, but in 
instances where the  HOD is saying I am giving you an instruction and I 
want this and this is the documents that I have got, you have no 
20 
chance, you will have to scrutinise that document and comply, he is not 
asking you, he is instructing you, he is not saying do you have an 
opinion here, what can we do, he is instructing you to assist.  Official 
performance agreement also says I will assist, I will support the HOD in 
executing the following.   
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 114 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let’s ask the question – let me ask this, as you 
understand the position in the Agriculture and Rural Development 
Department when may a subordinate refuse to carry out an instruction 
given by his or her superior, or is the position that subordinates are 
always obliged to carry out instructions given to them by their 
superiors? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  It is the situation of obliging 
Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So is your answer that at least in that department 
your understand is that a subordinate who gets an instruction from his 
10 
or her superior is always obliged to carry it out even if the instruction is 
unlawful? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No, if you feel Chairperson that this is an 
unlawful and you provide reasons then you can do it in writing and say 
but I don’t understand this part but in this instance where an 
accounting officer is saying I have looked at all the other news, I am 
convinced, I am happy, I am instructing you to compile this for me or to 
do this for me it is an issue of obliging, you have to oblige. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now I understand what you are saying to mean that 
where as a subordinate you are of the view that the instruction given to 
20 
you by your superior is unlawful and you express that opinion to your 
superior but he insists that as far as he or she is concerned the 
instruction is lawful you as a subordinate become obliged to carry out 
this instruction that you believe to be unlawful because your superior 
thinks differently, is that correct? 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 115 of 217 
 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Let me put it like this Chairperson, 
let’s say what I’m saying is if you feel, let’s see for instance there is 
nothing, it’s just an instruction to say go and do X, Y and Z and you 
feel that moment I am not comfortable you have all the rights to put it 
down and say but I don’t understand, but instances ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, let’s leave out you don’t understand, you do 
understand. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What the instruction says you must do. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, then you can put it in writing and 
say but I don’t agree with what you are saying I must do because there 
is nothing, but I am saying instances where let’s say the accounting 
officer for instance is saying I am from this meeting, I am from that and 
what we must do is this one.  In fact what I am going to do is this, I am 
instructing you to assist me with X, Y and Z, you are obliged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now are you obliged as a subordinate to assist him or 
her even if what he wants to do or she wants to do as far as you are 
concerned is unlawful, as long as he says you must assist me, I want 
20 
this to be done, are you obliged to continue to assist him to do 
something unlawful? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not obliged? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  You are not obliged in that case. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 116 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I just wanted to understand. 
DR TANBKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Yes thank you Chairman, but in that 
instance what goes through your mind as an official is whether you are 
meeting your KPI’s,  your key performance indicators, which you have 
also annexed to your papers, because your key performance indicators 
tell you you’ve got to support, as a Chief Director you must support the 
HOD. 
DR TANBKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Am I right? 
DR TANBKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   But back to the Chairman’s question, 
what then goes through your mind, you know what your key 
performance indicators are, but you also know that what you are being 
asked to do could – is irregular, you know therefore that if you don’t 
perform in terms of your key performance indicators you could lose 
your job.  What do you do as an official?  This is a perennial problem in 
government, all levels of government. 
DR TANBKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Ja.  What is happening Chairperson 
20 
is that there are levels I think that is where we have to start, in 
instances where the accounting officer is clear and is saying I will 
report this as an irregular if I remember those remains the 
responsibility of the  HOD.  The HOD is not asking you for your opinion, 
the HOD is saying you have the responsibility to take this instruction of 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 117 of 217 
 
just compiling this for me, I am not asking you your opinion and 
whatever, I am now instructing you to compile and then if you say no it 
might cause a challenge because it is an instruction, he is not asking 
your opinion, he is instructing you, he has taken all the risk, he has 
looked at all the risk and he has accepted the consequences therefore 
your task is just to compile or to submit to the Accounting Office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may be that we will make more progress if we go to 
the specifics than the general. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Chairman this is where we are right now, 
so if you look at the reference file the first one page 1313 Chairman I 
think should be I know there’s ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that under A? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   That’s under D Chairman.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I think – I thought you said A and B, you said A and 
D. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Sorry Chairman my colleague says it is 
easier for us to go to page 87 of Dr Masiteng’s affidavit, you will find 
the same document. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   And it is easier to handle here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   87 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 118 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   It is labelled Annexure F.  Dr Masiteng 
page 87 to 89 of your affidavit of your papers deal with the submission 
you made or let me rephrase that, deal with the submission the Chief 
Directorate District Services made with respect to the partnership the 
Department was contemplating entering into with Estina.  First we 
really should go to page 89 where you have three blocks that have 
various directives, the first says submitted by, the second says 
recommended, the third says approved.  Maybe we should take this, 
break it down slowly and start off with submitted by your name appears 
here, please just explain to the Chairman whether that is your signature 
10 
or not. 
DR TANBKISI JANKI MASITENG:   No that is not my signature. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   And tell the Chairman why it is not 
signature, where – why you did not sign this document? 
DR TANBKISI JANKI MASITENG:   I did not sign the submission Chair 
because I believe that at that time I was not even around and also 
there was a stage I think on the 26 t h it is signed on the 26 t h, I don’t 
think I was around. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANBKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Yes, and there was a stage but I 
20 
think we will deal with that one, there was a stage I was out of the 
country. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whose signature appears above your name in that 
block? 
DR TANBKISI JANKI MASITENG:   This one is the signature of Mr 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 119 of 217 
 
Sarel van Schalkwyk who is the District Director for Gariep. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was he one of the people who reported to you at the 
time? 
DR TANBKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Yes he is the one who reported to 
me, I think he signed as an Acting or what. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   So we’re looking at the 26 t h of which 
month and which year? 
DR TANBKISI JANKI MASITENG:   It is the 26 t h of 05/.2012.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Now what was submitted on the 26 t h of 
10 
May 2012, so we go back to page 87, can you just walk the Chairman 
through what this document is? 
DR TANBKISI JANKI MASITENG:   What was submitted on that date 
the purpose is to obtain approval to accept the proposal from Estina 
with regard to the Vrede integrated Dairy Project and secondly to enter 
into a partnership with Estina to implement an integrated dairy project 
in Vrede. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Yes, now I accept that you were travelling 
at this point in time and you have annexed to your papers your passport 
details, Chairman we are going to look at them because I think it’s 
20 
correct, the reason they are annexed was because he was travelling in 
China, if I might just make that submission.  Page 74 has the passport 
picture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   So I think the Commission can accept 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 120 of 217 
 
Chairman if it makes sense to you that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, after all he didn’t sign the document, ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   He didn’t sign it and the reason was he 
was travelling in China, so I think instead of leading that evidence I 
think the Chairman is happy to accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, that’s fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But I would like you then to tell the Chairman 
what you knew about the project and when I say this particular project 
it is called here the Vrede Integrated Dairy Project before you left for 
your trip abroad first and then when you returned from your trip 
10 
abroad? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Gcabashe before we get there.  You – if 
we go back to that block which has got your signature Doctor Masiteng 
the person who signed there appears to have signed on your behalf pp 
and your name was put there.  That gives the impression that you had 
authorised that person to sign on your behalf otherwise if he or she was 
signing as the acting Chief Director in your position one would have 
expected that he or she would put – would have put her name or his 
name and written Acting Chief Director District Services or something 
to that effect.  Do you have any comments to make about what – what 
20 
one makes of that signature and what is written in that block? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, no thank you very much 
Chairperson.  I think that is why in my affidavit I have indicated that I 
have never authorised the person who signed there to sign on my 
behalf. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 121 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  And when you – when you 
left and you travelled you had not been requested to put together this 
document? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright thank you. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Can I take you to page 88 just to add to what 
10 
the Chairman has just asked you.  Under point 6 you have a heading 
Parties Consulted the HOD, the CFO, the Chief Director District 
Services and the District Director.  Now you at the time were the Chief 
Director District Services do you confirm that you were not consulted? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  I was not consulted Chairperson.  I 
think that is why even the official has made a statement to confirm that 
he did not actually consult with me.  He was only instructed to compile 
the document and to sign. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Okay before we leave this document two 
questions.  Now these three blocks is that a stamp that has your names 
20 
on it anyway or just I am trying to understand why your name would 
appear here even when you are out of office.  Is that just a particular 
stamp that you use in the office? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  It is a template Chairperson.  I think it 
is a template.  If it has blocks like this I think they use a template. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 122 of 217 
 
There is always a sort of a template with the details – my details, the 
CFO and the HOD.  I think what they did they just use a – they used 
that.  So instead of putting the names of the person who actually was 
going to sign they then put my name. That is why in all fairness he 
indicated that I am signing on behalf as an acting Chief Director at that 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But was he acting Chief Director? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Simele was acting Chief Director 
at that time Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that is what he should have disclosed.  He should 
10 
not have put your name there if he was not signing on your behalf.  He 
should have put his own name and indicated that he was doing so in his 
capacity as acting Chief Director. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because as it stands it looks like he was signing on 
your behalf and therefore he had authority from you that he could 
submit this document on your behalf. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No thank you very much Chairperson I 
think even the Chief Director District Services was actually referring to 
the acting not necessarily to myself. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well there may have – I do not know you know.  
Those people do not – they know if somebody is acting you refer to 
them as acting Chief Director you do not refer to them as Chief 
Director. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, yes. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 123 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  If somebody is acting Head of Department you do not 
refer to them as Head of Department.  I would have thought that these 
people are people of the right level to appreciate those distinctions.  Ja 
anyway okay. Alright. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Thanks. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  But I think also Chairperson if you 
allow me.  Then the issue was on number 7.  Because even if… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 87. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  This one, point number 7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 88. 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Authority for approval. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  The same page 88. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes.  So if you look at that even if this 
one for argument sake can submit or compile but he has got no 
authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No you do not understand Doctor Masiteng.  There is 
the authority to submit.  There is the authority to recommend.  There is 
the authority to approve. 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it not? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG: Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the approval, the authority to approve might vest 
with the head of department but if you submit something the first 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 124 of 217 
 
question is whether you are the right person to submit that thing. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Oh yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you have authority to submit that thing? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  To submit that yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because when you submit it you associate yourself 
with that thing.  So your name here is being associated with a proposal.  
It suggests that you initiated the approval. Not that you granted the 
approval but you initiated the approval by submitting this document.  
You asked somebody to recommend they recommended.  You asked 
somebody to approved they approved.  So it says all this comes from 
10 
you.  Do you appreciate? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  I tend to differ Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  That is not how it works. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  What is happening is I can instruct a 
person to submit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  It is me who is instructing any person 
to submit to me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Because I cannot be a referee and a 
player.  I cannot submit to myself.  I cannot recommend to myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  But in terms of the government 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 125 of 217 
 
processes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Everything that is submitted or – yes 
submitted it must first go to the CFO if it has got financial implications. 
CHAIRPERSON: Hm. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  So that is always the case and that is 
what is always happening in the government sector. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No but if you – if you prepare a document and you 
submit it you are associating yourself with it. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes I agree there ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what I am talking about. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are associating yourself with it because if you do 
not submit it there will be no occasion for anybody to recommend it.  
There will be no occasion for the person who must approve to approve. 
So you submit it you are saying this is what I think should happen and 
then I am asking my immediate senior to recommend or whoever is 
supposed to recommend.  And ultimately the approving authority to also 
to approve.  So you have the person who submits the proposal.  You 
have somebody who recommends that the proposal be approved.  You 
20 
have somebody who actually provides the approval.  But the person 
who provides the approval can say … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was at the end of the queue.  So and so submitted 
this proposal and I am entitled to think that he looked at it properly and 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 126 of 217 
 
he formulated the proposal and submitted it to so and so because he 
was thinking that it should be approved.  And so and so looked at it and 
recommended it.  And I as the person with authority to approve then 
approved.  Somebody that had already been submitted by somebody 
else and recommended by somebody else.  So on the face of it it 
associates the name of the person who submitted the proposal with the 
proposal.  That is why it is important that if you have got nothing to do 
with it it should not reflect your name. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It should reflect the person – the name of the person 
10 
who is submitting it.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman can I protect my witness?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Protect your witness. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And suggest Chairman that if an accounting 
officer 
did 
that 
he 
or 
she 
would 
simply 
be 
rubberstamping 
documentation that came up from the bottom.  That is the first point.  
But the second one is the more important one Chairman.  The facts as 
set out in this witness’ affidavit speak to peculiar circumstances that 
you might want to consider to be exceptional. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Given the frame, the legal frame that you 
have set out. 
CHAIRPERSON: No, no what I am saying is general.  It is general.  I 
am talking general.  But – but the first point you raised is not really 
correct.  An approving authority who says I approved this after it was 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 127 of 217 
 
recommended by so and so who got it from so and so submitted does 
not necessarily rubberstamp.  But that person is simply saying I just did 
not do it on my own.  It had gone through certain stages and those 
people including somebody whose duty is to apply his or her mind to it 
concluded that it should – approval should be recommended.  So if I 
have made any mistake in approving I did not just do it on my own 
there were different stages.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I accept that Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But can we then come to that exceptional 
10 
circumstance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But can I also Doctor Masiteng as you explain 
your exceptional circumstances I actually want to ask you to turn to the 
document that you in fact signed.  This one was signed by somebody 
else and that document Chairman we will find at Bundle A and the 
signature I think is on page 4 of Bundle a reference – reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us stick to reference bundle A. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Reference bundle A Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which is under Exhibit HH. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got it.  What page? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And then the signature that we are going to 
look at is on page 4 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  4. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 128 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes.  I beg your pardon page 5 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Doctor Masiteng are you there?  It is page 5, 
paginated page 5 right at the top.   
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No I do not think I have that. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Oh the reference bundle … 
CHAIRPERSON:  He might not be having the right bundle.  Look for 
bundle – another bundle. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  It is not your – not your bundle Doctor 
Masiteng.  Reference bundle. 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Reference bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja somebody should orientate him. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Reference bundle A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay somebody will come and orientate you which 
one is bundle – well tell him about others as well so you do not have to 
go there each time there is a reference to another bundle.  Let him 
know which ones and where to find the others.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And then please switch your microphone on 
before you – you give your answers thank you.  So we are now looking 
at a document that you in fact signed. 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And again it is titled Approval to Accept the 
Proposal for the Establishment of Integrated Dairy in Vrede from 
Estina.  Terrible English but anyway that is what is written here. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 129 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Please explain what this document is that you 
prepared?  I take it you prepared it because your signature is there and 
why you signed it?  That is the issue the Chairman raises in the 
example he gives and this is your – your signature please explain the 
circumstances? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  This document was actually 
accompanied by other documents.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Please tell the Chairman which ones it is 
important? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja tell us what the document is first? 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  It was – this document was 
accompanied… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no before you come to what accompanied it tell 
me what this document is that you signed the one that starts at page 2? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Oh yes.  This one it is an approval to 
accept the proposal for the establishment of an integrated dairy – dairy 
in Vrede from Estina. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a memorandum – is it – it is a memorandum, is 
that correct?  It is a document which you addressed to Mr M P 
Thabethe head of the Department of Agriculture. 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whose purpose was as stated there in:  
• To get the Head of the Department to accept the proposal from 
Estina/Paras with regard to the establishment of integrated 
theory in Vrede and 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 130 of 217 
 
• Enter into a memorandum of agreement with Estina/Paras to 
implement the integrated dairy project in Vrede. 
So that – those – that was the purpose of the document. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, yes Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay then you can carry on and talk more or tell us 
what other documents accompanied it. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson.  This – this 
document was actually prepared in line with the supporting documents 
which were brought to my attention by the – by the accounting officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Thabethe? 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, yes Mr Thabetha. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes tell us what? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  It was the agreement which has 
already been signed between the – it is an agreement entered into 
between the Department of Agriculture and Estina. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is the document… 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Which is 006. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the document.  Ja page 6 ja.  Okay. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  And there also it was accompanied by 
the project proposal. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Which is 26 which was already 
signed.  If we go to  
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 26. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Page 34. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 131 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh not page 26? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Page 34 it was signed on the 15 May 
2012.  There was also… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Page 20 – page 34 is the end 
of a document.  Where does it start? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman.  It starts – it starts on page 26. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so – ja so it is the same document that I just 
mentioned where it starts and you mentioned where it ends. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  It starts with 26 it ends with… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 34, at page 34. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  34 with the signature at the bottom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and whose signature is that? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  This signature is – it is Sanjeev 
Gautam. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes.  And also… 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Do you know Mr Gautam? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  I do not know the person.  And also 
20 
there was an EXCO memorandum.  I do not see the EXCO 
memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  EXCO memorandum. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is a memorandum … 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 132 of 217 
 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Which signed on the 13 t h if I am not 
mistaken of June. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you say EXCO are you referring to the 
Provincial Executive Council? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  The Provincial Executive Council 
memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman with your indulgence do you mind 
very much putting the witness’s bundle on one side and then the 
reference bundles that we will be referring you to on the other.  
10 
Because sometimes it is a little easier for us to navigate between the 
two as we quickly find documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  For you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No – okay I am quite – I am quite fine. What would 
you like us to do? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So I would like you to go back to the 
witness’s bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got it here in front of me yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And to go to page 86 of that bundle. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  86 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  86. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  TJM 86. And the resolution that Doctor 
Masiteng refers to is on that page 86.  
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 133 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am at 86.   
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the EXCO memorandum that you were talking 
about? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  This is the EXCO memorandum I am 
referring to which was brought to my attention by the accounting officer 
together with the supporting documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So there were three documents that were given 
to you? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was the agreement which was already signed.  
The proposal which was signed by Mr Gautam 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And then this resolution of the Provincial 
Executive Council. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes there was also a profile. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Can I ask you then to look at your bundle.  
You have actually included these documents in your bundle. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Doctor Masiteng. 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So if you look at page 83 of your bundle 
TJM83 you will find the company profile.  83 has the company profile.  
Top right hand corner.   
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  83.  Yes, yes, yes.   
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 134 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And then if you look at…. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the Estina Company Profile? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes that will be Estina Company 
Profile. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Company Profile. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  You had this document as well.  
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE: Can I ask you to look at page 75 again TJM 
10 
your witness bundle. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  75 yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes that is the project proposal. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  That is the project proposal. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  That you have just pointed the Chairman to 
but we found it in the other file. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Maybe we should stay with this file for now 
Chairman? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  This is the one signed by Gautum on the 15 
May 2012.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was three or was it four supporting documents? 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 135 of 217 
 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Four supporting documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So it was the agreement between the 
Department and Estina and that – the agreement was already signed 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was the proposal it was already signed.  It was the 
EXCO Resolution and then it was the Estina Company Profile. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Profile yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.   
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So these are the documents that were before 
you? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  When you signed? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  That submission. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Now the question the Chairman has been 
asking is – Did you apply your mind to what you were submitting to the 
CFO for her to recommend to the HOD? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe we should … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe we should say how did you – how did it come 
about that you were given this and you ultimately signed the document. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 136 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Microphone, microphone. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  I think – yes Chairperson.  This brings 
us to the point that all along if you look at all the documentations I was 
not part.  I only became part on the – on this date and the reason being 
there was a stage I was out of the country for a period of a month.  
Because I left on the 9 t h I came back on the 6 t h.  Now what happened is 
that on my arrival there was now this documentations which the HOD 
brought to my attention and said:  Look already there is an EXCO on 
this matter already I have signed an agreement, already there is this 
project proposal that has been developed.  I am deviating but at that 
10 
time it did not come out very clear that he is deviating to implement 
this project.  He just said compile for me I am accepting the agreement.  
I am accepting the proposal from these people I am moving with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And deviating in this context did it mean deviating 
from procurement procedures? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes he was very clear to say I am 
deviating. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  They are bringing money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  We are also going to bring money 
there is no any other company which is prepared to bring R200 million.  
I have already presented it to EXCO I am deviating. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 137 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so he made it clear to you? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  He make it very clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That this was a case where he was deviating from 
procurement procedures deliberately. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because for whatever reason he believed it was 
justified to do so. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So the evidence – your evidence is the HOD 
10 
cannot submit to himself.  The submission starts below him. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And that is what you were asked to do simply 
to prepare a submission on the basis of documents that were given to 
you? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Do I understand you correctly to say that in 
addition you recognised that there was a deviation at play in the 
submission that you were making.  Did you recognise that or were you 
simply putting documents together? 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No.  If you look at this Chairperson 
this document that was developed it was subsequently replaced by the 
other.  If you look at this one.  This one is similar. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I am sorry – which one? You are pointing to what 
page? 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 138 of 217 
 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  The 02.  The 02. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  The one signed by – what did you say it was 
Schalkwyk? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes because I was not aware of that 
one which was signed on the 26 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the one at 2 of reference bundle A. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that is the … 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  You will also find it at page 89 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  TJM89. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I will just stick – because he is using 2 I will just 
stick to that one ja.  For now ja. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so this is the document that you signed and you 
were making a certain point about it just repeat that point ja. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes this document if you look at it the 
purpose is to obtain a [indistinct]. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Sorry Doctor Masiteng may I interrupt you? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I do apologise.  Not this document so you 
must identify the document it helps with the record.  So just start the 
answer again please but identify which document you are looking at. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 139 of 217 
 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Oh 02. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Page – the date on the document? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  The date on the document it is 
05.07.2012.  It is now July. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And that is the one with your signature? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  This is the one with my signature. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Thank you. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  We know which document you are looking at. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Now the point I was making is that if 
10 
you look at this document and the one which was submitted by Mr 
Schalkwyk they are basically the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  So I did not understand the 
instruction properly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  So I submitted this document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  He then brought it back and said no, 
no, no this is not what I want. I want this – the submission that you 
20 
have compiled has already been compiled what I want I am deviating.  
Now there is a document I do not know whether is there a submission 
now.  You will see it was also signed at the same day.  That is the one 
that he was very clear and he brought this one back and said, no, no 
this is not what I am talking about.  I am deviating. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 140 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now when you prepared this one at page 2 which you 
say is the same as the one that was signed by somebody else had you 
seen the other one? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They just happened to be the same but you had not 
seen the other one? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No I was not aware of that one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  So I was under the impression that 
the only – the thing that you can do now is to give in the 
documentations and so on and so forth.  You can accept, you can also 
enter into – because the memorandum of agreement was already there.  
He was very clear to me to say I am also entering into a memorandum 
of agreement with them.  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay continue. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Can we then just for one minute look at that 
resolution?  The EXCO resolution.  Where is it now? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is at page 86 of the other bundle the one with – 
20 
with your statement I think.  Am I correct? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  That is correct Chairman.  Because we have 
been talking about levels of authority and instructions being given. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So it is at TJM86. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 141 of 217 
 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  86 okay thanks. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  TJM. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Alright thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Your document.   
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  I have got it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  What did you understand of this resolution in 
relation to the instruction you were – been given?  What was the 
import?  Why – what was the relevance of this document? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Chairperson my understanding is that 
yes you do have an EXCO resolution and also it comes a directive but it 
10 
does not imply that you can take it at face value and implement it.  So 
that is why he was saying I am deviating to ensure that I comply also 
with the EXCO Resolution.  It was the EXCO Resolution it is very clear 
it is talking to the very same Vrede Integrated Dairy Agri Business 
Project.  So my understanding was that as an accounting officer he is 
saying – he is saying I understand I – there is this commitment however 
I am now following this process and the process that I am following is 
to deviate. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Was the CFO in terms of position your equal 
or your senior?  Just in terms of levels of authority. CFO the Chief 
20 
Financial Officer. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  The CFO’s are appointed in terms of 
the PFMA even though we are equal with the – equal with the Chief 
Directors but there is always that sort of a seniority. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Could she have refused to recommend what 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 142 of 217 
 
had been submitted by you … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  As Chief Director? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, yes.  That is what I was trying to 
explain.  That the – that the – if you submit to – to the person who 
recommends.  The person who recommends can say no.  It happens on 
several occasions if you initiate but if in this case if it is an instruction 
the CFO also can say yes it is an instruction but let us look at other 
processes and so on and so forth and when she is fine she can 
recommend and then it goes for an approval. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Would it also be correct to say that the CFO 
has a great responsibility to ensure that the Supply Chain Management 
procedures are complied with? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  They are actually residing in that – in 
that Chief Directorate. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So where there is a deviation in terms of 
those procedures and the Treasury Regulations it really is the duty of 
the CFO to engage in discussions with the HOD to discuss whether that 
deviation is regular or not? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So the Chief Directorate’s submission is not 
the last word on this? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No, not at all. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  At the end of the day the HOD could also say 
I – I have taken a totally different decision here? 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 143 of 217 
 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  It happens on several occasions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Despite having an Exco resolution that says 
we approve of this project? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  My – my understanding is that if you 
are having an Exco resolution it is like a court order but it does not 
mean that you can take an Exco resolution as it is.  I always make an 
example of an Exco resolution that says appoint 50 undergraduates.  I 
cannot stand outside here on the street and take 50 undergraduates.  I 
still have to say look at the issues of agenda, their qualifications and 
10 
so on and so forth but it is a must do because it is an Exco resolution. 
Otherwise you are rending the whole Executive Council 
useless in sitting in meetings and taking resolutions but if – there are 
other processes that you can follow if you do not agree but it is quite a 
long process because this was done in the presence of the Executive 
Councils and in the presence of the Accounting Officers – officers in 
most cases. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – I am sorry.  So – but there maybe a – there 
may be a situation where the Exco resolution tells you about the 
20 
ultimate objective says this is what must be achieved but it does not 
tell you about the how. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  The how part of it, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then that is up to you to make sure that the manner 
in which you achieve that objective is a lawful manner. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 144 of 217 
 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course you may well have a situation where the 
Exco resolution either makes it clear as to the how … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or it might not make it clear but there is no way of 
achieving that objective without breaking the law.  You could have that 
situation as well in theory. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   In theory. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because if - if the process which you must follow … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In order to appoint 50 graduates. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Requires three months … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the Exco resolution says within one week appoint 
50 graduates.  Then it prevents you from following a lawful procedure if 
20 
you are going to comply with it.  Is it not? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Now my understanding of the response that 
Premier gave to the Public Protector on the – the deviation we speak of 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 145 of 217 
 
that the CFO ought to have interrogated more closely was that the 
Supply Chain Management procedures allow for a wide range of 
exceptions.  It is not a close list and it – it should not be interpreted as 
a close list.  The close list being emergency situations sole provider. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I do not know if it is a fair question but do 
you have a view on this because I know you are not the CFO but would 
this be a correct interpretation? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  I do not want to – to guess in this 
regard honestly Chairperson.  I think I will be subjecting myself to 
10 
speculation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  That is fine.  We – we are hoping 
Mr Thabethe will come in any event and Ms Dlamini and we can raise 
the same issues … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  With them; but to then go back to the program 
itself or the project itself. 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  The Vrede Dairy Project.  Explain to the 
Chairman where this project was located in the strategy of the 
department and here I have in mind I – I have heard of the address by 
the Premier in 2012 that spoke to this issue and to the Mohuma Mobung 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 146 of 217 
 
initiative or strategy.  Please explain to the Chairman where the Vrede 
Dairy Project idea came from and where it fitted in the District Services 
suite of projects. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Chairperson the – let us start first 
with one of the – the key strategies in the – in the province was to 
focus more on the agro-processing value adding and Mohuma Mobung 
was actually initiated in 2011.  So Mohuma Mobung was a strategy that 
deals with the mega – let us call them mega projects as well as foot 
security projects and when it comes to the mega projects they must 
have an element of agro-processing value adding. 
10 
So that is why when the – the project – I had – actually I 
came into the picture after July but my understanding was that Vrede 
Dairy was part of – is one of the projects under Mohuma Mobung as a 
strategic guide.  It is not Mohuma Mobung but it is one of the projects.  
In the same way as we are having boiler projects as well as the HER as 
well as the feed lots and so on and so forth. 
So the issue here was that Mohuma Mobung was developed 
to actually concentrate on more high impact projects that could employ 
more than 100 people or so.  So that is how Vrede Dairy actually came 
into been.  It was one of the projects under Mohuma Mobung which was 
20 
actually initiated in 2011.  If I may just – let me just take the 
Chairperson through one of the issues that we are saying here. 
Chairperson I say Mohuma Mobung for instance is a multi-mega public 
and private partnership business concept which revolves around income 
generation through funding in the rural areas of the province and the 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 147 of 217 
 
creation of on and off farm agri business value chain enterprises and 
Black Economic Empowerment. 
That is what the concept centred around.  The total budget 
required for the implementation of Mohuma Mobung strategy for 
instance is more than 1.2 billion over a period of four years and has the 
potential of creating more than 10 000 decent and permanent jobs and 
more than 100 000 indirect jobs.  That was the idea.  So that is why 
when Vrede Dairy was actually presented it was a very lucrative and 
good project that fit into this guide Chairperson. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  You see Mr – Dr Masiteng the reason it is 
10 
important to locate the Vrede Dairy Project within Mohuma Mobung is 
as I understand matters the Vrede Dairy Project became Mohuma 
Mobung simply because all resources were directed at the Vrede Dairy 
Project certainly in the period 2012 to 2014.  Would that be a correct 
summary of what happened? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No.  That – that will not be the correct 
summary Chairperson.  We – we end up having an allocation called 
Mohuma Mobung.  Under that one you will have an allocation for Vrede 
Dairy but you will also have an allocation for mechanisation for life 
stock and other agricultural activities.  So it is – it is not true to say 
20 
now all the resources were channelled. 
No there were also other initiatives which the grant itself was 
taking care of.  This is to say it – Mohuma Mobung is not Vrede Diary 
but Vrede Dairy is a project within Mohuma Mobung. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think – I think what Ms Gcabashe might have meant 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 148 of 217 
 
is that in the perception of many people this Vrede Dairy Project 
became like that is what they are talking about when you … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you talk about this whole bigger project which 
has got various components but in the perception of some people or 
many people it seemed to represent the whole thing when in fact it was 
not the whole thing. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would agree with me? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes I agree Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that there may have been people with that 
perception you would agree with that? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  We – we will interrogate that matter further 
Dr Masiteng with the financial people who were involved at the time but 
I think where you can assist the Commission is in relation to what you 
were calling the grant just now.  I presume you mean the CASP grant. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Which grant? 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  I am referring to the voted fund. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Coming from (indistinct)? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  It is a provincial allocation. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So you had the provincial allocation for 
agriculture? 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 149 of 217 
 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  That is what you are calling the voted fund? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And you are saying from those funds there 
was an allocation for Mohuma Mobung? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  As there would be for other … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Areas; but the allocation for Mohuma Mobung 
you say did not go exclusively to the Vrede Dairy Farm Project in 
10 
2013/2014? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No.  We did not have Mohuma Mobung 
as an allocation at that time.  I think it started in the 2013/2014 
financial year. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But this is the point Vrede Dairy Farm was in 
existence as of 5 July 20212. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes you had an allocation under foot 
security – which is foot security.  That is why I said that is why 
ultimately we had a Mohuma Mobung sort of grant which was catering 
for different projects but Vrede Dairy was – was supported at that 
20 
period under a normal voted fund which was a foot security and so on 
and so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us take the – well one we normally stop at four 
but sometimes we go beyond that.  I can go up to five.  Is that what you 
would like? 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 150 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I would prefer that Chairman. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Would you be fine with that? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:   
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Let us take an adjournment now and it 
is just after four.  We will resume at quarter past four.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I think it’s doable Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, from your side Dr Masiteng? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes thanks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And I think it’s because much of the 
evidence is evidence other people should really be speaking to, the 
essential evidence from this witness really turned on those memos, 
submissions that he signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But I think that some of what I am going 
20 
to explore in the next hour feeds into that memo.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no that’s fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You were explaining the vote that the 
Department of Agriculture gets.  I also however want you to explain to 
us the CASP budget, so if you turn to your affidavit page TJM094, TJM, 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 151 of 217 
 
which are your initials Dr Masiteng, 094. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must be consistent Ms Gcabashe. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I asked for permission Chair to straddle 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, I’ve said that – I am talking about the page 
numbers all along you have been saying page 86 without the TJM00. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Absolutely, I apologise, you are correct 
Chairman, it’s the first time I use the zero. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, otherwise whoever reads – looks for another page 
and not this one, so just to be consistent. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  For the record page 94, thank you 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can you please explain this document to 
me, and I know it’s looking at a particular year, 2013/2014, but what’s 
concerning me is the evidence you have given on what monies were 
used for Mahoma Mabung and what was used for the Vrede Dairy 
Project, so maybe this will explain or support what you are saying and 
help me understand it a bit better. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, yes. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What is this document and is this a 
document that is generated every year. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Okay thank you very much 
Chairperson once more.  This is actually a business plan framework for 
CASP for all the projects when you apply for funding you use this 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 152 of 217 
 
template.  Now what happened is that ...[intervenes]  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Please the acronym CASP? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  It’s Comprehensive Agricultural 
Support Program. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Now what happened is that because 
internally as the Provincial Department we have to compile what we call 
a Provincial Business Plan of which Vrede Dairy was then included into 
the Provincial Business Plan as one of those projects that we have to 
present to National for funding, so that is why this business plan was 
10 
then compiled, with the amount and if you look at the amount, the total 
amount talks to the Esco memo, that 140million, that is why for CASP 
you would request 53million but you are saying DART will avail 
60million to give you the total of 140, this is the document which is also 
compiled by the Agricultural Economics of our department. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But when I read this page 94 I see the 
total CASP amount of R53 950 000, and then I see the total available 
budget at the bottom which is 114million.  I also know that the 
department allocated 114million over a three year period to the Estina 
Dairy Project.  The amount above that 114million reads 60 050 000.  
20 
When I look at this document it says to me the 60 050 000 that ought to 
have gone to production inputs, mechanisation, other infrastructure and 
revenue enhancement is now going to form part of the 140million that’s 
going to go to Estina because you had budgeted 114million for Estina.  
If I am misreading it please just help us understand what this 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 153 of 217 
 
represents? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes you are correct Advocate 
Gcabashe. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You see because earlier you said to us 
no, no, no, we put money into various items, and I know you are talking 
about the vote. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But the point really about the Estina 
project is that money was taken from other areas that the department 
ought to have been servicing and put into this one mega project 
10 
because you had identified it as a mega project. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, what is happening Chairperson is 
that let us say for instance now you see I am just trying to apply my 
mind here, I’m just assisting.  What is happening Mahoma Mabung 
would be for instance allocated 80million for argument’s sake. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which would be for different components. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Which would be for different 
components for argument’s sake, and then what this document is trying 
to say to us is that yes out of that 60 will be utilised to top up the 53 
and give you a total of 140. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I hear you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the total CASP budget for the 2013/2014 year was 
R53 950 000, is that correct? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No, no Chairperson.  The total budget 
for CASP for that financial year, the allocation for the province, let me 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 154 of 217 
 
just look at the presentation that we made, that would be 108, 108 
under the same document, that is the presentation that the Department 
has made to DAF at that time, it will include quite a number of 
initiatives of which dairy will be one of them but not to say the 
allocation for the province was 53million, it was more than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where is the 108 to which you refer, which page?  
You referred to 108 and I can’t see 108 at page 94 where I see R53 950 
000, where is the 108. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It’s annexure? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  It’s Annexure K. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Annexure K? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson that TJM108 
Annexure K. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Yes, that is the presentation which 
was done on the 30 t h of January 2013. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   To the National Assessment Panel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry please tell me the page rather than the 
annexure, what page is annexure K? 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Page 108 Chairman, but like you I cannot 
find the figure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh 108 is the page number, I thought it was the 
amount of money, 180million or something.  Okay, alright, so at page 
108 is the beginning of a certain document and you say that document 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 155 of 217 
 
represents, it does indicate the budgets for CASP in regard to the 
2013/2014 financial year. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Yes Chairperson. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   And where is the amount ...[intervenes]  
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Then you go to 118. 
CHAIRPERSON:  118? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I’m there. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Yes now you see the breakdown 
there. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   The breakdown begins to indicate to 
us that in total on the conditional grants the province received 
206million but that 206million 8.5million of it was land care of which 
57million was for Ele Maletse which is another conditional grant, so the 
rest would be CASP Advocate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay there are two boxes there, you’re talking to the 
bottom box is that right? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   The first, let’s take the first one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Financial year grants. 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   The financial year grants. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2013/2014 yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   It will say CASP, the amount is 
140million, the allocation for the Province. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh when there is – there is something that’s been 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 156 of 217 
 
blacked out at the top there, and then on the side, so it’s 
comprehensive agricultural support program, that is the long term for 
CASP? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   For CASP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   And then the allocation for that 
financial year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is 140. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Is 140 of which the 53 is then 
requested to assist the Vrede Dairy, not the whole budget. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, it’s 140 204 000 for the whole 
...[intervenes]  
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   For the whole CASP. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the whole CASP. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and then the 53 950 000 that we see at page 94 
comes from that amount? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   From the 114 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, okay, so where it says total CASP on page 
94 it means total contribution from CASP to this dairy project. 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   To the Province. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the Province. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   To the Province, the Province has 
received conditional grants every financial year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 157 of 217 
 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Now you will go and present the 
projects that you want them to be funded, and once they have approved 
those projects you then come back and enter into now the other 
processes of beneficiaries agreements and so on, because there is an 
approval at a national level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So a CASP from National level? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Yes it comes from National. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that 140 comes from National? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   It’s a national allocation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is allocated to the particular province, that’s 
10 
Free State only. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   It’s Free State only, other provinces 
might get ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  So the money sits with National, with the National 
Department but when you have satisfied them that you have got 
projects that fall under CASP and you have worked out how much is 
needed then if they are happy then they give you the money. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   They transfer the money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now I understand. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Yes, but let’s look at these documents 
again, so I’ve got one finger on page 94, another on page 118 and 
another at page 119. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   119. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 158 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   So if we go back to page 118, to the 
second block that’s entitled District budget breakdown, we get to Thabo 
Maphutzanjane, page 118. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   So I am at the second block. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   And so the allocation, this is per district. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   The allocation for Thabo Maphutzanjane 
is for dairy, pigs, soya. 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   And that’s 66million. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   That’s 66 million. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Okay, if you go over the page to 119 you 
– the second block again has commodities supported, we then get to 
dairy, 53 950 000. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   That is the figure that corresponds to the 
one on page 94. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Exactly. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   So of the total budget you say of 
140million that comes into province from CASP only 53 950 000 would 
go to the Vrede Dairy Farm. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s about one third of the allocation. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 159 of 217 
 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   That’s about one third of the 
allocation yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   But having given that one third of the 
allocation according to page 119 to dairy it leaves very little for other 
projects, so the other projects that are supported, commodities 
supported, game, livestock, poultry, agro-processing, essential oils all 
of those are Thabo Maphutzanjane projects that are supported by 
CASP? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have to say yes, nodding is not recorded. 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   So if CASP is providing 53million, almost 
54million for the Vrede Dairy Project, and the total budget for Vrede, 
for the Vrede Dairy Project is 114million where does the shortfall come 
from? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   The shortfall will have to come from 
the voted fund. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Which portion of the voted fund? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   The Provincial allocation. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   But it is itemised as well, isn’t it?  Or has 
20 
it got general items so you can easily take ...[intervenes]  
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Yes let’s say, like I’ve indicated if it’s 
80million for instance you would say already I have this 53million, now 
I am shortfall of 60, then from 80 I am taking 60 to total, that’s how it 
works in most cases. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 160 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   You know the reason I have a real 
interest in these numbers is because when I go back to the documents 
you say you were given, when you made your submission, I look at the 
feasibility study for instance that you had, the feasibility study in fact 
you didn’t have the feasibility study because the feasibility study was 
only concluded in October of 2012.  Chairman if I might just find the 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   And I know you are simply assisting Dr 
Masiteng and we will be leading the same evidence with other 
10 
witnesses, the reference bundle Chair is reference bundle B is 
reference Bundle B and the page is 482. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   I’ve got it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   It comes back to understanding not just 
your approval or your submission but the approval of the project, 
because if you are saying that the intention is to have a bankable 
project, a commercially viable project that also uplifts the people of 
Vrede, one you need to have the money for it, which is why we are 
looking at the CASP allocation and you’ve mentioned the vote, but more 
importantly the underlying premise for initiating the project has to be 
20 
sound, you would agree?  Dr Masiteng? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Yes, yes Chairperson. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   If I ask you to look at page 546 of that 
same feasibility study. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  546? 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 161 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  546, just above conclusion there’s a little 
sub-heading that’s part of the financial performance projected for this 
project, they say here that it would take 12 to 14 months for the dairy 
to become operational.  This would – I am reading what is written here, 
this would result in a loss of 8.48million in 2012 to 2013, and 
1.83million in 2013 to 14.  Now this is a feasibility study that was done, 
the questions that arise in my mind are the following, when you look at 
the prospects of this project at any point becoming a commercially 
viable project which I understood to be the intention of the department, 
and the feasibility study itself tells you from the first 114million that 
10 
you are going to put into this project in the first year you are going to 
lose 8.48million, and in the second year you are going to lose another 
1.83million and I really am just looking at one aspect, I am not even 
looking at the whole recommendation, doesn’t that require at some 
level, maybe not at your level, some interrogation, the viability of the 
project given the limited funds you have. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Like you are correctly indicating, 
remember you have professional services, which then has to come in 
and interrogate this, the District Services will have to wait for the 
completion certificate, so you are correct, I agree with you, the 
20 
economists in this case will have to look into all the issues then. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The economists sits in District Services? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No, they sit in ...[intervenes]  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Where does the economists sit? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  They sit in the Professional Services, 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 162 of 217 
 
that is another Chief Directorate. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   So the economists must be able to look 
at a feasibility study like this.  
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And make recommendations on the 
bankability of a project like this and the commercial viability? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Of a project like this.  
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Do you know if that happened? 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No I will be speculating. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You see because this particular feasibility 
study is dated October 2012. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson, the issue would be 
when you develop this business plan you also have to take into 
consideration other supporting documents, so that’s why I am afraid to 
say yes they did look into this, because this was done in October, the 
business plan was developed for 13/14.  So they might have taken into 
consideration quite a number of documents that will include also an 
analysis of this, but I am speculating Chairperson and I am afraid to do 
20 
that to the Commission. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes Dr Masiteng I have heard your 
evidence that you were given documents, you were asked to make a 
submission, you made the submission and passed it on to the next 
level, that is the essence of what you have said, and that you did not 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 163 of 217 
 
interrogate the documents that you were given? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No what I did I didn’t interrogate the 
documents, the instruction was very clear, I have this, I have satisfied 
myself just compile for me this deviation. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   Yes I think with respect to this project, or 
this aspect, the financials, we will deal with it with a different witness 
Chairman because I do not think that Dr Masiteng can take this point 
any further from where he sat in 2012.  Can I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  The one point I wanted to raise is this, to the extent 
that you were asked by the HOD to prepare a document where he made 
10 
it clear to you that he was deviating from the procurement procedures, 
was your understanding that he needed something, he needed a 
document that he would adopt as his own and all you would be was 
simply a compiler of the document yourself, or was the position that 
you understood that you would by compiling the document become also 
yourself one of the people who would be said to have made it possible 
for approval to be granted, or for the deviation to happen. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Not in this case Chairperson, in this 
case I am a compiler, because remember in the first place there were 
documents which were completed already, so I did not have a say on 
20 
those ones, I did not have the inputs whatever, it was just to compile. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you saw your job as simply ...[intervenes]  
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Simply a compiler in this case. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 164 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you thought everything was so to speak his. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, yes Chairperson, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In the normal course of things however for 
a project of the size of Estina you would have a planning session long 
before anybody signed any contract, am I correct? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You would apply the plan, in fact it would 
have been drawn from the strategy of government, whatever you put 
into the plan, you would have gone through the budget to make sure 
10 
you had the money, this is in the normal course, you would make sure 
you have the money to sustain the project, but in this instance none of 
these things preceded the signing of the contract with Estina. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Chairperson I am also disadvantaged 
in this case because I was not in the picture Chairperson, I was not in 
the picture form the beneficiaries were identified, when meetings were 
held, I only had one meeting with the beneficiaries which Dhlamini was 
talking about, that was in October 2017, that was my first meeting with 
them, which is not a surprise because I am the Chief Director, I have 
directors who every now and then meet with them.   
20 
 
So in this case I only came into a picture after, so it is a little 
bit difficult, I am actually cornered Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, well if you don’t know you are not cornered you 
just say you don’t know, but I either now or after the question if you 
want to take the question further I just want to go to the document that 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 165 of 217 
 
you prepared after the HOD said no, no not this one, because that one 
had been done, but it depends whether Ms Gcabashe still wants to take 
that question further that she had asked you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Not this particular one Chair, I think I 
should move onto one or two other aspects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  May I find out where that document is, we saw the 
one which you said the HOD rejected and said that one had already 
been prepared and he asked you to prepare another one, where is that 
10 
one? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You are looking for the one that you had 
...[intervenes]  
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  The one that includes deviation, that 
one does not talk to deviation, there is the one that talks about the 
same document, same date, but that one now talks about the deviation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because he wanted you to compile a document that 
would show that there were grounds to deviate, is that right? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman with your leave let me just go 
through the file quickly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or what we can do if your learned colleagues can 
look for it we can move on, you can ask other questions and then we 
will come back and maybe they will have found it when we come back. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 166 of 217 
 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let’s move on to other questions, we will come 
back to it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman if we might then just explore 
your understanding of an implementing agent, you mentioned this right 
at the outset, you said you understood Estina to be an implementing 
agent, what is the importance of that, Estina being an implementing 
agent? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   An implementing agent takes – it is 
sort of project management, takes charge of the implementation of the 
10 
project from the word go up to its completion and once – that will 
include the appointment of the service providers, that will include also 
the purchase or the procurement of material and once that has been 
completed now you will have, the engineers are always with the levels 
of construction, but once that completed there must be a completion 
certificate so in this case Estina was appointed to do the feasibility 
study, to do the business planning, to do the water issues and so on 
and so forth.  The way I look I am just saying these things Chairperson 
based on the document that I have seen.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   It was appointed actually to do 
almost everything and then bring a product, to say here is a product 
now bring your own beneficiaries and department out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe when you say I am out you may be 
answering the question better, I wanted to ask why Estina would do the 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 167 of 217 
 
feasibility study or would be the implementing agent when in fact they 
are to benefit from the project, they are party to the project.  Shouldn’t 
the implementing agent be somebody else or is it my ignorance of how 
these things are done in government? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Chairperson your analysis is correct, 
I won’t be able to respond to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you look like you have something to say, do you 
want to say what you are thinking? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   Not as such Chairperson I was saying 
you are correct in your analysis. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:   To say in instances I appoint you as 
an implementing agent, you must actually – we must clear, you do up to 
this file and then after that you get out, then in case you want to 
participate further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  And then you can indicate and say, I 
want to bring in my – this so that I can buy in these shares and so on 
and so forth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes okay thank you. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  You see part of the Chairman’s difficulty is my 
difficulty as well that you have Estina’s an implementing agent and a 
management agent but not only that you also have the same people 
who prepared that company profile you looked at, that feasibility study 
that you looked at, the business plan that you look at – you looked at 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 168 of 217 
 
so all documentation that has been prepared is given to – is being 
assessed at the end of the day a decision is taken to give the project to 
the same people who had no competitors who prepared this 
documentation.  It is very incestuous the manner in which this carried 
out. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  That is why Chairperson I wanted to 
limited my answer to the question, what is the implementing agent? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we want you to assist us with as much 
information as possible including telling us whether to your knowledge 
the way things were done in regard to this project including the role 
10 
that – the roles that Estina played was the correct way of doing things.  
What was done wrong, what deviated from the norm?  What was the 
normal way of doing these things and what were the procedures which 
were supposed to be followed?  What – who qualified to do what?  
Because it just seems that Estina was taking roles where – which 
should be done by somebody who does not have an interest in the 
project but Estina had an interest in the project? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson.  When you look at 
the – the setup.  I am appointing you as an implementing agent for a 
project of let us say 570 million.  But you are saying to me I think this 
20 
is a good investment I also want to put in 200 million.  Or fairly 
speaking you would say this sounds good.  Are you experienced in this 
kind of an activity and so on and so forth and if you say yes I am 
experienced I have got market, I have got 200 million over and above 
what you are going to invest you might be attracted to enter into such a 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 169 of 217 
 
deal Chairperson.  But in instances whereby you do not bring anything 
then it becomes a problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But also why should you take my word for it?  
Why should you not – if you do not have the knowledge or expertise to 
make an assessment whether I have the expertise and knowledge that 
they – that I say I have.  Why do you not go to somebody else and say, 
make an assessment of this person who wants me to spend millions on 
a certain project and says he has a lot of experience and he will put in 
some money as well.  Just give me an assessment?  Is this person the 
right kind of person to be involved with?  Do they have this – the kind 
10 
of expertise and experience that is required?  Would you not be 
expected to do that? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson.  That is why when 
you look at I think it is a profile there is a statement that they have also 
entered into a memorandum of agreement with the Paras which – which 
have got all the knowledge in as far – which are actually leading.  That 
– I am just giving what – what I have also checked and so on and so 
forth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  So by so doing you are saying, okay I 
20 
have got this one but I also have this one has partnered with this one 
that I recognise, that I respect who is actually in the big league and so 
on and so forth.  So those are some of the things.  I am just giving. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  The perspective Chairperson as you 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 170 of 217 
 
have requested me to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Other than that I do not see any other 
reason Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but tell me you are now Acting Head of the 
Department and maybe by virtue of that position you have – you now 
have access to some documents that you might not have had access to 
as Chief Director. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to this project.  To your knowledge is there 
10 
any document in the custody or possession of the Department which 
shows or which came from Paras signed by Paras people, legitimately 
in terms of which they said they were party to this whole arrangement 
with Estina? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No I have never seen one myself 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have never seen one? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  I have never seen one but I have seen 
the statement in the profile and where is says, Estina have just entered 
into a Memorandum of Agreement with the Paras. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes but I have never seen the 
Memorandum of Agreement between Paras and Estina. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  In – in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you… 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 171 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  In fact Chairman if it might assist you page 
284 of the reference bundle A has got a Memorandum of Understanding 
not Agreement – Understanding signed by Estina and Paras. This 
document was submitted to the Department.  It is bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Reference bundle A page 284.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But the essence of this Memorandum of 
Understanding Chairman as I have read it is that it is valid for one 
year. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  It is signed – it is actually – if you look at 
page … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you looking at it as well? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  295 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry are you also looking at it? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes I am looking at it Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Page 295 has the signatures but the date is 
not legible.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  295? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  295 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I see yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Oh Chairman if you go to 285 this 
Memorandum of Understanding is dated 11 April 2012.  11 April 2012 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 172 of 217 
 
page 285. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So it is an April 2012 document.  The parties 
to this document are Paras and Estina.  Ms Sanjeev Gautam is he 
authorised signatory for Estina and Mr Gajender Kumar is the 
authorised signature for Paras which is also known as VRS Foods 
Limited.  Page 295. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now to – now have you seen this document before? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No Chairperson no I have not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are seeing it for the first time. 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No Chair I am seeing it for the first 
time this one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now obviously you have – you have looked at it 
Ms Gcabashe? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I have – I have Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Excuse me.  Does it in substance or effect say that 
Paras and Estina are entering into partnership or some corporation 
relating to the Vrede Dairy Project – Vrede Farm Dairy Project? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  It does Chairman.  It says that they will enter 
into an association that – they do not call it a partnership. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So Estina would be similar to an agent as and 
when they needed expertise they would ask the Paras people to assist 
them with their expertise.  That is the essence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is general.  Is it general? 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 173 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  It is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not specific to this particular project? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  It is to the extent Chairman at 285. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  That it says that Estina at paragraph B – so 
you have an A, B and C. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  It says that Estina – third line well Estina will 
play an active role in identifying and securing opportunities in the 
territory being South Africa and the company will assist Estina with the 
10 
technology and commissioning of those identified opportunities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that still does not say anything about this 
particular project. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I know they do – they do mention the dairy… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  They do Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh have you picked it up somewhere? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes I have picked it up somewhere 
where they are saying – the company has been – that is A under … 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  That is under.  It says the company 
has been in the business of implementing Dairy Projects and production 
and marketing of the dairy products.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman if I might be of assistance?  Page 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 174 of 217 
 
287 the product means a dairy project and dairy products.  The project 
refers to the strategic partnership between Estina and the Department 
of Agriculture and Rural Development in the Free State Province of 
South Africa to implement a dairy project in the province. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay so at least that is specific. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you made the point that it is for one year. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  It is a one year.  My reading of it at the time 
it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the project was going to be for a much longer 
10 
period. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  A three year project Chairman. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Three year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And Chairman the question you really ask at 
the outset is – is there a documents that we know comes from Paras? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And can be authenticated by Paras. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Ja that is the –  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  That is your question. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because even – even though there might – there 
might be somebody’s signature here who purports to be a director.  
Well I see it just says director.  And then there is something written I 
do not know what.  So the question is was this authenticated?  Was this 
authenticated?  Did anybody do their homework that was supposed to 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 175 of 217 
 
be done to make sure that Paras was party to this agreement and would 
provide?  As far as you know are you able to indicate whether anybody 
did that kind of homework? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No Chairperson I am unable to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are unable to say. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you have not seen anything in the records 
relating to this project that tells you that that homework was done? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No, no Chairperson.  Except the 
mentioning of Paras. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paras yes.  Do we even know whether the Department 
knew who Paras was other than what they may have been told either by 
Estina people or by those who may have supported the idea of this 
project?  Do we know anything along those lines?  Do you know 
anything from yourself? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No, no Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Do you know as a fact that Mr Peter Thabethe 
visited India to go and speak to the Paras people at Paras?  Do you 
20 
know anything about that? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No.  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Well I do not know from the legal team and the 
investigation side but it may be important that communication with 
Paras be made so that they can say whether they know anything about 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 176 of 217 
 
this.  
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman a letter was written to Paras it 
should have been about if not three weeks ago in that region. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Last I knew we were still waiting for them to 
respond. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  What the media has inferred is that Paras has 
denied completely having anything to do with this dairy farm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Or with South Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But we have sent a letter out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman as the commission and we are 
waiting for a response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE: What we have also done Chairman is try to 
find out if this particular Mr Kumar might have been in the country in 
April of 2012. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And therefore he signed this document while 
he was in South Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  In April of 2012. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 177 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  We will be coming back with the information 
that we source. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Mr Peter Thabethe really is the person who 
can assist with much of this information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes of course also it is necessary to just check with 
Paras whether they had anybody by that name around that time? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  We have googled Chairman and yes if it is – if 
he is not the founder he is the senior person in Paras. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay well that is… 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Mr Kumar. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us hope Google is reliable enough. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Which is why the investigators have through 
the secretariat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have sent a letter. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Sent a proper letter out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Making enquiries on behalf of the 
commission. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is fine.  But what is important is that the 
Acting Head of the Department even though he might not have been 
acting Head at that time the Acting Head who has access to all the 
records of the Department insofar as this project may be concerned 
says he has not come across any document that suggests that any 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 178 of 217 
 
authentication, authentication was done.  Okay thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairman I have just got a few short 
questions left.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  The first being Doctor Masiteng do 
you know anything about the registration of Mahoma-Mobung PTY 
Limited as a company on the 11 October 2013? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  I do not know that.  I only learnt from 
when you were asking me Chairman it was for the first time. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes that is fine.  Do you know of Mr Kamal 
10 
Vasram he is the Director, sole director of Estina? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  I was introduced to Mr Kamal by the 
Hawks on the 14 t h and the 15 t h.  I do not know him.  It was for the first 
time I see that person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  14 t h and 15 t h of when this month? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No it was the 14 t h of February 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  When the Valentine’s Day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  And also I met the other group on the 
20 
15 t h that was on my son’s birthday and that was for the first time I see 
the family related to the Gupta’s it was for the first time. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  In court 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  In? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  This was in court? 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 179 of 217 
 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  That was in court.  Yes I was taken to 
Johannesburg where there was other groups – that is why I am saying I 
was introduced to the Gupta’s by the Hawks.  I have never seen them 
after that. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Do you know of Mr Chandrama Prasad who is 
reputed to have been the project officer of Estina? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  At the farm. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes there was a visit I made and then 
I found him there as a project manager and also to the offices of the 
10 
Department he also went there. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Now there is a witness who will come and say 
that Mr Prasad know nothing about dairy and that Estina as an IT 
company knew nothing about dairy.  Was that your assessment when 
you visited the farm and found Mr Prasad there? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  At that time there were I think there 
was a vet also who had an experience on the animal side.  I think in my 
opinion I was quite happy with the way he was explaining, analysing the 
diseases and what he is dealing with and so on.  But with Prasad I did 
not see any dairy except a manager. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  The person who was giving you an 
explanation was the vet not Prasad? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Was the vet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Jankielsohn, Jankielsohn. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 180 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Indicated when he gave evidence that Estina was 
actually an IT company.  It was – it had nothing to do with – with 
farming and with you know dairy farming.  Do you know anything about 
that? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Chairperson I also learnt about that.  
Quite frankly I was not aware until I saw it on the media and so on and 
so forth but I was not aware at all about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Then there is Mr Ashook Narayan who is said 
10 
to have been an economic advisor in the Premier’s office.  Have you 
met him? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  I struggle to even – Ashook I might 
have met him but not maybe like discussing or whatever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you are the Acting Head of the Department now 
would it shock you if somebody in your department gave a dairy farming 
project to an IT company or is it – or not necessarily? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  To implement? 
CHAIRPERSON:  To do what Estina was supposed to do here. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Chairperson if I – I – let me put it like 
20 
this.  If you give it to a person who does not have that experience there 
must be an assurance that that person will project manage and use the 
expertise to implement the project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But normally would the position not be that you would 
want to give a job to somebody who has that expertise and experience? 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 181 of 217 
 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Preferably Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  If you deviated from that there would have to be 
proper justification which could happen maybe where you want to give 
people who have not been given opportunities before but then you take 
precautions to make sure that the job will be done. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So as we talk – as we speak now do you know 
of any justification why an IT company could have been given a job for 
a dairy – dairy farming? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  My apology once again Chairperson I 
10 
was not in the picture at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you now have records.  You are the Acting Head. 
You have access to the record.  Does it look like there was justification 
to give this job to Estina? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Chairperson except the fact that they 
are also bringing in their contribution and they have partnered with a 
much more experienced strategic partner in the form of Paras otherwise 
there is nothing that I can deduce. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But are you saying because they were going to spend 
their own money on the project and because they were relying on Paras 
who was said to have the expertise. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Because 
of 
that you 
would say 
there 
was 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 182 of 217 
 
justification? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  I would say yes there was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes reasons for – to consider. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is assuming that Paras has the expertise and 
that indeed it was party to the project. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Definitely Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And you would have authentic – you would 
10 
have made sure you authenticate? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether Paras is really party to this thing. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I wonder whether in addition the Department 
would have wanted to make sure that Paras also signs into some 
documents just other than having their own arrangement with Estina. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes you are correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that – so that – because if Paras has an 
arrangement or agreement with Estina only – if they have a fight and 
20 
Paras pulls out you will not know necessarily. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might not know. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may know, you might not know.  Whereas if Paras 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 183 of 217 
 
has signed something with you as well then you have a way of knowing 
when they have pulled out and then you know we cannot continue with 
these ones alone because they do not have the expertise. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  I agree with your analysis 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Chairperson what – also interesting is the 
fact that the FDC took over after Estina left.  Was the FDC the type of 
entity that could do the work you expected to be done at the farm? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  If we look at the EXCO memorandum 
10 
also the whole idea of bringing FDC it was to instil a business element 
into the projects itself.  That was the main purpose and also if you look 
at the [indistinct] processing value adding that is partly the mandate 
also of the FDC.  So FDC was brought in to actually instil that element 
of business so that the project can sustain itself.  The project can begin 
to do what is intended for – that is to benefit the beneficiaries and also 
to benefit other milk producers. Because the idea was to see to it that 
the processing plant is in operation so that you can begin to collect the 
milk and process it there and supply the school feeding schemes.  
Those were the things which I am saying the whole idea was actually 
20 
very good. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well once Estina had pulled out I assume that that 
meant Paras also pulling out to the extent that Paras may have been 
part of the project. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 184 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now Paras was relied upon for the expertise and 
experience required to run this project? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right?  Who remained who had the expertise 
and experience that Paras had provided as far as you know? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  That was the project manager.  
Because the project manager … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Is that Mr Prasad? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes the CP continued with the FDC. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But Mr Prasad had no qualification in dairy or 
10 
dairy farming. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes I am just saying from that 
movement of Estina now out you had a project manager by the name of 
Prasad.  Now Prasad FDC is taking over.  You still have Prasad.  I am 
just responding to that one.  But in terms of what the Chairperson 
wants to find out I would say – I would go back to your analysis and say 
if we did have a document that also [indistinct] like we were going to be 
in the position to say you can go but remember we still have an 
agreement with you, you need to complete the following outstanding 
activities. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but my question is a slightly different one.  Estina 
has pulled out.  With Estina pulling out Paras pulled out. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is my understanding. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 185 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The expertise on the basis of which the expertise that 
Paras was thought to bring in is now gone.  Who remained or who was 
there in regard to the project with the expertise and experience that 
was required which would take the place of Paras?  Was there 
anybody? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No.  That is why I am saying 
Chairperson the only people who remained were the people who were 
part of that let us call it partnership of Estina Paras that the whole 
team that was working then was never sought of relieved with Estina.  
They remained with the FDC. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did they have the expertise – the necessary 
expertise and experience? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Except the experience having learnt – 
having started with the project but the expertise and so on I do not 
think they had that expertise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you… 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Because the expertise will include 
also the issues of marketing and so on and so forth. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether since then because I was told 
that the project continues.  Do you know whether since then steps have 
been taken to ensure that the project has the expertise or experience 
that is required for it to operate viably? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson what we did in terms 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 186 of 217 
 
of also the court order the Department is now in charge of the project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  That is in line with the court order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  We have a senior managers 
responsible for research and also some of our researchers they are the 
one who are now assisting on the dairy project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So now the necessary expertise and experience is 
there? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Is there Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Have your learned friends found the document 
they were looking for? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No they have not.  They have not 
Chairman and I must apologise.  I know we have seen that document 
and Dr Masiteng knows that we have. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  I know ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But I think Chairman it is a fair question 
to ask him just to give you a summary of what he thought the deviation 
20 
could entail.  What …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well did you say it is in the bundle? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is not in this bundle Chairman … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not in this bundle … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But I … 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 187 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or any of the bundles? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Or any of the bundles that you have 
Chairman … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And I do apologise … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because I am very sure that we have that 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Somewhere in the other documentation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I saw you holding some document there.  Is it 
the document? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Then copies can – can be made.  Have you 
seen it in any of the bundles that you looked at? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but you – but you – you have got – is there a 
copy? 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Which document are you referring to 
Dr Masiteng?  I just want to be sure we are talking about the same 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well somebody can just … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  The one – there was … 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 188 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Show it to you. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  There was a question from the 
Chairperson that had two submissions. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  The second one that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Deals with the deviation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is the one now … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was looking for. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Then I am satisfied it is the correct one. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Okay.  Can I have a look at the document – 
at your copy?  I will bring it back. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman, can I ask him two short 
questions 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  That we can just dispose of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is fine. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Dhlamini referred to you in his 
evidence yesterday and said you had met him and spoken to him 
outside the hall just before a meeting.  Do you confirm that that 
discussion did take place? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes I confirm that. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 189 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And what was that discussion about? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  When I arrived there I was informed 
that – remember it was for the first time I met with the group and I was 
informed that Mr Dhlamini is actually the one who is – who is leading 
the group and I could sense that the venue is too small and I then said 
okay it is fine.  Request Mr Dhlamini to come here so that we can agree 
on the venue. 
I was a little bit surprised on the issues of the – we – we do 
not where do you belong to with the farmers.  Not at all.  You are not 
allowed to do that as Government Officials.  It does not matter which 
10 
political party are you affiliated to.  What is fundamental is the service 
that you are requesting. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Then the other important aspect is the 
Beneficiary Agreement. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE 
SC: 
 
The 
Chairman 
was 
interested 
in 
understanding how you came to sign that Beneficiary Agreement. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  As soon as the Chairman finishes reading 
can you please give him an explanation? 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Copies of the - the document will be made and I 
suggest that we – we mark – we include it in the – in the bundle. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  In the reference bundle Chairman? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you can decide whether in his – in the – in the 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 190 of 217 
 
file that has got his statement or in the reference bundle but it should 
be included.  It is important but I just want to ask some questions.  I 
see Dr Masiteng that – (clearing throat) excuse me – the document is 
dated 5 July 2012 which I think is the same date … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As the other document … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is addressed to Mr M Peter Thabethe the head 
of Department Agriculture exactly the same way as the other one. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that correct? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in terms of the purpose it appears that it has a 
third purpose which the other document did not have.  Is that right? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Exactly Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the first two bullet points under – under the 
purpose would be the same as the other document.  Is that right? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The third purpose says: 
“It is to get approval from the head of department to 
20 
deviate from the normal Supply Chain Management 
processes and procedure and appoint Estina/Paras 
to implement establish integrated dairy in Vrede.” 
You – you remember that? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 191 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and on page 2 it says among other things: 
“The department in consultation with Estina/Paras 
have identified 4 400 hectares of municipal land in 
Vrede.” 
And then in the next paragraph it says: 
“Paras involvement in milk industry will improve 
milk productivity locally, provincially, nationally and 
internationally.” 
Then it says a lot of things about Paras.  Paras’ involvement 
in the internationally market including Germany, France, Turkey, 
10 
Belgium and so on and then in that same paragraph on page 2 that is 
the middle paragraph it says: 
“The Paras are international recognised and would 
like to maintain that recognition.  It is against this 
background the department is seeking to deviate 
against the normal SCM processes and procedures 
and enter into a Memorandum of Agreement with 
Estina/Paras 
to 
implement 
and 
manage 
the 
operations of the project during its life cycle.” 
That is part of what it says.  Then – and then on page 3 paragraph 4: 
20 
“The department has set aside R30 million under 
Mohuma Mobung in the current financial year 
2012/2013 for this initiative.  The intended period 
for the completion of this initiative is over a period 
of three years.” 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 192 of 217 
 
Five: 
“All relevant role players will be informed about the 
outcome of the submission.” 
Six: 
“The parties consulted the executive management 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Agriculture 
and 
Rural 
Development. 
 
Phumelela 
Local 
Municipality 
Management and the management of Estina/Paras.” 
That means all those have been consulted and then under 
paragraph 7 the heading is “Authority for Approval”.  Then it says: 
10 
“The Authority of Approval is vested in the head of 
the Department of Agriculture.” 
Paragraph 4 - there is recommendation.  That is now eight. 
“It is recommended that approval is granted by the 
head of department to:” 
Bullet point 1: 
“Accept the proposal from Estina/Paras with regard 
to the establishment of integrated dairy in Vrede 
and …” 
Bullet point 2: 
20 
“Enter into a Memorandum of Agreement with 
Estina/Paras to implement the integrated dairy 
project in Vrede.” 
Bullet point 3: 
“To 
deviate 
from 
the 
normal 
supply 
chain 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 193 of 217 
 
management processes and procedure and appoint 
Estina/Paras to implement establish integrated 
dairy in Vrede.” 
And then below that is – are three blocks similar to the ones 
we saw in regard to the – in the other document.  The first block says: 
“Submitted by” 
And then there is a signature and then says: 
“Dr T J Masiteng GM District Services.” 
Then the next block says: 
“Recommended/Not recommended” 
10 
And not recommended is crossed out which means it has 
been recommended and there is a signature and it says: 
“Ms S Dlamini CFO DARD.” 
The next block says: 
“Approved/Not approved” 
And there is a signature and it says: 
“Mr P M Thabethe HOD Agriculture.” 
Now I – I have said that under paragraph 8 there is a recommendation 
there. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who is making that recommendation? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  It is – it is the CFO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  No, no.  That is before the block.  I know you do 
not have the benefit of … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Oh. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 194 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Looking at – at the document but as I understand it 
from the beginning of the document you are the one who is speaking 
here.  Is it not? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who is writing here? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So you are saying these things on page 1 and 
page 2? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and page 3.  You are saying all of these things.  
10 
Then we come to eight.  There is a recommendation under paragraph 8 
on page 4 and it says: 
“It is recommended that approval is granted …” 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  “…by the head of department.” 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes.  It is granted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then there are those three bullet points. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then at the bottom there are those three blocks. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am asking the question who is making that 
recommendation under paragraph 8. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Is the HOD. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 195 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  The HOD is the one who is saying – 
the recommendations he will be saying Chairperson.  If you are saying 
it is recommended that approval is granted yes it means the HOD. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  If you are – if you are saying … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can he be recommending to himself? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes.  Most – most probably yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say he is recommending to himself? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes.  Remember what is happening 
with this kind of submissions in the department you are very clear as an 
Accounting Officer that this is what I can recommend.  If … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No but – but the – the actual the approves I thought 
that was the understanding. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He does the approval? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes of what … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  He is supporting.  You do not just 
approve anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – but documents such as this emanate from a 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 196 of 217 
 
lower level. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that correct? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and maybe without talking about this one in 
particular but generally they would emanate from a lower level and if 
the requirement is that before they reach the HOD they must go through 
– through somebody else who must make a recommendation. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then the person who initiates the document is 
10 
actually the one who is seeking a recommendation from somebody and 
ultimately approval from the head of department.  I am talking generally 
now.  (Intervenes). 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes I understand you clearly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You understand. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  You are correct.  You are 100 percent 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I am correct? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now I am saying to you I am looking at this 
20 
document on the basis that that would be – that was (indistinct) as 
well. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and then I ask the question who therefore was 
making the recommendation that is at paragraph 8. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 197 of 217 
 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  In the normal processes? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I am back now on this document. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  On this one? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  It means … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  The – the CFO in this case … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG: 
 
Is 
now 
recommending 
to 
the 
Accounting Officer … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG: 
 
And 
the 
Accounting 
Officer 
is 
approving. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but the C – the CFO did not write these things 
here. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is correct. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were written by somebody else. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes.  What is happening in most 
20 
cases … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  The – such a submission … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Cannot be recommended by the CFO 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 198 of 217 
 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  If she does not have input on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  It can go to and fro 10 times … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Until she is saying I am happy … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  And the same applies to the HOD. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  It can – the HOD can even decide to 
say I am no more approving it and then return it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see if there was no block here saying submitted 
by and with somebody’s signature there I would say and all that we had 
was the CFO’s signature and the approval.  Then I would say that I 
need to look at only the two … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I want to find out who is speaking – who is saying it 
is recommended that approval is granted by the head of department.  I 
would look at those who are here. 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Now the fact of the matter is that there are 
three people here. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yourself, the CFO and the head of department.  The 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 199 of 217 
 
CFO has recommended.  The head of department has approved. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So my impression is that the person who is making 
the recommendation at paragraph 8 would be the compiler of the - or 
the person who submits the document.  So I want you to comment on 
that.  Why should I not read this along those lines? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  You are correct Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  With your analysis to say … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  If for instance let me say I am 
requesting a car. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  A subsidised vehicle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Then I – I will submit - it is not even 
necessary because we have a policy now to say … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  You do not need a hundred people 
signing … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  They will just maybe submit.  It will go 
to the Director.  It will go to the Chief Director but it still has to go to 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 200 of 217 
 
the CFO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  The CFO is the last person who will 
then recommend to – to the HOD.  That is under – let us categorise 
under a normal … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Situation. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Submission … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Which I am – I want. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  It is me who is requesting a pen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  It is me who is requesting a laptop. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  It like when you are … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you – when a Chief Director wants to go on 
leave.  Maybe not – let us not say Chief Director a Director. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When they want to go on leave.  The Chief Director 
who I assume would be their immediate superior … 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would need to sign whether – maybe recommend.  I 
do not know. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  They approve. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe ultimately somebody else must approve. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 201 of 217 
 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  There are delegations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are delegations. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  The Chief – in this case … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Let us say it starts from the Deputy 
Director or the Assistant Director. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  The Deputy Director … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Will recommend or support … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  And then the Director will also maybe 
say I know … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or recommend. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  recommend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  And then the CFO signs.  The Chief 
Director in this case … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Approves. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Approves, yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So that – that is the context of  
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Those are the ladders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which I am looking at that you have somebody who is 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 202 of 217 
 
requesting.  You have got somebody who needs approval … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ultimately … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the person who has the authority to approve does 
not want to or cannot approve unless somebody else has recommended 
and therefore there is … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A requestor, there is a recommender and there is an 
approver. 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  That is why we are saying in most … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  If it was according to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Normal. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Let us say – no.  If we are saying we 
want to do away with other officials to sign documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  We could say HOD it is you who wants 
20 
this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Compile it and approve it yourself … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  But in this case the HOD has got the 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 203 of 217 
 
powers to say compile it for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  You cannot just write it and say here 
is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  You will still have to say okay you 
want it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Then I am compiling it to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  It still has to go to another person … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  And then it goes to the HOD. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is your point that although here it – it does look 
like you – you were making the recommendation.  You were just doing 
what the HOD wanted you to do? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes which could be any person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  In this case yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But not that it was something coming from – from you. 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He wanted to achieve a certain objective and he 
asked you to prepare a document.  You prepared a document.  He had 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 204 of 217 
 
told you that he was deviating. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He thought there were enough grounds to deviate.  
You might have had a different view but your attitude was it is his 
decision and I will prepare the document. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The only problem is just that your name is there, your 
signature is there. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes.  I could have just compiled it, 
give it to him. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You could have said well I do not want – I can 
prepare it for you but … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It will be in your name not in my name. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Exactly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you.  Lerato take (intervenes). 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chair.  We found the copies 
that we had. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh have you found it?  Oh, give it to Dr Masiteng.  
Thank you very much.  Okay, thank you.  I am done. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We will add it to the reference bundle 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And so this document we will simply 
paginate properly and put in your reference bundle. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 205 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If I may just ask one last question arising 
from the questions you have been asking Dr Masiteng? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  From this document Dr Masiteng you did 
not stand to benefit anything really … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No, nothing at all. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  By … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Compiling it in the manner in which you 
10 
compiled it. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay, thank you.  Are you done? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The only other thing you were interested 
in Chairman were the Beneficiary Agreements which were drafted.  Well 
whether they were prepared by Dr Masiteng.  I do not know if you still 
want to hear his version of those Beneficiary Agreements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – unless you – well you have looked at them.  
Unless there - there is something important if they are there. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It – it was really just why they were 
20 
compiled in that particular manner.  So they had not separated the 
different beneficiaries. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The clauses did not really make sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 206 of 217 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So when Mr Venter was here you were 
interrogating that issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Dr Masiteng has an explanation.  Maybe 
he should give us a very short explanation so on record … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  He has given you an explanation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No I think ask – ask him because I have 
forgotten what my line of questioning was, ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So Dr Masiteng could you just explain to 
10 
the Chairman how you came to be responsible for those Beneficiary 
Agreements and why they were drafted in the manner in which they 
were drafted. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Thank you Chairperson.  What 
happened is that as a compliance issue after an approval you must 
enter into a Beneficiary Agreement with those beneficiaries.  That is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  That – is that the agreement that was between 
the department and the projects? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Correct. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the project with the assistance of the beneficiary 
or something like that. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Correct.  That is the one … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Now I remember, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   That bothered you a bit. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 207 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Now well what was strange to me is when I 
looked at – at those agreements at least one of them they just did not 
seem to be you know – some of the aspects did not seem to make 
sense like it was between the department and the dairy project.  You 
cannot have an agreement with a project you know but maybe if 
whoever drafted them and if you say it is you it is because you are not 
– I should not say you are not – you might not be a lawyer. 
I do not know all your qualifications.  You might not be a 
lawyer and therefore you - you might not have appreciated those 
things. 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Okay.  No, no thank you very much 
Chairperson.  The – the agreement was not actually drafted by myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  It was drafted by our legal team.  We 
also realised with time that – remember that was in 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Then we realised that there are 
certain clauses that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  We have to clean off which our legal 
20 
team 
has 
gone 
through 
that. 
 
We 
also 
went 
through 
AGs 
recommendations … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  And findings and then it was correct 
but fact of the matter is that that one Chairperson … 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 208 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Was signed with the beneficiaries … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  of the dairy project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  That was the thing … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  And you cannot take a project to 
national … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  If it does not have beneficiaries. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  That is why they were forced to give 
us that - the list – the first list … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Of the beneficiaries … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  And the second list which was now 
going with the beneficiary agreement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  hm. 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Had to go with the IDs … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Because now we are sure that this 
project has been approved … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 209 of 217 
 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  And that I did because I was 
delegated to do that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  And I can read to you the letter that 
was delegating that responsibility to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no.  The issue was not so much the delegation in 
terms of what I was looking at.  It was simply the content and … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And certain aspect – aspects of it.  So – but – but the 
agreement that I – I am talking about that was the one which was 
10 
saying the agreement is between the Department of Agriculture and 
then instead of telling – of giving the name of the beneficiary.  It would 
give the name of the project … 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then below that it would say something like in 
association with then the beneficiary.  That is the one I am talking 
about. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  You are spot on Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  We have corrected that in  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  The new agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that was your legal department that had drafted 
that one? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes.  It was drafted a long time - I 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 210 of 217 
 
think it was drafted … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  In 2010.  We have been using it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Until 2013 after this one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  when we said no, no, no.  There are 
certain things that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No more relevant in this case. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Just for the record Chairman that 
particular agreement is on page 1-3-3-3 of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  1333? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  correct … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman of Reference Bundle D. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Just for record purposes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise I am done. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman otherwise those are the … 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 211 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Questions. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Issues we really wanted to raise with 
Dr Masiteng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Unless there are other matters that he 
thinks are important that we have not touched on that he does want you 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  To – to know about we – we … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you are done. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Have done our bit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is – is there anything else that you feel the 
Commission should know about this whole project that you have not 
mentioned? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No Chairperson.  Thank you very 
much for the opportunity.  Chairperson I just want to indicate that there 
has never been a – a meeting where I was called and corruption into 
this project was discussed with me.  Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  I – I have no idea whatsoever … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  About the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Issues. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  I am also shocked about some of the 
things Chairperson. 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 212 of 217 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  That is why I am also in – in 
understanding the – the District Directors and the project coordinators 
emotions and feelings around these things … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  And I know they were doing it out of 
their own heart. They were doing their job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  They knew about … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  These other challenges that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG: 
 
That 
we 
are 
confronted 
with 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  But thank you very much Chairperson 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  For the opportunity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – just the last part if you are able to say.  You 
20 
might not be able to say off the top of your head.  More or less how 
much is – are the taxpayers paying for this project annually maybe in 
the last three years?  More or less not necessarily the exact figure.  In 
what - what region in terms of amounts are we talking about as it 
continues? 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 213 of 217 
 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or is that difficult to say without (intervenes)? 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  It is a little bit difficult Chairperson 
because even the court order … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG: 
 
Is 
suggesting 
that 
look 
there 
department must budget for the project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  I think it was – it is done in good faith 
to say … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  You cannot let it fall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  You have to invest.  So we are still 
budgeting … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  For it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  In terms of the court order … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  But I think I can go into – we will be 
able to abstract from our last report … 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes). 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  I might be able to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and send it to the legal team just to say maybe 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 214 of 217 
 
from the time it started this is what has been paid – has been spent 
annually up to – up to now the previous financial year by the Provincial 
Department and maybe national.  I do not know.  Just to give us a full 
picture of how much money has gone into it. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if you could prepare something like that and be in 
touch with the legal team that would be very helpful. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  No thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  No thank you very – thank you very much 
for coming to give evidence to the Commission.  We appreciate it.  You 
10 
are excused. 
DR TANKISI JANKI MASITENG:  Okay, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you – thank you Chairman. We 
have your bundles for tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And we will be handing those up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Tomorrow how many witnesses have you got? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  There are two witnesses Chairman … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And they as you can see … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Their bundles are fairly slim. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE 
SC: 
 
It 
is 
Mr Doctor Radebe 
and 
24 JULY 2019 – DAY 139 
 
Page 215 of 217 
 
Mr Willie Basson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  They should not take too long Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  No that is fine.  Is Mr Thabethe coming? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We have …

ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  MEC Rockman Finance, MEC Thabethe 
Agriculture, MEC Lamleli Agriculture.  They all have 3.3 notices … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And then Mr Zwane and Mr Magpele … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But it is scheduling those appearances 
Chairman that might be a little bit of a challenge.  We will see how it 
goes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, no.  Arrangements need to be made for – 
for the legal team to say to them we would like to talk to you about 
10 
what certain witnesses say about you and/or to say we would like you 
to provide your version by way of affidavits but preferably if they agree 
an interview where they can put their version and statements can be 
prepared or if an arrangement is made with their lawyers to say we will 
provide their statements. 
We will prepare them and an agreement would have to be 
made in terms of timeframes.  That would still be fine but in the end it 
will be important that they come and give their side of the story as well.  
Ja, ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and be questioned, ja.  Okay.  We – tomorrow
