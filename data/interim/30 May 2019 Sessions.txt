CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Sello, good morning everybody. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that there has not been any improvement? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Actually Chair it is surprising there has not 
because if the Chair has regard to the spine of the file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The correction has been made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  How we did not find itself to the cover as a 
10 
matter we were discussing this morning but I have been assured  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That they all will be reprinted and refiled at 
least there … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   There is progress the spine is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well I guess we must acknowledge the progress 
that has happened. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even if it does not meet the expectations that we had. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Undoubtedly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We shall endeavour to improve. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And this is now Chair marked 88 – BB8[c].  Bo 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 3 of 116 
 
– [a], [b] and [c] will all be .. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Sello started by saying 88. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I know Chair.  I am looking at 8 and it affects 
what I say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  They will all be corrected this afternoon so 
the next time the Chair has regard to these files they will be… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. Hm. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair we are still on MNS Reports.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And we are now dealing with the MNS Report 
that is titled the Relocation of 2 OEM’s to Durban. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair will recall Mr Sedumedi dealt with 
95 100 1064 and appointment of TA’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Today we deal with the relocation and 
tomorrow Doctor Bloom will deal with transactions flowing from the 
20 
advice of the TA’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which will be tomorrow and that will complete 
the MNS reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 4 of 116 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The witness we will – we have today is Mr 
Thobani Mnyandu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And with your permission may he be sworn in 
Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay please administer the oath or affirmation? 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Thobani Trevor Mnyandu. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed 
oath? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No I do not. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that all the evidence you will give 
will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, if so please 
raise your right hand and say, so help me God. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  So help me God. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  Chair before Mr Mnyandu deals 
with his presentation perhaps to place his testimony in its proper 
context.  The Chair will recall that last week Mr Gonsalves representing 
the minority shareholder in the CNR Consortium testified and he spoke 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 5 of 116 
 
in large part on the relocation.  The evidence of Mr Gonsalves concerns 
relocation from the perspective of the bidders or the minority 
shareholder within the bidder.  Mr Mnyandu today is dealing with the 
same issue except from a different angle.  He is dealing with it from the 
Transnet perspective and whether Transnet was aware in part of the 
increases in relocations costs that were being proposed.  What position 
it took in regard to those increases and whether it was agreeable to 
such increases.  So at time the testimony might sound familiar but we 
would like to point out that this from the Transnet perspective.  Thank 
you Chair.  With that context then Mr Mnyandu you confirm that you 
10 
have prepared a presentation on the relocation of the OEM’s to Durban.  
You should have next to you a file marked BB8[c]. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes I confirm Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you confirm that that is the presentation 
you have prepared? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed it is so. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The structure of the file Chair is the first part 
of the file is the actual presentation.  There are tabs 1 to 7 that follow 
documents under tabs 1 to 7 that follow the presentation.  Mr Mnyandu 
please explain what those documents are in tabs 1 to 7? 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  These are documents that are not 
necessarily annexed to our report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you said he is testifying from the perspective of 
Transnet.  Do you… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No, no he is giving a report on how Transnet 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 6 of 116 
 
dealt with the relocation issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but let me know first about him – about him.  Who 
is he? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Oh.  Yes I was going to do that Chair I was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we go into anything. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We go into the documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I must know who he – who he is. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then Mr Mnyandu could you very briefly tell 
the Chair who you are, what role you played in this investigation and 
your relationship with MNS? 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair as already has been stated 
in for the record my name is Thobani Trevor Mnyandu.  I am an attorney 
and one of the directors at MNS Attorneys.  I am the lead attorney in 
the Department of Construction and Engineering Law.  We offer a wide 
range of services in that area of law which includes what is referred to 
as front end services.  From a large perspective we advise organs of 
state as to what should go into tender documents, what they should 
look like so we advise on the legal framework that is concerned with 
the preparation of such documents.  We also play a huge role in 
advising organs of state and contractors alike on contract management 
20 
1 but more specifically in relation to disputes that arise from 
construction engineering contracts including but not limited to bank 
guarantees, advanced payment bond guarantees and the like. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  And you were directly involved in 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 7 of 116 
 
the investigation of this particular aspect the relocation of the 2 
OEM’s? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes I confirm I was directly 
involved I led the team that put together the report. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  You were still explaining to 
the Chair the structure of your submission made up of your 
presentation and followed by 7 documents as filed under tabs 1 to 7. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair in consultation with the 
10 
evidence leaders we put together a presentation that summarises the 
context and the conclusions of the report.  The exhibits that are marked 
TTM1 to TTM7 are documents that are not necessarily attached to the 
report but no new matter arises from them so it does not seek to raise 
new points but they expand on the points that are contained in the 
reports. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then the issues emanating from TTM1 to 7 
are foreshadowed in the report? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed they are Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Except the report does not attach the 
20 
document as an exhibit in respect of each of the points? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed it is so. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  With that explanation then I think we 
have the proper context. Could you lead us through your presentation? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Thank you Chair.  Chair just to give 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 8 of 116 
 
you’re an overview of what the presentation deals with we have got the 
contents page at slide number 2.  The contents page outlines that we 
will give you the background in relation to the issue of relocation.  Most 
importantly we will ask first the question of what is relocation and 
whether there was a commercial rationale to it?  We will then deal with 
communications that were sent to the OEM’s in relation to the issue of 
relocation.  As well as highlight to you at the outset as to what was the 
attitude of each OEM in respect thereof.  We will then deal from the 
one perspective of the OEM first with the approval process.  What 
communications were had to take the issue of relocation costs as it 
10 
were forward?  In particular we will deal with a particular memoranda 
prepared internally at Transnet.  We will deal with internal meetings as 
well as email communications as I have said.  The meetings that were 
held with the respective OEM’s.  We will then highlight to you Chair 
that prior to the approval of the relocation costs what critical 
communications were had amongst the negotiation team members 
within Transnet.  We will deal with – Chair with the involvement of a 
structure known as the Transnet Internal Audit who ought to have 
played a particular role in the facilitation of the negotiations as well as 
the conclusion of the approval of the relocation costs.  Chair we will 
20 
then take you through the sale and findings of an independent expert 
that was contracted by us pursuant to a prima facie view that we held 
on the relocation costs.  That is a rail logistics company that does work 
in the space.  Finally Chair we will conclude by giving you our findings. 
Also explaining what our findings mean for Transnet considered 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 9 of 116 
 
together with the findings of the independent expert who by and large 
as we found support the prima facie view that we had.  The last bit we 
will deal with Chair relates to the recommendations made to Transnet. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  You may then start. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Thank you Chair.  Chair just to 
outline the background again. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Excuse me Mr Mnyandu I apologise.  I get a 
message here that you are not particularly audible could you pull the 
microphone closer to you. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  I apologise Chair. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  Okay thank you. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Right.  Firstly Chair just to outline 
the background that led to Mncedisi Ndlovu & Sedumedi Attorneys 
being requested to undertake an investigation on this issue.  It arose 
out of the fact that during July 2015 Transnet approved the relocation 
costs for both BT Bombardier Transportation and China North Rail at 
amounts of R618 457 125.00 and R647 181 494.00 respectively.  The 
issue of relocation Chair has been the subject of intense debate riddled 
with allegations of corruption that was said to be associated with it.  
When we undertook the investigations we therefore set a couple of 
20 
questions that applied to the investigation.  And this slide we seek to 
summarise what those questions were.  Firstly Chair we needed to 
know what was relocation in itself?  What is the meaning of relocating?  
We then needed to question whether there was indeed relocation in this 
instance.  Whether it was envisaged in the business case because the 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 10 of 116 
 
business case by and large Chair as evidence has been led now was 
the document that gave effect to the line items that would make up the 
total budget for the 1064 locomotives procurement process.  We then 
needed to interrogate when exactly and by whom the decision to 
relocate the two OEM’s was taken and whether or not there was any 
commercial rationale provided for the relocation of the two OEM’s.  
Lastly we needed to ask ourselves and investigate and come to a 
conclusion on whether or not the approved relocation costs that we 
have just referred were indeed justifiable.  Chair in considering the first 
question of what is relocation we decided to consult the Oxford 
10 
Dictionary.  You will see there Chair at slide number 5 that we make the 
point that the Oxford Dictionary considers relocation to be the action of 
moving to a new place and establishing one’s home or business there.  
Chair relocation therefore proceeds from the premise that there is a 
move from one place to another.  Following on from this Chair you will 
then get context as to why both in our report as well as in the 
presentation the word “relocation” is in inverted commas.  As early as 
June 2018 when we first interviewed the project engineer of Transnet 
that is heading from a Transnet perspective the manufacturing of the 
locomotives and certify his acceptance from time to time.  We were 
20 
informed by Mr Frikkie Harris that 1. No OEM moved from one place to 
Durban and that BT more clearly BT and CNR had not set up any jigs 
nor had they established site when the request for them to be located 
in Durban was made.  The finding that we made therefore arising from 
this was that there was no relocation.  Just to explain what jigs are?  
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 11 of 116 
 
Those are metal materials that are set up in a manufacturing site of 
locomotives in order to bend the materials that are there for the 
manufacturing of the locomotive to a particular degree.  Chair in slide 
number 6 as has already been canvassed before you this morning our 
view – our finding is that the word relocation is a misnomer insofar as it 
is mentioned in the context of the 1064 locomotives transaction.  Put 
differently and to reiterate the point we found that there was no 
relocation of either BT nor was there relocation of CNR.  The 
noteworthy point to be made at this point Chair is that whilst there was 
not a relocation per se of any OEM there was a decision communicated 
10 
to the OEM’s for them to be located at a place different to the one that 
they had initially thought they would be when they put in their tender 
submissions.  But Chair as you will see going forward we have found 
that all communications were had in this regard prior to the conclusion 
of the contract.  As we take you through the presentation we will deal 
with the respective communications or rather the communications with 
the respective OEM’s.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair the question that arose from 
what I have just explained when the decision was taken to change the 
20 
location of the two OEM’s is whether there was a commercial rationale 
linked to that decision.  And Chair the issue is covered in a report 
commissioned by PWC who were instructed by Transnet between 
January and February 2014 to conduct an assessment of whether first 
of all Transnet Engineering and operating division of Transnet was 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 12 of 116 
 
going to be able to deliver on the 1064 locomotive programme 1 and 2 
to advise amongst other things as to whether or not there were 
available facilities to house each of the OEM’s.  Chair you will recall 
that initially when the tender was issued it was issued for the 
manufacturing of electric locomotives as well as diesels locomotives on 
the one side.  The view at that point was that there were going to be 
two OEM’s.  The PWC report Chair is to be found at Volume 12 page 
8927.  But what we have tried to do in this slide is to summarise the 
findings of PWC.  Just to get back again to the issue of the decision to 
award to four different OEM’s as opposed to two that brought about the 
10 
question as to whether or not the facility that was – is known as 
Koedoespoort in Pretoria would be able to house more than two OEM’s.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Please proceed. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Going ahead Chair PWC made the 
finding that unfortunately PW – Koedoespoort would not be able to 
house more than 2 OEM’s as they would arise issues related to 
intellectual property in relation to the electric locomotives being 
conducted – being manufactured by two OEM’s as well as those being 
manufactured by the diesel OEM’s.  As a result and based on a study 
done by PWC of the facilities of Transnet around the country they put in 
20 
an alternative suggestion that the other two OEM’s could either be 
located in Uitenhage in the Eastern Cape where Transnet Engineering 
has got facilities or Durban in a place known as Bayhead.  The decision 
that was made had pros and cons to it was that the location would 
rather be Durban.  Just to point out at this point Chair that the decision 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 13 of 116 
 
and the communication in this regard was made prior to the signature 
of the contracts and during the negotiations with the four OEM’s.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And by reference to the contracts you mean 
the main contract? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes when I… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The allocation – the award. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  When I refer to… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Or the tender. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The contracts I am referring to the 
main contracts being the locomotives supply agreements concluded 
10 
with the four OEM’s. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair we then move onto the next 
slide to summarise what was the critical advice that was given to 
Transnet by PWC once they had made the recommendations.  PWC 
advised that Transnet should request the OEM’s to justify costs 
incurred as a result of the relocation and to seek alternative assembly 
locations where additional costs would not be incurred.  We make the 
point in this slide that we have found that the advice given by PWC 
above was not carried through either in the negotiations nor was it 
20 
contained in the proposals by the OEM’s for the relocation costs.  Chair 
we also make the point in this slide that in the locomotive supply 
agreements that were concluded with the two OEM’s being BT and CNR 
the concept of relocation nor the cost plays any role nor is it mentioned 
in those agreements.   
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 14 of 116 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So on that point as at the point of conclusion 
of the locomotive supply agreements we can deduce that it was not 
contemplated by the parties that any of the OEM’s would have to 
relocate and therefore incur costs as a consequence thereof?  If one on 
the strict reading of the agreement. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  On the strict reading of the 
locomotive supply agreements. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes it is so. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now after the conclusion of the agreements in 
10 
March 2014 is there document signed by both parties that opened the – 
opened up the issue of relocation and start a negotiation process in 
respect thereof and if there is such a document does that document 
indicate on – in terms of which clause in the contract such a 
negotiation is being undertaken. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  At this point I would like to take 
the Chair to TTM1 which is on page 38 of the bundle before the Chair 
this morning. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  This is email correspondence sent 
20 
to one of the OEM’s and prior to the conclusion of the locomotive 
supply agreements.  It is sent by a supply chain services personnel at 
Transnet Freight Rail who played the role of being the interface 1 in the 
negotiations of the locomotive supply agreements as well as being the 
interface as we will see later in relation to the negotiation for the 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 15 of 116 
 
relocation costs. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair as evidence has already 
been led the locomotive supply agreements were concluded on 17 
March 2014.  The email before you Chair at TTM1 on page 38 is 
addressed by Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe to Mr Aubrey Lekwane as well as a 
David Anglin who are from Bombardier Transportation.  I would like to 
read into the record if the Chair will allow? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The subject of the email reads as 
10 
follows: 
“Revised Proposal.  The date of the email is 6 March 
2014.  Dear Tenderer you are requested to submit 
your revised proposal which include the latest TE 
scope of work by no later than 14h00 tomorrow 7 
March 2014.  Price impact for Durban must be 
submitted on Monday at 10 am.  TFR also requested 
that you share your sub-contractors prices as per 
your discussion yesterday.  Kindly be on standby for 
tomorrow.  Time will be communicated in the 
20 
morning.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair this… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So that is an invitation from Transnet? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 16 of 116 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  This demonstrates that there was 
an invitation from Transnet in writing to the one OEM to give a price 
indication and factor in what it would cost the OEM – the particular 
OEM to be located and manufactured from Durban.  We have not been 
able to discover a direct response to this but from the communications 
that follow as well as the locomotive supply agreements it would seem 
that the particular OEM chose not to put in a price proposal insofar as 
our investigations are concerned and therefore the agreement was 
concluded on the basis that the particular OEM would be located 
10 
elsewhere.  Chair it is relevant at this point to take you to appendix 2 
of our report which is to found at Volume 12 pages 8830.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair if – if I may I omitted to point out Mr 
Mnyandu’s testimony will rely only on 12 and 13 so the Chair could 
have 13 ready – at the ready.  The rest are not applicable.  Thank you 
Chair.  Could you repeat that page number again Mr Mnyandu? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It is 8830 for the Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  8830 is the cover sheet the actual 
document starts at 331. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  8831. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  8831. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Apologies. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  What the Chair will see at page 
8831 is that this is an internal memorandum at Transnet addressed to 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 17 of 116 
 
Mr Brian Molefe the Group Chief Executive at the time.  The subject 
reads:  The award of TFR – of the TFR 1064 locomotives tender to 
originally equipment manufacturers and their associated sub-contracts 
with Transnet.  Below that Chair you will see it is dated 16 May 2014 
which is some two months after the conclusion of the locomotive supply 
agreements.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry Mr Mnyandu to be precise it is with 
Transnet Engineering which as you explained is a division within 
Transnet? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes.   
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is what it reads yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Transnet Engineering. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The memorandum is from a Mr 
Richard Vallihu his title at the time being Chief Executive of the 
Operating Division Transnet Engineering. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair if you turn to page 8832 the 
purpose of the memorandum is summarised as to request the Transnet 
Group Chief Executive to formally communicate the allocation of 
20 
Bombardier Transportation and CNR to Transnet Engineering Durban 
facility.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair perhaps we can turn to 8833 
so as not to detain ourselves with the memorandum and deal with the 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 18 of 116 
 
ambit we seek to draw your attention to in this memorandum.  At 
paragraph 5 at 8833 it reads as follows: 
“The decision to allocate CSR Zhuzhou electric 
locomotive company and GE just to point out CSR 
Zhuzhou 
is 
the 
CSR 
being 
the 
locomotive 
manufacturer that was awarded 359 locomotives at – 
to the Koedoespoort facility was based on the fact 
that sub-contracts with these OEM’s already exist 
and that the facility currently holds production lines 
for locomotives designed by them.” 
10 
Chair you will recall that evidence as being led by Mr Sedumedi that 
prior to the conclusion of the 1064 locomotives programme there had 
been a transaction for the acquisition of 95 locomotives which are 
electric locomotives that were manufactured at Koedoespoort by CSR 
and 43 diesel locomotives that were being manufactured by GE.  It is in 
respect those locomotives that paragraph 5 is based. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And sorry the 43 by GE were also 
manufactured in Koedoespoort? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair we then take you to 
paragraph 6 which reads: 
“CNR rolling stock South Africa which is the CNR Consortium once it 
had been incorporated have indicated their acceptance of their 
allocation to the Durban facility through their actions which we will 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 19 of 116 
 
promptly you to Chair and planning around the use of the Durban 
facility.  Bombardier Transportation has however expressed their 
requirement for an official communication informing them that their 
factory site will be Durban.” 
Section 1.1.33 of the sub-contract this relates to the sub-contract 
agreement concluded between Transnet Engineering on the one end as 
well as Bombardier reads as follows: 
“Facilities shall mean the rolling stock assembly and engineering 
facilities of the sub-contractor situated in Koedoespoort or any other 
location of the sub-contractor as may be agreed upon by the parties.  
10 
Until such time as the communication has been received Bombardier 
Transportation insists that the contractual agreement is Koedoespoort.” 
Chair in relation to what happened pursuant to this communication … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before we get there so our understanding of 
Section 1.1.33 or Clause 1.1.33 of sub-contract we must understand 
that the parties contracted on the basis that the production may be in 
Koedoespoort or any place in South Africa? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it is on that basis that they contracted 
and they accepted that term? 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And why was Bombadier Transportation saying until 
such time as the communication has been received Bombadier 
Transportation insists that the contractual agreement is Koedoespoort.  
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 20 of 116 
 
Was – was there already an arrangement in terms of which 
Koedoespoort had been agreed with them as a site? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair in relation to the main 
agreement - the Locomotives … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Supply Agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The facility … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU: 
 
For 
engineering 
or 
the 
10 
manufacturing of the locomotives is noted as Koedoespoort. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And if I may just follow on that question at 
paragraph 5 of – of that memorandum page 8833 it states that: 
“The decision to allocate both CSR and GE was 
based – was the reason …” 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It advances the reasons. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At the time that decision was made is there a 
record of a firm decision to relocate or allocate Bombadier and CNR to 
Durban? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  In our findings there had been a 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 21 of 116 
 
firm decision based on the findings of the PWC Report as well as now 
with particular reference to the correspondence that we have taken the 
Chair to at TTM1. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  You may proceed. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Thank you Chair.  Chair we would 
now like to take you to volume 12 - the same volume – at page 8837.  
Chair we can make it 8838 because 8837 is the covering page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  This is correspondence on the 
10 
letterhead of Bombadier Transportation.  It is addressed to Transnet 
Freight Rail on 6 June 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The subject reads: 
“Allocation of Bombadier Transportation to the 
Transnet Engineering’s Durban Facility - Letter of 
Mr Brian Molefe 
to 
Dr Lutz Bertling 
dated 
21 May 2014”. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  “Dear Mr Jiyane, further 
to our informal discussions Bombadier has now 
received the letter above mentioned from your 
Group Chief Executive Mr Brian Molefe via our 
Chief 
Operating 
Officer 
Mr Lutz Bertling 
on 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 22 of 116 
 
26 May 2014.  Mr Molefe officially informed us that 
Transnet Engineering’s Durban Facility should host 
our operations and asked Bombadier Transportation 
to agree.  A response letter was provided by 
Dr Bertling on 5 June 2014 confirming that our 
project team would contact TFR directly to confirm 
the next step.” 
Chair what we seek to do with this correspondence from the 
perspective of the OEM being Bombadier is that communication then 
was had and there was confirmation that it was accepted that it would 
10 
be located at Durban.  That is what we seek the Chair to note from this.  
In relation to timeline Chair and insofar as our slide number 9 is 
concerned.  We would now like to take you through the attitude of CNR 
Consortium … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And before we do so just with reference to the 
appendices you just referred us to. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  What is your interpretation of the agreements 
that is signed by Bombadier and CNR?  Would it - if one were to 
conclude that it was not open to any of the OEMs to insist on operating 
20 
from Koedoespoort would that be a – a proper interpretation of that 
agreement? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes that would be a proper 
interpretation of the agreement. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, thank you. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 23 of 116 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair at slide number 9 we would 
now like to take you through the attitude of CNR Consortium in so far 
as it concerns the decision we should say to locate or rather be located 
in the Durban Facility of Transnet Engineering.  TTM2 which is to be 
found at page 39 before the bundle that is with Chair this morning is a 
letter from the CNR Consortium.  The letter is dated 10 March.  We 
make the point at this point Chair that that is exactly a week prior to 
the conclusion of the Locomotive Supply Agreement. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It is addressed to – sorry Chair – it 
10 
is addressed to Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe who at the time was a Commodity 
Manager in the Supply Chain Services Unit of Transnet Freight Rail.  
We have already explained the particular role that she was playing in 
relation to the negotiations.  In fact we have already demonstrated it 
through the correspondence that she had sent to Bombadier on 
9 March 2014.  It says Chair: 
“Dear Lindiwe, with reference to the TFR request 
relating to the CNR response to for the cost impact 
of building the locomotives in Durban we would like 
to point out that our original quotation is based 
20 
upon building the locomotives in Koedoespoort or 
Germiston.  We understand from TE …” 
Which is meant to denote Transnet Engineering. 
“…that the Koedoespoort Facility has already been 
allocated but CNR would like to request that before 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 24 of 116 
 
a final decision is made regarding this matter that 
we are granted site visits for both Durban and 
Germiston.  As regards the request for the cost 
impact of this decision CNR would like to point out 
that our preliminary studies show that the cost of 
building the locomotives in Durban will be higher 
than the cost of building the locomotives in 
Germiston.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair if you turn overleaf it is then 
10 
from CNR dated 11 March “The Impact of Manufacturing in Durban 
versus Johannesburg.”  What we have tried to do in slide number 9 and 
the two slides that follow is to summarise and be able to take you 
through the particular quotation – as we see it – received by Transnet 
from CNR. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The Chair will note that on the 
extreme left those are topics which relate to manufacturing.  Chair we 
are to understand this as the capital – it is to denote the capital 
expenditure that would be incurred if CNR were to be located in 
20 
Durban.  We will make some examples for you Chair in relation to what 
would cost less and what would be a saving as a result of CNR being 
located in Durban.  The first item is an engine per locomotive.  In the 
third column it reads that there would be an extra cost of R8 000.  
There is a comment that is put in there in order to substantiate - as we 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 25 of 116 
 
see it – why there would be the extra cost.  The comment reads: 
“Engine 
imported 
but 
testing 
done 
in 
Johannesburg.” 
That is to be understood Chair saying whilst the engines would be 
imported for each locomotive from China or anywhere else that they will 
be procuring from and get to the Durban Harbour there would be an 
extra cost for the engines to be tested.  We then seek to – on the other 
hand – draw your attention to what was going to be a saving … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before we get that – we get to that point. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If – if I understand you correctly.  The extra 
cost – the engine is imported? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Fully assembled from China? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It arrives at Durban Harbour? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And if manufacturing of the locomotives is 
undertaken at Koedoespoort that engine would then have to be 
transported to Johannesburg? 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it is at Johannesburg that it will be 
tested? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So that cost was going to be incurred in the 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 26 of 116 
 
first place?  Why is it listed here as an extra cost?  Does that – is that 
intended to cover the cost of returning the engine back to Durban for 
manufacture of the locomotive? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair unfortunately the quotation 
itself is not substantiated … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  But we can follow that the extra 
cost to be incurred is to take it back to the Durban Bayhead Site for it 
to be fitted on the locomotive. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Otherwise the cost of transporting it from the 
10 
harbour to Johannesburg was already included in the original quote on 
the basis of which the parties contracted? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  Yes you may proceed, thank you. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Thank you.  Chair to take you then 
to a line item that denoted in this quotation what would be a saving for 
Transnet we use again an item that has a similar amount of R8 000.  It 
is in relation to wheels and axles. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That will be the seventh entry – I think. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The eighth. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Eighth entry on the left column, yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Ja.  Chair the saving that was 
denoted there was an amount of R8 000.  The comment that you will 
see on the far right hand side is … 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 27 of 116 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  There are two R8 000 entries there under 
“Savings”.  Which one are you dealing with? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Wheels and axles. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which should be the second one Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay the second one. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The comment on the far right hand 
10 
side reads imported components. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The understanding is that the 
wheels and axles would therefore be imported to the Durban Harbour.  
There would not be a cost to bring them up to Johannesburg and return 
them and therefore there would be a cost saving of R8 000 for 
Transnet. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Please explain that again Mr Mnyandu. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  In respect of wheels and axles an 
amount of R8 000 would not be incurred and it would be a saving for 
20 
Transnet in that the wheels and the axles … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Which are parts of the locomotive 
would be imported to Durban taken from Durban to the site … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 28 of 116 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  For manufacture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the significance of the two amounts being 
exactly the same in regard to the engine and the wheels and axles? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair – Chair there is not.  I 
thought it would be easier to find on the slide and that is why I referred 
you to the R8 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well is it not an indication that it is – it relates to 
transportation because the transportation from Durban to Johannesburg 
would probably cost the same?  I do not know whether that is petrol 
and whatever else because otherwise very interesting that it should be 
10 
exactly the same amount.  If you are going to use the same … 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  (Indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it is transportation so you talk about petrol.  You 
talk about whatever else then one could understand if it is exactly the 
same amount.  Otherwise it is difficult to understand why there should 
be this coincidence that it is the same amounts. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair your conclusion is a logical 
one to follow. … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  From what is in the document. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And on that basis we may assume then seeing 
as it is a saving that that transport cost of the wheels and the axles 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 29 of 116 
 
would have formed part of the original quotation? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  That is to be understood from the 
quotation. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it is a saving because now they no longer 
have to be transported to Johannesburg when they get to the Durban 
Harbour? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed it is so Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair - we then take you to slide 
number 10 to deal with the next section of the quotation that starts at 
10 
page 40. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry before you do so.  There seems to be a 
– a fixed amount a total cost for the recollection at the bottom of nine? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that is 4 million? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  4 million. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So we are informed by CNR that these 
adjustments - add some deduct others - the cost will be 4 million? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed it is so Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Then we go overleaf. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Then we go overleaf. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Overleaf it is the second part of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am – I am sorry. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 30 of 116 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that 4 million the total of all the other items under 
“Extra Cost”?  Is that total of all the – or not or is it a separate – is it a 
… 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  An extra cost on its own not totalling? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair it totals all of the extra costs 
that are to be found in the column in which it appears.  So it is a sum 
made up of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – no, no it cannot be.  My – my arithmetic is not so 
good but … 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair for the purpose … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That 4 million the highest of those amounts is 
R40 000.  The next highest is R20 000.  All the others are too small to 
make up 4 million. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair for the purposes of – this is 
a cost and extra cost per locomotive. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Per locomotive. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU: 
 
For 
the 
purposes 
of 
our 
presentation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The four – the 4 million?  The one you say is an extra 
20 
cost per locomotive? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It is supposed to be the total for all 
locomotives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For all locomotives? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 31 of 116 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  For all locomotives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is not a total of adding up the amounts that are 
above the 4 million in that column? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  But you can accept Chair even 
though … 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Indistinct). 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  You can accept Chair even though 
nothing turns on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  That on any score … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The amount that is the – the total 
there … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Is in correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It is a little under R5 million on our 
calculations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 32 of 116 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The next part of the presentation at 
slide 10 we deal with the next part of the quotation and this relates to 
the subject of the imported locomotive.  What we are to understand 
from this is that there would be a savings of imported locomotives.  The 
number in brackets is the number of locomotives that would be 
imported and the saving is denoted as R1 million.  For locomotives that 
would be fully assembled and shipped to the Durban Harbour. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  What we are to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Please just go back. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The number in brackets represents what? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The number of locomotives that 
would be fully assembled in China and transported by ship to Durban. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  So the savings of R1 million is in 
relation 
to 20 
locomotives 
that 
would 
not 
be 
transported 
to 
Johannesburg. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And in this instance the R1 million saving is 
not per locomotive.  It is a total saving on the 20? 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 33 of 116 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed it is so Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The next line item deals with 
savings on kits and 15 of them.  Chair before we take you through the 
amount we would just like explain what kits are.  It relates to the bogie 
which is a part of the locomotive, the underframe and some body 
panels that would be imported from Dalian.  Just to give context to the 
conversation from that perspective 15 locomotives were going to be 
produced by CNR as semi knockdown kits.  That is to say some of it is 
manufactured in China and then some of it – the parts are imported to 
10 
South Africa and then full assembly happens in South Africa.  The 
amount that was denoted as a saving there was R285 000.  Again we 
understand on the basis that the 15 kits would then not need to travel 
to – inland.  Chair you will see in the next column below that is the 
total saving from that perspective and it amounts to R1 285 000. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  And therefore the last it says the 
total extra costs is R2.79 million.  It is R2 792 900 for the Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Arithmetically does that add up? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Arithmetically that does not add 
20 
up. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair the final part of the quotation 
received from CNR during March 2014 is made up of cost related to 
Flights and Accommodation referred to as FNA Costs.  The quotation 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 34 of 116 
 
proceeds from the basis that there would be a minimum of four people 
to fly to Durban every week from Johannesburg. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  That cost is denoted as an amount 
of R1 320 000 and the next line item is in relation to the 
accommodation.  From the reading of the quotation we are made to 
understand that it would be the accommodation for the four people 
flying to Durban.  That amount is put down as R960 000.  There is no 
indication as to what the flights would be.  There is no indication as to 
where the amounts are quoted from. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And before you – you leave that point going 
back to Mr Harris’ conclusion that neither Bombadier nor CNR had a 
base in Johannesburg.  Presumably there was no personnel as well? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And your conclusion that as a fact therefore it 
could not have relocated from Johannesburg to get to Durban or to be 
placed in Durban? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Do you have an indication of who these four 
people are that fly from Johannesburg every week and why they must 
20 
fly from Johannesburg to Durban every week? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No we do not Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is there any documentation that you have 
seen where Transnet interrogates both the figures and the basis for the 
figures in this regard? 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 35 of 116 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No there is not such a document 
Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, thank you. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair the extra FNA Costs denoted 
on this slide is for Flights and Accommodation is simply adding the two 
amounts.  It is R2 280 000.  Chair the last item that was dealt with in 
respect of the quotation was new office set up for 60 personnel and 
that amount was R604 800.  The last point to be made is that the total 
extra costs as indicated in 10 March 2014 quotation received from CNR 
was that it was going to cost R9 755 600 for it to be located in Durban. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that is made up of the 4 million – your 
slide 9? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Plus the 2.7 million at slide 7 which are 
savings or extra costs in relation to imported locomotive and what they 
denote as Flight and Accommodation Costs and offices for new 
personnel.  All that taken together will give a total of 9.7 million … 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Together … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  According to this document? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair together with the total 
20 
extra transport costs. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  That is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes, thank you.  Please proceed. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Thank you Chair.  Chair we now 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 36 of 116 
 
seek to take you through the approval process of the cost for 
relocation. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That 9.7 million total extra costs is that the amount 
that was – arrived at by – that Mr – is Mr Gonsalves? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Gonsalves, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Gonsalves he is the one who (intervenes). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is Mr Gonsalves who testified on behalf of 
the minority shareholder in the CNR Consortium. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That – that is the amount that he was talking 
10 
about. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is the amount that he was talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright but based on what you have said even 
that amount there are certain things that are not explained.  Is that 
right? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed that is so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that maybe – maybe not the true costs might have 
been lower? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed – indeed it is so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Mr Mnyandu you may proceed. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair at slide number 12 we now 
seek to take you through the approval process in relation to the cost of 
relocation.  We first seek to highlight some salient points in relation to 
CNR and then deal with BT before we get to the actual approval of the 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 37 of 116 
 
costs.  Pursuant to the receipt by Transnet of the quotation of R9.7 
million by CNR we have found that there were no further engagements 
during the year 2014 until February 2015 during which a proposal was 
submitted by CNR which estimates the costs inside the text of the 
report to be approximately R100 million for relocation.  However in the 
same document Chair it also reflects at the end of it an estimate of 
R318 million.  Chair that is to be found at volume 12 page 9013. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  We have no record and we have 
not seen such a record in our investigation of the quotation having 
10 
been interrogated, having been responded to by Transnet but we gather 
from the further correspondences that there were that such a quotation 
was not accepted.  Chair a previous witness – Mr Gonsalves – has 
already led evidence about an agreement that we speak about at slide 
12. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before we get to that we have – I have turned 
to your page – the document at 9013 volume - volume 12 – your 
Appendix 7 and in particular I am at page 9017. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And under item 4 “Potential Cost Increase”. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Understanding sequence of events Transnet 
was provided with the 9-odd million increase to the cost – no – 9-odd 
million … 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Quotation. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 38 of 116 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Cost for relocation to Durban? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So we are somewhere in the ballpark of 10 
million? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Subsequently and in February 2015 Transnet 
is then served with this document and at item 4 it states: 
“It is estimated that it will get the cost increase …” 
That is the relocation. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The cost will be more than 100 million such as 
the following fields:  transportation cost increase, human staff cost 
increase, technical cost increase. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is 90 million difference between this 
amount and the previously quoted quotation of 10 million? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes it is Chair in the space of 11 
months. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Were you able to get any understanding on 
how this came about and the justification for this jump? 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No we were not Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Did you make enquiries? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  We tried making enquiries through 
the documentation itself … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 39 of 116 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  But however the proposals gives 
no indication. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Does this document make reference to the 
previous R9 million quotation? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No it does not Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Thank you.  You may proceed. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU: 
 
During 
April 2015 
Chair 
we 
discovered an agreement which I have – already has been highlighted 
to the Chair – was dealt with Mr Gonsalves who is a minority 
shareholder and a Director of the CNR Consortium.  The agreement 
10 
was concluded between CNR and BEX – Business Expansion Structured 
– a company that was going to assist CNR with the benchmarking of its 
relocation costs.  It is an agreement as I say Chair that is to be found 
at volume 12 page 9022 in consultation with the evidence leaders to the 
extent that evidence has already been led on it.  We shall not cover it 
save to confirm to the Chair that a copy of the agreement was obtained 
from Transnet and it is the exact agreement that is on record in the 
evidence bundles of the Commission. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And again I am – the very document that said 
the cost will be in excess of 100 million in fact gave a new cost of 380 
20 
million? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the lip is actually from 9 million to 380 
million in 11 months? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed it is so Chair. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 40 of 116 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  You may proceed.  You are 
dealing with the BEX Agreement. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes.  Chair whilst we do not deal 
extensively with the BEX Agreement – rather the agreement between 
CNR and BEX – we do point out that BEX were entitled to earn the 
difference between 580 million and R647 million.  On our calculation 
that works out to R67 million for computing the costs. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Whilst we are not – cannot confirm 
the date on which payment was made Chair we have seen an invoice 
10 
number one and the attorneys for CNR have confirmed that payment 
was indeed made.  Chair this is to be found at page 9035 of your 
volume 12 bundle. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  Is it necessary to go there? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well does the slide not say nine – Appendix 9? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is Appendix 9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay, on volume 12? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  On volume 12. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do we need to go there to that page? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Mnyandu let me just check with you.  That 
is the same invoice that Mr Gonsalves led evidence on? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes it is so Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You have seen the invoice already Chair. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 41 of 116 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So we may proceed on that basis.  We are 
familiar with the invoice. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU: 
 
Chair 
there 
is 
a 
particular 
paragraph that we would like to take the Chair through. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes please do so. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  (Intervenes). 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Which assists or rather assisted us 
in forming a prima facie view in relation to ... 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At 9036? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  At 9036 once the Chair is there. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The Chair will note it is a letter on 
the letterhead of Hogan Lovells Attorneys. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The subject reads, reportable 
irregularity CRRC Rolling Stock our client.  The Chair will not it is 
20 
addressed to KPMG and he context to it is that there had been the 
reporting of an accounting irregularity in relation to the payment of 
67million rand to Becks which KPMG had found, the Chair will see the 
summarised at paragraph 1.3 as follows, 
 
 “We understand that at this time and on the basis of the 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 42 of 116 
 
 
information provided to you, you are of the view that the 
 
proposal and the agreement contain alleged irregularities for 
 
the 
following 
reasons. 
 
1) 
the 
proposal 
significantly 
 
misrepresented to Transnet the cost of relocation of relocation 
 
of a manufacturing facility from Pretoria to Durban and 2) a 
 
payment made by our client to Becks appear to “lack sound 
 
commercial substance and purpose”. 
 
Chair without detaining you we would like to take you to 
paragraph 2.1…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry is this the part you were relying on to say 
10 
the attorneys have confirmed payment? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is the part you were relying on? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:   Chair we’d now like to take you to 
paragraph 2.1 at page 9039. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  39 or 37 Mr Mnyandu? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Paragraph 2.21…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Oh 21 I thought 2.1 yes 2.21 is at 9039. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:    Yes, Chair, at this point the letter 
has already set-out the background in relation to CNR now known as 
CRRC Rolling Stock and BEX and how they became about to form the 
relationship. This deals with the perspective of CNR in relation to the 
relocation costs.  Briefly, paragraph 2.21 reads, 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 43 of 116 
 
 
“Our client was of the view at the time, that Transnet would not 
 
agree to a project cost of 580million rand and that the final 
 
project cost might be lower than this.  Based on our client’s 
 
prior business that our client believe that Transnet will require 
 
a discount on this amount, thus our client believed that the 
 
final project cost will be closer to 580million rand.  Hence they 
 
believed there was very little risk for the in agreeing in an up-
 
side fee arrangement with BEX”, 
 
It is just that note that we needed to take the Chair to. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before you leave that note, this is – this letter 
10 
is from the attorneys and it is advancing CNR consortium position. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Where it seeks to justify the conclusion of the 
agreement for services with BEX. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And at paragraph 2.21 that you’ve just 
referred us to at page 9093, the letter informs us that, in truth, CNR 
believed, presumably on the basis of some calculation that the actual 
cost of relocation would be 580. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But we know that’s not what CNR claimed as a 
relocation cost. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And they did this knowing that the actual cost 
is 580 if it is the actual cost. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 44 of 116 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you, yes you may proceed. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Thank you Chair.  At slide number 
13 we make the point as made in our report that the agreement was 
based on a risk sharing model which we’ve already dealt with, that we 
note to be very suspicious for the reasons already outlined to the 
Chair.  Furthermore, we’d like to point out that the agreement is also 
suspicious on the fact – based on the fact that the Chair will recall that 
evidence was led by Mr Sedumedi that CNR, as a consortium, had 
placed in or submitted a bid or proposal for the manufacturing of both 
10 
electric as well as diesel locomotives.  Chair from our perspective it is 
therefore unfathomable that there would be an OEM that would require 
the assistance of a third party in order to compute the price difference 
of it being located in one place as opposed to the other. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And in bidding for both diesel and electric 
effectively, they bid for 1064 locomotives. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed it is so Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  We then move on to the next slide. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:    Chair on 19 May 2015, there is a 
memorandum that is prepared by Ms Mdletshe, Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe in 
which she sought approval from the, then acting Group Chief Executive, 
Mr Siyabonga Gama for the negotiation of the terms of the relocation 
with CNR.   
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 45 of 116 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Whilst the memorandum notes that 
a separate submission is to be made or has been prepared for BT we 
have not discovered such a memorandum but from the processes that 
ensued arising his memorandum, we are indeed able to confirm that BT 
was communicated with to the same effect.  Chair we seek to take you 
through the genesis or the purpose of the memorandum, the purpose of 
the memo was to seek approval for the following, 1) for the team to 
negotiate the commercial terms of relocation…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry the memorandum is at what page? 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair it is to be found at volume 13 
at page 9110. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The actual document starting at 9111. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the appearance of Appendix before the 
volume…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is confusing a bit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s confusing because I’m used to these bundles 
starting with a volume. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I take time to – I kind of miss them. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    We shall amend, Chair, your copy and 
remove references to appendix and just give direct reference to the 
volume and the page number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean I appreciate that having appendix (indistinct) 
might be helpful but …(intervention). 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 46 of 116 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It perhaps may come at the end of 
the…(intervention) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe it can come at the end. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Not at the beginning, yes Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’ll find this page just now. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   9111 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair we summarise as I’ve said 
that the purpose of the memo was to seek approval for the team to 
10 
negotiate the relocation to Durban with CNR.  The background speaks 
to the issues that we’ve already covered and needs not to be covered 
for you Chair…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Mnyandu please pull the mic – swing it 
towards you yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Apologies Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes thank you. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  If we go to paragraph 6 under 
background Chair it says, 
 
“A team will be…(intervention). 
 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry before you go to paragraph 6, at some stage 
it would help if you could just tell me, where do we find the first use of 
this term, relocation and by whom, if your investigation helped you to 
establish that but it doesn’t have to be now, later, but if you were not 
able to discover that you will just let me know. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 47 of 116 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Alright Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair if we go to the purpose it is 
A) the team, 
 
“To seek approval for the team to negotiate the relocation to 
 
Durban with CNR.  B) Seek approval for a variation order to 
 
finalise the relocation of the programme of the construction of 
 
233 class 45D locomotives to Durban to a maximum value of 
 
R669 784 286.00 Separate submission has been  
prepared 
 
for BT, we know that there is a typo at B insofar as it refers to 
10 
 
233 locomotives it ought to be 232.  C) it is also to seek 
 
approval for a letter to be issued to CNR to commence 
 
negotiation for this relocation of the programme”.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  For these purposes Chair we’d just 
like to draw your attention to the cap of 669million rand that is 
requested.  We found it odd that a Transnet official, internally would 
request for a cap at 669million rand.  Upon investigating the issue, the 
amount resembles exactly what is to be found at page 42, but the Chair 
need not go there now at page 42 of the Exhibit Bundle that is before 
20 
the Chair.  So it is the latest proposal that had been received from CNR 
even though it is dated June 2015, it coincides, as I say the amount 
coincides with the memo done by Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe, if we go to the 
bottom…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before you leave that point, you say the 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 48 of 116 
 
669million odd emanates from a proposal by CNR? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you referred the Chair to the document 
and you said it’s not necessary really to go there at the moment. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  At the moment. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you say that document is dated June 
2015. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Please refer to page 9115 of the memo to Mr 
Gama…(intervention). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before that this amount of 669 784 286.00 that 
is dealt with under purpose, does it look like somebody, for Transnet 
may have received the proposal from CNR and had just taken that 
amount as is and said to Gama that’s what we should talk about? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed it looks like that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes without any discussion from what you could find. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It seems there was indeed no 
interrogation of the amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It is a request to approve that 
20 
amount as a ceiling for the negotiations Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, okay thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the other – please go to 9115 and 
following on the question that the Chair has just posed that, that 
number appears to be uplifted directly from CNR proposal into this 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 49 of 116 
 
memorandum.   You testified that, that proposal is dated June 2015. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But this memorandum is dated 19 May 2015. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the number was known somewhere, 
somehow to somebody within Transnet before the actual proposal was 
received? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Do you know how that came to be or is that 
asking too much? 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  During the course of our 
investigations we weren’t able to determine. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  But it is to be noted Chair that the 
particular memorandum actually contains two signature pages because 
if the Chair goes to 9114, it is where the amount at the top at 
recommendation of 669 is to be found but on the page at which Mr 
Gama 
signs 
the 
memorandum, 
the 
amount 
is 
denoted 
as 
R635 851 786.00 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:    Even that amount comes from a 
particular proposal submitted on behalf of CNR. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is that…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the page 9114 and page 9115 are these pages two 
pages of different documents or – I see they both say recommendation 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 50 of 116 
 
at the top and then say compiled by, they don’t – they’re compiled by 
Lindiwe Mdletshe both of them but the signature on top of Lindiwe 
Mdletshe’s name, the signatures are different on the two documents 
and the – or does it look like it’s one person who signed for Lindiwe 
Mdletshe, 
Ravi 
Nair 
and 
Peter 
Selinga 
, 
what 
was 
happening…(intervention). 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Sorry to disturb just to confirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The reading that you see on the 
signature lines of Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe, Mr Ravi Nair as well Mr Selinga 
10 
say, see attached. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh they say, see attached, they are not signatures. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The signatures are on the next 
page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But then Mr Anoj Singh’s signature is there and Mr 
Gama’s signature is there on page 9114 and they are repeated at page 
9115, what is the meaning of this? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair we were not able to 
20 
determine Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe herself, when interviewed could not 
explain as to why there were two signature pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes the most senior – was the most senior of all 
these people, well it was Mr Gama as of this time, he was acting Group 
Chief Executive. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 51 of 116 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair and the approval was 
sought from him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And to the extent that he signed two pages that 
contained the same thing in terms of the recommendation except for the 
figure at 9114 it’s one amount, at 9115 it’s a different amount, he 
approved two different amounts for the same thing, is that right? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The understanding as we 
understood it from our interview was that the one that was actually 
10 
approved is the later proposal which is the one, as I say, dated June 
2015 and it contains the amount of 669million rand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how did the other one come about, you don’t 
know? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It was earlier, it had been 
submitted earlier by CNR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But this document that we are looking at which has 
got these two pages 9914 and 9115…(intervention). 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  I apologise Chair, perhaps we 
should have pointed out, if you look at the page 9114, it signed during 
20 
the month of June. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2015. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  2015, 9 June. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  So it is approved by Mr Gama 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 52 of 116 
 
based on the later proposal received in June. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the document – then 9115 there is no date 
appearing next to Mr Gama’s signature to indicate when he signed it 
but Selinga, I don’t know if it’s Ms or Mr Siphiwe Selinga he or she 
signed on 19 May 2015 and Mr Lindiwe Mdletshe signed on the same 
day, I’m not seeing…(intervention). 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  There is no date. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It looks like – is it 19…(intervention). 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It looks like 19 May 2015 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2015, So the document – Mr Gama’s approval on 
page 9114 is later than the approvals on 9115. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but then only he approved that on that page and 
Mr Singh on 9114 to the extent that their signatures are good enough 
for the approval, that would be the amount that must be seen as having 
been approved. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And replacing this other one, at page 9115. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:    Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that somebody wrote at 9115 that – I think 
maybe Mr Gama he needs clarity on certain things so maybe that’s why 
there’s the one on page 9114 because he needed to have some clarity 
but I wonder why he signed before getting the clarity. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 53 of 116 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair it’s a mystery. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I’m still trying to reconcile 9114 with 9115.  If 
one looks at 9114 it’s seeking approval for an amount of 669million. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   It says compiled and typed, Lindiwe 
Mdletshe, on the signature line it’s not her signature it’s written see 
attached. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  See attached. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  For Mr Ravi Nair? 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:   Ravi Nair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The same thing applies, it says see attached. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So does Mr Selinga say, Mr Anoj Singh signs 
on what appears to be 28 t h May 2015 and Mr Gama signs on the 9 t h of 
June 2015. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  What is the attached that we are being 
referred to? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Again through our interviews we 
20 
discovered that what is attached is – what is denoted by the see 
attached, my recommendation of the memorandum has already been 
signed for, see attached. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay now will the see attached be what 
appears at 9115? 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 54 of 116 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed it is so Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So 9115 would appear to be the last page of a 
memorandum. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If we were to follow the structure of Appendix 
10. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And yes Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe signed there on 
the 19 t h of May 2015, except when I look at the recommendation it is 
now for 635million. 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So would my logic be correct if I say, page 
9115 is the final page of a – another memo and not Appendix 10, 
there’s another memo that argued for approval of 635million. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair on the basis that the front of 
Appendix 10…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Precisely because that front speaks of 669. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So there must be another memo that speaks 
of 635. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:   Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which is not annexed here or attached but 
only the signed recommendation page is annexed. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes it is so Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 55 of 116 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m not sure that I have followed your exchange but 
let me ask this.  It seems – it seems – it would seem illogical or maybe 
illogical is not the right word but it maybe it would be strange if the, 
see attached, at 9114 was made with the intention of referring to 9115 
because, see attached, above Mr Mdletshe’s signature line and Mr 
Nair’s signature line from what you said earlier on, in that event cold 
only mean, I have already signed. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed that is what is to be 
understood Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but the problem with that understanding of, see 
10 
attached, is the two pages could not have both been meant to be used. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Principally Chair because they 
refer to different numbers, that there is a request for approval on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so that is the one problem with that 
understanding, the other problem is if – is that it would be so easy to 
sign there unless the idea was that Mdletshe – Ms Mdletshe and Mar 
Nair were not available, I don’t know but it just makes it very difficult to 
understand precisely what was being recommended by who and what 
was being approved by Mr Gama. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Even more so Chair when one 
20 
considers that the signature lines with the, see attached, above the 
names of the personnel at Transnet that would take the memorandum to 
Mr Gama, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  As I say, during the course of our 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 56 of 116 
 
investigations and interviews there was no direct answer in relation to 
why this memorandum was done in this manner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when you found this document, did you find it 
with these two pages as part of the document? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:    On first investigation we were of 
the view that perhaps the one related to BT who at the time had a 
quotation very close to the number which is 635million but we later 
discovered that there was a proposal from CNR to the effect of 
10 
R635 851 000.00 moreover, as we say, the last letter, which is C, under 
recommendations, it says, letter to be issued to CNR to commence 
negotiation, so too does 9114 read, letter to be issued to CNR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ye but you say your team did speak to Ms Mdletshe? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you put this to her. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say she could not explain it? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  On many questions she could not 
explain the sequence of events, nor what led to particular decisions 
20 
that she took.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And what did she attribute that to, did she say she 
had forgotten, she couldn’t remember or she just stared at you? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair in certain instances she 
couldn’t remember but I should place on record that the interview with 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 57 of 116 
 
her was rather abrasive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was she hostile? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  In a manner yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that interview wasn’t recorded by…(intervention). 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It is transcribed Chair, it is part of 
the transcripts that will be delivered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay and what about Mr Gama and Mr Anoj Singh 
they had left Transnet by the time you had this chance or did you get a 
chance to put this to them and hear what they had to say? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair we didn’t – we did get a 
10 
chance to speak to Mr Gama, we didn’t put this particular memorandum 
to him at the time, at the time we were investigating the large part of 
the 1064 locomotives transaction which was the procurement process 
followed.  Whilst we did touch briefly on the issue of relocation this 
particular memorandum was not put to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Anoj Singh? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  He had left Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then at 9114 as we pointed out on the 
signature lines of Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe, Mr Nair and Mr Selinga 
20 
respectively it’s a manuscript written, see attached, did you investigate 
who wrote that on each line? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  When we asked Ms Lindiwe 
Mdletshe she didn’t have a clue. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Did she say definitely that she did not, at 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 58 of 116 
 
least insofar as her name is concerned, write, see attached, on this 
document? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Definitively, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And she said what, did she claim that she 
doesn’t know who wrote that and under what circumstances? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes but she did own up to 
compiling the memorandums. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then she would be aware of both 
memorandums for CNR, firstly for 635 and then subsequently for this 
669. 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:    Sorry the memorandum – let me 
say the memorandum. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  This memorandum? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of 669? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Of 669. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Did you have a discussion with her about, 
seemingly another memorandum for 635? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  For the purposes of our interview 
we didn’t attack the – rather ask the question from that perspective 
20 
because as I say, amongst other things, the interview was hostile. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Alright thank you.  Chair it’s just been brought 
to my attention, I apologise…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s fine. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 59 of 116 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   
We’ll take the tea adjournment, it’s half past now 
we’ll resume at quarter to twelve, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed Ms Sello. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Mnyandu when we rose for tea we were 
still trying to make sense of the memorandum for the approval of 669 
trying to reconcile pages 9114 to 9115.  The queries I had in respect of 
10 
that document are addressed thank you.  I do not know if the Chair has 
got any other issues arising from the document or whether there are 
other comments you Mr Mnyandu would like to make in respect of that 
document before we move on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No we can move on. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No there are not Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  Then you may proceed. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair we then proceed to slide 
number 15. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  To – to give an overview of the 
team composition and then deal with what the mandate that was sought 
for the team was going to be. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The titles are the Group Chief 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 60 of 116 
 
Financial Officer Mr Anoj Singh at the time.  The Chief Executive of 
Transnet Engineering Mr Thamsanqa Jiyani. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The Group Head of Supply Chain 
Management which was Mr Garry Pita as well as a representative from 
the Executive Legal and Compliance Mr Selingo.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I am sorry to interrupt you Mr Mnyandu I am 
looking at the screen in front of me and I seem to have a different feed.  
I seem to have a – okay now it is back.  I was just checking that we are 
on the right computer.  It is sorted you may proceed thank you. 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Thank you Chair.  At slide number 
15 we highlight that the team insofar as the memorandum goes was 
going to determine the approach that would best yield benefits for 
Transnet as well as the OEM’s by taking into consideration two things. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Quantifying different negotiation 
levels and the reasons for a revised pricing. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  And 2 reviewing the accuracy and 
assumptions in the models in order to inform the negotiations. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this is the Transnet team? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair under the header Motivation 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 61 of 116 
 
the memorandum highlighted in order to move to Durban there would be 
different heads of additional costs. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The memorandum summarised 
these different heads of costs as labour costs. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Material costs, warehousing costs, 
technical 
support, 
operational 
and 
logistical 
effects, 
physical 
transportation of materials and resources, incremental warehousing 
costs, financing and risk costs due to time constraints and delays.  The 
10 
memorandum also illustrated that there would be ancillary benefits for 
Transnet 
and 
savings 
associated 
with 
the 
two 
OEM’s 
now 
manufacturing from Durban. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Your heading at slide 16 speaks of the – 
speaks to the 19 May 2015 memorandum. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that is our page 9111. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The issues listed there… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that is what I was exactly trying to look at so we 
20 
have not moved away from the memorandum but you discussing what it 
dealt with? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  What the memorandum sought  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Approval for. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 62 of 116 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think what confused me is that I thought she was 
saying she was moving away from the memorandum. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I had understood Mr Mnyandu to say he is 
done with the memorandum but clearly not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  I apologise Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  We are done with looking at the 
copy itself. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  But summarising some of the 
[indistinct] parts of the memorandum.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja.  My question then is you list these issues 
or these factors that explain the costs of relocation. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And we are – I must – we must understand 
from your slide that those issues emanate from the memorandum itself? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then I go back to my previous question.  In 
light of the fact that the actual proposal comes in June 2015 how do the 
drafters of this memorandum in May know the factors that will be taken 
into consideration in computing the costs of relocation?  Were you able 
to establish? 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 63 of 116 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It is in relation to the memorandum 
received earlier in May which is for the amount of R635 million odd. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Have – do you have that memorandum? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  We actually do have a copy. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  A complete one? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes.  So not the memorandum the 
proposal from CNR – apologies Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the proposal by way of just a letter or a more 
comprehensive document? 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It is a comprehensive document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and but it is not here in the bundle that is here? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So that – in that memorandum the figure is 635? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed it is so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Which is where the 635 may have been taken 
from? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay then again let us look at sequence.  
20 
Remember we started at 9 million. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is what we got from CNR. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is then updated to 318? 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 64 of 116 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Must the Chair understand that that 318 
million proposal was subsequently followed by another of 635 million? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then the yet to come in June of 2015 after 
this memorandum of 669? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay so we are now on a – we are talking 
about third and fourth proposals now? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  We following yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The memorandum was approved by 
Mr Gama we make the notes on 19 May 2015. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Going forward the following 
personnel made up the negotiation team.  Mr Anoj Singh, Mr Garry Pita, 
Mr Ndiphiwe Silinga, Mr E Moletsane, Mr Thamsanqa Jiyani as well as 
Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  For the record I think that is Ms E Moletsane 
not Mr. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Oh. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is what you have on the slide. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry which one? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  He – Ms E Moletsane. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Moletsane. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 65 of 116 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  On behalf of TE he had said Mr Moletsane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr oh. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  My apologies Chair.  Ms E 
Moletsane. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair we now take you through the 
proposals submitted on behalf Bombardier Transportation BT having 
taken you through the proposals of CNR after which we will then look at 
10 
the process followed internally in order to approve the relocation costs.  
Bombardier Transportation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I thought earlier on you had said 
Bombardier Transportation had not put up a proposal when they were 
asked to.  Did they subsequently do? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh and this is what we talking about now? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  You will recall that we made the 
20 
point that on the 6 June they addressed a letter to Transnet Freight 
Rail recording that pursuant to the issuance of a letter by the then 
Group Chief Executive Mr Brian Molefe which was after the signature of 
the main agreement as well as the sub-contract.  They were now willing 
to consider being located in Durban and they would work on the 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 66 of 116 
 
necessary documentation in order to communicate to Transnet what 
would be the cost difference of them being located elsewhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And by 6 of June it is 2014? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:   2014. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To be exact. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  2014 to clarify Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair following on from what we 
have just discussed then BT presented three proposals to Transnet.  
10 
Whilst with – between – in between these three proposals there were 
letters that were issued by BT in which BT sought to try and explain or 
substantiate its proposals.  The proposals were submitted during 
September 2014.  A second proposal submitted during April 2015 and 
the third proposal which was eventually accepted albeit with a discount 
applied is the July 2015 offer which Chair will find from page 63 of the 
bundle that the Chair has this morning. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the… 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Just to… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That be your tab 4 of your presentation? 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Under tab 4 of the presentation. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Just to take the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is – that is tab for the presentation is Exhibit 
BB8[c]. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 67 of 116 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we just needed to put that on record 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  On record indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because we might not have put it on record.  So tab 
number 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  4. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair under tab number 4 what you 
10 
will find is email correspondence from Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe in which we 
are able to gather and confirm that the proposals from BT were indeed 
shared with Transnet because she in turn on 20 June 2015 was sharing 
the different versions with her colleagues at Transnet.  And overleaf the 
proposals from Transnet.  The Chair need not consider them intensely 
because both in our report as well as in the presentation we highlight 
that the relocation costs insofar as BT was concerned were made up of 
the transportation costs, logistics costs, the loss of industrial footprint 
synergies and is how the amount of 634 in the first instance 
R634 315 000,00 was made up which then in April became an offer of 
20 
R634 315 000,00 the Chair will see this now from slide 19 of the 
presentation.  And then lastly as we said the offer of R618 457 125,00.  
As we have said those are the three points that the proposals on BT 
were based on.  We make the point in our report there is however no 
conclusive breakdown of the costs which would seek to support the 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 68 of 116 
 
amounts that were claimed in each respect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was – what is the loss of industrial footprint 
synergies? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair as we – as we understand it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It is an argument that says if I as 
an OEM am based in Gauteng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  I have got relations synergies with 
particular suppliers who would not necessarily be able to supply me 
10 
with the materials I need if I were to be located in a different location 
or would do so at an extra cost. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So effectively saying if I operate from Johannesburg./ 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have in the course of my business certain people 
that I deal with who may supply me with certain things for my business 
and I have a certain – I have established certain relationships with 
them and maybe I get discounts and if we operate from Durban I take 
that into account when I quote to you but if I am going to be in another 
place I will not have those discounts and therefore I would – I would 
20 
pay more than I would pay if I was in Johannesburg and that I have to 
pass on to you. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  But it should – does it warrant – does it 
warrant to be an item under loss because all I really need to do is look 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 69 of 116 
 
at how much I will get things in Durban and say well my price will go up 
because this is what I will be paying for things that I must get.   
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair in order to understand can I 
rephrase the question and ask whether it warrants a price variation as 
such. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair it would depend on the 
negotiations of parties that have contracted arm’s length but it would 
not automatically arise that they should be an additional cost. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Ja okay thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And if anything – if anything it might result in 
a saving? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now I look at your tab for TTM4 at tab 4 of 
BB8[c] and in particular at page 71 I see that the R634 316 000,00 is 
given as a fixed price and it is a globular amount.  I have looked 
through the document and unless I misread the document I do not see 
the breakdown of that amount per item as you have listed in a sense 
20 
that I do not see what portion of that R634 million is allocated for 
transportation costs and for logistics and what balance then is 
computed as a loss of industrial footprint synergies?  
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed it is so Chair there is no 
breakdown hence we make the point that where there is no breakdown 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 70 of 116 
 
of the costs that is in support or would be in support of the amount 
claimed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Did you – were you able to get an 
understanding from any member of Transnet that you interviewed as to 
the exact meaning of loss of industrial footprint synergies? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No Chair I must record that we did 
not necessarily engage them on that concept. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And I think Mr Sedumedi pointed out that you 
had as yet not engaged with Bombardier on these issues? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes that is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the extent that logistic costs are listed as separate 
from transportation costs what did that entail? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair I think it would only be 
explainable or explained by the drafters of – or those who considered 
the two to be different.  Because one – when one speaks of 
transportation costs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  One is referring to logistics. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  That is… 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  That is what we would – 
20 
understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you did not get a chance to talk to Bombardier 
about that? 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 71 of 116 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair as has just pointed out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  We have not yet engaged 
Bombardier in relation to these issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes.  But it would appear that Transnet did not 
interrogate the – that as well hey? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Now Mr Mnyandu again 
looking at the papers please refer to TTM4 at page 63 of BB8[c] and 
10 
that you said is the email from Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe of 20 June 2015. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Circulating to her colleagues the Bombardier 
proposal. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I read that email and it says and I quote: 
“Good day please find attached Bombardier proposal as 
requested. 
1.  Initial proposal dated 26 September 2014 and as 
bullets 
20 
• Additional information dated 2 October 2014. 
• Further clarification dated 10 October 2014. 
• Detailed explanation dated 3 November 2014. 
2. And secondly revised proposal dated 10 April 2015.” 
When I perused TTM4 I seem to find only a letter from Bombardier 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 72 of 116 
 
dated 26 September 2014.  What – a document termed final notice of 
contractor proposed variation with respect to Transnet’s request to 
move TE’s facility location from Koedoespoort to Durban and that would 
appear at page 72 to also be dated 26 September 2014.  It is then 
followed by a schedule of deliveries. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I do not seem to have under TTM14 this 
additional information dated 2 October 2014, the further clarification of 
10 October 2014, detailed explanation of 3 November 2014. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  To… 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You confirm that? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Now my question is were you able to 
locate these particular documents that are listed here for – issued in 
October 2014 and November – October and November 2014? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes.  To place matters into context. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
 MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  This was information that came to 
hand pursuant to the completion of our report together with the 
statement that will be submitted to the commission. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  We will provide the further 
clarifications which are documents that we attached to the particular 
email.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 73 of 116 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Rather what the email seeks to do 
is to at least give credence to the fact that the proposals from 
Bombardier were indeed received by Transnet. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So then we can expect through the 
submission of a supplementary statement the documents list dated 2 
October 2014, 10 October 2014, 3 November 2014 and the revised 
proposal of 110 April 2015. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  I confirm Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I go back to that issue of what the logistics costs 
10 
referred to as well as the other item.  Did you ask Ms Mdletshe well 
what these were and what her understanding was of the logistics costs 
insofar as they were a separate item from transportation costs because 
if they agreed to paying for certain things at least they should 
understand what those things are. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair again to place matters into 
context insofar as the discussions ahead with Ms Mdletshe. 
1.  The exchanges in relation to the issues of relocation were rather 
hostile. 
2. She gave the impression that she being a SCS of Supply Chair 
20 
Services personnel would not have the expertise to deal with an 
assessment of the proposals notwithstanding the fact that she 
was part of the negotiation team. 
Therefore we took the view that to try and take her through each of the 
proposals  
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 74 of 116 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Would not be… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Serve any purpose. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Would not be serving any purpose 
for our investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  But you are not sure whether the lack of 
cooperation was – arose just from the fact that she seemed to be 
hostile or she might genuinely not have known certain things because 
they fall outside her expertise. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair I am not sure. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja, ja.  But I would have thought that if you are 
a member of a negotiating team even if something falls outside your 
expertise that at least from those in the team who have the expertise 
you would want to understand what is this about so that if you as part 
of a team are party to a decision to say we approve this you can at 
least explain if you are asked. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair I think – yes that is what one 
would expect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  But I think to – matters will be 
20 
placed into better context as we move forward and we deal with some 
critical email communique amongst the negotiation team members. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Thank yo. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But before we get there Mr Mnyandu again I 
am at TTM4 page 63 of your bundle.  I see the addressees there appear 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 75 of 116 
 
as Mr Garry Pita, Mr Thamsanqa Jiyani, Mr Anoj Sing and Mr Yusuf 
Lehar. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Following on the Chair’s question we 
understand that you did not – you have not had opportunity to interview 
Mr Anoj Singh on the basis that by the time you undertook your 
investigations he was no longer an employee at Transnet? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now did you have opportunity to interview Mr 
Garry Pita, Mr Yusuf Laher, Mr Thamsanqa Jiyani and if you did did you 
10 
raise these issues with anyone of them? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  We had the opportunity indeed to 
interview Mr Thamsanqa Jiyani. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  He pointed out that he was only 
able to attend a single meeting in respect of the negotiations and that 
he played no further role.  Now we will get to the no further role at a 
later point Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.   
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  We therefore did not take him 
20 
through the proposals submitted by the OEM’s.  We did have the 
opportunity also to speak to Mr Yusuf Laher.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Who gave us a version that he had 
interrogated particularly the CNR proposals and he had shared certain 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 76 of 116 
 
comments and they were not necessarily attended to that is a part that 
we will also get to in the presentation. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja.  And insofar as Mr Garry Pita is 
concerned? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Mr Garry Pita was no longer under 
the employ of Transnet as at the time we undertook our investigations. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Thank you.  You may proceed then with 
your presentation. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair having given you the 
sequences of the proposals related to both OEM’s we now take you to 
10 
initial meetings held with them arising from the approval by Mr 
Siyabonga Gama for the negotiations.  That particular meeting was held 
or rather those meetings were held on the same day, the same location 
being OR Tambo International Airport on the 19 June 2015.   
CHAIRPERSON:  That memorandum was 19 May or 19 June – 19 May? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  19 May Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  On 19 June the negotiation team 
members from Transnet met with the representatives of the respective 
OEM’s.  Chair when we conducted our investigation and we were 
20 
provided with a transcript of the meeting for reasons that we will deal 
with now we could not make sense of it so as to include it in our report.  
However in consultation with the evidence team leaders for the 
commission we agreed that we should not deprive you of the document 
and in so doing in providing it to you which is TTM7 it is to be found at 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 77 of 116 
 
page 97 of BBH – Exhibit BB8[c]. We also then sought to summarise 
the 
points 
of 
discussions 
that 
were 
held 
with 
each 
of 
the 
representatives.  Chair you will see that at 97 and 98 registers or I 
should say properly attendance registers dated 19 June 2015 for 
meetings held with the representatives of the negotiation team.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did the meeting that we are talking about involve 
Transnet meeting with each of the … 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the entities not jointly? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The transcripts would have you 
believe as such at least unfortunately and the reasons that we were 
referring to when we considered whether or not we could make sense of 
the transcript in the first place it does not have an introduction.  It does 
not alert you to who is speaking at any point.  The speakers are not 
recorded.   The proposals that are referred to on the 19 June 2015 
meetings in respect of both OEM’s do not actually tell you which 
versions of the proposals are being discussed.  However what we 
sought to do as I said in slide 21 and the slide that follows is to 
20 
summarise what the discussions were about.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  We make the point that the – as 
you have just requested clarification Chair separate discussions were 
held with CNR and BT.  The first discussion was held with 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 78 of 116 
 
representatives of CNR which included Mr Mark Shaw who was the sole 
director of Becks a company that is already been dealt with Chair.  We 
also make the point as I have already tried to outline that the transcript 
does not give you any indication as to who is speaking.  You really 
have to follow the conversation in order to understand that this would 
be a Transnet representative and this would be a Chinese CNR 
representative. 
 
Apologies. 
 
In 
both 
instances 
Transnet’s 
representatives referred to proposals received from the OEM’s without 
necessarily giving any indication what were those versions of the 
proposals.  Notably Transnet personnel addressed each OEM on the 
10 
negative economic downturn in South Africa.  We sought to highlight 
that Chair when we summarised the discussions because if these were 
individuals in the meeting concerned with the economic downturn in 
South Africa it would be strange a word you have used Chair that they 
would agree to an aggregate amount of R1.2 billion in an instance 
where as far as we have found the costs are wholly unjustifiable and 
have not been substantiated.  In respect of both proposals of the 
OEM’s the Transnet personnel emphasised the request for the OEM’s to 
also demonstrate what would be the savings occasioned by them being 
located in Durban.   
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before we leave tab 7 I am at page 100 and 
according to this document this would be the first page of the 
transcript? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It starts with as you rightly say unfortunately 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 79 of 116 
 
the transcript does not identify who this – each speaker is.  It starts 
with a speaker stating that was because of me in Cape Town and the 
mediator was kicked out of this process.   
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That start would indicate to me that this is not 
the full transcript of that meeting that there had been an engagement 
prior to that speaker making that comment. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Were you able to determine how long I will 
call it the unrecorded portion of the meeting if it is that it had taken 
10 
before this speaker stated as they did. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair we were not able to we are 
awaiting information on who the transcribers were. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  We are awaiting this information 
from Transnet Freight Rail. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And if I go to page 123 even with BT I see the 
same problem.  It – the transcript kicks off with the speaker saying the 
warehousing am I mistaken.  And that is not a – a usual way of starting 
a meeting or a conversation. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It certainly is not Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Do you have – were you provided with the 
actual audio recording of this meeting? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No unfortunately not Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  What is the source of the transcript? 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 80 of 116 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It is officials in the Supply Chain 
Services Department of Transnet Freight Rail. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Did you go back to the same 
employees to enquire whether they had a more complete transcript of 
these meetings? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair.  They indicated they 
do not and it is in that respect or in that regard that we have requested 
and are still awaiting the details of the company that would have 
transcribed the meeting. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Do you know the identity of the company that 
10 
transcribed? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Not at this moment Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I take it that you have enquired as to their 
identity? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair it is in respect of that 
enquiry that we await information from officials at Transnet Freight 
Rail. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  How far backward was the request made by 
you to the officials of Transnet? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  We have had discussions about it 
20 
at least in April of this year. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And since then you have received no further 
information? 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 81 of 116 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  We have received no further 
information and the basis is that the knowledgeable person is not at 
Transnet. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Not at Transnet anymore? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes.  That is Ms Mdletshe who is 
on suspension. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So if we were to make enquiries you – 
are you suggesting that Ms Mdletshe would be somebody to speak to – 
to find – to at least lay our hands on a complete version of the 
transcript? 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Insofar as we have been advised 
Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Insofar you have been advised, thank you. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then you may proceed. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU: 
 
Chair 
the 
OEMs 
were 
also 
requested to clarify assumptions made and the contingencies built into 
their proposals so that Transnet could seek to assist the OEMs with 
whatever challenges they have.  Both OEMs were requested by 
Transnet for a price reduction and a revised offer.  The price reduction 
20 
would be in the range between 15 and 25 percent.  It was agreed that 
once the negotiations were finalised there would be a variation order to 
the main contract concluded.  The main contract concluded being the 
Locomotive Supply Agreement.  It was further agreed that CNR in 
particular would revise its proposal in order to communicate what was 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 82 of 116 
 
not detailed in its proposals at that point being the milestone payments, 
the scheduled delays and Supply Development.  The revised proposals 
it was agreed with both OEMs would then form part of the variation 
order that would be signed off.  There is particular reference to the 
Transnet Team seeking approval from its Board Sub Committee on 
30 June 2015.  At least is it recorded in the transcript in the part that 
deals with CNR. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The Board Sub Committee that we 
would understand it to be would be the Board Acquisitions and 
10 
Disposals Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Now with the limitations or constraints that came 
with the transcript … 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of these meetings. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you able to form a view as to whether the 
Transnet Negotiation Team interrogated how – for example with CNR – 
the costs that were initially estimated to be around R9 million could go 
up to R600-and something million from that discussion did you – were 
20 
you able to see that they raised this issue and how it was explained or 
is that something that you cannot tell from the transcript? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair from the transcript we are 
unable to tell … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 83 of 116 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  But from email correspondences … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  That will be covered in the 
presentation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  We do see some questions raised 
by some of the members … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Members, yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  But we do not have evidence that 
those were dealt with. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Let alone dealt with sufficiently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the – the discount that Transnet requested the 
OE comes to give them of between 15 to 25 percent.  Do you get – did 
you get to know how Transnet arrived at that – at those discounts 
because if you have been told that the price or the cost will be 600-and 
something million and you say please give me a discount of 15 or 25 
percent one is entitled to assume that you mean you would be quite 
20 
happy with a 15 percent discount so you could pay 100s of millions for 
something that could have been R9 million and maybe even less? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair.  There is neither a 
document nor is there anything in the transcript that suggests or 
discloses how the request for a discount in that range … 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 84 of 116 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Was arrived at. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might be difficult for you to say this but I am – I am 
going to ask you and you can indicate if you are able to – did you get 
any sense whether the Transnet Negotiating Team was negotiating 
effectively or was carrying out their duties to negotiate the best price 
for Transnet to the best of their abilities or were they just going through 
the motions and I accept that you might not be able to say?  So – but I 
am just wanting – wondering whether … 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Having gone through the transcript you got any 
impression. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair it is a question that is linked 
to the findings that we make … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  And therefore from that perspective 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  I am able to record that the 
negotiation team was not carrying out the negotiations in a manner … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  That would best serve the interest 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Of Transnet … 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 85 of 116 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  At least. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  At least Chair insofar as firstly or 
principally … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  In relation to the advice that was 
given in the beginning by PWC … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU: 
 
When 
they 
said 
you 
must 
10 
interrogate … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Or ask the OEMs to justify their 
costs … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  And what we understood from the 
second part of the advice is that is that if it was going to be prohibitive 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Then you should seek alternative 
20 
measures in order to go to locations that would not cost … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Too much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm and your investigations did not reveal that that 
advice was followed or taken further in anyway? 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 86 of 116 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And if I may just enquire along the same lines 
when you started with your presentation you indicated that PWC – I 
think you said it was – had or you told us as a fact that Transnet 
Engineering had different facilities.  Some in Durban and some in 
Uitenhage and both were an option – both Durban and Uitenhage were 
an option? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Did you find any documentation as regards 
10 
whether or not there was a consideration for you Uitenhage to see if it 
might result in cheaper costs than Durban? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No Chair but it is – but it is 
relevant to also point out that having weighed out the pros and cons in 
relation to the stimulation of the economy along the coastline particular 
recommendation was firstly Durban … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  But the line of questioning as I 
understand it Chair is – okay – so if we proceed from the basis that 
Durban is now going to be cost prohibitive is there a study that was 
20 
done pursuant to that in order to consider another location. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And … 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No we have not discovered such. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 87 of 116 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You have no indication that was done? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, thank you. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair at slide 23 having dealt with 
the fact that there was just a single meeting that was held we now wish 
to draw your attention to critical communication amongst the 
negotiating team members with particular reference to volume 13 at 
page 9119 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  By the way Mr Mnyandu the leader of the 
negotiation team of Transnet was whom? 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The Group Chief Executive – Group 
Chief Financial Officer … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Mr Anoj Singh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU: 
 
Yes 
Chair. 
 
With 
particular 
reference Chair to volume 13 at page 9119. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  We draw your attention to an email 
sent by Mr Garry Pita – apologies Chair.  It is - 9119 is where the 
20 
appendix cover is.  So we should actually go … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It is 9120.  Is that right – 9120? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You have – in your slide you indicate that as 
Appendix 11? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 88 of 116 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At 9119 is Appendix 12. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Oh apologies. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And I see that it is a string of three emails.  If 
we start at 9121 it is from Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe to Mr Yousuf Laher. 
That is then followed at 9120 with a response from Mr Yousuf Laher to 
Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe and lastly at the top of 9120 it is once again from 
Mr Yousuf Laher to Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So is that the – the – you wanted us to find 
the email from Mr Garry Pita? 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair.  My apologies.  It is 
actually 9117. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Page 9117? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So it is the page numbering on the 
slide that is wrong? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  We have corrected to seven. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair as is clear this is an email 
from Mr Garry Pita sent on 20 June 2015 at 12:08.  The email is sent to 
20 
Mr Thamsanqa Jiyane. 
 
It 
is 
sent 
to 
as 
well 
Mr Anoj Singh, 
Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe, Mr Yousuf Laher and Mr Ndiphiwe Silinga.  The 
subject reads “CNR Comments”.  The email reads: 
“Dear all, below first find my comments and 
questions for CNR.  I have not received the BT 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 89 of 116 
 
proposal as yet and cannot comment other than 
what I raised yesterday.  I am heading off to a 
family function away for the rest of the weekend but 
cannot be contacted on my phone.” 
Chair what then follows are the actual comments … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – I wonder whether what was meant was – but can 
be contacted on my phone but it does not seem to … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Contextual that is what is suggested here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The sentence does not seem to – to – but it is okay.  
That is him.  That is not you. 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before you proceed and deal with the issues 
that he raises.  This is date 20 June 2015? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed it is so Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And on the previous day on 19 June there was 
a meeting with both OEMs? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Was Mr Garry Pita part of that meeting? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes he was. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So he went into that negotiation with BT 
without having seen the BT Proposal if this email is to be accepted 
because he says I have not received the BT Proposal as yet? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair unless he was referring 
to a revised proposal that ought to have been sent overnight. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 90 of 116 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Because we at least know from our 
records that there was BT Proposal of April … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  2015. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU: 
 
Going 
back 
to Appendix 
11 
Mr Garry Pita says: 
“There is no mention of SD or ED for all contracts 
we normally either keep the percentage of the 
10 
contract value, the SME …” 
Which is not understood. 
“…or make it higher depending on the change.  I 
suggest keeping it the same percentage of now 
greater contract value as the change was created 
due to our choice.  Yousuf to check whether there 
were any contingencies in initial offer as if there 
was then it must be taken into account in this 
calculation.” 
There is a typo we believe. 
20 
“Of they knew we were going to send them to 
Durban so maybe they already priced some of the 
risk in the initial office.  Get list of suppliers they 
are using in Gauteng and total material they expect 
from them as they say they are moving R1.3 billion 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 91 of 116 
 
material but does not make sense as they do not 
have many supplies set up yet per my info.  They 
need to prove the 1.3 billion expected value.  Page 
3 talks of limited manufacturing skills and engineers 
in the area but the plant is situated in Bayhead 
where there are many manufacturing companies and 
an abundance of engineers.  They also talk of the 
same team having to move to Durban yet charge on 
a number of occasions for more labour skills but 
they are sending the same people.  So why charge 
10 
for this on more than one occasion.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  “R54.4 million added size 
of team for labour and quality assurance and CST.  
Transnet in general need to advise if the team in 
KZN has such low skill to justify this additional 
labour from OEM.  178.8 million for material is 
significant.  The inflatory percentage uses is 5.5 
percent which they say is CPI.  Yet CPI is 4.5 
percent.  Additionally they say they use 1.8 percent 
20 
per month for four months which adds to 7.2 
percent.  Why?  They also say it is multiplied by a 
total project cost.  Why total project cost and not 
just the material?  If it is material it should be 1.3 
billion as per page 7/12.  This number is surely 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 92 of 116 
 
overstated by some margin.  The second part of 
material costs being R16.8 million storage would be 
incurred if it was Durban or KDS.” 
He is meant to denote Koedoespoort. 
“So should not be an additional cost unless I am 
missing something.  Technical support in my mind 
already has some change in the additional labour 
charge 
for 
engineers 
and 
additional 
quality 
assurance.  Yet they charge R38.5 million for 
additional support especially for maintenance and 
10 
post production.  Why maintenance and post 
production?  Under technical the additional cost of 
onsite service is high.  Against the list of suppliers 
and how this is broken up seems excessive.” 
Chair - he then goes on to deal with transportation.  In particular in the 
second sentence of that last paragraph on 9117.  He notes: 
“The charge R94.2 million for additional transport 
and advise it is for 55 percent local content.  Ye 
they have 45 percent imported which will not have 
any travel costs once it has reached the port.  We 
20 
need this benefit back estimate as close R90 million 
if you use their logic.” 
Turning overleaf at 9118.  He then says: 
“Yousuf to check assumptions they have used 
possibly or possibly PWC like transport costs, 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 93 of 116 
 
average CPI, insurance costs, shelving and storage 
per m² costs which seem extremely excessive.  
Transport also include local testing for 1.8 million 
but what is the additional cost that would not have 
been incurred in Koedoespoort.  Warehousing:  
Transnet Engineering to check this as I recall them 
asking 
Transnet 
Engineering 
to 
do 
what 
warehousing in initial bid.  So if they are charging 
extra then …” 
I believe it is a typo. 
10 
“Eight should charge them extra bed on their 
numbers like R55 per m² versus R35 per m² in 
Koedoespoort which seems excessive and needs to 
be checked.  They also charge for fencing and 
security and office furniture.  Why is that additional 
over Koedoespoort?  Same goes with additional 
trucks and forklifts.  Why more in Durban versus 
Koedoespoort for the same work?  Does not make 
sense.  Under warehousing R11 200 m² for shelving 
and storage is ridiculous and impossible.  Need to 
20 
fix this.  Again they charge for additional of 90 
under warehousing costs of 25 – 24.5 million plus 
R5.8 million for engineers.  This is now the third 
time they are charging for additional people.  
Yousuf to check financing costs and hedging 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 94 of 116 
 
numbers.  Also industry standard for training is 3 
percent not 6 percent.  So 3.6 million is overstated.  
Contingency must be talked about.  This is fixed 
price.  Regards, Garry.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes.  Chair those are numerous 
concerns, attacks and requests for clarifications that Mr Garry Pita had. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And not in significant concerns one may say? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  And not insignificant concerns one 
must add especially when one has regard to the amounts that 
10 
Mr Garry Pita is attacking or seeking clarification in respect of 
throughout the email correspondence. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair we would now like to take 
you to Appendix 12 which is to be found on page 9120 … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Of volume 13. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  On – halfway through the page of 
9120 and on 21 June the Chair will recall that Mr Yousuf Laher was 
20 
requested to check a number of things by Mr Garry Pita on the previous 
day.  He send the email and he says: 
“Dear all, my comments as follows:  increasing the 
team size does not make sense considering the 
learning curve will mitigate this requirement within 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 95 of 116 
 
a short time.  Two, negotiating with suppliers will 
eliminate 
the 
inflatory 
costs 
related 
to 
four 
additional months.  In any case material costs 
generally do not increase on a monthly basis thus 
the impact should not be as large as 1.8 percent.  
Also 1.8 percent for four months does not equal 5.5 
percent but rather 7.2 percent which is excessive.  
Three, 
from 
the 
explanation 
provided 
the 
incremental cost of procurement does not relate to 
the move to Durban.  This should not be charged.  
10 
In any case 9 percent interest is excessive.  Four, 
the additional technical support requirement in 
Durban does not make sense.  The cost of this 
technical support should have been included in the 
original price.  Five, onsite service by technicians 
should have been included in the original price.  
R31.5 million for travel and relocation seems 
excessive.  Six, can the transport not be done by 
TFR via rail containers?  If so then insurance costs 
would also be a minimum was would be internally 
20 
insured.  Seven, R11 200 per m² for shelving seems 
excessive.  SCS can research this.  Eight, has 
consideration been given to TP …” 
Which is Transnet Property Chair. 
“…or 
Transnet 
Freight 
Rail 
Property 
for 
the 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 96 of 116 
 
warehousing?  Nine, why the additional forklifts?  
10, how much is the incentive and relocation cost 
per staff member?  11, labour inflation does not 
increase on a monthly basis.  The impact could 
possibly only be at the end of the project.  12, 
labour inflation rate applied at 5.5 percent for the 
full year whereas it should only be for four months.  
(Sell E23 and staff sheet).” 
The 13 t h area of concern is: 
“The additional cost to roll over the hedge must be 
10 
checked by Treasury.” 
This point we are to understand that would be Transnet Treasury. 
“14, additional bond costs must be checked by 
Treasury.  15, contingency risk of 4 percent and risk 
provision of 9 percent is unexplained and seems to 
be additional profit.  This seems excessive.  16, 
obtain a detailed list of suppliers being used in 
Durban versus those in Johannesburg.  The cost of 
the long term maintenance consulting does not 
relate to the move to Durban (sell E29 staff).  This 
20 
should not be charged as it should have been 
included in the original contract.  18, labour 
inflation is doubled (Ref:  sell D7 and sell E23 
“staff”).  Best regards, Yousuf Laher.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So on 20 June Mr Pita raises a – a range of 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 97 of 116 
 
concerns. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Regarding the computation of costs by the 
OEMs? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
 
And 
request 
Mr Laher 
to 
do 
some 
calculations? 
MR THOBAN TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  This email you have just read does not 
necessarily seem to suggest that Mr Yousuf Laher was dealing directly 
10 
with the concerns raised by Mr Pita but instead it appears to me – at 
least – to be Mr Laher raising his own set of concerns? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed it is so Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Then what transpires next? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair what then transpires next is 
that on 23 June Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe shared via email and the email is 
be found at Appendix 13.  That is volume 13 page 9122.  It will be 911 
– 9123 Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair in order to follow the email 
20 
chain properly we need to read the one that is at the bottom first.  
Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe sends the email and says … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry Mr Mnyandu the - the mic – your voice 
is … 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Apologies Chair. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 98 of 116 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  (Interpreter). 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU: 
 
The 
email 
from 
Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe reads: 
“Good day, please find attached revised CNR 
Proposal for your review and comments.  Please 
note that both meetings that were scheduled to take 
place today – 23 June 2015 – were postponed.  BTs 
Proposal is still outstanding.  They are having an 
alignment session this afternoon and they will 
revert back to us today with an indication on when 
10 
the revised proposal will be submitted to Transnet.” 
Then it says: 
“Kind regards.” 
Chair we then go to the middle section of the – of the page.  The email 
is sent by Mr Yousuf Laher to be in response to Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe.  
He says: 
“Hi Lindiwe …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is 25 June? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  25 June 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Which is two days after the email 
from Ms Mdletshe.  The email reads: 
“Hi Lindiwe, their proposal has not changed from 
the previous submission except for their new offer 
on payment terms.  As such the comments per my 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 99 of 116 
 
email over the weekend would still apply.  Their 
payment terms offer needs to be considered in light 
of Transnet cash flow situation for which Treasury 
must advice.” 
Chair on our investigation 20 June 2015 was a Friday which was when 
Mr Garry Pita sent his email.  The response from Mr Yousuf Laher was 
on the 21 s t being a Saturday and therefore when he refers on 25 June 
to an email over the weekend he is referring to Appendix 12 which we 
have just considered. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
10 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair there – there then seems to 
be silence.  There is a break in communication insofar as email 
correspondences between the Transnet Relocation Negotiating Team up 
until 10 July. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And so far we have not seen any comments following 
that meeting – those two meetings at - I think you said O R Tambo.  You 
have not seen any comments from the senior people in the team - 
Mr Anoj Singh … 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For example.  Okay, alright. 
20 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair.  Additionally we have 
not seen any email correspondences sent to Transnet Engineering for 
them … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  To check the considerations of the 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 100 of 116 
 
team – concerns of the team members. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU: 
 
Nor 
has 
there 
been 
any 
correspondences sent to Transnet’s Treasury Department for them to 
validate amongst other things … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The additional bonds that are 
required and whether they would be acceptable.  Nor have we seen any 
correspondences sent to the Transnet Property Division which would be 
considered for items like warehousing in a different location. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair as we say slide 27 – there 
then seems to be a break in communication up until 10 July 2015 on 
which date beginnings the process to finalise the relocation costs. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
 
And 
just 
so 
we 
are 
clear 
following 
Mr Yousuf Laher’s 
last 
communication 
of 
25 June 
reminding 
Ms Mdletshe that the issues I raised remain outstanding.  I have not 
received an answer thereto – thereon and Mr Garry Pita’s own concerns 
as reflected in the email you read into the record and that period 
20 
23 June to the date you say 10 July 2015 finalisation begins.  Is there 
any record of at least Mr Garry Pita been addressed on the concerns 
that he raised? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No there is not Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And I – similarly I’ll take it neither are Mr 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 101 of 116 
 
Yusuf Laher’s concerns raised? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No there isn’t Chair, particularly in 
respect of him, there isn’t a response to the mail of 25 June. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which reminds them of the earlier email where 
he set out these concerns. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you come across any suggestion that there 
was a meeting of the members of the Transnet negotiating team where 
they discussed the way forward in the light of the concerns that had 
10 
been raised prior to talking about finalising the agreement? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No Chair we were not able to come 
across any record that demonstrates a meeting having taken place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And to what extent are you able to say that the emails 
to which you have referred exchanged among members of the 
negotiating team, to what extent are you able to say that those to which 
you have referred are basically the only ones that were exchanged 
among the members of the negotiating team of Transnet in regard to 
these negotiations after meeting with the two entities? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair it is pivotal at this point to 
20 
record that the email correspondences we’ve got were received from 
Transnet directly, it is also important to record that we also have had 
access to Transnet’s server.  It is possible in certain instances where 
the subject of a particular email does not indicate that which is 
discussed in the email and therefore you would not be able to find it 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 102 of 116 
 
but insofar as our searchers on the server have confirmed there were 
no further engagements in relation to these issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say there might be some possibility that you 
might have missed some if the subject didn’t…(intervention). 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair what I’m trying to clarify is 
that insofar as our searches have gone on the two OEM’s being 
concerned there were no further engagements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m talking about communication among the members 
of the Transnet negotiating team in regard to their negotiations with the 
two OEM’S.  To what extent – these emails to which you have referred 
10 
could be said to be the only ones that were exchanged among this team 
to say, what are we going to do with the proposals from these entities? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Perhaps Chair, in order to assist 
the Commission in this regard one can recollect that when Ms Lindiwe 
Mdletshe was interviewed and she was questioned about the steps that 
needed to be taken insofar as the comments, in particular, of Mr Yusuf 
Laher are concerned, her response was, Mr Yusuf Laher in any event 
was not part of the negotiation team.  So that gives the indication that 
I, as Lindiwe Mdletshe did not need to take his concern or concerns 
seriously.  So that, together with our searches and the investigations 
20 
conducted therefore leads one to the conclusion that there were no 
further engagements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But insofar as, through technical means of which I 
know nothing that investigators would know, their computers were 
checked to see that really there was – there were no other 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 103 of 116 
 
communications that you might have missed. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so you feel quite confident that there probably 
were no other emails exchanged among them? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   At least – or through Transnet servers? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:    At least not through Transnet 
servers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but of course it would be strange if it was through 
10 
other servers isn’t it? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Strange, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because this was business – this was work related. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you then you’ve taken us now to the 
date of 10 t h July 2015…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry let – just before that, unless they had a 
meeting, that I the Transnet negotiating team, unless they had a 
meeting to which they made no reference in emails among themselves 
20 
to say, let’s have a meeting.  Unless they had a meeting to which they 
made no reference in emails, then it would look like they went into 
finalising the agreement without having had another meeting to talk 
among themselves or to have an exchange of ideas through emails to 
say, how do we approach this, do we have concerns, how do we 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 104 of 116 
 
address concerns that have been raised. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that would be quite strange. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Strange Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And if, on that score, I may then refer you 
back to 9123, the email from Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe of 23 June 2015, at 
the bottom, the bottom email at 9123, she states to the addressees, 
 
“please note that both meetings that were scheduled to take 
 
place today 23 June were postponed”.  
10 
 
You see that? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  First question, do you know what these 
meetings were, these meetings were they OEM’s or presumably 
meetings of the negotiating team. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:   I am – we are unable to clarify 
Chair, save to state in our searches again on the server, these 
meetings had not been discussed earlier, so it might have been  that 
they were arranged by other means other than by way of email 
communication. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And based on your responses to the Chair’s 
questions, I take it that up until 15 t h June – 15 t h July those meetings 
were not held as they were postponed from the 23 r d of June so they 
were postponed on the 23 r d of June and I take postponement to mean 
they shall be held on a different date. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 105 of 116 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you are suggesting that at least whatever 
that date may be it was not before the 15 t h of July, there’s no record of 
those meetings being held before the 15 t h of July?? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair before the 10 t h of July. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before the 10 t h of July, my apologies, 10 t h of 
July. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:    Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Secondly we have heard from a few witnesses 
as well as Mr Sedumedi, it seems common practice that when these 
10 
matters are considered in Transnet, tender related and proposals are 
submitted for evaluation that a cross-function evaluation team is either 
appointed or some evaluation team is appointed, whatever it may be 
called and at the conclusion of whatever their mandate is, they produce 
a report. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Did we have a cross-functional evaluation 
team in respect of these relocation proposals? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No we did not Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So we only had the negotiating team as you 
20 
listed there. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Did the negotiating team produce a record – a 
report on their negotiations with both Bombardier and CNR? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  There isn’t a record of such a 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 106 of 116 
 
report Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Did you enquire about one? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  We did enquire about one when 
one supposes or rather has regard to the fact that there is a report or a 
draft report from the Transnet Internal Audit Team, in respect of which 
we’ll get to shortly, and we were told there wasn’t such a report 
prepared. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Was a reason advanced for why one wasn’t 
prepared? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No Chair. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And in this regard who did you have 
discussion with, who so advised you? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It was firstly Mr Yusuf Laher and 
the secondly Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So your investigations did not reveal that there was 
much discussion around the Transnet negation team on their 
negotiations with these two entities on this very high amounts that were 
supposed to be looked into. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair can you please ask the 
20 
question again. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Your investigations it would seem did not 
reveal that there was much discussion among the Transnet negotiating 
team on these proposals that came from these two entities. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair.

CHAIRPERSON:  Indeed you found nothing that suggested that the 
negotiation team of Transnet interrogated these amounts in any way – 
in any serious way. 
MR 
THOBANI 
TREVOR 
MNYANDU: 
 
Other 
than 
the 
email 
correspondences that we’ve just referred to Chair, we were not able to 
find such communications. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And of course in regard to one, I think Ms Sello said 
Ms Mdletshe said Mr Laher was not even part of the negotiation team. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Except Chair that was said by Mr Mnyandu not 
10 
Ms Sello, I wouldn’t have known – I wouldn’t have that knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
I 
thought 
you 
were 
referring 
to 
some 
email…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  He said that arose during the interview yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no, Mr Mnyandu not Ms Sello.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So okay I guess we’ll get to the point where, 
ultimately, now they agree to something. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:   Agreed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which is a topic you start now on your slide 
27. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:    Which is a topic we start now on 
slide 27 Chair and we take you to Appendix 40 at 9126, Chair we no 
longer mention the cover of the Appendix. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 108 of 116 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:   
At 9126 in volume 13 Chair 
there’s an email sent by Mr Gary Pita on 10 July 2015, it 
reads…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Sorry, for reference at the bottom of 9126, 
right? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Correct Chair, for your reading 
from the bottom of the page, 
 
“Hi Lindiwe, feedback from the meeting this morning is that BT 
 
will be sending us another letter providing further clarity on 
10 
 
their offer.  This is expected on Monday, can I ask that you 
 
update all the documentation i.e. memo for us to send to the 
 
acting GCE, which is for Group Chief Executive for approval of 
 
CNR and BT proposals and a letter from GCE to CNR and BT 
 
accepting proposals.  In order to save time, should the team 
 
copied be happy with the proposals, we can the effect sign-off 
 
quickly.  Please also ensure that the TIA, which is for Transnet 
 
Internal Audit Chair, sign-off from (indistinct) is included in the 
 
memo”, then it says Gary Pita, Group Chief Supply Chain 
 
Officer”. 
20 
 
 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before you go to the response to that email, 
the first paragraph of that email reads, “feedback from the meeting this 
morning is that BT will be sending us another letter”. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 109 of 116 
 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That would suggest that there was a meeting 
held that morning, either Mr Gary Pita was or was not a part of that 
meeting but Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe might not have been as he is 
reporting to her. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:   Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That would be a correct interpretation.  Now 
were you able to establish what this meeting was and between who it 
was? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No we were not able to Chair. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, and I know you said you haven’t had an 
opportunity to interview Mr Gary Pita. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Mr Gary Pita. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  He will shed light, I guess, the day he 
appears. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what is clear from that email is that he says that 
– is that BT was going to be sending a letter providing further clarity on 
their offer.  So – and we know that Mr Gary Pita was one of those who 
had sent emails seeking – giving comments, is that right? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
 
20 
CHAIRERSON:  So here, at least in relation to BT he talks about a 
letter that would be sent, giving clarity and we don’t know whether it 
was going to be giving clarity on some of the issues he had raised or 
whether it was clarity on other aspects. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 110 of 116 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair might I add. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  But what we do know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Is that there is still to be a 
clarification received from BT, however Ms Mdletshe is now being 
requested to prepare the necessary memorandum for the approval of 
both the cost in respect of BT as well as CNR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes which may mean that they – which may mean that 
10 
they know – they’ve been given clarity verbally and what’s left is just 
that clarity being in writing, that’s one way of looking at it.  Another 
way of looking at it, is probably what you have in mind that they’re 
going ahead before getting clarity. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  No Chair, it’s not what I had in 
mind, I agree that, that’s one way of looking at it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there another way, you think? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:    Chair I think you and I are ad 
idem, we are in agreement that there would be another way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But even then we at least accept that it is 
clarity that Ms Mdletshe did not have as she prepared the memo. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 111 of 116 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes you may continue, thank you. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair sticking to or staying on 
page 9126, going further up the page there’s an email from Ms Lindiwe 
Mdletshe on 10 July at 4h14, she writes, 
 
“Hi Gary, I will prepare as requested and circulate for 
 
comments by Monday, Kid Regards, Lindiwe Mdletshe”. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:   Chair what we would like you to 
note in respect of the email correspondence sent by Mr Gary Pita on 
that day being 10 July 2015 is that Mr Yusuf Laher notably is no longer 
10 
copied in the email exchanges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it was Mr Gary Pita who directed 
specifically to Mr Yusuf Laher certain tasks and asked him to do certain 
things. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just remind me again, what was Mr Lehar’s position? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:   He was an Executive Manager in 
the finance department of the operating division acquiring the 
locomotives, Transnet Freight Rail. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would seem to suggest it was somebody whose 
concerns should be given some attention. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 112 of 116 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Mr Mnyandu. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair turning over to slide 28 of 
the presentation, we now take you through the approval process arising 
from the email sent by Mr Gary Pita, firstly in relation to CNR on 22 
July 2015, Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe compiled a separate memorandum for 
the approval of the costs of CNR at an amount of R647 181 494.00.  
Chair this memorandum is to be found at volume 13 at page 
9135…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I’m sorry Mr Mnyandu, before the Chair does 
10 
that I’d like us to go back to 9126 in that email chain at the top is a 
further email from Mr Gary Pita but this time addressed to Mr Selinga. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it seems to suggest that the document is 
ready and is requesting Mr Selinga to review the legal clauses and 
caveats only. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    So by the 14 t h of July the document was, for 
all intents and purposes ready. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I take you back, the Monday on which it was said 
the letter of clarity from  BT would be received, what – do you know 
what date that Monday would have been? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  It would have been Monday 13 July 
Chair. 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 113 of 116 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and the memorandum that Ms Mdletshe was 
preparing seems to have got – to have been ready by when? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The 22 n d of July. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Thanks Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay so then I see that Mr Gary Pita requests 
Mr Selinga to have regard to the document and review the legal clauses 
and caveats raised in both proposals especially in the BT offer. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Firstly were you able to consider a document 
10 
that reflects the caveats, particularly raised in the BT proposal? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes we were Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And what were those in brief? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  In summary those spoke to the 
amount first of all being offered by BT for relocation costs, it spoke to 
the payment terms in relation to the offer as well as a change in the 
facility to be recorded as Durban Bay Head. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Okay, so – and they wanted those issues 
addressed before they could finally decide, is that the understanding? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes.  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay the email then goes further to say, they 
raise some clauses which might have a significant impact please advise 
so we can sign this off ASAP, that is Mr Gary Pita on the 14 t h of July. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay now do you have a record of how Mr 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 114 of 116 
 
Selinga dealt with that request? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Indeed Chair it is dealt with in our 
report, the response is an Appendix, it’s just that we have not covered 
it in the presentation but we can take the Chair through if we find the 
Appendix on the report. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If you recall, perhaps the essence of that 
Appendix, you may tell the Chair. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  The Appendix – sorry the 
concerned was a response from Mr Selinga in which he noted 1) 
617million rand as an offer from BT is okay if that’s what you have 
10 
agreed.  2) The other clauses were fine, however, he raised a particular 
concern or a comment in relation to, I believe, the delays, but I stand 
to be corrected Chair, it would be a document that we should look at as 
the Appendix but indeed there was a response that dealt with the BT 
issues in that form. 
ADV 
MAHLAPE 
SELLO: 
 
Okay 
thank 
you. 
 
Chair 
we 
are 
mindful…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
We 
(indistinct) 
achieved 
what 
we 
hoped 
to 
achieve…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  What we set out to achieve time wise. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but there hasn’t been any delay we have been 
engaging Mr Mnyandu with his important issues, how much more time 
do you need…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  He’s got seven slides to go Chair, I guess if 
he could indicate to us, if we don’t engage him any further how long 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 115 of 116 
 
that might take him but if the Chair engages him and myself perhaps 
that might double or triple the time required.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I need to be out of here now. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was hoping that – I was hoping to be out of here at 
half past twelve and I was hoping that 1 o’clock would be fine so it 
hasn’t happened.  I’m wondering whether we shouldn’t make space if 
Mr Mnyandu is available for tomorrow to finish properly before we start 
with the next witness. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We could Chair, if Mr Mnyandu is 
10 
available...(intervention). 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Chair I confirm I am available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are available? 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDU:  Yes indeed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And for that purpose we could start at 9 
o’clock considering there are seven slides left that should not take us 
more than an hour, I’m quite mindful that we don’t impact the time of 
the next witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes what’s your own estimate of how much time we 
need, I’m trying to think whether we should say 9 o’clock or half past 
20 
nine. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I would – it’s got references – the 7 slides 
have references to certain documentation and as I have seen it is when 
we consider the documents that perhaps we take slightly more time, I 
see about four or five documents that he cross-refers, I think I would 
30 MAY 2019 – DAY 102 
 
Page 116 of 116 
 
be more comfortable with one-hour Chair otherwise if we do half past 
nine then we may force advocate Pretorius to run till 5 and he might not 
be quite happy with that, so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no I think we – I think let’s start at half past nine. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Half past nine? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja let’s start at half past nine because there may be 
something else that I need to attend to if we start at nine, there might 
be some difficulty, let’s start at half past nine. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Catering for one hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And hope – try and finish at least within an hour or 45 
10 
minutes depending.  Okay, alright we’ll adjourn then for now.  So Mr 
Mnyando we will start at half past nine tomorrow, so if you could be 
back tomorrow. 
MR THOBANI TREVOR MNYANDO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, we will adjourn until tomorrow at half past nine 
in the morning, we adjourn. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 31 MAY 2019
