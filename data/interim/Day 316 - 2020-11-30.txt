PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 30 NOVEMBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Chaskalson, good 
morning everybody. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes are we ready? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  We are Chair but before we get 
to todays’ business I would like to correct an error I made 
in last week’s questioning of Mr Ramosebudi. 
 
On Friday evening it was brought to my attention 
that in my questioning of Mr Ramosebudi at the end of the 
10 
session on Thursday the 26 November Thursday’s session I 
unintentionally 
referred 
to 
McKinsey 
as 
opposed 
to 
Regiments in relation to kickbacks paid to shell companies 
set up by Salim Essa.  And Chair the transcript reference 
to where I accidently and incorrectly referred to McKinsey 
is Day 13 page 198 line 5.  Day 13 page 198 line 5. 
 
So I need to apologise for my error both to you 
Chair and of course to McKinsey and I need to set the 
record straight so I would like to do that and just make it 
very clear. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  There is a spread sheet on pages 
590 to 597 of Annexure VV4. That was the spread sheet on 
which I was questioning Mr Ramosebudi. 
 
That spread sheet is a spread sheet of revenue 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 4 of 315 
 
generated by the Regiments advisory unit not the McKinsey 
advisory unit. 
 
The kickbacks to Salim Essa’s shell companies 
reflected on that spread sheet were kickbacks to be paid 
by Regiments and not by McKinsey. 
 
In relation to that spread sheet I questioned Mr 
Ramosebudi on the SAA working capital contract and 
referred him to the kickback in respect of that contract 
reflected on page 596 of Annexure VV4. 
 
Regiments worked on that contract with McKinsey 
10 
but the commission has found no evidence to suggest that 
McKinsey was aware of any bribes or kickbacks being paid 
by Regiments in respect of that contract. 
 
I just want to set the record straight on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair Mr Mpofu might I just have 
a word with Mr Mpofu? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Who represented Mr Ramosebudi 
as well. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Mr Mpofu is – was just wanting to 
indicate 
that 
in 
his 
capacity 
as 
Mr 
Ramosebudi’s 
representative he has noted the correction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay no that is fine.  Thank you.  
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 5 of 315 
 
Thank you.  Thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair there quite a few legal 
representatives present today for today’s evidence and for 
what was planned for today and I wonder if everyone might 
put themselves on record before I – I start today’s 
proceedings. One of the representatives Mr Cockerell is 
here with us on Zoom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think let us take it step by step.  I 
think your next application is for the postponement of the 
evidence of the other witness who was going to give 
10 
evidence today Mr Williams I think and the other witnesses 
who were going to give evidence tomorrow and Wednesday 
and Thursday. 
 
If there are legal representatives representing those 
then we can have those placing themselves on record 
before you move that application.  
 
 
But those who may be representing certainly Mr 
Gordhan and whoever else in regard to Mr Gordhan’s 
cross-examination 
or 
evidence 
then 
they 
can 
place 
themselves on record when we get to what is going to 
20 
happen today with regard to Mr Gordhan’s evidence. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you Chair.  There are 
indeed representatives of the witnesses coming – Mr 
Williams and witnesses coming later or due to come later 
in the week. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 6 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  There are also representatives of 
interested parties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  In relation to those witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And I want to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us have them placed on record. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I wonder if they might place 
themselves on record at this point. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Well maybe you – okay ja you 
might do it from where you are if your microphone works.  
If it does not work you might have to come to the podium.  
Or maybe let everybody comes to the podium then.   
ADV MATHABATHE: Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV MATHABATHE: My name is Leago Mathabathe and I 
appear on behalf of Mr Sipho Masego. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MATHABATHE:  He was an implicated party in Mr 
20 
Williams’ statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MATHABATHE:  So we just want to place on record 
that we reserve out client’s rights to cross-examine Mr 
Williams should the need arise. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 7 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes okay alright. 
ADV MATHABATHE:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will have to apply for leave? 
ADV MATHABATHE:   Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you want to cross-examine. 
ADV MATHABATHE:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Okay thank you.  
ADV NGUTSHANE:  Morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV NGUTSHANE:  I am Advocate Patrick Ngoljana [?] I 
10 
am here with Mr Athol Williams. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV NGUTSHANE:  We have been informed that there will 
be this application to have his evidence postponed today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV NGOLJANA:  On account of the evidence leader who 
is not available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well.  Yes. 
ADV NGUTSHANE:  To deal with his evidence today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Thank you. 
20 
ADV NGUTSHANE:  Thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair I see Mr Cockrell on the 
Zoom screen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Mr Cockrell. 
ADV COCKEREL:  Morning – thank you Chair – sorry 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 8 of 315 
 
Chair.  I am on the Zoom feed but I cannot see you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV COCKEREL:  May I just place myself on record I 
appear for Bain and Company South Africa Incorporated.  It 
is one of the entities that is implicated in Mr Williams’ 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV COCKEREL:  You will note Chair my client has 
applied for leave to cross-examine Mr Williams and has 
also applied for one or two other things.  So I may I simply 
10 
place 
myself 
on 
record 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
those 
applications?  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Yes 
well 
I 
am 
not 
aware 
of 
the 
application for leave to cross-examine but that does mean 
the 
commission 
has 
not 
received 
it. 
 
Things 
start 
somewhere before they get to me but it is good if you make 
[00:07:47] to my attention. 
ADV COCKEREL:  Yes Chair.  May I – sorry – I have been 
engaging with my learned Mr Franklin before he took ill and 
he is obviously well aware of that application. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV COCKEREL:  We had been discussing some of the 
logistics 
but 
obviously 
all 
of 
that 
has 
fallen 
away 
[00:07:50] health Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you.  I think Mr 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 9 of 315 
 
Mpofu wishes to – to speak to you. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   It looks like I am having a busy 
morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chair we would also like to place on 
record that in relation to some of the witness’ who were 
meant to be here for the rest of the week particularly Mr 
Van Loggenberg, Symington, Lakay and I think Mr Williams 
10 
as well we – we were informed of some of them on time 
others only came last week.  So we intend to apply for 
cross-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  At this stage I am not sure if it is for all 
of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  But I will discuss it with Mr Franklin. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, no that is fine. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair that then brings me to the 
business 
of 
the 
day 
and 
as 
several 
of 
the 
legal 
representatives have foreshadowed I need to ask for a 
postponement of the evidence Mr Williams that was due to 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 10 of 315 
 
– to be called later today together with the evidence of Mr 
Vlok Symington who was due to testify tomorrow.  Mr Van 
Loggerenberg who was due to testify on Wednesday and Mr 
Lakay who was due to testify on Thursday. 
 
The reason for the requested postponement Chair is 
that the evidence leader of the commission who was 
dealing with all of these witnesses whose testimony relates 
to SARS is Mr Alistair Franklin SC and Mr Franklin has 
come down ill yesterday and is not in a position to come to 
the commission or to be present in the commission today 
10 
and may well not be able to be present this week. 
 
We would ask that the evidence of those witnesses 
be postponed until – well and to be set down at later dates 
as soon as we know what the condition of Mr Franklin is 
and when he will be able to take that evidence. 
 
In – specifically in relation to the witness Mr 
Williams I would like to apologise for the very short notice 
that he received of this postponement application because 
he has in fact come up from Cape Town yesterday to be 
here today and he – he was not notified before he came up 
20 
but I assure you Chair that that has – that this state of 
affairs happened only in the course of yesterday and the 
commission did its best to notify his attorneys as soon as it 
became clear that Mr Franklin was not going to be 
available today. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 11 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  I take it that all the 
other parties who will be affected by the postponement of 
the evidence of the witnesses you have mentioned have no 
objection to the postponement. 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 
None 
that 
has 
been 
communicated to me but maybe those persons present here 
can be asked if they have any. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja may just say if there is any of them 
who is opposing they can raise their hand.  If they do not 
then I will take it that there is opposition.  There is no hand 
10 
being raised so there is no opposition. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  It has been confirmed to me that 
Mr Williams has no objection to the postponement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  So the hearing of the 
evidence 
of 
the 
witnesses 
that 
Mr 
Chaskalson 
has 
mentioned which was going to happen later today in the 
case 
of 
Mr 
Williams 
and 
tomorrow, 
Wednesday 
and 
Thursday in regard to the other witnesses is postponed and 
other dates will be fixed for them to come back and give – 
to come and give evidence.  Okay thank you very much and 
20 
all inconvenience to all concerned is really regretted but as 
Mr Chaskalson says the evidence leader who was going to 
lead those witnesses as fallen ill and we – that only 
happened yesterday.  Okay.  [00:12:40]. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you Chair.  Apart from the 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 12 of 315 
 
evidence to be led by Mr Franklin Chair today was 
scheduled for the cross-examination of Minister Gordhan 
by Mr Mpofu on behalf of Mr Moyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I see Mr Gordhan has joined us.  He 
was I think not on the screen when I greet everybody. Good 
morning Minister Gordhan. 
MINISTER GORDHAN: Good morning Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Yes 
10 
Mr Chaskalson. 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 And 
Chair 
as 
this 
cross-
examination is cross-examination by Mr Mpofu and not by 
Mr Franklin we do not seek any postponement of this 
cross-examination from today.   
 
However Chair it will be necessary for me briefly to 
lead Minister Gordhan on his clarificatory affidavit which 
he filed after he testified and which has not yet been the 
subject of oral evidence. 
 
And I ask because we now have the whole day open 
20 
I ask that this matter might stand down until after the tea 
adjournment so that I might briefly prepare in relation to 
leading that evidence and confer with Mr Gordhan and his 
legal representatives to give them an indication of where I 
intend to go with that. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 13 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Well 
first 
of 
all 
I 
thank 
you 
Mr 
Chaskalson for stepping in to assist in the absence of Mr 
Franklin at least with regard to Mr Gordhan’s evidence 
because if you – if nobody had stepped in we might have 
had 
to 
consider 
postponing 
the 
cross-examination 
obviously with everybody being heard first.   
 
But the fact that you were able to step in at very 
short notice has assisted us to be able to continue with Mr 
Gordhan’s evidence and his cross-examination. 
 
But certainly I will grant you some time to look at 
10 
issues that you need to look at and I confirm that all legal 
representatives affected by this have no problem with the 
matter being stood down – adjourned for some time for you 
to get that chance. 
 
They have confirmed that to me.  So we are at 
twenty eight minutes to eleven shall we say we will resume 
at half past eleven? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay fine.  That is fine.  Mr Mpofu that is 
in order?  Yes Ms Le Roux?  That is in order.  Okay alright.  
20 
Mr Gordhan we are going to adjourn until half past eleven.  
Mr Franklin who was going to be the evidence leader is not 
– is not well and Mr Chaskalson has stepped in to try and 
assist so that we do not postpone your evidence or the 
cross-examination.  But he needs some time to look at 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 14 of 315 
 
certain issues because he has not been involved in the 
matter until I think yesterday.   
 
So we are going to adjourn until half past eleven.  
We adjourn. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Chaskalson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see we do not have Mr Gordhan on the 
screen as yet or that he is okay.  Yes, Mr Chaskalson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Mr Chair.  Good  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Good morning. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Minister Gordhan, I am here, 
briefly to lead you on your clarificatory affidavit that you 
furnished to the Commission in response to a directive of the 
Deputy... of the Chairperson.  Can I ask you to turn to page 
781 of Bundle N3? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before we do that Mr Chaskalson.  He 
20 
needs to take an oath or affirmation.  Please, administer the 
oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think he cannot hear you.  Can you hear 
us Mr Gordhan? 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 15 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I can hear you Chair but not the...  I 
can hear Mr Chaskalson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   [Indistinct] [Speaker is not clear.]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  My registrar is going to be 
administer the oath or affirmation.  We need to see you are 
able to hear him. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes, I can hear you.  Let me try to 
hear the registrar. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
10 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record. 
WITNESS:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, he cannot hear you.  What is wrong 
with your mic today? 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record. 
WITNESS:   Pravin Jamnadas Gordhan. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objections in taking the 
prescribed affirmation? 
WITNESS:   No objection. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you still affirm that the evidence you will 
20 
give, will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing else but 
the truth?  If so, please raise your right hand and say:  I 
truly affirm. 
WITNESS:   I truly affirm. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Okay alright.  Okay

PRAVIN JAMNADAS GORDHAN:  (d.s.s.) 
EXAMINATION BY ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, 
Mr Gordhan.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask you to turn to page 781 
of Bundle N3?  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   [Indistinct] [Speaker is not clear.] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is the first page of your... or 
can you confirm that the document that starts there and runs 
to page 791 is your clarificatory affidavit? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us just get the bundle right.  I have 
got in front of me N3(a).  Is that the one you are talking 
about? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, that would be...  I have one 
consolidated N3 Chair.  I image it would be N3(b) because I 
have been told... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I know his clarificatory affidavit is not 
in his bundle.  It is on the other one.  The other big one that 
has got some blue dividers.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, Chair.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  What is the page number? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   781 is the page number that I 
have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Say this one is N3(b) and the other one 
will 
be 
Bundle 
N3(a). 
 
Ja. 
 
Okay 
alright. 
 
Yes, 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 17 of 315 
 
Mr Chaskalson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Minister Gordhan, if you can go 
then to page 781.  It is in N3(b).  And I would like you to 
confirm that the affidavit that runs from 781 to 791 is your 
clarificatory affidavit. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I confirm. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And the signature at page 791 is 
your signature. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I confirm. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And can you confirm the 
10 
correctness of the contents of that affidavit? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I do. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Minister Gordhan, I am going to 
take you briefly through certain parts of that affidavit.  Can I 
ask you first to go to page 782, paragraph 5 where you 
explain the circumstances in which you furnished the 
affidavit.  And can I ask you to briefly read into the record 
paragraphs 5 to 7? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Paragraph 5, Chairperson: 
“I 
submit 
this 
affidavit 
as 
directed 
by 
the 
20 
Chairperson of the Judicial Commission of the 
Inquiry into allegation of State Capture, corruption 
and fraud in the public sector, including organs of 
state (the Commission). 
On 6 May 2019, requiring a short affidavit to clarify 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 18 of 315 
 
“whether 
in 
stating 
in 
his 
statement 
of 
11 October 2018 that Mr (Tom Moyane) (Mr Moyane) 
acted maliciously in laying charges against him and 
others.  He meant that: 
a) In laying the charges against Mr Gordhan and 
others, Mr Moyane was motivated wholly or in 
part by/or he sought an advance the objectives of 
State Capture or he was revealing a legal process 
for his own personal goals that had either nothing 
or little to do with a legitimate complaint relating 
10 
to an alleged crime.” 
 
Paragraph 6: 
“The Chairperson’s directions go on to require that 
“I simply state what (I) meant when (I) stated that 
Mr Moyane had acted maliciously in laying the 
charges against (me) and others.” 
 
At paragraph 7: 
“At the outset, I emphasise that I have never alleged 
that Mr Moyane was motivated by [Speaker is not 
clear – transmission lost] when he laid the complaint 
20 
that led to criminal charges in court against me 
which was subsequently withdrawn.” 
ADV 
CHASKALSON 
SC: 
 
 
Can 
I 
then 
ask 
you, 
Minister Gordhan to turn to page 786 at paragraph 22 of your 
affidavit? 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 19 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And there at the start of paragraph 
22, you concede that you have no knowledge of Mr Moyane’s 
state of mind when he laid the complaint.  And then – so that 
you considered his explanation for his conduct that he 
provided to the Commission. 
 
And from paragraphs 21 through to 27...  Oh, sorry.  It is 
22.1 to 22.7.  But you then set out, what I understand to be, 
the reasoning upon which you submit that the Commission 
should conclude that Mr Moyane sought to advance the State 
10 
Capture Project.   
 
Would that be a fair summary of 22.1 to 22.7? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes, that will be fair.  And of course, 
if I may add Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   That in all of these matters, it is Mr 
Moyane who is implicated in State Capture and he should 
give his version of various events to the Commission in 
addition to whatever emerges from my cross-examination so 
that the Commission has the full benefit of whatever he has 
20 
to say. 
 
But the advocate is right.  Paragraph 22 and 22.1 to 
22.7, he has presented as a fair summary. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask you to read into the 
record paragraphs 22.1 to 22.7 so we – so the Commission 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 20 of 315 
 
and the public hear what the core of your reasoning is in 
relation to the conclusions you want the Commission to draw 
against Mr Moyane? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I will do that.  In the introductory 
lines under paragraph 22 Chairperson, the following is 
stated: 
“To be clear, I have no knowledge of Mr Moyane’s 
state of mind when he laid the complaint and I have 
considered his explanation through his conduct that 
he provided to the Commission.” 
10 
 
At 22.1: 
“In essence, he said that he acted as a reasonable 
person in the circumstances in which he found 
himself as the Commissioner of SARS.” 
 
At 22.2: 
“I, however, disagree with this and personally belief 
that Mr Moyane through his legal processors for 
reasons already explained in my evidence.” 
 
At 22.3: 
“I say this based on my experience of his defiant 
20 
attitude 
and 
vilification 
of 
me 
following 
my 
reappointment as Minister of Finance, which I 
believe was then at forcing or pressuring me to 
resign from that position so that the Capture of 
National Treasury could proceed under a different 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 21 of 315 
 
minister.” 
 
At 22.4: 
“To use the words of the Chairperson’s direction, I, 
therefore, do mean that Mr Moyane “was not 
motivated wholly or in part by or he sought to 
advance the objective of State Capture” and that “he 
was abusing a legal process for his own personal 
goals that either had nothing or little to do with the 
legitimate complaints to an alleged crime.” 
 
At 22.5:

“I believe in Mr Moyane’s “personal goals” while he 
was SARS Commissioner included the advancement 
of a State Capture Project.” 
 
At 22.6: 
“This believe is founded on what we all now know 
about how “the failure of integrity and governance at 
SARS soundly evidenced by the change over four 
years has certainly compromised the performance of 
its core function of collecting tax to the detriment of 
the country at large” as found by Justice Nugent in 
20 
the Commission of Inquiry into Tax Administration 
and Governance by SARS, what is called the Nugent 
Inquiry, pages 477, paragraph 19 of the final report 
of the Nugent Inquiry.” 
 
At 22.7: 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 22 of 315 
 
“I turn to highlight briefly certain relevant findings 
by Justice Nugent below which forms the basis of 
my belief that Mr Moyane’s actions as SARS 
Commissioner were a part of the State Capture 
Project.” 
 
Just give me a second so that I can find the right page.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   [Indistinct] [Speaker is not clear.] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I do not need you to proceed 
beyond that point.  You can go onto to quote certain 
10 
passages from the report of Justice Nugent...  Well, that 
report is a document which we all have. 
 
I do want to take you to paragraph 28 which is at page 
789 and there you state: 
“In 
my 
statement 
to 
this 
Commission 
on 
the 
11t h of October 2018, specifically in paragraph 104 
and 127 through to 127.4, I recorded numerous 
examples of the acrimonious nature of Mr Moyane’s 
rejection of my oversight while I was Minister of 
Finance and his insulting attacks on me following my 
20 
reappointment 
as 
Minister 
of 
Finance 
in 
December 2015. 
This provides the context to and the basis for my 
belief that he is laying of a complaint against me 
was 
something 
other 
than 
the 
actions 
of 
a 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 23 of 315 
 
reasonable commissioner.” 
 
Can I ask?  Apart from the evidence to which you refer 
by cross-referring to paragraph 107 and 127 to 127.4 of you 
statement of 11 October 2018.   
 
Are 
there 
any 
facts 
on 
which 
you 
rely 
in 
your 
clarificatory 
affidavit 
for 
the 
inferences 
you 
seek 
the 
Commission to draw that are within your own personal 
knowledge as opposed to the facts that are in the public 
domain? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Sorry, I did not hear the last part.  
10 
As opposed to...? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   The facts that are in the public 
domain or facts that other witnesses may testify to that are 
not within your personal knowledge. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chairperson, it is very difficult to 
draw the distinction between what might be in the public 
domain and what might be in my personal knowledge, 
because over the years, those two have in fact merged but I 
will 
try 
my 
best 
to 
address 
the 
question. 
 
During 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe I can assist?  The reasons why 
Mr Chaskalson has drawn a distinction between what you 
may have personal knowledge of and what is in the public 
domain, is because facts that you have personal knowledge 
of.   
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 24 of 315 
 
 
Matters that, generally, you can testify about.  Facts that 
may be in the public domain but of which you have no 
personal knowledge, you may not be able to testify in regard 
to whether they are true or not.   
 
So I think that is the – that is why he is making that 
distinction.  Is that correct Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I will certainly attempt to do that 
Chairperson.  Thank you for your guidance.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I mean, one reference Chair that I 
could make is, the meeting that the Deputy Minister Jonas 
and I had with Mr Moyane sometime on the morning of the 
14t h of December 2015 when I left him with - and the deputy 
minister as well – I left him with ten guidelines and requests. 
 
And amongst those ten, where firstly that the issue of 
governance over SARS must be a matter that we should 
discuss. 
 
Secondly, that I would like the opportunity to review 
20 
what was then being called the new operating model.   
 
Now outside of my knowledge there is, of course, 
information about various meetings with and company at 
Nkandla and elsewhere, very much prior to Mr Moyane’s 
appointment at SARS and the implications that could be 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 25 of 315 
 
drawn, including – and this is again outside of my knowledge 
...[intervenes]  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry ...[indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   [Indistinct] [Speaker is not clear.] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Minister Gordhan, I must ask you 
to confine yourself to matters within your knowledge because 
otherwise ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   ...the evidence and the cross-
examination may stray far beyond the bounds of what will be 
10 
helpful to the Commission. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, thank you for the guidance.  So 
the second matter, as I was saying, is the new operating 
model, which I said, I would like the opportunity to the 
opportunity to review. 
 
Meaning, that this was something foreign to me and one 
would like, together with the deputy minister, to understand 
what the new operating model was and how it was going to 
be implemented and that various appointments that were 
intended to that privy, halted. 
20 
 
The third matter was the question of requesting that if 
SARS was involved or any person in SARS was involved in 
the leaking of information to, in particular at the time the 
Sunday Times, that should stop because that is not in the 
best interest of SARS. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 26 of 315 
 
 
Then 
the 
fourth 
element 
is 
that, 
as 
far 
as 
communications go, that SARS should limit itself to customs 
and related matters of administration. 
 
And that it will be something next door, maybe that 
SARS will be required to comment on that consultation 
should take place with the Deputy Minister of Finance before 
SARS got involved in any other matters. 
 
The 
fifth 
– 
the 
sixth 
issue 
was 
the 
question 
of 
endeavouring.  That we should all endeavour to put in place 
a strategy to regain public confidence in the institution. 
10 
 
And I think it is fair to say that it is my personal 
experience in government that the standing of SARS and the 
capability of SARS in collecting tax and customer revenue 
and stopping illicit trade has been compromised over that 
period of time. 
 
Then there was a request that SARS officials should not 
stray into political matters and should desist from political 
commentary.   
 
And then a further request, that it was important that 
SARS officials familiarise themselves with broader economic 
20 
issues because the relationship between SARS as an 
important fiscal institution and for example the work of the 
Treasury or the work of the Department of Trade and 
Industry or the economy more generally, is an important one 
to understand so that there is a context that officials at 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 27 of 315 
 
SARS, for the kind of work that they do, in addition to – or to 
place into context the various administrative functions that 
they actually perform. 
 
And lastly Chairperson.  Me emphasise, the deputy 
minister and I, the importance of suggesting integrity.  Again, 
referring to the theme that I made reference to earlier on. 
 
So those were issues that were confirmed by Mr Moyane 
in an email that was discussed in the first meeting. 
 
Apart from that, of course, there is a question of the 
alleged charges which in fact I have learnt more recently is a 
10 
complaint that has been lodged – had been lodged by 
Mr Moyane at the Brooklyn Police Station. 
 
And initially Chair, I will give you the reference if you 
need 
them, 
on 
your 
findings 
in 
the 
matter 
with 
the 
[background noise interference present – speaker unclear] 
judgment or ruling...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The ruling or judgment, ja. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   You may Chair?  I beg your pardon? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can call it ruling or judgment.  We 
know what you are talking about.  
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Okay.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Alright.  Thank you.  Not being a 
lawyer is – I need to get my terminology correct.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Yes.  But there were two – you 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 28 of 315 
 
may be referring to the first one.  You must still tell us which 
one you are referring to. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Ja, it is the ruling of 2019. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay that will be your first one, ja. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Ja, in which the quotation from 
some document that Mr Moyane has submitted to the 
Commission in which he said that he did lay charges against 
several individuals. 
 
And if I remember the quotation, he said – the quotation 
goes onto to say, “including Mr Gordhan or Minister 
10 
Gordhan”. 
 
But in his later affidavits, he then, of course, confirms 
that I was not amongst the names that he had indicated in 
that complaint. 
 
Of course, I was none the wiser because we had no 
access to the actual documents lodged at the Brooklyn 
Police Station.  
 
And secondly, that only became apparent when the 
documentation became available to the officers of the 
Commission itself. 
20 
 
So there is that discrepancy, if you like about whether, in 
fact – and the words, as you know Chairperson, complaint 
and charge gets mixed in various passages, in various 
documents as well but I believe the technical terminology is 
that was a complaint.   
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 29 of 315 
 
 
And the charges, actually, that followed, lodged by the 
NPA on the 11t h of October 2016 and then withdrawn on the 
31s t of October 2016, were in relation to the pension fund 
and not the then investigation unit itself.  So that is another 
set of facts that are not material, up to a point, in this 
context. 
 
And the third is the fiscal implications of a revenue 
service that now has – or as a result of various actions taken 
during Mr Moyane’s term of office as Commissioner of SARS. 
 
And as a result further of dismantling of various 
10 
capabilities and institutions that we had set out within SARS, 
which advanced tax compliance, generally in the country and 
led to increased revenues being collected. 
 
That 
this 
dismantling 
of 
some 
of 
those 
or 
the 
reorganisation of some of those entities, actually resulted in 
loss of capabilities.   
 
So I supposed the people at SARS, they can tell you 
how many auditors, how many debt collectors, how many 
expert in corporate taxation that were assembled over a 
period of time in the 2000’s, had left SARS, either being 
20 
forced to or not wishing to be associated with the current 
developments that were taking place. 
 
The consequence of all of that Chair is that tax 
compliance is now lower than what it used to be, which 
means that what we used to refer to the as the Tax Gap, 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 30 of 315 
 
meaning the gap between revenue due and revenue to be 
collected, grew rather than was being narrowed as it was 
during that period and after that period as well. 
 
And so today, the new commissioner and management at 
SARS would have an additional task of in rebuilding the 
capability and capacity on the other one. 
 
But on the other hand, encouraging quite a different 
level of tax compliance compared to the period when 
Mr Moyane was there as well.   
 
And that has serious consequences in terms of, if one 
10 
would like to say balancing the national books between what 
revenue comes in, what expenditure takes place and what 
borrowing has to happen in order to enable that expenditure 
to take place and the consequences are felt by ordinary 
people in South Africa at a day-to-day level.  So that is a 
whole topic, you know, on that. 
 
In respect of what happens when – under the guys or 
one or other narrative, institutional deterioration takes 
places, not accidentally but with intention and possible 
through a misguided belief that those actions would serve a 
20 
particular cause. 
 
In retrospect, it did not.  It only served the course of 
what today we know as State Capture and institutional 
deterioration and destruction as compared or as opposed to 
actually helping the country to be in a better position to deal, 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 31 of 315 
 
what we now know as a Covid pandemic itself. 
 
I am going to pause there Chair because there might be 
many other things as well and so – I am not sure what 
Mr Chaskalson has in mind but those would be some of the 
things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Chaskalson. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, before I ask further 
questions. 
 
If 
I 
can 
just 
give 
one 
cross-
reference...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you do that.  Can I just confirm 
10 
that the question you had posed to Mr Gordhan, to which he 
was responding, was whether there were any other facts of 
which he had personal knowledge on which he relied for his 
belief that Mr Moyane was pursuing a state capture agenda 
during his time as SARS Commissioner.  Well, is that in 
effect the question? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That was the essence of my 
question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   To distinguish between the facts 
20 
within his personal knowledge and facts ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   ...which he may have seen from 
elsewhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 32 of 315 
 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And also, specifically related to 
the belief that he expresses that Mr Moyane was pursuing 
State 
Capture. 
 
I 
do 
want 
to 
draw 
that 
distinction 
Minister Gordhan because this Commission is concerned 
with whether Mr Moyane’s actions were good or bad for 
SARS, it just concerned with the question of whether Mr 
Moyane’s actions at SARS were motivated by a desire to 
pursue state capture, so I think it is very important to keep 
those issues separate. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But also I wanted to …[intervenes] 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   May I respond to that, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you respond to that please do not 
forget what you wanted to say, Mr Gordhan.  In answering 
Mr Chaskalson’s question did you understand the question 
to be the one that I have just articulated and which he has 
confirmed? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   You have given it a bit more 
clarity, Chair, so I can add one or two elements and I would 
like to, if I may, comment on Mr Chaskalson’s point about 
the Commission focusing on state capture and not what 
20 
happened within SARS itself, if I may. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, Mr Gordhan, that was not 
the distinction that I was seeking to make.  It is a 
distinction between whether Mr Moyane was motivated via 
desire 
to 
pursue 
state 
capture 
which 
is 
what 
the 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 33 of 315 
 
Commission is concerned with and what the consequences 
of Mr Moyane’s actions were for SARS which, for the most 
part, is not an issue with which the Commission is 
concerned.  Assessing whether Mr Moyane was good or 
bad for SARS is not primarily a focus of this Commission, 
certainly not a focus of today’s cross-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think Mr Mpofu has been covered 
or has he not?  He wanted to say something.  Okay, let 
them sanitise before you – otherwise if you can speak – if 
it is a brief point you could speak from where you were.  
10 
Okay.  Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Good afternoon, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  No, Chairperson, I wanted to just 
raise an objection.  I do not know what is going on now.  
We are here the cross-examination of Mr Gordhan, I 
understood that there was a clarificatory statement that 
was going to be gone to so that it is part of the record 
which really should not take long but what is now 
happening is a rehash of Mr Gordhan’s evidence and him 
20 
reading long passages from affidavits that are already 
before the Commission.  No useful purpose can be served 
by that except to waste time and then Mr Gordhan goes on 
ready ten points from some email which has nothing to do 
with the question.   
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 34 of 315 
 
 
So if we are going to go at this rate – and then he 
only gets told after the long rambling that he did not 
answer the question.  Then that is going to detrimentally 
affect the pace and progress of the cross-examination.   
 
So, Chair, I mean Mr Gordhan has given this 
evidence here, he gave it for over two days.  If the 
evidence leaders did not ask those questions so that they 
can focus his evidence which I charge they did not 
because they allowed him to go o and on.  You cannot have 
another chance to do what was done in November 2018. 
10 
 
Secondly, Mr Gordhan has given this evidence of 
vilifying Mr Moyane, about his performance and business 
centres and what have you.  He gave that evidence, you 
know, unabated at the Nugent Commission.  So I do not 
know why he must give it for the third or the fourth time 
now.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe – okay, Ms… 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine, let me hear what 
Mr Chaskalson has to say.  I have noted that Ms Le Roux 
20 
does not indicate – does not wish to say anything.  Mr 
Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, I am right at the end of 
this process, I appreciate that the purpose of today is not 
to afford Mr Gordhan a new attempt to give evidence, it is 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 35 of 315 
 
to 
– 
it 
is 
essentially 
to 
summarise 
his 
clarificatory 
statement which was not in the record already. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I must say that my understanding – I 
thought the reason behind your question was to see 
whether apart from saying he bases his belief that Mr 
Moyane was pursuing a state capture agenda, apart from 
saying that he bases his belief on Judge Nugent’s findings 
whether there were also any personal matters or facts of 
which he had personal knowledge on which he was basing 
it and I thought that was connected with paragraph 28 
10 
because I was not sure whether that was meant to say 
well, that might not be in the findings of Judge Nugent but 
it is part of what informs my case. I thought that it was 
intended to clarify that.  
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It was really to narrow – the 
purpose of the question was to narrow the ambit of today’s 
hearing to facts that are within Mr Gordhan’s personal 
knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Upon which he bases his 
20 
reasoning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   As opposed to facts which the 
Commission will have to find elsewhere or not find 
elsewhere on which he relies. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 36 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright.  No, that is fine. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But in addition to that – and the 
purpose of that question has already been served. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Mr Gordhan has identified what 
facts are within his personal knowledge.  The last topic 
that I want to address with Mr Gordhan in …[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Sorry, Chair, may I intervene? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, in fact can summarise in six 
10 
points.  Maybe that would help, it will take a minute and a 
half. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   The point that Mr Chaskalson 
addressed and also to assist Adv Mpofu as well in relation 
to what he had to say.  So the first point, Chair, which is 
also [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry, Minister Gordhan, before 
you carry on those six points? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang, hang, on.  
20 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can I ask you to confine yourself 
to facts within your personal knowledge? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   That is the exercise that I want 
to… 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 37 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes, I will.  Yes, I will. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Go ahead, Mr Gordhan.   
MINISTER GORDHAN:    So the issue is one of state 
capture, Chairperson.  Subsequent to my evidence in 
November 2018 I now have experience in various state 
owned enterprises and the kind of impact that activities 
related to state – what we today call state capture, what 
they result in, what the consequences are and if the 
Commission is interested we can talk about that, but there 
is a pattern as I indicated in November 2018 but that 
10 
pattern reinforced by experiences subsequently.  That is 
my first point. 
 
My 
second 
point 
is 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
complaint/charges which I have already expanded upon. 
 
My third point is the issue of accountability, simple 
matters like application for leave, etcetera, which I am 
sure Mr Mpofu is going to come back to. 
 
My fourth point is in relation to SARS’ operations 
and I do have personal knowledge of what was set up and 
what appears to be the changes thereafter. 
20 
 
The fifth point is in relation to what you refer to – or 
somebody referred to, Chairperson, the dismantling of 
certain entities like The Large Business Centre, I think Mr 
Mpofu referred to it.  I did not give evidence as far as I can 
recall before the Nugent Commission on that, so he might 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 38 of 315 
 
want to check his facts.  I went through the presentation I 
made to the Nugent Commission last night and I merely 
explained how SARS worked in the various dimensions. 
 
And my last point which will also,  imagine, in the 
cross-examination is that Mr Moyane was in possession of 
various forms exculpatory evidence both in relation to the 
so-called pension issue and the investigating unit issue 
which did not make itself known or was no publicly opened 
up to until it was very late in the day, so to speak.  So 
those are my six points, Chair, thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   I am going to try and bring us 
back to the terms of reference for today which are set out 
in your ruling, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Where the Chairperson has 
identified the ambit of today’s hearing to deal with five 
issues.  The first is whether in laying the criminal 
complaint or charges against Mr Gordhan Mr Moyane acted 
maliciously.   Now it now appears to be common cause that 
20 
Mr Moyane did not lay a complaint against do you.  Do you 
accept that? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   (b) Again whether in laying the 
criminal complaint against Mr Gordhan Mr Moyane was 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 39 of 315 
 
motivated wholly, in part, etcetera.  It is common cause 
there was not a criminal complaint against you. 
 
(c)  Same story, it relates to a criminal complaint 
that was not laid against you, you have explained why you 
believe that there was one. 
 
(d)  Whether as Commissioner of SARS Mr Moyane 
sought to advance the state capture project, and 
 
(e)  Whether Mr Moyane’s personal goals, while he 
was SARS Commissioner, included the advancement of the 
state capture project. 
10 
 
I would like us to emphasise (d) and (e) because it 
seems to me that at this stage that is what the ambit of 
today’s hearing should focus on, no more and no less, 
because (a), (b) and (c) are based on a supposition which 
turned out not to be correct.. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   And probably – and, Chair, for the 
reasons that I have outlined it was not out of intent, there 
was lack of information that was available at that particular 
point in time, firstly.   
 
And if I may repeat, the 27, so-called 27 questions 
20 
that came from the Hawks prior to the 2016 National 
Budget made reference to a case number which is the 
same case number as the complaint lodged by Mr Moyane. 
 
And my last point, which I have made before as 
well, is that the true nature of the complaint and the 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 40 of 315 
 
persons indicated in that complaint only became apparent 
once 
the 
documentation 
was 
available 
through 
the 
Commission.  Thank you. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Thank you, Chair, those were all 
the questions that I wanted to ask. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you.  Mr Mpofu, you now 
have the opportunity  to cross-examine Mr Gordhan. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Thank you, Chair, good morning. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, good morning. 
ADV LE ROUX:   When we were …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or good afternoon. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Good afternoon already.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV LE ROUX:   When we were in chambers you said that 
you would give an indication at this point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV LE ROUX:   With respect to duration of the cross-
examination. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV LE ROUX:   We had previously been advised that it 
was likely to be around two hours …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well …[intervenes] 
ADV LE ROUX:   You said you would give an indication on 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 41 of 315 
 
whether the further evidence this morning had changed 
that for you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no, actually I …[intervenes] 
ADV LE ROUX:   If we could just get that clarity we will be 
indebted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The last thing I said  was that after Mr 
Chaskalson has finished leading Mr Gordhan on the 
clarificatory affidavit I will adjourn and we would have a 
discussion about the duration in chambers.  Maybe we 
should do that quickly.  Mr Mpofu, is that fine?  Ja, okay.  
10 
Mr Gordhan, we are going to adjourn for a very short time, 
maybe five minutes to discuss the duration of the cross-
examination and then we are going to resume after that.  
We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES: 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see Mr Gordhan is not back on the 
screen yet, we will have to wait for him. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I am back Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are back, okay, alright.  After 
20 
discussing with the – all the legal teams with regard to the 
duration of Mr Gordhan’s cross-examination by Mr Mpofu I 
have provisionally fixed two hours, which is not going to be 
rigid, I said that at the expiry of the two hours I will assess 
eth situation and may have a discussion with the legal 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 42 of 315 
 
teams as to whether it is not necessary to add and if so 
add how much.  So that is what I have said. 
 
So we are going to start now and then at one it will 
be lunch so Mr Mpofu’s first hour will finish at half past two 
and then the second hour at half past three so roundabout 
half past three we will then look at the situation again.  I 
also want to emphasize having discussed with the legal 
teams that the scope of the cross-examination is subject to 
what I will say just now set out in paragraph 28 of my 
ruling of 25 November 2019, that is the second ruling. Mr 
10 
Chaskalson did refer to this paragraph just before we 
adjourned, and I am going to read it for the benefit of 
everybody including the public.   It said in 28.1, subject to 
2 below but I won’t go to 2 below it is not relevant for 
today.   
“Mr Moyane is hereby granted leave to cross-
examine Mr Gordhan on: 
[a] 
whether in laying the criminal complaint or 
charges against Mr Gordhan Mr Moyane acted 
maliciously; 
20 
[b] 
whether in laying the criminal complaint 
against Mr Gordhan Mr Moyane was motivated 
wholly or in part by or he sought to advance the 
objectives of State Capture. 
[c] 
whether in laying the criminal complaint 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 43 of 315 
 
against Mr Gordhan Mr Moyane was abusing a legal 
process for his own personal goals that had either 
nothing or little to do with the legitimate complaint 
relating to an alleged crime. 
[d] 
whether 
as 
Commissioner 
of 
SARS 
Mr 
Moyane 
sought 
to 
advance 
the 
State 
Capture 
project; 
[c] 
whether Mr Moyane’s personal goals while 
he 
was 
SARS 
Commissioner 
included 
the 
advancement of the State Capture project.” 
10 
As I understand the position Mr Gordhan has indicated that 
[a] to [c] as far as he is concerned have fallen away and I 
think as far as Mr Chaskalson is concerned in the light of 
the clarification that Mr Gordhan gave about how – what 
had happened Mr Chaskalson really as far as he is 
concerned what remains is [d] and [e].   
 
Now Mr Mpofu has said that he will have some 
questions for Mr Gordhan in regard to [a] to [c] although 
they would not take a lot of time but other than that there 
is common understanding that the main issues are those 
20 
that fall under [d] and [e] of paragraph 28 of that ruling. 
 
Okay, Mr Mpofu did I capture that correctly as you 
understood it as well? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Chairperson yes you did.  If I may chair 
before you run the clock Chair just a few remarks, one is 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 44 of 315 
 
that we don’t accept implicitly that [a] to [c] have fallen 
away and I will deal with that in questioning Mr Gordhan to 
clarify. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MPOFU:   And then maybe I might address the Chair 
on that, but we do of course accept Chair that even when 
you gave your ruling the accent of your ruling was on let’s 
say [d] to [e]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MPOFU:   In the sense that our approach is that the 
10 
five 
things 
are 
completely 
inter-related, 
one 
cannot 
separate from them but in fairness he did say at paragraph 
26 an allegation that someone performed his or her duties 
in order to advance the State Capture project is a serious 
allegation and those facing such an allegation should be 
given an opportunity to defend themselves against it, and 
you also said at 27 I consider that subject to one condition, 
it is the interest of the work of the Commission to grant 
Moyane leave to cross-examine, and then you went to say 
before this Commission it must rank as the most serious 
20 
allegation or statement for it to be said that you performed 
your official duties in order to advance the objectives of 
State Capture and speaking generally such a person 
should a person should be granted leave to cross-examine, 
so at lease we agree on that part. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 45 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no that’s fine, I used the words 
fallen away in regard to [a] to [c] but Mr Chaskalson might 
not have used that term, so ja okay. 
MR MPOFU:   Yes, but I know what the Chair means, and 
maybe I can clarify it as follows.  Good afternoon Mr 
Gordhan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Gordhan can you hear Mr Mpofu?  
Oh, we cannot hear you Mr Gordhan.  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Ja, I thought he was addressing 
Chairperson, good afternoon. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, he has greeted you. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I was addressing you Mr Gordhan.  
Okay where are you today? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I beg your pardon? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Where are you? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I am at home. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay, and is there a reason why you did 
not grace us with your physical presence today? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   On medical advice. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Medical advice, okay.  Now I just want 
20 
to clarify this point that the Chair was dealing with now, 
effectively, your thesis is that Mr Moyane was not vetted 
by, let’s call it, State Capture motives in doing various 
things that you testified about in the Commission and 
elsewhere, correct? 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 46 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So, Chair, if I may clarify that, in 
my evidence before the Commission in November 2018 at 
paragraph 11 onwards, I described what is State Capture 
and the point I’m making in sum is that there are various 
activities that constitute, ultimately, to be defined as State 
Capture.  So we’re talking about two things, the first is a 
concept called State Capture which I clarified in my 
evidence before you in November 2018 and what history 
has taught and the South African lessons have taught us 
about activities that constitute, ultimately,  what became 
10 
known as State Capture.  So, if I look at the activities that 
were undertaken at the South African Revenue Service 
during Mr Moyane’s term of office those activities came to 
match the activities that fall under the definition of State 
Capture. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay, look, please if you are able to 
just answer yes or no when you agree with the proposition 
that 
will 
help 
us 
to 
save 
time. 
 
The 
question 
was…[intervenes]. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   When I can, Chair, I will certainly 
20 
say yes or no. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, please do. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   But where I think clarity is 
required, Chair, with your permission, I will add a line or 
two, it might help Mr Mpofu as well, thank you. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 47 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   No I don’t need your help Mr Gordhan, I 
will ask you questions, if the question is clear you must 
just answer yes or no.  Of course, if you want clarification 
the Chair will stop me if I try to block you.  I asked you a 
very simple question, your entire outlook is that Mr Moyane 
was motivated by a State Capture motive in performing his 
duties, that’s what you said in many affidavits, so a yes 
will do. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes, as I indicated earlier, 
10 
Chairperson. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you, now, you also said, and Mr 
Chaskalson led you to this that you say that Mr Moyane’s 
complaint that led to criminal charges was part of the State 
Capture motive, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   With the limited knowledge that 
was available then. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No, no fair enough, the point is that, you 
20 
were not really saying that it’s the charges that he laid 
against you per se but that his complaint, which led – it 
was his complaint that led to the criminal charges, there 
may have been other things but it triggered a process that 
led to the criminal charges, correct?  
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 48 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, so therefore the – and when he 
laid that complaint that was part of his official duties that 
he was performing, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Can you repeat that please? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   When he laid the complaint against 
those people at Brooklyn Police Station it was part of 
performing his official duties, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I don’t accept that. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Did he do it just as a person or as a 
10 
Commissioner of SARS? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well I think Mr Moyane is in the 
best position to explain himself when he gives his major 
evidence before the Commission, Chair. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well, okay, to your knowledge now – I 
accept that you say earlier you are not au fait with the 
facts.  To your knowledge now, you know that he laid that 
complaint in his capacity as Commissioner of SARS, 
correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you.  Now, therefore, the 
artificial line that is said drawn between what you call – 
whether in laying the criminal complaint or charges and I 
do understand that it was not against Mr Gordhan it’s 
against anyone but your view is that, in laying criminal 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 49 of 315 
 
complaint, Mr Moyane acted maliciously, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   As I said earlier Chair, that he was 
acting – that was one action in amongst many others that 
constituted, in my view, his contribution to the State 
Capture process. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you very much.  Okay, let’s go to 
B and also in laying the complaint, again, we can take out 
the words, against Mr Gordhan, we say against X, Y or Z, 
Mr Moyane was motivated wholly or in part or he sought to 
advance the objectives of State Capture, do you stand by 
10 
that?  That in laying the criminal complaint he was 
motivated wholly or in part or he sought to advance the 
objectives of State Capture, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   It’s correct in the context of all the 
other activities that he undertook yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, thank you and then the third one 
is, whether in laying the criminal complaint, again we take 
out the words, against Mr Gordhan, against those other 
people, Mr Moyane was abusing a legal process for his 
own personal goals that he had, either nothing – that had, 
20 
either nothing or little to do with a legitimate complaint 
relating to an alleged crime, do you also stand by that? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well, that’s not my formulation, 
the concept of personal goals, Chairperson, how does one 
draw the line which has mystified me between what one 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 50 of 315 
 
does as a person when holding a particular official position 
or any position and what one does by playing a role in that 
particular position.  So, I don’t know what the word, 
personal, means in that context but if you say that he as a 
person did certain things, yes, but I don’t know about what 
personal means. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No but, if you don’t know what personal 
goals are – these are your words Mr Gordhan, if you go to 
page 
TSM787, 
the 
one 
that 
you 
read 
out 
in 
front 
of…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just to confirm, we are still using the 
same Bundle, that was referred to? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   That’s correct Chair. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Sorry what number Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   TSM-787 it’s the one that you read out 
now to the Commission…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Actually, Mr Mpofu, we can just ignore 
TSM…[intervenes]. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   We just use the number. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The number ja. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the number? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   787. 
CHAIRPERSON:   787, okay, have you got it Mr Gordhan? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Again, Chair, this 22.4 is a 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 51 of 315 
 
paragraph that Mr Mpofu is referring to, if I’ve got it 
correctly, is that the one? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second, Mr Mpofu do you 
want 
to 
articulate 
your 
question 
again 
in 
relation 
to…[intervenes].  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, thank you Chair.  The witness said 
that he doesn’t know what personal mean, so I was just 
pointing out that this – the words he used in a statement 
under oath.  You said at 22.5, 
“I believe that Mr Moyane’s personal goals, while he 
10 
was 
SARS 
Commissioner, 
included 
the 
advancement of the State Capture project”, 
 
And you did that under oath, do you remember? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Ja, absolutely, so Chairperson can 
I first draw your attention to 22.4 in which I say the 
following, may I quote that Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you do that Mr Gordhan, Mr 
Mpofu maybe we should, just for completeness mention 
that in 22.5 personal goals is in quotes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright, Mr Gordhan you 
wanted to say something about 22.4? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So, to – for the benefit of the 
public as well, this is what I say, and of course affidavits 
are under oath, I think most people understand that and I 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 52 of 315 
 
quote, 
“To use the words of the Chairperson’s directions I 
therefore do mean that Mr Moyane! was motivated 
wholly or in part or he sought to advance the 
objectives of State Capture” and that “he was 
abusing a legal process for his own personal goals 
that had either nothing or little to do with a 
legitimate complaint relating to an alleged crime”.  
 
So, when you look at personal goals in that context 
it is a person who is advancing the objectives of State 
10 
Capture and the quotation, Mr Mpofu, is a quotation of the 
Chairperson so he should …[indistinct – interference on 
audio]. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Listen, I know what a quotation is, I’m 
saying to you, in those two paragraphs, you voluntarily 
adopted those words even though they were originally used 
by the Chairperson, nobody forced you to adopt them, you 
used them in, both, 22.4 and 22.5 and therefore you can’t 
tell us you don’t know what personal goals are, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So what I was doing here, Chair, 
20 
is in the context of 22.4 and 22.5 explaining that the 
personal goals in this context as described through the 
quotation referred to yourself, Chairperson, is in the 
context of advancing State Capture.  That’s the point I was 
making there but my earlier remarks were, if you like, in a 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 53 of 315 
 
more abstract sense. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Thank you Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, thank you very much.  The 
question, really was whether you stand by the statement in 
C which was, whether in laying a criminal complaint Mr 
Moyane was abusing a legal process for his own personal 
goals that had, either nothing or little to do with a 
legitimate complaint relating to an alleged crime and you 
stand by that? 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, I stand by the fact that Mr 
Moyane, in his position was advancing State Capture and 
that one of the activities in that process was to lay the 
complaint. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe, just to make sure I follow, what 
was your understanding of the reference to personal goals 
in the Chairperson’s directions? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Is that with reference to myself, 
Chairperson? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, in 22.4. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   It’s as I explained, Chairperson 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to make sure I understand 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 54 of 315 
 
what your own understanding was of what the Chairperson 
was referring to when he was referring to Mr Moyane’s 
personal goals. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So, I’m just drawing a distinction, 
Chairperson, between an abstract concept of how does one 
distinguish 
between 
personal 
goal 
and, 
if 
you 
like, 
professional goal that was part A.  Part B is with reference 
to 22.4 and 22.5 and there my understanding was, a 
person who advances of his own volition the objective to 
the State Capture as we know it today. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you Chair.  Chair, I just wanted, 
just for the sake of the record to correct you Chair.  The 
words that the witness was using in his affidavit were taken 
from the Chair ’s directive, not from the ruling, remember 
the affidavit came before the ruling. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Just for the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, was I the one who said ruling? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, you said when the Chair said in his 
20 
ruling, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that’s fine – ja it was from the 
directions yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you Chair.  Anyway the point is 
that you stand by all the sentiments expressed from A to E 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 55 of 315 
 
except of course the technicality that the charges were not 
laid directly against you but it was a complaint that led to 
the criminal charges, are we still together? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you.  Right, now, - so let us – 
apart from that, I really had hoped that we were going to 
start on a positive note Mr Gordhan which is on things that, 
I think we agree on.  You agree, and I know you gave a 
definition but you agree that this notion of State Capture is 
a political term or a South African term for crimes really, 
10 
crimes like corruption, fraud, money laundering and so on? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chairperson, this is not a South 
African 
term, 
State 
Capture 
has 
a 
long 
history 
in 
international literature on corruption etcetera that takes 
place largely through procurement measures and of course 
in paragraph 16 of my evidence, before you in November 
2018 I say the following and with your permission I want to 
quote it, 
“A useful conceptual framework for understanding 
events and the phenomenon of State Capture has 
20 
been developed by the group of academics who 
published The Betrayal of Promised Report and the 
recent book, The Shadow of State, the politics of 
State Capture.  It envisages various groupings that 
perform different roles in State Capture and pattern 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 56 of 315 
 
its networks”, 
 
And it goes on to – from 16.1 explain the key role 
players but if you look at the literature…[intervenes]. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Mr Gordhan…[intervenes]. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Let me just finish…[intervenes]. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Hello. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   May I just finish please. 
ADV MPOFU SC: If you can just answer my question, I 
don’t want your…[intervenes]. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I’m answering your question 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, the question is either you agree  
...[intervenes – speaking simultaneously 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  And the answer is …[indistinct] is 
not just a South African term, secondly…[intervenes]. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Do you agree that corruption or fraud or 
crimes like that, yes or no? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I think, Chairperson, it might be 
very useful if Mr Mpofu wants yes or no answers then he 
must ask one question at a time please. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   That’s one question, do you agree that 
20 
…[indistinct – parties speaking simultaneously] corruption 
and fraud. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on Mr Mpofu let him finish I don’t 
think he’s going to take long to finish what he was saying 
…[intervenes]. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 57 of 315 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I think he’s going to take long Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m not going to allow him to take long 
but just finish what you – how you were capturing State 
Capture as an international concept as you understand it 
Mr Gordhan, what was it? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Thank you Chair, all I wanted to 
say is that, it doesn’t only have South African origins it has 
international origins and it largely started with people 
working at the World Bank many years ago who observed 
similar phenomena elsewhere in the world and there’s a 
10 
famous author called Professor Hellmann who authored 
some of the text, that’s the first point I’m making.  The 
second point is, the answer is yes, it relates to, amongst 
other things corruption and related activity.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, okay just for your own edification, 
when I say South African term, I meant that it is used in 
the context of this Commission.  State Capture actually 
didn’t even come from the World Bank it came from a 
gentleman called Lamien[?] who advances the theory of 
capturing the State but that’s a discussion for another day 
20 
but as far as this Commission is concerned, do you agree 
that it relates to things like corruption, fraud and money 
laundering, yes? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Amongst other things yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And it involves, I think as you have 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 58 of 315 
 
said, stealing from the poor and if you steal, for example, 
money that was meant for a hospital or a school, literally it 
can lead to people dying, it’s a serious matter. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chair, I’m not sure whether that’s 
a statement or a question. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   It’s a question, you can say yes or no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just articulate it again, Mr Mpofu, the 
question. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   When such corruption, fraud and theft 
relates to, for example, let’s say stealing money that was 
10 
meant to build a hospital, we could say that State Capture 
is such a serious thing that it could lead to people actually 
dying or suffering.  In other words what I’m trying to say is, 
it’s a very serious matter, yes? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you and actually if you look at it 
in the – in its proper context it – that idea of stealing from 
the poor would be – particularly in a country with a history 
like ours, tantamount to treason, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I leave that to the lawyers, 
20 
Chairperson. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well, it’s a serious crime that, in many 
places, would even have a capital offence, in fact in other 
countries it does, correct, capital punishment? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Again, I leave that to the lawyers, 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 59 of 315 
 
Chairperson. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, well to your knowledge you don’t 
know that it’s a serious crime? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, it’s a terrible thing to do that’s 
why I imagine I mention …[intervenes]. 
ADV 
MPOFU 
SC: 
 
 
That’s 
not 
just 
for 
lawyers 
...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Can I answer, Chairperson or is 
Mr Mpofu going to do all the talking, with the Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja give your answer. 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   You don’t have to be arrogant Mr 
Gordhan. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   The question as I understand it 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   You don’t have to be arrogant, I’m not 
going to do all the talking you are the one who is being 
cross-examined, so you do the talking, if you’ll answer my 
questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Mpofu, Mr Gordhan, just give 
your answer. 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, what I’m saying, Chairperson 
is that Mr Mpofu is absolutely right, that State Capture but 
more importantly the activities that take place under this 
umbrella is a very serious matter and that is a matter that, 
as 
Deputy 
Chief 
Justice 
and 
Chairperson 
of 
this 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 60 of 315 
 
Commission you are charged with – to both investigate and 
evaluate both in terms of the actions taken by various 
people but also the consequences of the actions as well.  
So, clearly, in the South African context it’s very serious, 
whether 
the 
stealing 
happens 
at 
a 
Municipal 
level, 
Provincial level, National level or indeed in the private 
sector as well, thank you. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you very much and therefore 
when we make an accusation against somebody that they 
are mired or they are practitioners of State Capture, it’s a 
10 
very serious accusation because you’re accusing them of 
something that is, as you say, despicable, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well the formulation I used earlier, 
Chairperson 
is, 
that 
in 
this 
particular 
instance, 
the 
activities that took place at SARS under Mr Moyane was 
his contribution and those were my words as I recall them, 
earlier on to the phenomenon of State Capture and if I’m 
given the opportunity later I’ll explain what I mean but yes, 
it’s said in that context. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   You will be given an opportunity.   If you 
20 
just, please – it will help all of us, listen to the question 
and then answer it, I’ve not said anything about Mr Moyane 
yet, I will just now.  I’m saying, since you and I agree that 
State Capture is such a serious and despicable thing, to 
accuse someone of being a player or a practitioner of State 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 61 of 315 
 
Capture, then makes it a serious accusation, anyone, 
correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I imagine those are the people 
that must appear before this Commission and make their 
views known and be cross-examined, yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:    Is that ...[indistinct]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Mr Mpofu I will try my best to answer 
yes or no but it depends on the formulation of your question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The question… 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I have just given you my answer. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The question is whether an accusation that 
somebody was engaging in certain activities in pursuit of 
state capture is a serious accusation that – whether you 
agree that it is a serious accusation.  I imagine that you 
agree based on what you have said before? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Yes Chairperson as I have explained 
yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you very much.  And therefore such 
20 
a serious accusation is not to be likely made against a 
person even if you hate that person, correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even if? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  The last part of you said Mr Mpofu? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Even if you hate that person. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 62 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  The question or the proposition is 
such as an allegation is not an allegation that should be 
lightly made even if you hate that person. That is the – that 
is the – the question is whether you agree with that 
proposition? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Is the – the word preceding that 
person is it hate?  Did I hear you correctly? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  H-a-t-e. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hate ja. 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No I think there are two different 
issues here Chairperson. The first is yes it is a serious 
allegation, the second hate has got nothing to do with this.  
This is an objective exercise. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Now – okay in the – and the 
performance of that objective exercise it would be important 
given the seriousness that before you accuse someone of 
state capture you better have evidence, correct? 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No it could be evidence, it could be 
perception, it could be a conclusion.  For example the public 
might think that Person X is involved in state capture but it is 
a collection of information rather than evidence that they 
have and they well – could well draw that conclusion.  So in 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 63 of 315 
 
some instances it is information in other instances it might 
well be evidence. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Okay let me ask it maybe differently.  
Before you accuse someone under oath in a commission 
such as this or in statements of state capture being such a 
serious matter it would be better if you have evidence and 
not just relying on gossip, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No gossip is a terrible thing to rely 
on. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  And you agree that you should evidence? 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Oh there must be facts that are 
fitting the picture if you like. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Ja.   
MINISTER GORDHAN:  That you will base a conclusion on. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Okay sorry Mr Gordhan I do not know why 
you have a problem with such a simple thing.  If you accuse 
someone of a serious thing rape, murder, state capture 
under oath you better have evidence.  It is a simple thing.  
Yes? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Yes obviously you must provide facts 
20 
that lead to evidence being – the word evidence has legal 
connotations that is the only point I am making Chairperson.  
But all I am saying yes there must be a collection of facts 
and there will be other collections of information. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Otherwise known as evidence? 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 64 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I take your word for it. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you.  Okay now one of the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I see we are at one Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Well… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if you have one more question to ask 
before we adjourn that would be fine or one or two that is 
fine.  What do you … 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What would you like? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chair you know a cross-examiner’s one or 
10 
two questions can be – Chair I will concede when we get to a 
natural place I will indicate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Just on this topic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can take even ten minutes or so if that 
is… 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Oh good – good. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I just want to alert you. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  To alert me yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No Chair I will – in fact this thing I am just 
about to end it and then maybe we will stop even before the 
ten minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Okay I was saying again coming to the 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 65 of 315 
 
South African context one of the tell-tale signs of somebody 
involved in the kind of state capture activities that the 
Chairperson is investigating would be a meeting with 
Gupta’s, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I am not sure where that is going but 
… 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Do not worry about where it is going just 
answer the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just – for my benefit … 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Can you repeat the question for me 
10 
please so I can understand what you said? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Whilst in South Africa context one of 
the tell-tale signs that we use to determine that someone 
was involved in state capture is if they had a meeting or 
meetings with the Gupta’s or visited their compound.  These 
are some of the tell-tale signs. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  In visiting the compound might well 
be one of the tell-tale signs yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  I [talking over one another] that one. 
I knew you were going to go for that one.  Why are you 
20 
jumping the one of meeting the Gupta’s? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Because meet the word meeting 
means many things as I have explained in my affidavit.  
What are the – ja my statement in November 2018 that there 
were 
for 
example 
New Age 
breakfasts 
that 
Ministers 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 66 of 315 
 
including myself attended once or twice. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Ja. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  When the President that was 
attending those in order to support him to answer questions 
if questions arose in a particular portfolio. In the second 
instance if you walk into a room and a Gupta person is 
present and you obviously are told here is so and so and 
then you meet the person.  But there are other instances 
where you conspire with the Gupta’s.  That is a very different 
category. 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No Mr Gordhan please it will help you, me 
and the Chair if you listen to the question.  I am not talking 
about you about meetings with – at dinners or what have 
you.  I am saying do you agree or do you disagree that in 
South Africa one of the tell-tale signs that we use is to 
determine if a person had meetings with the Gupta’s is that 
one of the tell-tale signs – not the only one – yes or no? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  In depends on the context. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Alright maybe let me put it this way.  In 
Parliament you were asked many – by the DA if you had met 
20 
with the Gupta’s, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Yes 
ADV MPOFU SC:  And you said you never met with them, 
correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  In a particular context yes. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 67 of 315 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  Now all I am saying is I am not 
getting there now I am saying one of the reasons that the DA 
or any opposition parties would ask you that question it is 
because one of the tell-tale signs of people being involved in 
state capture in South Africa is meeting with the Gupta’s.  
They were not asking you just for fun.  Correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Well I do not know what their 
intentions are the DA must come and give their own 
evidence. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  What do you think – what do you think 
10 
their intentions were when you answered their question? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I am not here to speculate. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Okay well I am putting to you then that 
they were asking you because of what you are avoiding to 
answer which I do not understand but one of the signs is 
meeting with the Gupta’s. But let us move on.  So the – you 
made – you had to change your statement to commission to 
reflect that you did meet with the Gupta’s correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Yes the reminder that I received from 
my then Chief of Staff who is currently is the DG of the 
20 
Treasury Mr Mogajane. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  So like Mr Nene before you you had 
“forgotten” that you had met with the Gupta’s, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I am not interested in any analogies. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Okay that is fine forget the analogy.  You 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 68 of 315 
 
had “forgotten” that you had met with the Gupta’s a number 
of times, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  There is no quote – unquote as far 
as I am concerned I did not remember I was reminded and I 
frankly disclosed that in Parliament subsequently and to the 
commission when I had the opportunity. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No Mr Gordhan. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  There is quote or unquote forgotten. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Okay.  No let us just be serious for a 
moment. 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  It is for emphasis. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No that is fine.  You answered the 
question of the DA and you said you did not meet with the 
Gupta’s correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Well I cannot precise formulation of 
the question but that is [inaudible]. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes but you denied.  I am not interested in 
the [inaudible]. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Chairperson perhaps during lunch 
time… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry  
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Can we just – Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I do require some guidance from 
you. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 69 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  If you could reflect on this please.  
When I am answering a question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I expect to be given the opportunity 
to answer and not be interrupted 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I was – I was about to say Mr 
Mpofu must let you finish your answer.  But I think we must 
take the lunch break now Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No Chair can I just finish this – just the 
10 
thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How much time will be required? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Two minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Two minutes? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I am just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But just remember when he answers. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Ja, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let him finish and when you ask questions 
20 
he will also let you ask ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Ja he must also let me finish. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  That is fine Chair.  We are trying to rush 
against the clock here. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 70 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no that is fine. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  And the reason why I am asking questions 
like this Mr Gordhan is to make it easier because when I 
frame the question it is because I do not want you know a 
long contract it is a way of trying to focus the cross-
examination but that is fine.  The – I am sorry if I interrupted 
you.  The question I was asking you is that the – you denied 
meeting the Gupta’s.  I agree you cannot remember the 
exact formulation but when you answered the DA you denied, 
correct? 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you.   
MINISTER GORDHAN:  [Inaudible] 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Oh I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on yes.   
ADV MPOFU SC:  Carry on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Carry on Mr Gordhan. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Do you want to clarify that yes? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I have said Chairperson I have said 
yes and I have said that is on the record. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  And as I said previously I had no 
recollection of anybody from the Gupta family being present 
when I met Mr Ambani during that time.  My Chief of Staff 
when I formulate – former Chief of Staff when I formulating 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 71 of 315 
 
the statement for the November presentation to you 2018 he 
reminded me of this and I disclosed it to you. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  If I wanted to hide it I could have 
hidden it. But I disclosed it voluntarily. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  You see... 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Just for the record.  Thank you. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  You see Chairperson really I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Ask the Chairperson to please control this 
10 
witness.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV 
MPOFU 
SC: 
 
Because 
if 
he 
is 
going 
to 
give 
unnecessary verbiage on top of the answer then I am going 
to be forced to interrupt him. 
 CHAIRPERSON:  No ask your next question Mr Mpofu so we 
can break for lunch. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you.  When you did your first 
20 
statement to the commission you still had forgotten meeting 
the Gupta’s, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I will check that during my lunch 
time and come back to you. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  But when you did your statement you have 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 72 of 315 
 
been reminded you say? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  As I said I will check during lunch 
time and come back to you. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Alright.  Now – okay when we come back 
Chair I am going to start with a theme but if I may – if the 
Chair allows me just to ask two questions? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  So as just to – again in the line of – let us 
try to deal with the issues that you and I agree with.  You 
would agree that the relationship between and Mr Moyane 
10 
can be described as one of hostility, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Not necessarily. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Those were your words Mr Gordhan.  In 
your evidence you said it was the evidence that… 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Yes it later resulted – later resulted. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  So that is [inaudible]. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Chair as I was saying there was no 
hostility. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am sorry Mr Gordhan are you 
saying it later resulted in hostility? 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Ja I do not know who is guilty of 
verbiage here Chair but we will leave that aside for now.  My 
response is very simple that I do not – I do not know Mr 
Moyane at all except that he was present at some meetings 
and he happened to wear the correctional services uniform 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 73 of 315 
 
at these meetings prior to him being appointed as the SARS 
Commissioner.  So why must I have hostility against 
somebody or should that person have hostility against me 
whom I did not actually know.  What I am saying secondly 
and very clearly and emphatically is that as events unfolded 
during my tenure as Minister of Finance and his tenure 
during 
that 
time 
as 
SARS 
Commissioner 
hostilities 
developed. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright. 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Thank you. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  So – so when you said not necessarily 
what did you mean if the answer is yes?  Yes hostilities 
developed.  Not necessarily what kind of answer was that? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   It is exactly what I have explained 
to the Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – yes Mr Gordhan I think there is 
something technically wrong you – we are not getting all the 
words from your answer.  Do you want to repeat your 
answer? 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  So I said earlier Chairperson before 
Mr Mpofu repeated his mind – can you hear me clearly 
Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes we can hear you. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Right.  So I was saying that I did not 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 74 of 315 
 
know Mr Moyane prior to his appointment as the SARS 
Commissioner.  That I knew who he was because he used to 
be for example what we had – what he call cabinet lekgotla. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I think we heard that part. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Wearing a correctional services 
uniform sometimes and I knew of him in that context. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we heard that Mr Gordhan. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Firstly.  Secondly … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The part was what you meant when you 
said not necessarily. 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I am coming to that now Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I am coming to that now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Which I have already said earlier on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  But for your benefit I am repeating 
it.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  The second point that I am making is 
20 
that you know in our first set of exchanges there was no 
hostility.  The third point that I am making is that during his 
tenure 
as 
the 
SARS 
Commissioner 
which 
SARS 
Commissioner is accountable to the Minister of Finance 
hostilities did develop. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 75 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh.  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  You do not want to answer the question I 
take it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we will – I thing we will – let us 
break if you want to proceed after lunch then you should  
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes we can break at that point – if you – if 
you might use the lunch break also to think about please 
answering 
my 
question 
what 
did 
you 
mean 
by 
not 
necessarily.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we are going to take the lunch … 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Chairperson – Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Before you adjourn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  May I address you please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja – yes, yes you may. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I do not think Mr Mpofu is helping 
this particular set of exchanges by throw away remarks like 
20 
that.  I have just taken the time to repeat twice what I 
actually meant and said.  And there are three elementary 
points.  Can you think about that as well.  Thank you 
Chairperson. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Well Mr Gordhan listen before you go.  
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 76 of 315 
 
The – I obviously you cannot have hostilities with someone 
you do not know.  We are not that infantile.  All I was asking 
you is whether when you did have a relationship with Mr 
Gordhan it was hostile.  I could not ask you about hostilities 
with somebody that you did not know.  Think about that. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Well I do not know what – Chair with 
great respect I do not know what Mr Mpofu has in mind. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Do not worry about what I have in mind. I 
will reveal it to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us do this.  Let us adjourn for 
10 
lunch and if Mr Mpofu wants to take this further or if you 
want to say something about it Mr Gordhan when we resume 
we will take it from there. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr Gordhan – the technical 
problems – he might not have heard me.  I see the picture is 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes it is frozen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  But when we – well I am sure when we 
come back I will – I will tell him what I said. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Namely. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  He is – not frozen now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I think it is – ja he will still frozen ja.  
Okay we are going to adjourn but he needs to hear what time 
we will come back. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 77 of 315 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can you hear me now Mr Gordhan?  No. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  He is still frozen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can you hear me?  No he is still frozen. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will – will somebody in the legal team 
tell him what time we are coming back?  We will – we will 
adjourn for lunch now and we will resume at quarter past two 
and if either Mr Mpofu or Mr Gordhan… 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Wants to… 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Does that mean my request was not 
exceeded of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  The request I made in chambers of a 
shortened lunch break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh no, no you remember you said either 
that or we end later. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  [Inaudible]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I said we will end later if necessary ja. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:  So we still take an hour? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Gordhan are you back? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Yes I can hear you Chair. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 78 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you hear everything that we have been 
saying because … 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because from our side you were frozen 
like.  You did hear everything? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No, no I can hear you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is alright. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I can hear you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  We will resume at quarter 
past two.   
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will take the lunch adjournment.  We 
adjourn. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you Chairperson. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES:    
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Are you ready Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you ready Mr Gordhan? 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you ready Mr Gordhan? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Mr Mpofu, your first hour will not end 
at half-past two.  It will end at quarter to.  Three and a 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 79 of 315 
 
second hour, we will end at quarter to four. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Quarter to four? 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I have added 15-minutes because we 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   We started a bit late. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Otherwise, let us try and make the best of 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...of the time. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And of course, on both sides, you will both 
try and give each other time to assess whatever you are 
saying. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Maybe I can say this to 
Mr Gordhan.  While, on the one the hand, you may clarify 
and answer that you give in order to make sure that maybe a 
yes or no answer does not give a wrong impression. 
20 
 
Your counsel is here as well.  I will give an opportunity 
after Mr Mpofu has finished to re-examine.  That means, to 
ask you questions arising out of the cross-examination. 
 
And in doing so, she will have kept an eye on some of 
your answers where she might think that your answer might 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 80 of 315 
 
not have given the kind of perspective you would have liked 
to give.   
 
So 
when 
she 
asks 
you 
questions 
during 
the 
re-
examination, some of the things that might not have come 
out clearly during cross-examination, she will seek to get 
those to come out. 
 
So I just mention that so that you understand. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, I do Chair.  And I will try to 
assist in everywhere possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Be as brief as possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Sometimes it is not possible, as you 
know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Ja-no ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Answering yes or no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   And I also want to add Chair 
because I am not here to hide anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I have nothing to hide. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So let us proceed and I will do the 
best I can. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 81 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   And I just hope that counsel is 
cooperating in that regard as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  Mr Mpofu. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION BY ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you, 
Chair.  Thank you for that Mr Gordhan.  Ja, what normally 
helps Mr Gordhan.  If there is an answer to a question, you 
need to answer the question.  And of course, sometimes, as 
you say, yes or no is not enough but you can say yes and 
then want to clarify it. 
 
So as long as I am happy that you have answered the 
10 
question, now and again you will have - obviously, you might 
need to clarify.  Thank you. 
 
Alright.  So we were at a point where we both agreed 
that, at least, the relationship was defined by hostility, at 
least at the point, at the relevant that we are talking about, 
which is the period that Mr Moyane was at SARS.  Correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes, but I think it is important Chair 
to add that there was going to be, in fact, it started from 
Mr Moyane’s end. 
 
When I looked at my statements over lunch and it was 
20 
insinuated that when I was Minister of COGTA and attorneys 
on behalf of Mr Moyane began to write to me and demand 
that I present evidence in the investigations that were taking 
place at SARS and there were one or two other instances as 
well, including the non-accountability which I am sure we will 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 82 of 315 
 
discuss in time. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  Okay.  No, we will get to mister...  
That is your version.  We will get to Mr Moyane’s version 
where the hostility came from, from his point of view.  And I 
will put it to you and you can agree or deny. 
 
But anyway.  We know that, at least from your side, part 
of this hostilities were caused by your belief that he was part 
of State Capture.  Correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   By that time, the notion of State 
Capture was just beginning to emerge.  So I cannot answer 
10 
to that question.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, at some stage...  Maybe, let me break 
it down.  At some stage, you believed that he was conniving 
with some people to have you removed.  Correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   It was part of a pattern and he 
appeared to have a role in it, yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  And you also believed that he was...  
Okay.  No, we will come to that.  Let me put it this way.  The 
line we note from your statements, the genesis of the alleged 
hostility and its connection.   
20 
 
I am not so interested so much in, you know, in some 
petty issues that might have a reason.  I am more interested, 
as you might understand, insofar as the hostilities were 
related to the allegations of State Capture.   
 
So if I refer to the other issues, it is just the context.  
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 83 of 315 
 
But let me tell you up front that Mr Moyane will – his version 
of where the hostility came from, has got five elements.   
 
Firstly, he phased it as what was caused by your, what 
one might general arrogance towards him.  And then he 
says, secondly it was caused by petty jealousies about his 
role at SARS.   
 
And as I have said, those are issues.  I will touch on it 
very briefly but those are not the core issues.   
 
And then thirdly, he says it was also – it originated from 
your racism towards him specifically and maybe towards 
10 
African people in general.   
 
And then fourthly, he says it was motivated – and this is 
where we come closer to the meat – he says it was 
motivated 
by 
your 
desire 
to 
deflect 
from 
your 
own 
involvement in State Capture and corruption.   
 
And then fifthly, he says it was because he blew the 
whistle on the last or failed(?) or illegal activities and corrupt 
activities that you left behind at SARS including the issue of 
the Rogue Unit and the alleged early retirement of Mr Pillay.   
 
You understand those five issues?  And of course, I am 
20 
sure you do not agree with them but you understand where 
he comes from? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe before he – Mr Gordhan indicates  
Mr Mpofu, I just want to make sure I have got them right.  I 
did not hear the first one. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 84 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Was what we call general arrogance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   General arrogance? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Arrogance, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thinking highly of himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I got number two.  The indication of 
jealousies. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Jealousies, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Number three racism ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Racism. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...on the part of Mr Gordhan towards him, 
that is Mr Moyane in particular, and maybe African in 
general.  Is that right? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   African.  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Number 
three 
was, 
motivated 
by 
Mr Gordhan’s desire deflect from...? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   To deflect from his own involvement in 
State Capture and corruption. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And the fifth was one, he blew the 
20 
whistle on...? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   On the illegal and corrupt activities that 
he left behind at SARS including the Rogue Unit and the 
alleged early retirement of Mr Pillay.  And maybe Chair, just 
to put context.  That last part, it related to the charges or 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 85 of 315 
 
complain that Mr Moyane laid at the police station. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Which is the core of the – which, 
according to Mr Gordhan, motivated the State Capture. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   That is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Gordhan, I think Mr Mpofu was asking 
the question whether, even if you do not agree with these, 
you understand that these are Mr Moyane’s reasons why 
hostility developed between the two of you. 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well, I do not think I am here to 
understand Mr Moyane, with due respect Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Let me first emphatically say, that 
all of those assertions have no foundations whatsoever. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   And to now throw around notions 
such as racism and my alleged involvement in corruption is 
part of the fact news narrative that right now seemed to be 
populating all over the show.   
20 
 
So I repeat.  I emphatically deny all of those assertions 
and they are merely a cover up Mr Chairperson for what 
Mr Moyane really did. 
 
And Judge Nugent, the first in his report when he says 
the day that Mr Moyane took office, were the calamity for 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 86 of 315 
 
SARS.  That is the implication(?).   
 
The transition of SARS from what it was and what it 
became, were brought about by the events that are shocking.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   We think that what occurred in the 
early described as a premeditated offense against SARS 
from Mr Moyane to seize SARS.  Those are not my words.  
Those are the words of the SARS Commission as you have 
referred to it.  So I deny any charge of arrogance.  I deny...  
What do I have to be jealous about with Mr Moyne? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   That is ...[indistinct] references.  
[Transmission distorted - speaker is not clear.] 
 
Thirdly, as far as racism is concerned.  For the last 50-
years since joining the congress movement and affiliating 
with the Freedom Charter. 
 
As 
I 
have 
pointed 
out 
in 
my 
statement 
in 
November 2018, I am emphatically a non-racialist and my 
record proves that, of course.  All sorts of stones will be 
thrown at me but I suppose that is part of the course. 
20 
 
As far as negativity towards African people is concerned.  
The evidence is completely to the contrary, both within SARS 
given my tenure and elsewhere.   
 
That this is a deflection from my role in State Capture.  
Well, again Chairperson.  I must say that Mr Moyane must 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 87 of 315 
 
come along and say that on the record in an affidavit before 
the Commission. 
 
And let all of those who have an interest in cross-
examining him, because he is the implicated person here, to 
have an opportunity to test his evidence, wherever that might 
be and you might or might not join the queue.   
 
Blowing the whistle.  There is nothing to blow the whistle 
about.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am sorry ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   The so-called has been repeatedly 
10 
shown to be legal by various senior counsel at the bar in 
Johannesburg.  Secondly, Mr Pillay’s issue.   
 
It has gone through all sorts of processes including 
court processes currently, I believe.  And there is nothing 
illegal that was done and that is also proven for the record.   
 
Those who want to believe the contrary, are welcome to 
do so but the facts do not support them at this point in time.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So I note what Mr Mpofu has said.  
Let us get on to the next question. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mpofu, I know you had not asked as 
yet what he has to say about this.  You asked him whether 
he noted them, so to speak ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, and you even repeated my question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 88 of 315 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   But now we got a lecture. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But in any event.  He was going to 
have to deal with the question ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   He was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...of what he needs to say.  So 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   He will deal with it ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay you may proceed. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay.  Now you and I – you have agreed 
that – so certainly you are saying that you are denying that 
10 
arrogance, self-opinionated, jealous, racist, who is corrupt 
and has a tendency to harm whistle-blowers who report on 
your unlawful activities?  You deny that? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Absolutely. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you.  Now, you and I have 
agreed...  Well, Mr Moyane, unlike you, will back up these 
accusations with evidence, as you correctly say, when he 
testifies. 
 
And just to assist you.  If you read Mr Moyane’s very 
first affidavit in December 2018.  He, under oath, offered to 
20 
give evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   2019, I think? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, 2018. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   It was after Mr Gordhan’s.... 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 89 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Mister... and repeatedly, even myself here 
on this podium - well, not this very podium – he repeatedly 
said that he will gladly assist the Commission when required 
to do so.  There is not even a need for a summons.  He will 
come here willingly.  So let us put that to bed. 
 
So you have agreed that it is important not to go around 
making serious accusations when you cannot back them up?  
10 
Correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, no.  There is enough evidence 
before... Chair, if I may respond?  There are lots of 
evidence.  I think one is the extensive work done by Judge 
Nugent to know what the evidence is in respect of SARS.  
There is also lots of evidence in relation the so-called 
complaint.  And what is interesting Chair is, I looked at my 
file ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on Mr Gordhan.  Hang on Mr 
Gordhan.  I think both of you have got something wrong.  Mr 
20 
Mpofu, I think from previous answers, I think it is clear that 
Mr Gordhan takes the view – he did say – that you cannot go 
– make serious allegations unless you have got facts. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, that is all I was asking Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and ...[intervenes]  
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 90 of 315 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   So what did I do wrong? 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that, from previous questions, that is 
clear.  But also Mr Gordhan, you are not answering the 
question that – the question was more general.  But you 
were 
seeking 
to 
answer 
the 
question 
in 
relation 
to 
Mr Moyane.   
 
So I think Mr Mpofu was just looking for an agreement 
on the general propositions.  But I am saying that, I think 
you have already said before that nobody should make 
serious allegations against somebody unless they have got 
10 
facts.  Is that correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   And you come in hard but I mean, 
that was the purpose of the evidence that I presented before 
you in November 2018.  And that is further enforced 
Chairperson by the findings of the Nugent Commission.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but what I am saying is.  His question 
was general and not relating to Mr Moyane so - but as I say, 
you had made it clear in regards to his response to earlier 
20 
questions, that you accept the proposition that once should 
not make serious allegations against somebody unless they 
have got facts.  So I think we can move on Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Well, I just do not 
want that the Chair says I did wrong because ...[intervenes]  
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 91 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   ...after that, I said:  Do you and I agreed 
that it is important not to go around and making serious 
allegations when you cannot back them up? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I thought you wanted him to answer 
again, whereas previous ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, I am talking... because we are 
coming back from lunch now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   To gear(?) up from my next question. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   That is why Chair, with respect, one 
sometimes does not know where – what Mr Mpofu really 
wants an answer to because he starts by saying Mr Moyane 
is willing to give evidence and he ends somewhere else.  So 
if he could customise his questions better, it will make it 
easier to answer them.  Thank you. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us do our best.   
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Ja.  No, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us do our best, ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you Mr Gordhan for trying to help 
me on how to ask you questions.  So the question is – was 
very simple, actually.  You and I have agreed that it is 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 92 of 315 
 
important not to go around making serious allegations when 
you cannot back them up.  Yes, no? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   As a general proposition, yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you.  And that is when you do so 
under oath, it is more than just not a good idea.  It is also 
illegal because it would be a crime or perjury, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I note what you say. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Do you agree or do you not agree?  If 
you...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I am not a lawyer.  So I am not 
10 
going to agree or disagree.  I note what you say. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   You do not know the importance of taking 
an oath before God? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I have affirmed right at the 
beginning of this proceedings Chairperson.  I am not sure 
what Mr Mpofu is pursuing here. 
ADV 
MPOFU 
SC: 
 
 
Okay. 
 
I 
am 
saying 
that 
if 
you...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I took an affirmation.  What else 
does Mr Mpofu wants? 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I asked the question here Mr Gordhan.  
You are just a witness.  So just chill.  Can you wait for the 
question, okay? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am saying to you.  If you asked – if you 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 93 of 315 
 
make statements that you cannot back up in – under oath, 
you might be exposing yourself to the crime of perjury.  Yes 
or no? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   As far as I am concern, there is 
enough evidence around.  There is no issue of perjury.  
Thank you. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay, I will not go back again.  The Chair 
explained this to you many times. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it is...  Ja, it was a general 
proposition. 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think you can move on. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I will Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I will give up on that answer.  So but you 
do also agree that it is the height of arrogance to go around 
accusing people without evidence? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chairperson, I need your guidance 
here.  Are we here to engage in theory or are we actually – I 
am here to answer questions in the evidence that I presented 
20 
before you in November 2018?  Could I be guided by you, 
please? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, sometimes Mr Gordhan, counsel will 
ask question of a general nature in order to get an 
understanding of your own view what is right and what is 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 94 of 315 
 
wrong and so on before coming to the evidence with regard 
to specific events.   
 
So sometimes questions are of a general nature just to 
understand your own values, your own understanding of 
certain things in general without being specific.  And at a 
certain stage, he might then be specific to certain things.   
 
So when Mr Mpofu asks questions, you just always bear 
in mind whether you understand it to require just a general – 
to be a general question or whether it is specific.   
 
And where you are not sure, feel free to say:  Can I get 
10 
clarification on this question?   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Or ask me to repeat the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or ask him to repeat.  But I think, maybe 
just repeat the question Mr Mpofu.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  Do you agree or do you not agree 
that it is the height of arrogance to go around accusing 
people of serious offenses without evidence? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   That is now all the questions 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   To anybody, yes. 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chairperson ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Any person. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For anybody.  Not necessarily you.  For 
anybody to do that.  So it is a general proposition. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well, if it is a general proposition, 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 95 of 315 
 
let us say yes for now until we know where it is going. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  Thank you. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well, maybe to assist you Mr Gordhan.  
You yourself were a victim of this view.  Remember, that you 
are actually on some, what you call the intelligence report 
and that caused you a lot of anguish.  Do you remember 
that? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   There have been so many fake 
ones.  So one does not know which one you are referring to.  
10 
But again, as a general proposition, as the Chair says, I 
have been the subject of various forms of what you have 
described.  So yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  And that is what I am saying.  It is 
wrong to do that without evidence, for someone to say 
Mr Gordhan is wrong.  [Indistinct] [Speaker is not clear.] to 
National Security or whatever without any evidence.  That is 
painful and wrong.  Correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Generally, yes.  When it happens. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you.  Ja, now, that is the point I 
20 
want to make.  And that is if you...  The proposition I want to 
put to you is, that you have gone around accusing every 
public official who has ever made an adverse decision 
against you as a practitioner of State Capture without a 
shred of evidence.  Would you agree with that statement? 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 96 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay.  You have no evidence that 
Mr Moyane was part of State Capture, do you? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   As I said Chair ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Sorry Mr Gordhan.  Sorry to interrupt you.  
In the mode of what – the way Mr Chaskalson was putting 
the questions to you.  You have no personal evidence known 
to you that Mr Moyane was part of State Capture, apart from 
gossip? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on.   
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well, I am surprised ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you answer Mr Gordhan. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mpofu, if you say it in the context of a 
particular formulation, you might wish to go to that page so 
that he can also have a look. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes.  No, no ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But if it is not important. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, Chairperson.  I am not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.   
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am not...  I am paraphrasing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am not quoting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Just repeat. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   In fairness you Mr Gordhan, because of 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 97 of 315 
 
what has exchanged, I will repeat the question.  You have no 
evidence, direct or indirect, that Mr Moyane was part of 
State Capture? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, I do. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   You do? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Good.  Do you have evidence that 
President Zuma was part of State Capture or corruption? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   That is not a relevant matter here. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Answer the question.  It is not for you to 
10 
talk about relevance.  Answer the question.  You are just a 
witness.  Do you have ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   That is not the point.  Chair 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Do you have any ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I do not think ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Listen.  You have to answer the question.  
I cannot be doing this.  Otherwise, we are not going to finish 
today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on Mr Mpofu.  Bearing in mind the 
20 
scope 
of 
today’s 
evidence. 
 
I 
am 
not 
sure 
whether 
allegations about whether Mr Zuma was part of State 
Capture, whether it is part of what should be ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   It is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Unless you ...[intervenes]  
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 98 of 315 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, let me explain Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You just wait...  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You will indicate and why. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well, according to the Gordhan theory on 
the State Capture issue.  Mr Moyane who was appointed by 
President Zuma, appointed him, amongst other things, to 
capture the National Treasury.   
 
And 
he 
gave 
evidence 
in 
this 
Commission 
about 
Mr Moyane 
was 
appointed 
by 
President Zuma. 
 
And 
10 
obviously, the – and there are many passages I will refer you 
if you want Chair.   
 
Where the link is made between the alleged disrespect 
and all that, owing to the fact that Mr Moyane had these 
connection in high places.   
 
So Mr Moyane, in that analogy, is – let us call it one of 
the foot soldiers that the kingpin is former President Zuma.  
So if the kingpin – if you have no evidence on the kingpin, 
then it is unlikely to have evidence on the foot soldiers.   
 
That is where I am going with this.  So it is relevant 
20 
directly to Mr Moyane.  Do you have or do you not have that 
evidence? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not sure...  Mr Chaskalson, do you 
have something to say and Ms Le Roux?  Let me just... 
ADV CHASKALSON:   Chair, I do have a concern about this 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 99 of 315 
 
for a different reason, which is... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON:   And I do think it goes quite a long way 
away from the Terms of Reference.  And normally, one might 
grant some latitude but there is a very different concern 
here, which is, Mr Mpofu is actually inviting the witness to 
make a serious of allegations against President Zuma or 
former President Zuma, who himself has given no notice of 
that line of cross-examination.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
10 
ADV CHASKALSON:   And I am not sure that that is the 
process that we should... 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV CHASKALSON:   It is not just a question of latitude of 
cross-examination.  It is also to a third party who would not 
been appraised of Rule 3.3. rights and the like. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Ms Le Roux...  Okay, let me 
hear Ms Le Roux but they should just sanitise before you 
...[intervenes]  
MS LE ROUX:   Chair, I will not touch anything.  So we do 
20 
not need to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright. 
MS LE ROUX:   Chair, we do object to the expansion of the 
scope, not only because of the impact it has on Mr Zuma’s 
rights but also because my learned friend, since the lunch 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 100 of 315 
 
adjournment, has mentioned things about the so-called 
Rogue Unit, about racism and arrogance and acrimony about 
bias and hostility.   
 
These are all topics that you ruled that he did not have 
leave to cross-examine on.  And so we do need to ensure 
that the questions actually cover the five questions that you 
gave 
legal, 
which 
is 
whether 
Mr 
Moyane 
as 
SARS 
Commissioner advanced State Capture and whether, when 
he laid criminal charges, he was advancing the State 
Capture.   
10 
 
And because otherwise, we are going to undo your two 
rulings and that is the concern that I have.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well...  Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, Chairperson, yes.  Look, I am not 
going to go to war on ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   On this one. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   ...on Mr Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   But I am saying.  The issue is directly 
connected.  And by the way.  Just to go back to what the 
20 
witness, when he denied that the issue of hostility and 
certain not...  He says in his statement at 127.4... 
CHAIRPERSON:   At what page? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   That is page 47, Chair.  I hope you are 
using the same bundle. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 101 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Which statement are you speaking 
of? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   That is the statement you made to the 
Commission in 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is not the clarificatory affidavit, is it? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, no, no.  Chair, it is the original 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   There is no 7.4.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   It is 127 ...[indistinct] [Speaker is not 
10 
clear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the paragraph? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, on what I have been given there is 
no 127.4. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay, let me read it out, Chair, just to 
save time.  It says: 
“Mr Michael Hulley attempted to mediate the dispute 
on behalf of the former President Zuma.  However 
he, Mr Zuma, appeared reluctant to personally 
20 
intervene 
to 
end 
the 
hostility 
and 
lack 
of 
accountability 
from 
Mr 
Moyane 
evident 
in 
our 
relationship.” 
Ja, so this was part – this is just one of the areas where 
there is a relationship made between Mr Zuma’s alleged 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 102 of 315 
 
inaction, so to speak.  I think even the Chair commented 
later as to was there any intervention from Mr Zuma and 
the witness said no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes …[intervenes] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   But I can …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I prefer your attitude that you are not 
going to go on war on this one, ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, I will not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Because otherwise we are just going to 
10 
be waylaid again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja, let us move on, ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   You have no evidence that Mr Moyane 
was part of that corruption.  You said you do have.  What is 
that evidence? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   You might want to look at the 
report of the Commission, Chair, by Judge Nugent. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, if I were you I would stay away from 
20 
the Commission chaired by Judge Nugent, I am saying 
before …[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   You are not me, with due respect. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, I am not you, thank God.  I am 
saying that …[intervenes] 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 103 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Thank God …[intervenes] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   The Commission of Judge Nugent came 
in 2018, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I do not know the precise date, 
Chair. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well, I can tell you, it was in May/June 
2018.  Before that you did not think that Mr Moyane – or 
actually, the report came even later in October/November.  
Before that he did not think Mr Moyane part of state 
capture. 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   As I explained earlier, Chair, so 
we seem to be going around the block on the same 
questions but let me answer that.  I said earlier on that the 
real hostilities at the beginning I place at the door of Mr 
Moyane.  However, counsel was briefed in this regard.  He 
is the one who initiated what I refer to as the letter from 
his attorneys demanding certain things of me, firstly. 
 
Secondly, post my appointment on the 13 or 14 
December 2015 back as the Minister of Finance it is he 
who says that in respect of leave forms he will submit them 
20 
to the Presidency.  If he wanted time off he will discuss it 
at the Presidency.   
When asked for certain types of information it would 
be not available.  So there was on the question of the 
operating model, which I referred to earlier on, I said let us 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 104 of 315 
 
review it and let me understand it, he went ahead with the 
appointments. 
 
On the question of bonuses being paid, I said hold 
it, I think it was a Friday, let us discuss it again on 
Monday, he went ahead later that afternoon and instructed 
that those bonuses be paid.  When he was challenged by 
the Auditor-General, who passed away recently, on that 
particular question he threatened to take the Auditor-
General to court.   
 
Now those are clear elements of evidence of 
10 
somebody who is basically a Director General and operates 
at that level within government is basically saying I am not 
going to respect your office, not me, as a person, the 
office, I am not going to cooperate with you.  On an 
elementary thing such as leave. 
 
When Mr Nene was the Minister of Finance his 
leave forms were submitted to the Ministry of Finance for 
approval.  As soon as I was appointed he said no, I will get 
my leave from the Presidency, I report to the Presidency. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, but I …[intervenes] 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So that is [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   This is not what the question was. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well, does not rely – no, may I 
finish please?  It does not rely upon Judge Nugent 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 105 of 315 
 
…[intervenes] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, do not finish unless I have got 
another question.  Do you remember what the question 
was, with due respect, Mr Gordhan? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   You asked whether there is 
evidence. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   There is evidence. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   That is not the question I was asking 
you, I knew you had forgotten the question, you are just 
10 
rambling on. 
MINISTER 
GORDHAN: 
 
 
Chairperson, 
Chairperson 
…[intervenes]  The question was, before Mr Nugent – 
before Mr Nugent was aboard did you think Mr Monyane 
was part of state capture or not?  Got nothing to do with 
leave forms.  Yes or no? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Gordhan, you wanted to say 
something while Mr Mpofu was speaking. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Ja, well the answer is yes, 
evidence 
of 
refusing 
to 
account 
within 
the 
normal 
20 
framework that governed – operates with, by an individual 
who subsequently does whatever the Nugent Commission 
found which - some of which I referred to in relation to 
doing away with – destroying entities that were crucial to 
tax compliance which in fact is directly related to whether 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 106 of 315 
 
poor people have hospitals, clinics or not at the end of the 
day.  So that is my first point. 
 
The second point, Chair, that I was going to raise 
earlier on is am I expected to return in kind the kind of 
comments Mr Mpofu is now allowing himself to make about 
rambling on.  I am not rambling on, I am very precise about 
what I am saying. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Precise?  Okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chairperson, with respect… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Mr Mpofu.  Yes, continue Mr 
10 
Gordhan. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So all I am saying is can you 
leave that for the theatre later and can you stick to 
questions which I am ready to answer. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay and can you stick to the answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let him testify. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Do you – honestly, do you remember 
the question, Mr Gordhan? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   You asked for examples of 
evidence of state capture.  I gave you one set of instances. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   If you want go back to my initial 
evidence before the Commission at paragraphs 9 onwards 
where I make reference to state capture and where there 
are examples of the classic signs of state capture and you 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 107 of 315 
 
will find that there is a correlation between what happened 
at the Revenue Service and what the state capture concept 
attempts to capture. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   And that is, get rid of good people. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja, okay …[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   The [indistinct] 06.53 that actually 
work.  Give, for example, VAT refunds to friends and 
family. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Chairperson, you have to intervene 
10 
now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay …[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   You are asked me a question, I am 
responding to it. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   This is not the question I put.  
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] carry on with your 
own question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Gordhan, let Mr Mpofu say 
something about your answer whether you remember what 
the question was. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja.  Mr Gordhan, you know, the effect of 
what you are doing is that we are not going to finish this 
evidence today and we will have to come back because I 
am going to ask you these questions.  That is not – you 
answered that question, I will come back to it, about 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 108 of 315 
 
evidence, the effect of you going on like you are going is 
that you forget what I ask.  I am asking the question for the 
third time.  Before Judge Nugent’s report, which was late in 
October/November 2018, did you believe Mr Moyane was 
involved in state capture, yes or no? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   The indications were certainly 
there. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Did you believe that Mr Moyane was 
part of state capture before the Nugent report?  It is simple 
question, Mr Gordhan, really.  We cannot have – you want 
10 
to be comfortable [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chairperson, Chairperson… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Gordhan? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Can I respond? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.   
MINISTER GORDHAN:   In my statement at various stages, 
I am trying to find the right reference, I say at paragraph 
14 on page 8, 14, and I quote: 
“I must emphasise that my knowledge and my 
understanding of state capture like that of the rest 
20 
of the country evolved over time.” 
In other words, as one begins to see certain activities and 
certain actions being taken …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, hang on, Mr Gordhan.  The best 
way is to start by saying yes, I believed that Mr Moyane 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 109 of 315 
 
had participated in acts of state capture and that is what 
you believed before the Judge Nugent report or you start 
by saying no, at that time I did not believe so and then you 
be asked from when you started to believe he had taken 
part in state capture.  If you start the answer like that it 
helps to make it clear what the answer is and then if you 
need to clarify then you can clarify in due course. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, thank you for your guidance, 
Chair.  I actually said that in my own words, I said that I 
10 
certainly picked up activities and I gave examples of some, 
there are many others, which indicated that this was 
eventually what we call state capture of an institution 
known as the  South African Reserve Service.  Thank you, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I think it is not clear yet 
because Mr Mpofu’s question relates to – seeks to 
determine the time when you might have formed that belief.  
Was it before Judge Nugent’s report?  Maybe before that 
you suspected but it was not a belief.  Maybe the belief 
20 
came after or maybe the belief was there before the Judge 
Nugent report.  I think that is what he is very interested in. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Let me try to get the chronology 
right, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 110 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   If I – if you give me a minute? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Because recollecting when exactly 
some of these things happened is going to be a bit 
difficult. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well you …[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   But the notion of state capture, 
Chairperson, for example at the funeral of icon Ahmed 
Kathrada on the 29 March 2017 I think South Africans 
began to realise on the memorial thereafter where a 
10 
concept of connecting the dots began to actually emerge.  
So yes, I think the concept – the notion of state capture 
was beginning to gel prior to the Nugent report.  Thank 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but you are talking in general, you 
are not talking about yourself.  If you cannot remember as 
from when you started believing that Mr Moyane had 
pursued or was pursuing state capture at SARS then you 
say look, I cannot remember, I cannot remember from 
when.  But if you do remember you say it was from that 
20 
time. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well, that is what I attempted to 
do by looking at the chronology, Chair, so …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think what you read to me with regard 
to the funeral of Mr Kathrada… 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 111 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was more about what you think - you 
say the people in South Africa began to believe whereas 
the question is more about your belief. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, that is why I referred to the 
memorial, Chair, of the late Ahmed Kathrada which took 
place a day or two latter by Johannesburg City Hall when I 
referred to the concept of connecting the dots so that 
picture of what we eventually called state capture was 
certainly gelling in my mind at that point in time.  Whether 
10 
I called it state capture, I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but the gelling, was it a belief at 
that stage or was it something less than a belief, number 
one.  Number two, was it in relation – did it include a belief 
that Mr Moyane was one of the people who were pursuing 
the state capture agenda?  I think that is the important part 
that Mr Mpofu is trying to establish because I think he 
wants to know from when you began to believe that his 
client was engaged or had been engaged in acts of state 
capture. 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Certainly the activities that I 
began to see from 2016 personally at SARS when I was 
Minister of Finance led me to believe that Mr Moyane was 
engaging 
in 
activities 
that 
could 
be 
described 
as 
contributing to state capture. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 112 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright.  Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja.  So – okay, thank you, Chair.  I am 
grateful to you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, maybe I should say this.  I take 
that, Mr Gordhan, to mean that long before Judge Nugent’s 
reports, when you looked at those activities on the part of 
Mr Moyane you associated them with what you later 
understood to be state capture, is that right? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, no, Chair, that is not …[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   That is right..  That is right, 
10 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay, no, Chair, [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just formulate it.  Just formulate it the 
way you understand it, ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  It is very simple, actually, this 
should not have taken twenty minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   So the answer that you are giving is 
20 
that you became aware of Mr Moyane’s involvement in 
state capture around about 2016 and that is before the 
Nugent Commission, so the answer is yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 113 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, thank you. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you.  Now – so if that is the case 
then your belief about Mr Moyane’s involvement in state 
capture cannot be sources from the Nugent report which 
came two years later and the point I want to make is that 
the – and I want to come now to your favourite subject 
about leave forms and so on.  All that, the fact that he was 
not giving – asking you for leave and all that, in your mind 
means that he was involved in state capture.  Is that what 
you are really –is that your evidence? 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So, as I understand, Chair, Mpofu 
has asked two questions.  The first is in relation to what I 
have just said about my knowledge and impressions prior 
to the Nugent Commission. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Correct. 
MINISTER 
GORDHAN: 
 
 
And 
which 
the 
Nugent 
Commission’s report, both the interim report in particular 
and the final report, amplified in detail about the kind of 
damage as Judge Nugent described was done by Mr 
Moyane which is described as a calamity for SARS.   
 
20 
So that is the first response in relation to – so what 
the Judge Nugent report did, it amplified and gave in a lot 
more detail what really happened at SARS which I presume 
is the task that he was given. 
The second question is in relation to leave forms, 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 114 of 315 
 
etcetera.  Those administrative are merely one set of 
examples 
of 
the 
defiance 
and 
the 
hostility 
and 
accountability that Mr Moyane he had to the office of the 
Ministry of Finance.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, thank you.  What on earth has that 
got to do with state capture? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well, it has everything to do with 
it because part of – sorry, may I – have you finished your 
question?  
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, sorry, I thought you had finished 
10 
your answer.  Yes, what has it got to do with state capture? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, part of state capture is to take 
control of an institution either at a board level or CEO 
level, so this is a CEO level. 
 
Secondly, 
is 
to 
protect 
yourself 
from 
any 
interrogation or transparency in relation to the kind of 
damage that is caused within the institution, so the refusal 
to discuss the operating model, the question of bonuses all 
add up to that kind of refusal. 
 
And the third is to then go about repurposing an 
20 
institution or parts of the institution.  So generally, for 
example, in state owned entities, the repurposing took 
place in two broad centres, procurement on the one hand 
and the treasury function on the other hand.   
So from institution to institution, that might – the 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 115 of 315 
 
locus of the repurposing might change.  But what is clear 
is that within that general picture you had a Commissioner 
at SARS who ensured that he owed no accountability and 
therefore did not allow any transparency and therefore he 
would not allow any kind of interrogation or enquiry into 
what was really going on in the organisation. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja, thank you. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Similar things applied too, for 
example, 
the 
FIC 
report, 
Chair, 
which 
the 
then 
Commissioner received in relation to Mr Makwakwa and the 
10 
manner in which that handled. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I think you have given enough 
examples to show your understanding.  Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja.  Well, you have given more than 
enough but you have not answered the question.  You 
know, Mr Gordhan, my professional assistant sometimes 
does not come to ask me for leave and she takes leave 
without permission and she tries to take control of her 
office.  I am asking you a question, that is just a question 
of maybe insubordination.  What has all that got to do with 
20 
state capture?  Can you educate us?  Let us assume Mr 
Moyane used the wrong process of taking leave for a 
minute.  What on earth – what has that got to do with state 
capture? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Mpofu, just to make sure that 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 116 of 315 
 
Mr Gordhan is not going to deal with matters that you not 
have in mind, are you talking about the leave forms? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, let us do it bit by bit, let us start 
with the leave forms, yes.  I think that is better, Chair, 
sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so the question, Mr Gordhan, is what 
does Mr Moyane’s refusal to give you leave forms or 
refusal to fill in leave forms have to do with state capture?  
Just the leave forms. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   That is what I elaborated on, 
10 
Chair, earlier on, so to save us time I will not repeat 
myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   That this is part of a pattern. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As I understood it, the part that certainly 
could relate to the leave forms is that you said – and I 
want you to confirm – that that refusal in relation to leave 
forms on his part was part of a refusal to account to you 
which would be part of what people who want to engage in 
state capture would do.  Is my understanding correct? 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   In this particular instance, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well, okay, then let us take it to that 
step, let us assume Mr Moyane refused to account to you, 
what on earth has that got to do with state capture?  Is 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 117 of 315 
 
that a criminal offence refusing to account to you?  
Because state capture is a criminal offence we know. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well, in terms of the PFMA there 
is a particular set of accountabilities, so depending on 
which particular section of the PFMA you refer to it could 
constitute a criminal offence but I do not think that you 
want to – or rather, we should allow the impression to be 
created in the public mind that this is about the pettiness 
of a leave form.  It is a lot more than that.  Accountability 
is an absolutely crucial part of any democracy in the world, 
10 
including South Africa. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I agree. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So if there is an absence of 
accountability, which I explained earlier on and I will not 
repeat that because then you are going to say I am talking 
too 
long, 
but 
that 
is 
part 
a 
contribution 
towards 
repurposing an institution. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay, I am giving up on that answer.  I 
was saying – we will come back to this, I was saying that 
you – you have accused every public official who has ever 
20 
adverse decision against you to be a practitioner of state 
capture and the examples I was giving, and I want you to 
comment, where I gave the example of President Zuma, 
which there was an objection, but other people that you 
have accused of state capture who have made adverse 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 118 of 315 
 
findings against you include Mr Shaun Abrahams and the 
Public Protector, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, firstly, your general notion I 
do not accept.  Secondly …[intervenes] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Specifically …[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Again, Chairperson, interrupting 
me while I am talking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, he just asking you to specify the 
general notion with which you do not agree that you are 
referring.  You said [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well, I do not have a transcription 
service, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes …[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   His first comment was I accuse 
every public official who issues an unfavourable finding of 
state capture.  I say that is the proposition I do not accept. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Is that clearly understood? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, continue.  Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Right, the second one he then 
20 
raises is the former President on the one hand and Mr 
Shaun Abrahams on the other hand …[intervenes] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And the Public Protector. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well, I think it is for the 
Commission …[intervenes] 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 119 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, he was just adding that the Public 
Protector is another one that he mentioned but you can 
take them one by one. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So where relevant, Chairperson, I 
have indicated the kind of role that the former President 
has played in my evidence before you in November 2018.  
In relation to Mr Abrahams, I certainly believe that he 
played a role and it is now common knowledge and 
generally accepted amongst the South African public which 
is growing impatient by the lack of people involved in 
10 
corruption and state capture not appearing in orange 
uniforms 
behind 
jail 
bars, 
that 
the 
NPA 
itself 
was 
compromised.  I do not have details but it is well-accepted 
and I imagine the Commission will be looking at it in some 
stage. 
 
in relation to the Public Protector, whatever I have 
to say is the lack of evidence before various courts.  Thank 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   So again you accuse all those people of 
20 
being practitioners of state capture without any evidence 
or what you call – you do not have the details. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   You did not ask me for details. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am asking you [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 120 of 315 
 
MINISTER 
GORDHAN: 
 
 
You 
asked 
me 
whether 
…[intervenes] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay, what evidence have you got of 
the involvement of the Public Protector and state capture? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, Chairperson, I think this is 
beyond the scope of what I am here for. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   The Chair is here …[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Those were matters before the 
relevant courts. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Mr Gordhan, Mr Gordhan, please. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on, hang on. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I do not want to waste time, I sorry to 
interrupt you. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, Chairperson… 
ADV MPOFU SC:   The Chairperson is here, he knows 
when the question is not fair.  You said you are not a 
lawyer, you job is to answer the questions not to make 
rulings. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   My job is also not to accept 
instructions from you, Adv Mpofu, with due respect. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Do you have – you do not have 
evidence …[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I am not on trial here. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   That Adv [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] is involved in state capture? 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 121 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I am – Mr Chairperson, let me 
make it absolutely clear that I am not on trial here.  It is 
Adv Mpofu’s client who must come and testify what he did 
at SARS, not me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us …[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   That is the first point.  The second 
point, Chairperson, I am appealing to you whether I must 
answer questions in relation to the Public Protector and 
whether that is the scope you intended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let us pause.  Let us pause.  Mr 
10 
Mpofu, just repeat what your question was. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja, it is a follow-up question, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Remember the proposition, because he 
said when we ask a question we start with a general and 
[indistinct – dropping voice]  The question was whether he 
goes around accusing every public official who has made 
an adverse finding against him and he said no.  Then I 
made examples and he dealt with each one of them.  Now I 
am asking the third follow-up which is did he make the 
20 
accusations against these people without evidence and 
that is it, it flows from the proposition I was making about 
him making such accusations against Mr Moyane without 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, apart from the issue of the scope, 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 122 of 315 
 
the issue that Mr Chaskalson raised earlier on becomes 
relevant, namely you may be inviting him now to put up in 
the public domain details of what he might consider to be 
evidence of state capture by people who have not been 
notified, 
they 
might 
be 
mentioned 
in 
that 
way 
…[intervenes] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, but he has already done – I did not 
want to respond to that, what Mr Chaskalson was saying 
does not apply because the witness …[intervenes]3 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I do not …[intervenes] 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   You have the witness – I am sorry, 
Chair, I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I am saying I do not have that here 
that he has made, for example, allegations against the 
Public Protector relating to state capture.  It is not 
something that I am aware of in front of me here. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes but the witness is aware of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And, Chair, with greatest of respect, 
part of cross-examination goes to the credibility of the 
20 
witness, so I cannot be confined.  If he has already 
answered the question, he should not have answered the 
question about those individuals.  I cannot be stopped 
when it starts to hurt.  I am simply asking the question of 
whether those accusations which he has testified here, not 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 123 of 315 
 
in his statement, in front of you ten minutes ago, about Mr 
Abrahams and the Public Protector, he made them without 
evidence, it flows from his evidence now, not from anything 
else.   
And as far as Mr Zuma is concerned, which is Mr 
Chaskalson’s point, the questions I was putting flow from 
the evidence which was given in 2018 but I will come to 
that, that is why I said I do not want to go to war on that 
particular issue.  But whether this witness has a propensity 
to accuse people without evidence, including Mr Moyane, 
10 
cannot be said to be out of the scope, that (a) to (e) deals 
with exactly that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Let me hear what Mr Chaskalson 
and Ms Le Roux have to say.  Mr Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, I would repeat my earlier 
objection.  The issue as to whether Mr Gordhan has 
evidence to support his allegations against Mr Moyane is 
the issue we are here to deal with today.   
 
In relation to other individuals, at best it goes to an 
issue of credibility.  But if it does then Mr Mpofu is bound 
20 
by the answer of the witness and the witness said yes, he 
has got evidence.  Mr Mpofu should not be allowed to go 
further than that because it is just an issue of credibility 
and it is also collateral to the central issues and one that 
is inviting a witness to implicate parties who have been 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 124 of 315 
 
given no notice that potentially serious allegations are 
going to be made against them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, let me hear Ms Le Roux as well 
before – Ms Le Roux? 
ADV LE ROUX:   Thank you Chair, we would be obviously 
align ourselves with Mr Chaskalson’s submissions.   The – 
as I understand Mr Mpofu’s – the thrust of the question is 
to say what you have done to Tom Moyane you have done 
to others.  The witness has dealt with the others that were 
identified and we can surely move on to actually get back 
10 
to Mr Moyane, rather than waste time on parties who are 
not here, have not been warned and quite honestly that 
evidence is not within the scope of what you ruled. 
 
So I would ask that we get a ruling that we go back 
to why he says Mr Moyane was part of State Capture. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Chairperson well firstly Ms Le Roux 
agrees with Mr Chaskalson but Mr Chaskalson is wrong, so 
must she be, because the answer that Mr Chaskalson is 
referring to was answer to a different question about Mr 
20 
Moyane which was given, not to the question I am dealing 
with now about the others, and this is a matter of 
credibility, unless she is saying Chair the proposition, that 
is why I start with the proposition so that it is not – I don’t 
– it is not mysterious where I am going with the proposition 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 125 of 315 
 
and if the Chair rules that the proposition I put which is 
that this witness has a propensity to accuse people without 
evidence, if that is not relevant to [a] to [e] then I will 
move to another question but in my respectful submission 
it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us take a short adjournment and let 
me see Counsel in my chambers.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Mr Gordhan we are going to take a 
short adjournment for me to ...[intervenes]   
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Can I give one response to the 
ultimate issue raised Chair if I may, for just half a minute. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on Mr Gordhan, let me just – let 
me talk to counsel and when we come back depending on 
what comes out it might or might not be necessary for you 
to say anything. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
20 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will wait for Mr Gordhan to appear on 
the screen again.  Okay Mr Gordhan. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
The 
agreement 
between 
myself 
and 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 126 of 315 
 
counsel on all sides is that this question is going to be 
parked and if the need still exists for it Mr Mpofu will come 
back to it later at the end of his questions and we can look at 
it then as to what should happen.  It may be that I will need 
to be – argument might need to be addressed to me whether 
I should allow it or not but it will be parked so that we can 
make progress.  He will – he will continue with other 
questions.  And if as he continues there are other questions 
that might be problematic like this one also those will be 
parked and then when he is done we can then apply our 
10 
minds to all of those questions that will have been parked.  
You understand? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I understand Chair.  May I just make 
one remark? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes,  yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I just want to say for the record in 
response to the question about propensity or accusing 
people that that is not true.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Let us continue.  Mr Mpofu I 
will bear in mind the five minutes or so of your cross-
20 
examination time that 
was taken by the meetings in 
chambers. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.   
ADV MPOFU SC:  Right then the next issue was what I 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 127 of 315 
 
called… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Firstly I am sorry Mr Mpofu.  Obviously it is 
important that all concerned just note the actual question 
correctly so that when we come back to them we know 
exactly what the question was. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes okay.  Moving on the – again I said I 
10 
will – I was hoping to move quickly through the what I call 
the – not the core stuff.  Mr Moyane gives the following 
examples of what it was your pettiness and jealousies.  That 
you – when he – you accept that he was the first 
Commissioner of SARS to collect a trillion rands, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  It might be correct I have to check 
the records. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Well he was the first and the second 
trillion was also collected by him and the third one.  But yes 
you can check your records.  But when the first… 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  He might be – even that comment 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Mr Mpofu might be I – might be 
misunderstood to say that we now – SARS now collects R3 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 128 of 315 
 
trillion it does not.  But I understand where he is going.  So 
no that is – there is no dispute we can go on with that. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Okay.  No that is exactly what I mean.  He 
was the first Commissioner not you who collected the trillion 
rand for South Africa.  The – anyway I am saying that the – 
when he did that you did not even congratulate him.  Do you 
remember that? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No I cannot remember that. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Okay.  The – and do you remember that 
you did not ask him – you asked him specifically actually not 
10 
to come to the press conference for the budget which is a 
tradition in South Africa that the Commissioner of SARS 
attends that. 
MINISTER 
GORDHAN: 
 
No 
I 
think 
there 
is 
a 
misunderstanding Chairperson on that question.  It is – there 
are three or four people who are seated at the head table 
when these press conferences take place before the budget 
announcements at 2 pm on a budget day and it is a 
Minister’s discretion as to whether for example the Governor 
of the Reserve Bank if there is something important to say 
20 
on foreign exchange for example or if there might be 
relevant 
taxation 
questions 
to 
invite 
the 
tax 
SARS 
Commissioner to attend so it is not a right by any means. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  The Minister of Finance exercises 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 129 of 315 
 
his or her discretion in each of these particular regards. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  No I accept that.  It is not a right 
that is why I said it is protocol.  All I am saying is that you 
using that Minister’s discretion that you referred to you used 
the discretion to exclude Mr Moyane from that press 
conference, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Not at the press conference that is 
why I differentiated Chair. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  What did you exclude him from? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry, I am sorry.  Hang 
10 
on, hang on.  I just wanted clarification which year we are 
talking about when this happened? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  2016 budget. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2016. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  That would be February 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  In other words for the year 2016/17 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Okay Mr Gordhan Mr Mpofu 
says you used your discretion – Ministerial discretion to 
exclude Mr Moyane at that press conference and I think he 
20 
says why did you use it to exclude him?  Mr Mpofu do… 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Confirm if I am right? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes I confirm you are right Chair.  If you .. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay [inaudible]. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 130 of 315 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I will even confirm more if you allow me 
to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I will allow you. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  May I respond Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Wait for him to clarify because I want him 
to confirm whether I got his question right. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes you did Chair and yes I confirm – I 
just confirmed with the client. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  That was the pre-budget –  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  2016. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Pre – ag press conference of 2016 where 
he… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was excluded. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Well – ja Mr Gordhan told the Deputy 
Minister Mcebisi Jonas to tell Mr Moyane not to attend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and you – part of your question was 
why did he use his discretion to exclude him? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No just to confirm that he did? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay so basically Mr Mpofu 
20 
wanted you to confirm that you did your Ministerial discretion 
to exclude 
Mr 
Moyane in the press 
– 
budget press 
conference of 2016 – February 2016. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  That is only half correct Chair as I 
was explaining.  There are two seating arrangements in the 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 131 of 315 
 
GCIS venue at 120 Plein Street.  The first as I have already 
explained is there are three or four chairs at the head table 
where normally the Minister, Deputy Minister and Director 
General and the Spokesperson present and then depending 
on the import of a particular question the Governor of the 
Reserve Bank might be there or the SARS Commissioner 
might be there.  That is the head table.  In the audience at 
the press conference there are probably 150 to 200 seats.  
May of them will be filled by the media but also officials that 
are relevant on the Treasury or SARS or similar institutions 
10 
like the Reserve Bank.  All I did was to say it is not 
necessary for him to be at the head table because there 
were no relevant questions as far as I was concerned.  But 
he could attend the press conference and take a seat like 
anybody else in the 150 or 200 seats.  So that is the clarity I 
was seeking to provide. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chair if I can just have one second? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I am sorry Mr Gordhan.  Okay so we agree 
20 
that you used your discretion to exclude him whichever way 
you look at it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  From the head table but not from the 
conference I think. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 132 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Gordhan am I correct?  You accept that 
you used your discretion to exclude him from the head table 
but not from the conference? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Okay well that is not – Mr Moyane’s 
evidence will be that you sent Mr Jonas to exclude him from 
the press conference itself actually for the first time at least 
in democratic history the Commissioner for SARS was 
excluded from that activity and he had to go to Parliament on 
10 
his own not with the other colleagues. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I have no recollection of that Chair. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Okay that is fine – well that is what 
happened anyway.  I accept that you have no recollection of 
it.  But..; 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe it might be important to Mr Gordhan 
to – to be clear whether you have no recollection even 
whether you excluded him from the conference as opposed 
to from the head table or whether you – what it is that you 
say you have no recollection of 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  The precise question I thought was 
that I sent Deputy Minister Jonas of that time to convey a 
message to Mr Moyane.  I have no recollection of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is what you have no recollection 
of. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 133 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Secondly .. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  And then reference is made to the 
democratic era.  I was not present in press conferences from 
1994 to about 2000 and something in the 2000’s so I do not 
know whether that was a tradition.  I think traditions changed 
over time because there were different Ministers of Finance.  
There was Mr Liebenberg if you recall Mr Keys before that 
immediately after 1994 elections. And then there was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you do not know ja okay. 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Okay thank you.  Now these are just some 
of the evidence of what he calls pettiness and petty 
jealousies as I said.  So now let us come to the important 
stuff.  You said that – I also said that he says one of your 
motivations is racism and you made some comments about 
that.  So let me just take you through that accusation 
because as I said we do not believe in making accusations 
which are not backed up. 
 
You should know – I am just as a South African again 
please distinguish between the general questions and the 
20 
specific ones.  You know some of the manifestations of 
racists etiquette I am sure that at some level you yourself 
might have been a victim of some form of racism.  As a 
general statement you – as a South African accept that, 
correct? 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 134 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat the proposition? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Do you know some of the manifestations 
of racist attitudes particularly in South Africa? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes thanks.  And do you know that some 
of the most crass forms of racism would be – include to 
dehumanise the person you are talking to calling them 
monkeys and baboons and so on.  Let us call that the 
[00:11:58] type of racism, do you know that? 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I am aware of it yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  And you also know that another form is to 
insult a person directly or indirectly by mocking their hair or 
their lips or whatever.  Let us call that clicks type of racism. 
You aware? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I did not hear the question could you 
repeat that please? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Another form  would be to insult a person 
directly by for example making references to their hair. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Okay. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Or any other physical part of it. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Oh hair. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Agreed? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Yes sure. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  And then another form of racism which is 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 135 of 315 
 
more common in South Africa is to belittle particularly 
African people.  It is probably the most annoying belittling 
calling them boys or girls.  I mean calling an 80 year old 
person a boy or a girl.  You know about that? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Ja with references to other groups in 
South Africa coolies or other things as well. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  So generally black people having 
subjected to racism I am sure of different forms yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes no, no, I am – I know – I am 
10 
specifically talking about African people.  I know that there 
are other victims of racism and even sexism but I am – my 
question is just about racism against African people.  So that 
form of the belittling is the one that as I say we will call it 
the what Mr Moyane would refer to as the Pravin Gordhan 
type of racism.  Now you had – and that racism goes – all of 
those go to the attacking the dignity of the person and 
disrespecting them, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No it depends which question you 
are asking Mr Mpofu.  So Chair the first point is look the so 
20 
called Pravin Gordhan forms of racism.  I deny any form of 
racism or racist behaviour.  The second question is about 
attacking.  I do not attack people on the basis of race and 
the basis of their performance or their competence there may 
criticism of it.  There might be questions asked and there 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 136 of 315 
 
might be an inquiries made.  And if somebody feels 
inadequate because they do not know their subject matter 
then I perceive it as belittling.  But that is the normal 
exchange 
between 
an 
accountable 
person 
and 
the 
accounting authority in this case the executive authority as 
described in the PFMA.  So it can easily be misunderstood 
but that is not my practice. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you Chair no I was actually in 
10 
fairness to the question – to the witness I did attribute this to 
him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  So if it was not a general question.  The – 
thank you Mr Gordhan.  The – the point that I am really 
coming to is that racism takes many forms and some of it – 
and is probably only understood by the victims.  It might be 
just the tone of voice that somebody use against you.  The – 
you know there are certain catch words like you know being 
called a boy or a girl or little person or being called cheeky.  
20 
I mean some of us we have been cheeky kaffirs.  It is those 
kinds of things.  Sometimes it is the tone, sometimes it is 
words, do you agree? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Well I myself have called cheeky by 
the former security branch in the pre-1994 period. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315

ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  But that means you are not -  you 
are not cooperating. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I mean I do not know what the import 
of your question is but let me note what you saying and let 
us move onto the next question. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  No that is good. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think – I think Mr Mpofu six confirmation 
from you whether you agree that sometimes when some 
10 
people calls somebody cheeky it could be a form of racism. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes in other words they … 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Inaudible]. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes they might not say it – like the 
security branch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Example is a good one.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  They would not say it to each other. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:  But they would say it to you.  So it was a 
form of belittle you, you accept that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so I think that the general proposition 
he is putting for your comment. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No Chair I think there is cheeky as 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 138 of 315 
 
in hostile and there is cheeky in the kind of context that you 
and Mr Mpofu seem to be describing. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  So I think you need to distinguish 
between the two and I repeat that none of my behaviour can 
be equated to racism. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  No fair enough. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I am simply saying that you accept that 
those are some of the signals belittling, tone, using certain 
10 
catch words like cheeky and so on.  Those are just some of 
the tell-tale – it does not mean – I mean people can belittle 
each other even if they are both of the same race.  I am just 
saying that those are some of the signs that you perceive as 
a victim.  I am sure you accept that? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I accept that and at the same time 
that same kind of behaviour could well be as I said earlier on 
be a manifestation of lack of accountability.  It could be 
manifestation of deliberate hostility and depending on the 
context when applies it then it could have different meanings 
20 
as you say and I say. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes thank you.  Now if you can go to 
TSM109 page 109 sorry Chair I keep on referencing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay before you proceed Mr Mpofu let 
me mention just for – so that we are on the same page.  I 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 139 of 315 
 
think we are three minutes away from quarter to four which 
would have been the end of two hours but I added fifteen 
minutes earlier on that five minutes so I think the two hours 
will end at five past four. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then we will take it from there. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  We will take it from there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Page 109 – are you there? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is page 109 of which bundle? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Bundle TSM so that would be … 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is M3B. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  It is called Exhibit M3 – M Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  M3 – oh they did not make sure that we all 
have the same things. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think there are only two that are 
20 
being used so it must be M3A. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes this is the one that was sent by the 
commission last week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  So I am sure it is the latest one. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 140 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay 
alright.  Mr Gordhan do 
you 
understand which bundle? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I am trying to find I have 104, 106, 
107. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  It was the typed – they have both 
with the big typed numbers but there are also numbers 
written in Koki pen. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  .Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is TMZ. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Annexure TMZ3 at page 109 is [00:19:23] 
conversation. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  The easiest for me at the top the 
TSM number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay ja we… 
ADV MPOFU SC:  In this case they are both 109. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  It is TSM 109.  I think all the page 
numbers are TSM but we do not – we just mention the page 
number.   
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I do not think I have it but let me 
20 
hear the question and see if I can address it Chair. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Is your – are your bundles – your files – 
lever arch files are they written on the spine TSM3?  Are 
they written… 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Have to find it – just give me a 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 141 of 315 
 
moment? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.   
ADV MPOFU SC:  Exhibit M3 that is the same one Mr 
Chaskalson took you to earlier where you were reading your 
affidavit at page 786. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Oh I see.  Thank you.  No but that 
was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I do not think that is the one Mr Mpofu. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No that is not the one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is not the one.  I think Mr Chaskalson 
10 
had one file – we have more than one. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes but the [talking over one another] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Those start at 781. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Mr – the transcript… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see the one… 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Ms Le Roux is trying to help Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay one second.  The one where Mr 
Gordhan’s clarificatory affidavit is – is the one we had before 
you referred us to this one.  So the – if he has two lever arch 
files like me then he should not be looking at the one that 
20 
has got his clarificatory affidavit.  He should be looking at 
the other one. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  Now Ms Le Roux thinks it will help if 
I tell him that it is the transcript. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 142 of 315 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:  It is the bundle with the transcript. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
The 
bundle 
with 
the 
transcript 
Mr 
Gordhan? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Let me – let me find it Chair.   
ADV MPOFU SC:  The telephone call. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we should all of us… 
ADV MPOFU SC:  The one with the transcript of the 
telephone conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We should have all had the same files 
marked in the same way. 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Mr Chaskalson says it is in 3A.  Ms Le 
Roux says. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  It is 1040.  
CHAIRPERSON:  The page number is 109.  The file is 
written on the spine N3A. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes apparently it appears twice Chair so 
that the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:  So we will use the Koki pen numbers 
because they correspond with the TSM numbers anyway.  
Yes that is the one Mr Gordhan.  It is marked TMZ3 are you 
there? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Ja no the number I have is 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 143 of 315 
 
TSM1040.  It is a transcript of a telephone conversation 
between myself and Mr Moyane. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  Okay fine I will use – I will use those 
numbers. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  We might all have different numbers 
but I think … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us go to the same numbers otherwise 
we will get confused.  Are you able to get them?  Mr Mpofu 
are you using the other bundle? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes Chair it does not really matter.  I will 
10 
use any bundle.  I can use the numbering that the witness 
prefers.   
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just that in the one bundle the page 
number might be – the page numbers might be different and 
if you say page so and so I might go to a wrong page. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I will use both Chair to save time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright you are ready Mr Gordhan? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Yes I am ready Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  So if you go to TSM110 which will be 
1041 on your numbering. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  Then turn to the next page 111 which 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 144 of 315 
 
is 1042.   
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  Okay I will just read a few extracts 
and then I will ask you the questions afterwards.  This is a 
conversation between you and Mr Moyane where you were 
shouting at him about some statement made about a Judge.  
We have the audio but this is a transcript thereof so if it is 
necessary to hand over the audio to the commission we will 
do so.  But this should be sufficient. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We know what date it was just for the sake 
10 
of completeness but if we do not it is okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chair in… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the conversation. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chair no, not readily but I will check on 
that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Because it was also an annexure to an 
affidavit in the High Court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  So it might have been dated in that 
20 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I will check on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you Chair.  Yes okay Mr Gordhan 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 145 of 315 
 
just start at 111 which is 1042.  It says there – firstly you – 
you participated in this conversation, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Correct. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  Okay there you say Tom, he says  
CHAIRPERSON:  Tell us from which line you starting to read 
Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  It is 21 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Why should I keep quiet when he makes 
that blasphemous statements about us says Tom. 
10 
And then it says Pravin:  I just told you you are a public 
servant you are not God. 
You remember that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am – oh okay now I see.  That is around 
line marginally … 
ADV MPOFU SC:  It is 21 to 24. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About 2 – about 20 – 23. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Line 23.  Okay alright.  Ja you can – may 
continue. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes remember that one.  I am asking the 
questions later.  Then he says to you at 1043 or 112 against 
letter 12.  He says I think Sir you also should treat me with 
respect you are shouting at me. Then Pravin says I am not 
shouting at you. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 146 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry.  I can see where 
you – where Mr Gordhan says: I just told you you are a 
public servant you are not God. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes that was the previous reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I want to find out whether in regard 
to that page is that all you wanted to draw my attention. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  That is all yes, that is all.  I have moved 
to the next position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Then the next would be on 
what page -  next page? 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:  The next page – 1043 or 112. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay right. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Lines 11 to 12 Chair.  Yes.  As I said if we 
have to play the audio we will but then he says: I think Sir 
you should treat me with respect you are shouting at me and 
it becomes inaudible.  He says:  I am not shouting at you.  
And then Tom says:   
Tom:  No that is fine.   
Pravin:  And if you start shouting then it does not matter.  
Tom:  That is fine.   
20 
Pravin:  You keep using shouting as an excuse.   
Tom:  You are.   
Pravin:  No man grow up man – grow up.   
Tom:  You should also grow up Sir.   
Pravin:  I beg your pardon.   
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 147 of 315 
 
Tom:  Yes who are you talking to you cannot talk to me.   
Tom – Pravin:  who do you think you are?   
Let us just pause there.  I said to you to say Mr Moyane and 
you are almost on the same age group, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I beg your pardon Mr Moyane and I – 
sorry? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Mr Moyane and you are almost in the 
same age group.  I mean need or late 60’s? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I am slightly above that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The question is whether you accept that Mr 
10 
Moyane and yourself are in the same age group, that is the 
question? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Is that no that it is not so or no you 
do not know? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No, no we are not of the same age. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are… 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I will be 72 at my next birthday in 
April Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes maybe Mr Mpofu when you say age 
20 
group you should be indicating. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  I do not mean – I did not say you are 
the same age.  I am saying you are in the same age group 
above 65? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Above 65?   
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 148 of 315 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Would you agree? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  For the purposes of progressing let 
us say… 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  We are in a similar age group yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes ja.  And something that it is – to say 
to a person who is almost as old as you that they must grow 
up is the same as treating them like children and belittling 
10 
them, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Not necessarily if given the context.  
So if I may elaborate Chair?  Because every [00:28:34] start 
is at 10:41 line 3.  With great respect we cannot be just 
choosing what lines.  Let us provide the context.  And there I 
am quotes as saying the following:  Let me start at line 5 I 
say:  Good afternoon Tom. 
Tom:  Good afternoon Sir. 
Pravin:  Thanks for returning the call.  I am a bit worried 
about your attacks on Judge Davis.  I do not think that is the 
20 
right thing to do.  You cannot attack a Judge in the way you 
guys are doing.  We will discuss this on Monday when I see 
you.  But please stop it. 
He then says: 
Tom:  I am listening. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 149 of 315 
 
Pravin:  No I am finished. 
Tom:  Okay. 
Pravin:  Are you going to stop it? 
Tom:  Stop what Sir. 
Pravin:  Stop the attacks on the Judge. 
Tom:  He has been attacking us. 
Pravin:  No he has written me an explanatory letter already. 
Tom:  Oh. 
Pravin:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  If I may – are you going to read the whole 
10 
transcript? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No I think it is very important Chair 
that you do not hear  
[EVERYONE TALKING OVER ONE ANOTHER] 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Do you intend to read the whole thing that 
is what I want to know? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No, no. no.  No, ...[indistinct] 
...tend(?) to(?).  [Transmission distorted - speaker is not 
clear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I just want to go on a bit more, to 
raise my point.  [Transmission distorted - speaker is not 
clear.] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Go on.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, continue Mr Gordhan. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 150 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   “Well, he did not have the decency 
to explain  
to me then.” 
 
That is the judge explaining to Tom.   
“Pravin: 
Well, no.  You should have the decency to 
call him.  You cannot just attack anybody you 
feel like.   
Tom: 
Oh. 
10 
Pravin: 
Just because you think you are a powerful 
person, that is not the way to conduct 
yourself.  You have a huge responsibility as 
a public servant, moving and going around 
speaking on your behalf.  Since when do we 
just go around attacking judges?  Is there a 
reason for this?” 
 
And then the rest goes on Chair.  So that is the context.  
The context is on SARS’ statement, issued – attacking 
20 
Judge Davis.  And I was cautioning Mr Moyane that public 
servants indeed, even a member of the public, should not 
attack a judge because of the view that they expressed. 
 
That they should rather talk about this and come to an 
understanding.  But in the meantime, until we meet on that 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 151 of 315 
 
mandate that is indicated in the transcript please do not 
attack the judge again.  That is all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you.  But...  Look, honestly, this is 
a waste of time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Mr Chaskalson wishes to say 
something. 
ADV CHASKALSON:   Yes.  Sorry, Chair.  Reverend 
Mbuyiselo has brought to my attention that there are going to 
be great difficulties on the transcripts with the audio, people 
10 
talking over each other. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON:   So would ask both Mr Mpofu and 
Mr Gordhan to try not to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  H’m.  Okay alright ...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay.  Well, I am trying to say time Char.  
When he rambles on, I have to say something.  I am sorry.  I 
cannot...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmm ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I will allow him.  That is why I wanted to 
make ...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct] Yes, yes.  Let us avoid 
mister... 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 152 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I know what you are going to say 
...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   That reference to rambling, is not 
acceptable Chair. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay when ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I knew ...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   When he goes on and talks about 
10 
ramble.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   And when I read from the transcript, 
it is ramble. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, okay.  Let us try and 
...[intervenes]    
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay let me just ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   stick to the contents ...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Listen, Mr Gordhan.  It does not matter if 
you are talking about a judge or the pope or whatever.  In 
any context, is it acceptable to shout at somebody and to 
say to them:  Grow up, man.  Grow up.   
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 153 of 315 
 
 
It does not matter what the topic is.  I am saying, that is 
belittling to the person you are talking to.  Yes or no? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   In this particular context, if a person 
does not want to provide a straightforward answer, I will not 
attack the judge until we discuss this matter on Monday and 
then the conversation goes on and what appears, even from 
the transcript, is open defiance. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, if it is defiance, you have a right 
...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   And lack of...  Lack of respect for 
10 
the minister.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   But he might have regard and, you 
know, voices being raised but it is neither here nor there.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   In the context, it is far more 
important than the form. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  No, that is good.  So if you are 
defiant, you are a minister and more importantly to you, does 
that give you a right to shout at him and treat him like a child 
20 
to tell him to grow up? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I did not treat anyone like a child.  If 
it is in the context.  I was merely saying to him, be 
responsible.  You hold a responsible position as a senior 
public servant.   
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 154 of 315 
 
 
You cannot go around attacking a judge through your 
spokesperson.  I have also accounted to a minister for about 
ten years.  And I know the kind of relationship that a 
director-general/commissioner 
needs 
to 
have 
with 
the 
minister. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay.  Do you remember what the 
question was?  If you are the director-general or whatever 
who is disobedient.  Does that give you the right to belittle 
them and to tell them to grow up like a child because it is 
only children that have to grow up?  Yes or no? 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I am not sure...  Again, if you read it 
in the context, this is not about belittling.  This is about 
asking for cooperation from the Commissioner of SARS in 
respect of a judge. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you.  So if I want cooperation from 
you, Mr Gordhan and I say:  Grown up, man. 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   [Indistinct] Mr Mpofu, in the context 
of...  Can I finish?  Can I answer? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, please.   
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   If the context requires even the 
Chairperson will allow you, you can go ahead. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And...  okay.  And if the Chairperson 
allows me and does not allow me but it will be belittling you.  
At least, let us agree on that.   
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 155 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Not necessarily.  I have been 
“shouted at”  Where I have been spoken to in an emphatic 
way.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Hmpfh.   
MINISTER GORDHAN:   And that does not mean... It 
depends on the individual.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   As to how you interpret the 
particular matter.  You can have many interpretations to your 
convenience as you like. 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  Okay.  Well, I put it to you that in 
the South African context, if you tell a grown-up man in his 
fifties or sixties to grow up, you are belittling him and it is a 
sign of racism and treating that person like a child, not as an 
equal.  You do not say to your – when you talk to your fellow 
ministers or other people that you respect, that they must 
grown up.   
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well, I reject your understanding 
and what you are putting to me. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  Okay.  Then, if you go to the next 
20 
page which is 113, 1044.   
MINISTER GORDHAN:   1044? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Okay.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   You say ...[intervenes]  
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 156 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second Mr Mpofu.  Do not 
forget the question you wanted to put.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay I will not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are... it is part of two hours.  Let us 
talk about that.  What is your sense of how much more you 
need? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Chair, I am sorry.  At the pace we are 
going and that is why I am trying to pace this up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   My sense is that we are not with – it is 
10 
almost certain we are not going to finish but we can push as 
far as we can.  I have got three topics to deal with.  Let us 
deal with D and E. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us add an hour and see 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, and see how ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...how we progress by then. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you, Chairman.  I am indebted.  I 
will try to be in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Ms Le Roux, you wanted to say 
20 
something?  Mr Chaskalson, you wanted to say something? 
MS LE ROUX:   Thank you, Chair.  Other than just to note 
that I am not sure that, you know, the debate about when 
Mr Moyane tells Mr Gordhan to grow up and Mr Gordhan tells 
Mr Moyane to grow up.  I am not sure that is progressing 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 157 of 315 
 
your inquiry.   
 
And I would ask if we move to the next topic, which Mr 
Mpofu indicated which was actually to get onto.  Why Mr 
Gordhan thinks Tom Moyane progressed State Capture at 
SARS. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you see Mr Gordhan said that part of 
what he associated – part of what makes him associate 
Mr Moyane with pursuing the State Capture agenda was, as 
he put it, his vilification of Mr Gordhan...  I cannot remember 
what the other term was connected with the vilification.   
10 
 
And that, of course, seems to speak to hostility.  And 
Mr Gordhan has a certain understanding of why there was 
that hostility.  Mr Moyane has a different understanding why 
there was that hostility.   
 
And as I understand it, this is where it comes in.  So I 
am keeping an eye on the scope but – and allowing that 
there may be different understandings.   
 
So I note what you are say.  I am keeping an eye on it.  
Yes. 
MS LE ROUX:   Chair, I would then just note for the record 
20 
that we certainly do object the duration going beyond today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Mr Chaskalson, do you want to say 
something? 
ADV CHASKALSON:   Chair, I do not have anything to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  Mr Mpofu. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 158 of 315 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you, Chair.  I will not comment on 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   All I am going to say is that.  Well, the 
pace of this cross-examination is totally dependent on the 
answers that I get. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you.  At page...  Where were we?  
And I do not agree with...  Well, maybe Ms Le Roux, to her it 
is not important the issue of racism but – it was a sure(?) 
10 
indicator.  That was one of the big five issues by Mr Moyane 
as the real route.  In the end the Chair will decide whether it 
is Mr Gordhan’s version or Mr Moyane’s version that must 
stand.  But page 113, which is also 1044 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   You say that: 
“Pravin: 
Because you work every day with the Hawks and so 
on you think you have the authority to talk to me – 
to talk like that to me.  I beg your pardon.  No DG in 
20 
government 
talk 
to 
the 
minister 
like 
you 
do.  
Nobody.  And the only reason you do it is because 
you know – because you have connections.” 
 
Okay.  We have already covered the part about no DG 
talks to a minister like that.  But what evidence did you have 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 159 of 315 
 
that Mr Moyane works with the Hawks every  day? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   That was a manner of speaker 
closely but certainly Chair there was gossip around at the 
time about Mr Moyane and Mr Abrahams possible meeting 
frequently or some other official from the NPA.  And I 
suppose this is something that Mr Moyane would want to 
come and testify on himself.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, he will. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So that he also can be cross-
examined about these matters.  As you put it to me earlier 
10 
on.  These were all signs and manifestations and tell-tale 
signs, if you like ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   ...of State Capture.  And I put to him 
whether his hostility and arrogance and defiance actually 
emerge from a place which said you have my backing and 
you can do what you like in respect of this particular 
minister. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   [Indistinct] ...[intervenes] 
20 
[Speaker is not clear.] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I understand exactly what it means 
Mr Gordhan.  I do not think anybody does not understand it.  
My question was a simple one.  What evidence you have that 
he was meeting with the Hawks everyday and you have 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 160 of 315 
 
answered that it was from gossip.   
MINISTER GORDHAN:   And information that was circulating 
at the time, which I cannot recollect where I got from. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay.  So it was from those two sources.  
Gossip and information that was circulating ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I did not use the word gossip.  I did 
not use the word gossip Chair. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Are we going around?   
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I did not use the word gossip.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay. 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I was saying to the Chair that this 
was the information floating around at the time when people 
are seen at coffee shops and at various venues.  That 
information gets circulated in one form or another.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   And my impressions comes from 
there.  But the far more fundamental question for anybody to 
answer, in particular Mr Moyane, is where does this 
arrogance and hostility come from?   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  So ...[intervenes]  
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   And particularly, in the context to 
which you will find in the following line 5 on page 1044 and 
the following line 27, also on the same page as well.  Which 
is nobody treats or talks to or deals with or relates to a 
minister in government in South Africa in this manner.  So 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 161 of 315 
 
what is so special about this gentleman called Mr Moyane? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes  No, thanks.  No, that part I 
understand. 
 
That 
is 
what 
I 
call 
– 
let 
us 
call 
it 
insubordination which is not a crime.  I am simply saying, I 
think he says that you had no evidence and I am sorry to use 
the word gossip.   
 
The record will speak for itself.  Maybe it is my ears.  I 
am quite sure you said that but I can be wrong.   
 
But let us cut the questioning to this.  You had no 
evidence that Mr Moyane worked with the Hawks every day.  
10 
Yes? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   It was a manner of speaking. 
ADV 
MPOFU 
SC: 
 
 
Yes, 
that 
manner 
of 
speaking 
...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   But I am sure ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   But I am sure Chairperson, but I am 
sure it happened. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   You ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well...  but Mr Gordhan.  The question is 
...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I beg your pardon? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The question is whether you have 
evidence to back up the statement that Mr Moyane worked 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 162 of 315 
 
with the Hawks every day. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   As I said Chair.  Firstly, there was 
information circulating at the time.  Secondly, it is a manner 
of speaking when one talks about every day.  And thirdly, I 
certainly do believe that there was collaboration between 
Mr Moyane and the then NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but the question is, do you have 
evidence?  That is the question. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you have evidence? 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   The evidence is the kind of 
information I have access to Chair or was I exposed to at 
that particular point in time?  Yes.  If there is something 
written on paper that I am required to produce.  No.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  I think it is more about whether you 
have personal knowledge that that was the position or you 
have any proof.  I think it is more about that.   
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you have personal knowledge that that 
was the case or do you have any proof that that was the 
20 
case?  I think that is what Mr Mpofu is talking about. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes, I do have personal knowledge 
in the sense that people have observed such meetings at the 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mpofu. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 163 of 315 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Mr Gordhan, I must...  Just let us be 
serious for a minute here.  I have been asking a very simple 
question.  It is either you do or you do not have evidence.  I 
am not talking about rumours or what people say in the 
corridors.  Do you, Pravin Gordhan, have any evidence of 
Mr Moyane working with the Hawks every day?  Yes or no? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I think you should leave out some of 
your preambles, with respect.  But the answer – the question 
what you are asking is what the Chair just asked and which I 
answered.   
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well, can you answer it again?  Do you, 
Pravin Gordhan, have any evidence that Mr Moyane was 
working with the Hawks every day?  I am asking for this the 
fourth time.   
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Let me then repeat for your benefit 
because you seem to be hard of hearing at this point in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe before you answer Mr Gordhan. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Mr Gordhan, you do not have to insult me 
about being hard of hearing.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   You know your job is to answer 
...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay? 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 164 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Gordhan ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   You are not going to take that 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...before you answer.  Let me break it up.  
Did you ever see Mr Moyane working with the Hawks every 
day personally? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No.  Do you have somebody that you can 
bring to the Commission who can say:  I did see Mr Moyane 
working with the Hawks every day? 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I will certainly search my memory 
Chairperson and if I do come up with a name, I will let the 
Commission know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Do you have any document that 
suggest that Mr Moyane was working with the Hawks every 
day? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Except for the processes around the 
charges for so complaining. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Mpofu, I think breaking it 
up like that will probably help. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  Well, this was before the charges.  
This was on the 10t h of March 2015 to answer your earlier 
question Chair.  So the answer is that you do not have 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 165 of 315 
 
...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   The 10t h of March...? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   10 t h of March 2015. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   In 2015, I was not in the 
...[indistinct] [Speaker is not clear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   What are you referring to Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   The date of this affidavit(?).  Remember, 
you asked me earlier Chair whether I could date the 
transcript. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes.  Okay, okay, okay.  Alright.  Yes, 
10 
you say the date is 2015...? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am sorry.  I was given 2015.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   That is wrong Chair. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   That date(?) is wrong. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Sorry ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I was at the COGTA Ministry at the 
time.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, thank you. 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Sorry, I got the wrong date.  The point 
is...  Okay anyway.  The answer is that you do not have 
evidence of Mr Moyane acting – or rather working with the 
Hawks every day, bottom line? 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 166 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes, I said to already. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   You did, ja.  Thank you.  And the next one 
was – you then said...  Okay.  Alright, firstly, let me just say.  
You have not right to say I am hard of hearing, okay?  I am 
not your child or your ...[indistinct].  So you must not treat 
me like that.  I am not one of those African that you can 
undermine.  So ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I beg your pardon Chair. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja, do not even think about it. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Ja-no, do not talk to me like that.   
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am not that kind of person. 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second.  Mr Mpofu 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am not your child. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just make the point that you want to make 
and Mr Gordhan will keep quiet while you make that point. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if he wants to respond, then he will 
respond.   
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just make the point that you wanted to 
make. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you.  Ja, and the next issue is you 
said the only reason you do it is you know it is because of 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 167 of 315 
 
your connections.  What were you referring to? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Which line is that Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   It is line 1,2, 3...  After the DJ...   
“No DG and government talks to their minister like 
you do.  Nobody.”   
 
And then you say:   
“And the only reason you do it and you know it is 
because of your connections.”   
 
What were you referring to? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So we are still on page 1042, am I 
10 
right? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   That is correct.  1044. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I beg your pardon? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I think it is 1044.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And on my bundle it would be? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   113, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   113.  Okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Okay 1044 and line number, please? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   The one about the Hawks was line 1 to 2.  
And then ...[intervenes]  
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   That is right. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Then it is under the next – that next line.  
Then on the third it says: 
“And the only reason you do it and you know it is 
because of your connections.”   
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 168 of 315 
 
 
And my question is, what connections are you referring 
to? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well, the connections to the NPA, 
the 
connections 
with 
the 
Hawks, 
which 
gave 
the 
27 
questions but as I said in the Hawks document, it makes 
reference to the same case number with the complaint was 
lodged to the Brooklyn Police Station by Mr Moyane.   
 
And when it is convenient Chair, I would like to read 
paragraph 19 of the affidavit, accompanying that complaint 
into the record as well but we will come back to that. 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So those are the connections I am 
talking about.  And perhaps also, whatever other apology(?) 
in South Africa that mandate of him, go ask him or suggested 
to him that he could behave in a manner herein referred to in 
line 6: 
“No DG in government and talks to a minister like 
you do.  Nobody.” 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So that needs some explanation.  
20 
That needs some explanation as to why one sees this 
extraordinary conduct from a DG level person in relation to a 
minister. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, that is correct.  No, I accept...  I also 
said that could just be a sign of subordination or just 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 169 of 315 
 
ordinary petulance.  That has nothing to do with State 
Capture or connections.   
 
But anyway, the point is... and then he says to you: 
“Which connections, Pravin?  And it known amongst 
the public. 
Tom:   
Which connections are those? 
Pravin: 
It is known amongst the public. 
Tom: 
10 
Which connections are those? 
Pravin: 
And you conspire. 
Tom: 
Which connections? 
Pravin: 
You have doing it for the last two years.  Now what 
have you been – you have been conspiring with the 
Hawks for the last two years: 
 
Which takes us to 2015.   
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So the question is Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Which connection was he conspiring with 
for – between 2015 and 2017?  You said that ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well ...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 170 of 315 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am sorry.  I spoke over you.  I was 
saying, it is still not the question as underlined where he 
says you have been doing it for the last two years now.   
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Okay are you finished? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, finished.  Ja. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So Chairperson, I already answered 
that question that I believe that there was a relationship, so 
connection between what Mr Moyane was doing.  The 27 
questions that appeared in February 2016 prior to this 
10 
conversation, attaching the case number which refers to the 
complaint about Mr Moyane had launched.   
 
And I was also referring to a press conference held by 
two ministers.  I will give you the date – if we are going to 
adjourn in a short while – had which made reference to the 
activities at SARS and we talked about this complaint of 
Mr Moyane and about certain activities and equipment, which 
equipment, I believe, has never been found. 
 
So if you bring all of that together, one sees a particular 
patterns emerging and that is where, once again, the notion 
20 
of connecting different phenomena or actions i.e. connecting 
the dots, actually, emerges at that particular time. 
 
And then that version, if you like, or that interpretation 
of events is totally justified as one sees, as I have indicated 
in my statement in November 2018 and attacked within 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 171 of 315 
 
cabinet by Mr Zwane and others on the question of the 
Gupta bank accounts. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   [laughs] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Later on the 11t h of October 2016, 
the lodging of the charges from – by Mr Shaun Abrahams 
and the withdrawal of the same charges on the 31s t of 
October thereafter.  So if you connect those and many other 
dots that were available at the time, there is a pattern and 
that is what I am referring to. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay.  So connecting the dots means that 
10 
mambo-jumbo?  Which two – who – which connections did he 
conspire with for two years Mr Gordhan? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I just answered the question 
Chairman.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I am not sure if you want me to go 
into that. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Gordhan.  Mr Mpofu, just 
repeat that question about conspiring? 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes.  Chair, you will remember I 
read from line six ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Ja, 
where 
it 
says 
about 
conspire 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   So, yes.  So there were two – I was trying 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 172 of 315 
 
to kill birds with one stone.  There is an issue of the 
connections. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And there is the issue of conspiring. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   But the climax of it is that you have been 
doing it for the last two years. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And that is why I then connected all those 
dots.  That is what Mr Gordhan says.  To say that who – 
10 
which connections was he conspiring with for the past two 
years?  In other words, from 2015 to 2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And the answer is unintelligible 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us just make sure we understand.  
Mr Gordhan, the question is when you said Mr Moyane had 
been doing it for the last two years now.  Mr Mpofu says he 
understands you to be talking about conspiring.  First 
confirm whether that understanding of his is correct.   
20 
 
You see where you are talking to Mr Moyane?  And you 
say:  And you conspire.  And he says:  Which connections?  
You say:  You have been doing it for the last two years now.   
 
Is Mr Mpofu’s understanding correct that what you are 
saying Mr Moyane had been doing for the last – for the 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 173 of 315 
 
previous two years is conspiring? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well, Chair I think I have explained 
that already Chair but let me briefly repeat what I said 
earlier on about...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes, I believe that there were 
conspiring individuals in the Hawks, in the NPA and Mr 
Moyane.  Number one.  And number two, I explained that the 
27 questions ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay hang on.   
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Just before ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on, hang on. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes, you recall that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just hang on.  I want us to make sure that 
we make progress.  What you have confirmed is that 
Mr Mpofu’s understanding that in that sentence you are 
talking about Mr Moyane conspiring for the previous two 
years is correct.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then if he wants to ask you the question 
of who he was conspiring with, then he can ask but you have 
confirmed that his understanding that you are accusing 
Mr Moyane of having conspired for two years, is correct.  Is 
– you accept? 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 174 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   That is my belief. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   That is my belief. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you very much.  Unfortunately, 
Chair.  Mr Moyane – I think he will make a good advocate 
because he asked the next question that Chair(?) [laughs] 
talks about.   
“Tom: 
10 
Which ones?  Be specific.” 
 
I think he was more successful than us.  And then Pravin 
says: 
“All.  The Hawks, NPA.  I mean, these are all your 
pals, are they not?  You conspire with them every 
other day.?   
 
We have already established...  Here is the question 
now.  We have already established that you have no 
evidence of this conspiring every day, correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  Mr Mpofu, I think when you 
20 
were asking him about every day, it was whether he had 
evidence that Mr Moyane had been working for the Hawks for 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Every day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Every day. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 175 of 315 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   But he is saying ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But it was working and it was the Hawks 
only.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Okay.  Sorry, this – it 
was not working, it was conspiring with them, whatever the 
difference is.  But do you have evidence that – you do not 
have evidence that he was working with them.  Do you have 
evidence that he was conspiring with the Hawks and the NPA 
10 
every other day? 
MINISTER 
GORDHAN: 
 
 
You 
did 
notice 
at 
line 
20 
Chairperson, that is a question.  And to which question – the 
next line says:  Tom:  Oh.  And the next line 24, he says:  
Now I conspire.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   So ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   And then it goes on.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   No ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So those were rhetorical questions 
if you like but I am firmly of the believe that when properly 
20 
interrogated, there will be evidence emerging from both the 
Hawks and General Ntlemeza, who headed the Hawks at the 
time, and the then NPA hierarchy, that there were conspiracy 
arrangements in this particular regard.  That is certainly my 
belief. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 176 of 315 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I – as I understand this discussion 
between you and Mr Moyane here.  It seems to me that 
Mr Moyane asked you which connections are those.  And 
then you say:  I just told you.  And then he repeats:  Which 
ones?  Be specific.   
 
Then you say:  All.  The Hawks, the NPA.  It seems to 
me that up to that point you are giving him an answer 
because he is saying which ones.  Be specific.  And then 
what follows is what appears to be the question.  I mean, 
10 
you say – I mean, these are all your pals, are they not?  So 
as I understand it and you must tell me if my understanding 
is correct.   
 
It looks like you do give him an answer to the question 
he puts:  Which ones?  Be specific.  And it seems you say 
the Hawks and the NPA.  Having said that ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   It says so at line 5.  It says so at 
line ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Line 5. 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   At line 5 on that page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let me finish. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I report to Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me finish.  Then you say – I mean, 
these are all your pals, are they not? 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 177 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   “You conspire with them every other 
day.” 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But do you accept my understanding or 
do you not accept that you do give the answer as to who 
you say he was conspiring with. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then the question relates to these 
are your pals, are they not, and you cannot conspire with 
10 
them every day.  You accept that, that understanding. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  Therefore your answer, the 
previous answer is a non-answer because the first part is a 
statement, all the Hawks and the NPA and even the one 
with a question mark: 
“I mean these are all your pals under you? 
That is a rhetorical question, you were stating that they are 
his pals.  And then in any event the next statement is a 
20 
statement, it is not a question. 
“You conspire with them every other day.” 
That is what I was asking you about. 
“So it is the Hawks and the NPA, you conspire with 
them every other day.” 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 178 of 315 
 
You do not have evidence of that.  Yes?  No? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I am sorry what is the question? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The question is whether you have 
evidence to back up the statement you made that Mr 
Moyane was conspiring with the Hawks and the NPA every 
other day. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Every other day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, obviously not, that was the manner I 
was speaking, Chair.  And this is a telephone conversation, 
this is not an exchange of correspondence or something 
10 
like that where there is precision in terms of what is going 
on but the general contention is yes, there was a 
conspiracy at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And you – I know that you said there 
was a conspiracy, I am asking you a different question.  
You – that accusation is one of your wild accusations, that 
is what I am saying.  You do not have evidence.  I do not 
know if you understand the notion of evidence.  I mean, we 
can all have rumours and all sorts of innuendos and so on.  
20 
It is very simple question, either you had evidence, 
someone said to you look, I have got a photograph of Mr 
Moyane meeting with the Hawks every other day or I have 
got information to that effect from Mr Moyane or from Mr 
Abrahams or you did not have that evidence and you relied 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 179 of 315 
 
on gossip and rumours and all sorts of talks in corridors.  
It is a simple issue really.  Did you have evidence, did you 
not?  Then we move on.  If you had it you will tell us. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chair, I have answered that 
question earlier on.  I said to you that at the time where 
people with information that such meetings did happened 
at particular coffee shops and so on.  I also said to you 
that I have to rack my memory, this is what, four, five, four 
years ago and one would have to try to remember, if I can, 
who might have said what in that particular regard. 
10 
 
And then there was the question, I think you might 
have raised it, Chair, that can somebody come and testify 
to that effect?  I said I do not know, let me reflect on that 
moment and come back to that particular point.  So the 
direct answer to what Mr Mpofu is saying is that I did have 
information 
given 
to 
me 
that such 
discussions 
were 
happening, whether that constitutes evidence or not, I do 
not know, you decide for yourself but it was not just pulled 
out of the air, there were particular activities that were 
going on which led to that suggestion and understanding 
20 
and I said I believe that that is the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, okay.  Mr Gordhan, you know this 
is a very serious process about state capture in South 
Africa.  You accept that …[intervenes] 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 180 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Yes, I am very aware of that, I am 
very aware of that. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, I am glad you are aware. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Particularly because of the 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] institutions of our 
country. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, do not speak over each other.  
Hang on, do not speak over each other. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja, can I finish, Mr Gordhan, do you 
mind? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let Mr Mpofu finish. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Oh, okay, I thought that was the 
question, sorry about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   The question is coming, do not worry.  
Do you expect anybody listening to your evidence now to 
take you seriously or this Commission to take what you are 
saying seriously that you were basing these accusations on 
what some people were saying and some  - the mumbo 
jumbo that you have just giving us about intangible sources 
20 
and, you know, gossip, as I call it?  Can a Commission of 
Inquiry rely on such in your estimation? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Have you finished? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, he has finished. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 181 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So there are three issues there, 
Mr Chairperson.  The first is do I realise that state capture 
is a serious matter and the answer is absolutely, that is 
why there are so many progressive democrats throughout 
this country who want to and have opposed state capture 
and the implications of state capture and the damage that 
it has caused to this country over the last few years and I 
imagine that is why the Public Protector requested that this 
Commission be set up, the previous Public Protector.  And 
it has damaged so many institutions, in this particular the 
10 
Revenue Services, which is under collecting what it should 
be collecting at this point in time.  Let me stop there. 
 
The second question is do I expect people take me 
seriously?  Of course.  If one looks at the evidence that 
has been in my statement, number one.   
Number the findings, of the Nugent Commission 
which 
described 
Mr 
Moyane’s 
conduct 
at 
SARS 
in 
particularly harsh terms and the destruction that he caused 
in a fair amount of detail and if the public is exposed to 
that they will be very angry and very upset about the fact 
20 
that this is what is done to an institution that was 
effectively collecting taxes. 
The third question is should the Commission rely on 
what I have to say?  I imagine that the Commission will 
connect its own dots, mine just being  one very humble 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 182 of 315 
 
contribution in that particular regard and will come to its 
conclusion, so I do not want to prejudge what the Chair is 
going to say but all of these matters that we are raising 
today are indeed in the context of the first question that 
you asked, extremely serious, must be enquired into and 
the 
people 
responsible 
for 
the 
damage 
caused 
to 
institutions must be held accountable.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN: Thank you.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you.  Well, I can tell you, Mr 
10 
Gordhan, that so far your dots are only in invisible ink so 
they are impossible to connect.  So I am saying to you that 
– and you keep on going to the Nugent Commission.  I said 
we should not go there. You remember that you had a 
secret meeting with Justice Nugent? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Is that a question? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   What do you think? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chairperson, may I respond? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you may respond.  Well, the question 
is …[intervenes] 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   There was no secret meeting, 
Judge Nugent issued a statement subsequently that there 
was that meeting and that similar meetings were held 
between that Commission and many other witnesses in 
order to understand what contribution each witness will 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 183 of 315 
 
make to the kind of evidence that the Nugent Commission 
required.  Certainly was no secret meeting. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   And in addition, Chairperson, Mr 
Mpofu did appear before Judge Nugent and had the 
opportunity to say and do whatever he felt was necessary 
at that point in time.   
 
And thirdly, there has always put this – let me call it 
intent for now, by Mr Moyane to review Judge Nugent’s 
findings and report and I believe to date, I am informed, 
10 
nothing has quite happened. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, thank you.  No, no, I agree with 
some of that.  The point I am really making is that the 
meeting you had with Judge Nugent was only revealed 
after it was exposed by the media, so that is why I called 
secrete meeting.  Maybe I should say an undisclosed 
meeting until it was revealed by the media but the issue of 
…[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   With due respect …[intervenes] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am sorry, sorry …[intervenes] 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Ja, with due respect, Chair, I think 
that is a matter that Mr Mpofu must resolve with Judge 
Nugent not with me. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, but he did not have a secret 
meeting with himself, you were there, I am resolving with 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 184 of 315 
 
you. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes, I will give …[intervenes] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I will resolve it with him when I meet 
him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Mpofu, I am not sure how far 
we need to go with the question of the status of that 
meeting for our purposes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well, Chair, I am sure as to why 
because this witness keeps on referring everything back to 
the Nugent Commission so it is my duty to demonstrate 
10 
that that Commission’s report is not worth the paper it is 
written on.  So I am saying, Mr …[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chairperson, may I intervene? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Can I speak? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second.  Are you moving on 
to the next question, Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, I just wanted to say one thing, 
Chair, on this and then the witness can comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Which is that they – I will put it as a 
20 
statement to make it easy and then you comment, Mr 
Gordhan.  I am saying if this Chairperson, for example, 
were to find out that he had a secret meeting or an 
undisclosed meeting with former President Zuma or any 
other important witness which is only disclosed after the 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 185 of 315 
 
meeting comes to know about it then that would – we would 
not take this Commission seriously, would you agree? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, I do not have a comment on 
that. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   If I can get to your earlier 
comments, Chairperson. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you, I am not surprised, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second, I think Mr Gordhan 
wanted to say something.  I think we should move away 
10 
from the status of that meeting after this, ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   He says he has no comment, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you still want to comment? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chairperson, all I want to ensure 
is that we do not mislead the public in this regard.  
Members of the Nugent Commission I believe met many 
people including the evidence leader meeting people.  
Similarly, I was met with by Adv Paul Pretorius long before 
my appearance in November 2018.  He is part of the 
Commission as a member of the legal team.  Similar 
20 
meetings I believe must be happening with other witnesses 
to 
formulate 
statements 
that 
will 
be 
helpful 
to 
the 
Commissioner.   
Now are we going to throw aspersions at this 
Commission that some people are attempting to do, just 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 186 of 315 
 
because 
those 
meetings/discussions/guidances 
actually 
provided by one component within the Commission, I would 
suggest no, that that in no way harms the integrity of this 
Commission or that of Justice Nugent as well.  But that is 
my humble view, I leave the rest to you, Chairperson, to 
deal with this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I think that is - let us move on, ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you.  No, I will move on, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Save to say your humble view is wrong, 
10 
a meeting with Mr Pretorius and having a meeting with the 
Chair are two different things.  I think anybody watching 
this knows that he is just dodging the question.  Okay, now 
let move on to page 1045. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chairperson …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Let us move …[intervenes]3 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Gordhan? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chairperson, Mr Mpofu is casting   
aspersions that he does not have to.  If he wants to 
20 
continue in discussion, I mean - and I do not think it will 
take us too far. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Let him stick to the facts and he 
must refer to paragraphs in my statement so I know what 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 187 of 315 
 
exactly he wants to talk about rather than travelling in the 
stratosphere. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   But please, he has no right 
whatsoever to cast aspersions on my integrity. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay, I am putting it as a fact, you had 
a secret meeting with Judge Nugent, as a fact. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us – we have dealt with that, let us 
move on. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, anyway let us move on. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us move on, ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   The last portion at 1045, paragraph 
114, this is where another display of your racism.  You then 
say – it says – you say: 
“What gives you the right to talk to your minister as 
you do.” 
And I think you seem to have some kind of God complex 
about being minister and how people should talk to 
ministers.  He says: 
“What gives you the right to talk to your minister 
20 
like this?” 
And Tom: 
“Now I conspired.” 
Pravin: 
“ What gives you the right to talk to your minister as 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 188 of 315 
 
you do?: 
Tom: 
“I…” 
And then you interrupt: 
“Nobody else in government does it.  So what gives 
you the right?  What gives you the courage to do it?  
What gives you the arrogance to do it?  You tell me. 
And the only thing is because you think you have 
certain things behind you.  Nobody else is as 
cheeky – is cheeky like you.” 
10 
Remember that?  Do you remember that transcript? 
MINISTER 
GORDHAN: 
 
 
What 
is 
the 
question, 
Chairperson? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Do you remember that?  That is a 
question, the question mark at the end of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you want – you are asking whether 
he remember saying …[intervenes] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   That part of the conversation, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That conversation, okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   It is in the transcript, Chair.  So I 
20 
accept the transcript as being correct and I want to 
continue along the lines that Mr Mpofu has started. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on …[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Which was after line 5 on 1045, 
8.40 …[intervenes] 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 189 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Mr Gordhan.  At this stage the 
question was whether you remember this conversation.  
The answer is yes.  Let us see what next. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And of course your counsel is also 
watching and some of the things she will raise in re-
examination but the question was whether …[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, but Chair, let me correct what 
I said.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I did not say I remember the 
conversation.  I said it is in the transcript so I take it for it 
is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes, ja, what you said is you accept 
the transcript as correct. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the sense that it reflects what 
transpired between you and Mr Moyane. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you, Chair, no I am learning how 
to decode these answers, so that is a yes, that long thing.  
Okay, so there you use one of the words I spoke to you 
about which are condensing and belittling to African 
people, I can assure you, by calling another man who is in 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 190 of 315 
 
your age group cheeky.  Is that how you speak to people 
that you respect or is that reserved for African people? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chair, as I have said several times 
in this process I reject with absolute contempt any 
suggestion that there is racism involved in my interactions, 
number one.  
 
Number two, that word cheeky is about attitude, not 
the persona.  So if I am met with a non-answer to my first 
question on the first stage of this transcript, the first issue 
I raise: 
10 
“Please do not do it again until we meet it on 
Monday.” 
If you go through the transcript I do not receive any such 
assurance and that is why, Chair, I was going to point out 
line 10, 11 and 12 to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Right?  Particularly 11 and 12 
which says: 
“Please do not – stop attacks on Judge Davis, that 
is the request to you.” 
20 
Not an instruction, that is a request to you.  It is about 
mentoring somebody and guiding them on what is proper in 
the relationship between a public servant and a member of 
the judiciary.  There is nothing to do with racism.  To 
reduce it to racism is to take the easiest route out in order 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 191 of 315 
 
to malign my character and that is actually something, as I 
said, I totally reject but I understand that desperation often 
leads to these sorts of adventures, so let me leave it at 
that. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay.  Well, grow up, Mr Gordhan, do 
not be cheeky.  How does that feel? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well, I think it is the way it comes, 
Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja, well I can tell you how it feels for 
people like me, you must – let me give you advice, you 
10 
must never again belittle African people the way you did in 
this 
conversation 
by 
telling 
them 
that 
they 
are 
…[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I did not – I did not …(intervenes) 
ADV MPOFU SC:   That they are cheeky. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chairperson [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   You must [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] okay? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Can I respond, Chair? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, just one second.  Ms Le Roux, I 
see you want to say something? 
ADV LE ROUX:   Yes, Chair.  Can I just object to Mr 
Mpofu’s editorialising on the answers, I understand he 
must …[intervenes] 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 192 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, just repeat that sentence? 
ADV LE ROUX:   Can I just object to Mr Mpofu’s 
editorialising on the answers he is getting from the 
witness.  He may be frustrated but we now seem to be 
descending into a personal spat between the advocate and 
the witness and I do not think that is assisting the 
Commission in completing this cross-examination today.  , I 
just want to note that objection. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think they were – we were about 
to move on and make progress.  I thought [inaudible – 
10 
speaking simultaneously] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair.  No, Chair, I am 
not – there is nothing personal.  Well, the racism is 
personal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   But apart from that there is – I mean, I 
have no business being personal with Mr Gordhan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I mean, it really is – I am think I am just 
doing my job. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Gordhan is it fine if we move on? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   It is either the words are in the 
transcript cheeky and you must grow up or they are not, it 
is not editorializing, it is here in black and white.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Gordhan is it fine if we move on? 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 193 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chair, can we have a five minute 
bathroom break? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   He wants to go to the … 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Gordhan is asking for a short five 
minutes break.  Let us have it otherwise we are 17 minutes 
towards the end of the third hour. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So at the end of the third hour we will 
stop but we will add the five minutes. 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will take a five minutes break.  We 
adjourn. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Thank you. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, we will wait for Mr Gordhan to 
appear on the screen.  In the meantime – oh, okay, Mr 
Gordhan is back.  We are at about what, eight minutes, 
20 
nine minutes to five.  What is your assessment of how 
much more time you need Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, Chair, I am sorry – yes I have just 
had a discussion with Ms Le Roux.  At the rate we are 
going honestly there is not – I do not see my cross-
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 194 of 315 
 
examination, the rest of it lasting for less than another two 
hours.  So we thought maybe we go for another hour and 
then assess.  We are all trying as much as possible not to 
come back, not to have to come back. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   But if it can avoided, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well, Chair, I am sorry to be so forward 
as to say that the fact that maybe other witnesses are not 
coming for the rest of the week might make it possible.  
10 
Unfortunately, I am not available, for example, tomorrow 
but maybe we could slot in an hour somewhere later on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let us – I would urge you to try and 
see whether if I give you another hour, which would be the 
fourth hour, whether you cannot finish. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, I will not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And how much would be left after that. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me also ask Ms Le Roux.  At this 
stage in terms of your assessment how much time would 
20 
you need for re-examination? 
ADV LE ROUX:   Chair, I will obviously try to …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I will not hold you to it at the end

ADV LE ROUX:   Do not hold me to it. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 195 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I just want to …[intervenes] 
ADV LE ROUX:   I will try to do it as quickly as possible 
but I would think 15, 20 minutes at the moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, not that is …[intervenes] 
ADV LE ROUX:   And certainly if we could complete. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV LE ROUX:   And I understand the imposition on you 
and the kitchen staff to sit late tonight. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no I …[intervenes] 
ADV LE ROUX:   I am sure every would prefer to finish. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I would like if possible to finish.  
That is fine.  Let us – let me check whether – how much 
time Mr Chaskalson – or, Mr Chaskalson, in terms of your 
own re-examination you might or might not need it but it 
depends on what remains, but I am not sure whether you 
would come before – I think you would come first before Ms 
Le Roux.  Have got any assessment or you are not able to 
make that? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, I do not have an 
assessment, I am sort of here standing in for Mr Franklin. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   For someone else, yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So I think it might be best for Ms 
Le Roux to go first. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   And then for me to possibly take 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 196 of 315 
 
an instruction from Mr Franklin if he is watching and well or 
well enough to watch. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   But at present I would not 
imagine much re-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. Okay, alright. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Chair, perhaps – sorry, perhaps what we 
could also consider is if my learned friend finishes tonight 
and we have a twenty minute re-examination that we fit 
into your calendar because it is only re-exam between the 
10 
evidence leaders and myself.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Perhaps that is a way – then you do not 
have to worry about finding time tonight for re-exam.  Mr 
Mpofu could finish today and then we find the re-exam 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine.  I think let us - 
Mr Mpofu, let us say just make your best effort to see how 
much you can cover in the next hour. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I will try, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then we take it from there. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Gordhan, you understand what we 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 197 of 315 
 
are talking about, hey? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I do, Chair, but I may place some -
record publicly that the next two weeks are particularly 
busy set of weeks for us to conclude both parliament and 
work of the executive.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So please keep that in mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, that is fine.  If we do not 
finish today the probability would be that we – I would be 
looking at slotting your evidence during one of the 
10 
evenings.  That is what I would be looking at and you 
would be allowed to testify like you do today from where 
you are.  So, in other words, the chances are that it would 
not be during the day as it was today and that might make 
things easier, I do not know. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   We also have meetings in the 
evening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the evenings, ja. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, I note that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, not that is alright, I think we 
20 
…[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   May I clarify? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chair, may I clarify? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 198 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   That I think it is time for Mr 
Moyane to come and give his evidence.  I mean, we are in 
your hands, I understand but this is a mere cross-
examination some of which are telephone conversations 
and so on [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   He cannot testify before you finish your 
cross-examination. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we have got to finish your evidence 
first and then he will come in due course.   
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Thank you, Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue, let us continue. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And I am sure if you have cabinet 
meetings, as we know that this is an important process, the 
President will excuse you.  No? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I am not going to provide any 
response to that right now, Chair.  I will have to look at 
what our diaries required.  There are votes in parliament 
for example on the budget and so on which can take an 
inordinate amount of time. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So let us work on your pragmatic 
approach, Chairperson, and see what we can fit in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me say this.  If we are looking at 
within the next two weeks the date can be negotiated.   
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 199 of 315 
 
The days that we do not negotiate is when we give you a 
reasonable notice.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if we are talking about the next two 
weeks everybody will be consulted to see …[intervenes] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja, fair enough, thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you.  Okay, Mr – may I continue, 
Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you may continue. 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Now Mr Gordhan the next topic I want 
to talk about is – going back now to the core issues of 
state capture.  You are one of the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Mpofu, can I put away this 
bundle now that we were looking at?  Which one do 
…[intervenes] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Oh, the one of the transcripts?  Yes, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the one with the transcripts. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am done with that, ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well, maybe just to wrap it up, I will just 
put a proposition.  That exercise, Mr Gordhan, would 
demonstrate using the three signals that I referred you to, 
shouting down at a person, calling them to – telling them to 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 200 of 315 
 
grow up, as if they were a child and calling them cheeky, 
those are the archetypical signals of a racist attitude.  
What is comment? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chair, let me first say that racism 
works in odd ways and perhaps - and unexplored in this 
exchange of views is whether Mr Moyane is actually the 
racist in this bargain. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Oh. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Because it is he who defies the 
authority of a minister who happens to come from a 
10 
particular community.  It is he that shows hostility in the 
first instance.  It is he who attempts to dictate the terms.  
So I want to suggest that whatever the telltale signs are 
that Mr Mpofu is trying to assign me can well be even more 
strongly assigned to Mr Moyane and perhaps when he 
gives his evidence, he can be cross-examined on some of 
those as well. So I would argue that the real racist attitude 
is not from me because my history does not prove that, it 
does come from Mr Moyane.    
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay, well maybe when he testifies you 
20 
will also being your own transcript.  I am saying from this 
transcript there was no sign of racism from him, there was 
sign of racism from you. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I am basing this – Chairperson, I 
am not basing it on one telephone conversation during 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 201 of 315 
 
which there was open deviance about the position of an 
member of the judiciary, a judge and a simple request, do 
not attack a judge.  That is how the rest of it followed.  Mr 
Mpofu has not even said that Mr Moyane concedes that he 
was wrong to attack a judge in whatever form. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, no, thank you, I do not know about 
Mr Moyane …[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So he wants to [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am sorry, Mr Gordhan. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, you are talking over each other. 
Okay, Mr Gordhan, finish? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  So that transcript does not prove 
anything except what are an exchange of views on a 
particular matter so the substance and the gravitas of the 
matter is do public servants go around attacking judges 
and is that the kind of value system and culture that we 
want to crate within our democracy?  And I suggest no.  So 
Mr Moyane must come and explain himself in relation to 
that transcript.  But thank you, I end there. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you.  No, thank you, Mr Gordhan, 
for your comfort, I do not care what Mr Moyane has to say 
about it, I can give you the assurance that if he attacked a 
judge he was wrong, there is no excuse for that.  Like 
whatever – if he did, if he beat up somebody he was wrong 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 202 of 315 
 
but none of that gives you a right to display racist attitudes 
against him.  That is all I am saying.  I am not justifying – 
whatever he did, he defied you, he did not bow before you 
and kiss your feet, that is fine, but the issue is that you 
had no right to be racist to him, whatever he had done 
wrong.  Okay?  Do you understand that? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So let me answer that finally, 
Chairperson, because it seems we are going around the 
same tree all the time.  I reject any notion of racism in my 
behaviour and I now put it to you that Mr Moyane actually 
10 
was the racist in this particular equation.  But let us leave 
it at that.  And I reject any suggestion whatsoever that my 
affinity to non-racialism as an important value both in the 
Freedom Charter and in our Constitution should be dealt 
with in any way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us move on.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, thank you.  So I was saying the – 
you are one of the people who refers to the so-called nine 
wasted years, correct, of state capture. 
MINISTER 
GORDHAN: 
 
 
Do 
not 
recall 
using 
that 
20 
terminology. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Are you sure? 
CHAIRPERSON:   He says he cannot recall. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I am not sure, I just said I – Chair, 
I just said I do not recall using that terminology but let me 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 203 of 315 
 
help Mr Mpofu.  There is no doubt that from about 2011 
onwards when the first interventions began to take place in 
state owned entities as we now see it via hindsight it is 
clear that we lost a lot of value, we lost the gravitas that 
we had in many institutions, state owned enterprises and 
SARS being amongst them.  We had a practice of chasing 
away black professionals who were honest and who had 
integrity and who refused to be manipulated in any kind of 
way either through procurement systems or other systems 
and all of that follows a pattern that state capture, as 
10 
concept, that really describes.  So yes, these have been 
years in which as economists would say we have had a 
huge opportunity cost. 
ADV MPOFU SC:    Yes, thank you.  And you also 
subscribe to the idea that – I think the Chair referred to 
this, he asked you towards the end of your evidence in 
2018 about where were people when all these things were 
happening and what responsibility you take.  So do you – 
you also subscribe to the idea that there are in the 
governing party or the governing structures there were 
20 
what we call devils and angels.  In other words there were 
those people who were peddlers of state capture and then 
there were other angels who were trying to stop it, like 
you.  Yes? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So where was I during this period?  
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 204 of 315 
 
I was in some of part a member of the executive and in 
other part of it I was a member of parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Gordhan. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The question is whether you subscribed 
to the notion that during those years or during that time 
there were those who were viewed and angels and those 
who were viewed – I think Mr Mpofu said the devils or 
those were seen as perpetrating state capture.  Mr Mpofu, 
did I capture it correctly? 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   You did, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And just to round it off, a nice way of 
putting it by Gogo Aubrey Matshiqi.  He says to prove that 
everyone was really rogue, he says that there were devils 
with wings and angels with horns.  So which one did you 
fall into? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, well firstly you want to know 
whether 
he 
subscribes 
to 
[inaudible 
– 
speaking 
simultaneously] 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   To the notion, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you can talk about whether he 
belonged to any of those categories? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Gordhan, you understand the 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 205 of 315 
 
question? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chair, with respect, I want to 
disagree with you.  I am making crisp notes to the best of 
my abilities of what Mr Mpofu says.  So the first question 
here is …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and I was not making  [inaudible] so 
feel free to disagree. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes.  No, thank you for the liberty.  
So the first question was where were you?  The second 
question was what was happening in the governing party 
10 
and then he changed it to governing structure and the third 
question is the one you referred to, the so-called devils 
and angels and then there’s a quotation from a public 
commentator.  So I am responding to the first question if I 
may, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.                                               . 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay, sorry, Mr Gordhan, let me just 
assist you.  And I promise you I will give you a chance to 
respond, 
as 
you 
wish. 
 
But 
the 
issue 
of 
one 
of 
paraphrasing the chair, it was just a build-up to the 
20 
question but if you want to deal with that where were you 
part that is also fine. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes, no, I think I want to briefly so 
that everybody who has an interest in this matter, Chair, 
can understand where we come from. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 206 of 315 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Sure. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So I was, as I said, a member of 
executive and subsequently a member of parliament and 
then again a member of the executive and during that 
process, as I said very transparently in paragraph 14 of my 
statement in November 2018, which if you do not mind I am 
going to quote two lines: 
“I must emphasise that my knowledge and my 
understanding of state capture like that of the rest 
of the country evolved over time.  So as we began 
10 
to understand…” 
And I say we, I refer to progressive democrats in the 
governing party, in civil society and in other entities and 
structures within the state and beyond.  The understanding 
of what was going on evolved over time and if one has to 
point to a particular moment it is certainly the reporting of 
investigative journalists, I think it said in the middle of 
about 2017 or so, Chairperson, who then reported on the 
Gupta Leaks, the emails which emails then exposed the 
roles of different people, it exposed the role of Bell 
20 
Pottinger as a front, it exposed the relationship between 
certain South Africans who today parade around as if they 
are 
renewed 
democrats 
but 
they 
are 
the 
ones 
who 
concocted certain fake notions and narratives together with 
Bell Pottinger, had them involved into what …[intervenes] 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 207 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am interrupting you, Mr 
Gordhan, I just want to follow.  You have answered the 
question of where you were. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So which one are you answering now, I 
just want to follow.   
MINISTER GORDHAN:   The second says what was 
happening in the governing party and structures and 
beyond as well and I then sum up my point on so-called 
devils and angels. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Because devils and angels is not 
my notion, it is a notion that is being introduced by Mr 
Mpofu.  So what I am – the main point I am making is that 
the understanding of what we today called state capture 
evolved over time, number one. 
 
Number two, that when the Gupta Leaks happened 
many, many, many connections and the relationships 
became clear. 
 
Number three, that there were outside agencies like 
20 
Bell Pottinger which many people seem to have forgotten, 
that were hired in order to create particular narratives 
which are used politically even today. 
 
And number four, within the governing structures                
clearly there were moments when – and this is as I said in 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 208 of 315 
 
November 2018 as well, discussions that are happening in 
cabinet and instances when people who people that these 
were wrong things that were happening including myself 
who ensured that certain decisions were not made or went 
to court, for example, on the Gupta bank accounts to seek 
guidance on what was the proper thing to do to bolster 
one’s position about whether a member of the executive 
could 
interfere 
in 
the 
relationship 
between 
an 
accountholder and the financial institution. 
 
So there were certainly those who were doing that 
10 
work and it was good work.  That work continued through 
the parliamentary committee and the chair at the time of 
the inquiry, Ms Ranto, who is no longer in parliament,  
when we interrogated what was going on at Eskom and 
there is a proper report available in that regard adopted by 
the National Assembly which describes the malfeasance 
have continued and the capture of Eskom over that 
particular period of time and of course there were those in 
governing structures and in various political parties who 
were engaged in these corrupt activities and malfeasance 
20 
as well.  If you want to call them devils and angels you 
may do that but as far as I am concerned there were 
democratic activists like myself in plenty around South 
Africa who objected to what was going on and made their 
objection known in various forms. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 209 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you.  In other words you were 
one of the angels? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No comment. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay.  Now there is a part – when you 
read paragraph 14 there is a part that you did not read, 
you said it evolved over time and so on and then you said: 
“The significance under interrelationship of such 
events were revealed progressively and often only 
in hindsight given the state capture activities.” 
10 
Correct. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes, I referred to that in my earlier 
remarks now. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  And then you go on, you say: 
“Repeated changes to cabinet.” 
So these were some of the activities of state capture.  Who 
are you accusing there of state capture?  Who repeatedly 
changed the cabinet? 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Well, 
maybe 
let 
us 
start 
with 
…[intervenes]3 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well, I think …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Gordhan, let us start with 
this, repeated changes to – in cabinet, do you confirm that 
that is part of what was manifestation as far as you are 
concerned of state capture? 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 210 of 315 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, that is the first component.  There 
are other that follow in a paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright.  Mr Mpofu, I think 
your question …[intervenes] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, thank you.  The question, ja, who 
in the state capture network, who did that first offence of 
repeated changes to cabinet? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chair, with your permission, can I 
read the whole sentence so that the context is clear? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, we are talking it step-by-step.  
10 
Believe we I will read the full sentence, I am just dealing 
with that specific issue. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Who makes the changes?  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  According to the Constitution all 
cabinet ministers are appointed at the discretion of the 
President. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   And serve at his favour. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay, fine, so that will be President 
20 
Zuma, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   At that time. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  And then – okay, the rest of the 
sentence which you want to go to, it says: 
“To the boards of - in other words, repeated 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 211 of 315 
 
changes to the boards of state owned companies 
and in the leadership of key institutions and organs 
of state often without rational explanation were 
done to take control of such institutions.” 
So the motive for those issues, repeated changes to the 
cabinet and to the boards were done to control such 
institutions by the peddlers of state capture, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes, Chairperson, the answer is 
yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   And if you look lower down under 
paragraph 16.1 and what follows it explains how typically 
within this kind of conceptual framework different  role-
players play different parts.  So where there are changes 
to the boards of SOEs or SOCs that will be led by a 
minister.  In other instances, for example, the NPA, had 
effected changes of the head of the Prosecuting Authority. 
I think it is again the President who has that discretion as 
well. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja. 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   And if one then looks this – this 
my last sentence, if one then looks at it, all of these issues 
retrospectively there is absolutely no doubt that control in 
one form or another, as I said many hours ago, is a crucial 
part and start of the progress of repurposing institutions.   
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 212 of 315 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  So at 16.1 you say you relied on 
the books to define state capture and you say: 
“They are the patrons of resources, for example 
Zuma and the Guptas, and they sit at the apex 
directly 
responsible 
for 
the 
predation 
and 
exploitation.” 
Do you remember adopting that quotation? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes, that quotation, just for 
everyone to know, is from the work done by a group of 
academics which called Betrayal of the Promise report. 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  And they – those words are, 
Chairperson, in quotations taken from that publication.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, which you adopted and put in your 
statement. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Oh yes – no, it is there, you are 
reading it, it is 16.1, yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, thank you.  So now that we have 
gone through those parts I wanted to ask you – it is a 
question that I asked earlier, do you have any evidence 
20 
that President Zuma was part of state capture? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   What I have to say in relation to 
the former President is in my statement. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Answer the question please, Mr 
Gordhan, it is late now.  Do you have any evidence 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 213 of 315 
 
whether hat President Zuma was involved in state capture 
and that his repeated changes to cabinet was part of that 
…[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chairperson, Chairperson, with 
great respect, I thought we had objections to this line of 
questioning but I see it is re-entering the scope.  I am not 
here to account for my views on the former President, I am 
here to account for my views in respect of Mr Moyane and 
where that is in relation to the former President I will say 
so. 
10 
 
The second point I am making is that that is 
exhaustively covered in my experience, for example the 
Nuclear Deal or non-deal, the question of the Gupta bank 
accounts and others have come before the Commission to 
give other pieces evidence as well. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   But to the extent that I am aware, 
those are contained in this affidavit. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay, I will move on. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Under oath. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Assuming you do not want to answer 
that first question.  Okay, so …[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I have answered your question. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay, thank you.  So of the – or you say 
well, of the good guys, the people who were not for state 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 214 of 315 
 
capture, that would be people like you, Mr Jonas, Mr 
Nhlanhla Nene, it would include those kinds of people, 
correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   It depends on your vantage point 
if one wears a particular …[intervenes] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Not mine, sorry. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Let me repeat what I said in a 
different form, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   It depends on one’s vantage point 
10 
and one’s political orientation and which hat or beret one 
might be wearing on a particular occasion.  So yes, if you 
look at it one vantage point, these are all individuals 
amongst many, many others who took a stand on various 
issues.  So in the case of the former Deputy Minister 
Jonas, according to the evidence he gave before the 
Commission, he was offered a bribe of R600 million and he 
turned down that bribe.  So depending, as I say, where you 
stand, you know, you could be categorised in one way of 
another depending on the hat or beret you wear. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, thank you for that, I will take that 
as a compliment, so – but now do you remember the 
question?  The question is it has nothing to do with 
apparel, it is whether the people who were the fighters of 
state capture, to extend your metaphor, that apparel, the 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 215 of 315 
 
fighters of state capture included you, Mr Mcebisi Jonas 
and Mr Nhlanhla Nene. Yes, no? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am …[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Each one of made a contribution, 
Chairperson, where we saw fit. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you.  Alright, now you – and in 
the – do you take any responsibility for your role in the 
perpetration of state capture over those years? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   None at all, okay. 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Now – yes, do you accept that state 
capture essentially was about capturing the Treasury or let 
us call it the till, capturing the money. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Invariably that is what it amounts 
to. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  Thank you.  And the …[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   It could be that – Chairperson, it 
could 
be 
also 
facilitating 
tenders, 
procurement 
and 
contracts, it takes various forms and some people have 
20 
done it at a municipal level, others have done it at an 
agency 
level, 
yet 
others 
at 
provincial 
and 
National 
Government level, so …[intervenes] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, no, no, I accept that. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Depending [inaudible – speaking 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 216 of 315 
 
simultaneously] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes even – I am sorry, I am sorry, Mr 
Gordhan, I accept that and even in the private sector but 
my question is a specific one. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:    Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Do you accept that at the centre of 
state capture would be a capture of the Treasury.  That 
makes sense, if you want to rob a bank you must capture 
the vault, you know, the till.  So to that extent do you 
accept that Treasury was at the nucleus of the project? 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well I wouldn’t say nucleus but it 
was the respondent in order to misallocate certain things 
happening.  I mean if that question has to be asked to 
those who actually designed the Capture strategy, because 
I am not one of them and they would know best what their 
strategy was, why they started with State owned entities, 
and in today’s terms why some political parties started at 
the municipal level for example, but that is a question they 
should answer. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, I am sure you are referring to your 
20 
political party, but I am saying that the -  when it comes to 
the – if you – I am happy with your description that 
Treasury was like a key component, let’s work with that.  
So the fact is that for more than seven of the nine years 
you and Mr Nene were entrusted with the Treasury with the 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 217 of 315 
 
key component of State Capture by President Zuma, 
correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you.  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Buying under calculation but I will 
take your word for it. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well you can take my word, you were 
there for the entire five years from 2014 and 2019 that 
whole term that President Zuma put you in charge of the 
Treasury, the key component of State Capture, correct? 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Correct. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, and then after that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was he not dismissed in 2017? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, no that was the…[intervene]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You said 2014 to 2019? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No I beg your pardon its 2009 to 
2014, Chair. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes 2009 to 2014. President Zuma put 
20 
you in charge of the Treasury, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   For the full term, that would be I think 
the fourth… 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I beg your pardon? 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 218 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   The question is whether you confirm that 
from 2009 to 2014 a full term of 5 years that President 
Zuma had put you, had appointed you as Minister of 
Finance? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   After that you – in the second term you 
served another let us say one and half years when you 
were reappointed by President Zuma again to the Treasury 
which we have defined as the key component of State 
Capture, correct? 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And between that…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second Mr Mpofu.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   I’m sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you said as the key component.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   A key. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it should be a key in terms of 
what he had said. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Oh no, no fair enough Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, a key and between that re-
appointment of yours the person who held the position in 
that key component was Minister Nene one of the angels, 
correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Minister Nene will have been 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 219 of 315 
 
appointed after the 2014 elections.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, I’m sorry 2014 elections. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Can I finish please; can I finish? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja sorry no I made a mistake, I’m just 
correcting myself, sorry Mr Gordhan. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So Minister Nene was the Chair 
after the 2014 elections until the  9 t h of December if I 
recall 2015 then he was summarily dismissed from that 
position and then that was followed by Mr Van Rooyen 
10 
which is referred to as a weekend special and because of 
the reactions of the market and various concerns the 
people and the institutions I was approached as my 
statement says to you in November 2018 on the evening of 
the 13 t h of December 2015 to take up that position again 
and where I was requested that just to remind everyone, I 
said why not Mr Molokethi or Mr Jonas.  I didn’t accept the 
position immediately just for the record, thank you. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No that’s true and Mr Zuma said no 
those people are not acceptable to me I want you, correct? 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Correct. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, now my question is does it make 
sense to you if President Zuma is supposed to be this 
kingpin of State Capture and he changes cabinet in order 
to enable it for him to appoint you for seven of the so-
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 220 of 315 
 
called nine wasted years, you and Mr Nene to be in charge 
of the very, of a key component of the State Capture such 
as Treasury.  
Do you think that would make sense to any neutral 
person observing that – it is like saying somebody wants to 
rob a bank puts the person at the vault who is most likely 
to stop the robbery if you get my metaphor, does it make 
sense?  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well it depends Chairperson, have 
you concluded Mr Mpofu? 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, yes I’m done. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Okay. So Mr Chairperson it 
depends again on what phenomenon one is looking.  So let 
us take the evidence that you have had before the 
Commission which I am not familiar with in absolute detail.  
I did some of it and I think the Director General of the 
Treasury maybe two Director Generals have done more in 
that regard.  Mr Nene would have done somewhat in that 
regard as well in relations to the so called nuclear deal.   
So that didn’t take, it didn’t originate in the 
20 
Treasury, it wasn’t processed in the Treasury.  The first set 
of figures were introduced in the Treasury, in fact the 
Treasury as I recall it was excluded from that process and I 
think you have had details before you in that particular 
regard and various people put up, various forms of 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 221 of 315 
 
resistance and some like Mr Nene paid the price for it and 
that deal as we stand today did not materialise.   
So that is one example where you would have 
different agencies or different government departments 
engaging in particular activities that are not directly 
related to the Treasury.  They will come to the Treasury 
when there are fiscal implications or financial implications 
or authority in terms of Section 54 of the Public Finance 
Management Act is actually required and then the Treasury 
has in the case of Denel Asia would have a sight of what 
10 
particular a department is doing and will be then able to 
respond in that particular regard.   
So then your Finance Minister didn’t mean that the 
Finance Minister had total control over everything that 
happened in government.  I supposed if we did have that 
kind of capacity which we didn’t and in law we didn’t either, 
many more so-called deals could have been stopped or 
interrupted in the process as well but this is all in relation 
to the Treasury I’m not sure where Mr Moyane fits in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well the question is whether you think it 
20 
makes, it made sense for Mr Zuma to appoint you and Mr 
Nene during the respective, your respective terms as 
Ministers of Finance during a time when you, when acts of 
State Capture where happening.  I think that is the 
essence of the question.  
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 222 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Let me have them Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words…[intervene] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   It does make sense.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   It does make sense.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, continue. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   It make sense because the 
Finance Minister and the Treasury and together with the 
Reserve Bank which have also been a target over a period 
of time are key institutions that foreign rating agencies, 
10 
foreign 
lenders, 
local 
lenders 
and 
others 
who 
are 
interested 
in 
evaluating 
whether 
we 
have 
a 
stable 
investment plan within South Africa would be watching in 
order to make decisions that would be positive as far as 
South Africa is concerned. So it is absolutely plausible to 
have people who would be “respected in the market place” 
and Mr Van Rooyen’s position for example is a classic 
example of the opposite in this particular regard.    
And for government to be able to borrow in the 
early years of 2009/10 when we had a very low deficit and 
20 
a very low debt GDP level and it helped us to borrow 
because of the percentages or ratios at that time but 
increasingly because of the financial crisis the country had 
to borrow in order to sustain its level off expenditure and 
10% of that borrowing maximum happened in foreign 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 223 of 315 
 
currency and the rest was borrowed in local currency within 
South Africa’s capital markets.   
So it makes absolute sense to have people who would have 
credibility to the project whilst - and this refers to my 
earlier answer around the Treasury - all sorts of things 
could be happening, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well let me just say this, the two of 
you have been doing quite well about not talking over each 
other let us keep it that way I think we are making 
progress. 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you Chair but I hope that is not 
condoning these long unnecessary answers because really 
that’s not the question I asked but that’s fine.  The 
consequence would be it is going to take longer.  So I’m no 
longer going to try and get the answers.   
So okay now you accept that you said the four-day 
appointment of Mr Van Rooyen was an attempt again to 
capture the Treasury, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Correct.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, now when that did not work out of 
20 
all the 57million citizens of South Africa, you had a second 
choice to go to Treasury and even when you said no why 
do you not take Mr Jonas and this one President Zuma said 
no I want you, is that a true reflection what happened?  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   He requested me to take that 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 224 of 315 
 
position.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, thank you.  Now the only point I 
was making is and again this is just for comment is that to 
- I think to a neutral South African you would expect then 
President Zuma to put somebody there who is pliable and 
is part of the State Capture project because it would be 
foolhardy for him to put someone who is going to block his 
project and that is as you have said he had the sole right 
to change Ministers.  He did not have to consult anyone so 
it is from that point of view that I am saying it was strange 
10 
but if you do not find it strange then we can move on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to comment on that 
proposition Mr Gordhan namely the proposition is that if Mr 
Zuma wanted to put in somebody who could, who would 
facilitate State Capture as Minister of Finance that is what 
he could have done but instead he appointed you and not 
somebody who would facilitate State Capture and it does 
not make sense that he put in somebody who would be 
against State Capture.  Mr Mpofu you must tell me if I have 
not summarised it correctly. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, you have summarised it correctly 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   But if I can just can take a liberty Mr 
Gordhan and just to explain why I’m asking that question.  
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 225 of 315 
 
I’m asking that question in relation to Mr Moyane because 
you have accused him of - in his State Capture activities 
one of the motives was to try and remove you from being 
Minister of Finance and the gist of what I am saying is that 
that also does not make sense it is actually completely 
senseless because if Mr Moyane and or Mr Zuma wanted to 
remove you from being Minister of Finance the President 
would just remove you and nobody would ask him.  So he 
did not need Mr Moyane’s help.  You understand your 
position you can comment on it?  
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   The Chair will decide. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you - would you like to comment on 
that proposition? 
MINISTER 
GORDHAN: 
 
 
Yes, 
because 
we 
misunderstanding what we saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Mr. Zuma, as a former President 
did actually appoint someone whose credentials were 
dubious, Mr Van Rooyen, in the first instance.  He did fire 
somebody who gave South Africa that credibility, Mr Nene, 
20 
and it is only the market reaction the fallen rand, the fallen 
increase borrowing cost for South Africa what happened 
within the stock exchange and those numbers are all 
available Chairperson and that was presented to you when 
I was with you in November 2018.   
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 226 of 315 
 
That shock actually woke everybody up and as a 
result the former President approached me because in 
somebody’s explanation would then the governing party 
and elsewhere I would be able to stabilise or assist in 
stabilising the situation.  So that attempt was made if one 
uses the other institutions as an examples in State owned 
companies 
you 
have 
evidence 
before 
you 
already 
I 
presume you going to get more.  In the law enforcement 
agencies, I presume you going to go into that as well 
Chairperson.  
10 
There are an abundance, abundance of examples of 
appointees of the top level who would do one kind of 
bidding or another either for themselves or for some 
associate or the other in the private sector or within 
government itself.  So the appointment of Mr Moyane at 
SARS follows a pattern.  So we not talking about every 
institution having the market sensitivity if one can use that 
terminology that a Treasury or reserve bank would have, 
other institutions were available for one or the other form 
of intervention and if one looks at that picture then the 
20 
proposition is not all that pliable that you only need pliable 
people within the Treasury.  You needed pliable people 
elsewhere within the government system as well and 
perhaps equally pliable people in the private sector. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, thank you well in part of that 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 227 of 315 
 
answer you said that the appointment of Minster Van 
Rooyen was or he was a dubious character that is also just 
an unnecessary insult on somebody.  Mr Van Rooyen holds 
an MSC in finance economic policy and Africa studies from 
the University of London and a master ’s degree in public 
development and management from the University of 
Witwatersrand.  So what makes his appointment dubious 
and not you, you are just a pharmacist are you not?   
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, no I am a very humble 
pharmacist and an activist and I do not really need to hide 
10 
that and history will judge whether I made a valid 
contribution to the countries growth or not so the country 
and everybody else could decide.  Secondly as far as Mr 
Van Rooyen is concerned certificates and credibility are 
two different concepts.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes and while we are still on the 
question of qualifications.  You also appointed your friend 
Mr Pillay at SARS, correct?   
MINISTER GORDHAN:   He went through a process.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, no I accept that but you appointed 
20 
him – he does not have any qualifications above matric as 
well, correct?  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, I did not appoint him I was 
merely the Deputy Commissioner at the time.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mpofu.  
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 228 of 315 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   That is not the question I am asking.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mpofu I am sorry is the suggestion 
that to the extent that he may have appointed Mr Pillay 
with whatever qualifications he Mr Pillay had…[intervene]   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Or did not have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or did not have that was part of 
advancing State Capture or…[intervene] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh is that the proposition? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   That is the proposition because okay let 
10 
me take one step back.  You understand that corruption 
which is State Capture takes many forms.  It can be in a 
position, it can be fraud, it can be appointing your friends, 
it can be like you did in your current position appointing 
someone who does not have the qualification, who also 
then appoints her sister that all that is part of corruption 
and these are some of the signs of State Capture and 
these are the things that you, Mr Gordhan, are guilty of or 
that I am asking or I am outing it to you.  But we were just 
dealing with the appointment of Mr Pillay the matriculant.      
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So Chairperson this is a real, how 
can I put it this is really an outcome of an event.  So 
Chairperson…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just hang on Mr Gordhan your Counsel 
is on her feet.  
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 229 of 315 
 
ADV LE ROUX:  Yes, Chair if I can just object to this line 
of questioning.  I have listened carefully as my learned 
friend asked the last few questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV LE ROUX:   And we do seem to be straying very, very 
far from the rulings you have given on the permitted scope 
of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Mr Pillay’s appointment which was years 
and years before the period of time that your Commission 
10 
is scrutinising hardly seems to be useful now, you know we 
are now heading for six hours of cross examination and I 
am not sure that it is either compliant with your ruling or 
actually going to get us to the questions that you have 
authorised namely the focus on Mr Moyane at SARS for the 
period of time that he is there many, many years after Mr 
Pillay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well Mr Mpofu I do not know what you 
want to say…[intervene]    
ADV MPOFU SC:   Chair I want to say…[intervene] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. I would like you to use the remaining 
time quite fruitfully.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   No Chair I was – you know I accept that 
objection. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 230 of 315 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I was saying that the issue was really 
provoked by the insults to Mr Van Rooyen.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   But I was just saying that it is trick 
coming from somebody like Mr Gordhan.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us move on.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, but…[intervene] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Now Chair…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on Mr Mpofu and Mr Gordhan.  Mr 
Gordhan your counsel has raised an objection to the 
10 
question.  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   That is fine.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mpofu has accepted the objection so 
the question falls away.  So I think we must move on.    
MINISTER GORDHAN:   But it does not fall away in the 
public eye Chairperson I need to rebut what Mr Mpofu has 
said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Accept that when your counsel Mr 
Gordhan says this question should not have been asked 
and Mr Mpofu says I accept that the public does hear that.     
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No but I thought he also implied 
Chairperson forgive me for this that I was involved in State 
Capture.  What is that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   But his with – he accepts that he should 
not have asked that question.     
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 231 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Oh okay, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us move on.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, in fact the only reference to Mr 
Pillay that is relevant relates to his retirement not his 
appointment.  You do remember that one of the things that 
you were charged with was a so called early retirement of 
Mr Pillay, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes, which was a trumped up 
charge.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   By among others Mr Moyane.  
10 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry Chair at this point I want 
to object because the terms of reference relates to the 
charge that was laid by Mr Moyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   It seems to be common cause 
now that Mr Moyane did not lay a charge against Mr 
Gordhan.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   So I am not sure where we going 
with this.  
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay you will be sure just now.  I 
explained this in the morning.  Mr Gordhan made it very 
clear that his, the gist of his gripe against Mr Moyane is 
what he called the complaint that led to the criminal 
charges.   
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 232 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   In other words Mr Moyane’s complaint 
sparked the criminal charges.  Now I am saying one of 
those charges that were sparked by Mr Moyane related to 
the Pillay matter, yes or no?   
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry Chair I need to respond to 
Mr, that is Mr Mpofu’s answer to my objection then with 
respect it is not good enough because whatever Mr 
Gordhan’s original complaint was this cross-examination 
should be bound by the terms of reference set out in your 
10 
ruling and your ruling does not relate to the charges in 
respect of Mr Pillay, it relates to national charge laid by Mr 
Moyane and we now accept that did not happen.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.    
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well Chair again I don’t know Mr 
Chaskalson maybe because he is just standing in for 
somebody else does not maybe he has not had an 
opportunity to read your ruling.  Your ruling says Chair 
whether in laying the criminal complaint or charges and I 
have said I accept that we excise the words against Mr 
20 
Gordhan, Mr Moyane did maliciously.  Second one whether 
laying the criminal complaint…[intervene] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry Chairperson that is 
precisely the point we cannot excise the word against Mr 
Gordhan because that is what your ruling says.      
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 233 of 315 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   If we were going to excise, we 
now accept that there was not such a charge and whatever 
allegations Mr Gordhan made in relation to that were in 
fact ill-informed whether it was his fault or anybody else’s 
fault is not for us to decide here but the issue that has 
been referred has become a non-issue.         
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, no Chair I am sorry Chair I asked 
Mr Gordhan the very first set of questions I asked him 
when we started here.  Was whether he stands by those 
10 
allegations even if they were excluded him and he said he 
stands by everything in A, B and C except that there was 
what we might call a clerical error of including him as one 
of the people. but to the extent that he was acting 
maliciously or that he saw to advance the objectives of 
State Capture or you will remember that debate about was 
abusing a legal process on his own personal goals that had 
the marking or little to do with a legitimate complaint 
relating to an alleged crime that he considered that he 
stands by those.  So we cannot be bound by…[intervene] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I remember him saying that but I  
think Mr Chaskalson’s point is in terms of that ruling there  
are certain - there are certain issues that I wanted to be 
dealt with today.      
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 234 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And in so far as A, B and C is concerned 
I think what Mr Chaskalson is saying is those points I 
wanted those points to be dealt with insofar as they related 
to a charge against Mr Gordhan and once it is accepted 
that there was no charge against him then the issue that I 
wanted to be addressed insofar as A, B and C is concerned 
falls away.   
If Mr Gordhan seeks to say well to say now even if 
they refer to other people I stand by that I think I am not 
looking at A, B, C now as we speak but I understand Mr 
10 
Chaskalson to be saying but what I was interested in was 
insofar as Mr Moyane was alleged by Mr Gordhan to have 
laid that charge against Mr Gordhan.       
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja, no Chair with respect that is 
unaccepted.  With respect Chair firstly that is an artificial 
distinction and that is exactly why…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does A, B, C say Mr Gordhan, does it 
say Mr Gordhan and others? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No Chair you know the record will show 
you that the first thing I did when I stood up here. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No I remember that part. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Was that to say to Mr Gordhan do you 
still accuse Mr Moyane of these things in other words 
accepting that now the charges were not against you and 
that was because Mr…[intervene] 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 235 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I remember that.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay things fall apart. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That part I do remember you asking him 
and him confirming.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes but that was because Mr 
Chaskalson of all people had said to him that the complaint 
related to, his complaint that Mr Moyane’s that led to the 
charges and that is why I said to him if we accept that 
10 
formulation do you stand by these accusations of State 
Capture even if we accept that you were not the person 
and he said yes.  I did that deliberately to avoid this 
debate because if he had said no I do not accept that Mr 
Moyane was motivated by State Capture and all that I only 
accepted it if it was the charge against me.  Then I would 
not be able to answer this questions but we are all bound 
by the answer that he gave which is…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can we park this question like the other 
one and then you exhaust others and then we can come 
20 
back later on. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Sorry Chair I just want to speak 
about a technical issue I am told that after the fall of the 
mic they may no longer be recording. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 236 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Can we take a technical two 
minute break just to check if it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thanks, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We take a five-minute adjournment to 
see whether everything would still be recorded if we 
continue. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn 
10 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay we are at six o’clock.  Before we 
adjourned I take it that the recording is fine. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes it was fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Before we adjourned I had asked 
whether if this question raises problems whether we cannot 
park it like the other one so that you use the time until we 
see towards the end. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chair I am sorry, I am sorry. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes you want to respond to that? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes sorry Chair [00:00:36] I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No Chair I wanted to say no this one I am 
afraid cannot be treated like that because this is quite a 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 237 of 315 
 
crucial part as Mr Gordhan himself says you know what – 
what was out there in public domain that Mr Moyane laid the 
charges against anyone as I [00:01:01] with him with – for 
the purposes of  
CHAIRPERSON:  State capture. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Advancing state capture.  And I am afraid 
this is not one of those. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me … 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Let me just explain Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chair if you – if you go to the – the – okay 
put it this way.  We know that the complaint was laid on a 
particular date and it said various things.  According to Mr 
Gordhan that complaint led to the charges against him.  So 
irrespective of whether his name literally was on that list but 
it is what led to the charges against him and that is the gist 
of his complaint.  So it is very artificial to now try and 
dissect the minutia of the gist of the complaint.  And the 
issue Chair is made very clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And just remind me again what the 
20 
question was? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes the question Chair was – oh you mean 
the one that I was asking now? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  It was – I had said Chair that I 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 238 of 315 
 
concede that the objection about the appointment of Mr 
Pillay is valid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  The issue that is relevant to the 
complaints that led to the charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the laying of the complaint? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes is the – no is this retirement rather 
than his appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Because the question of the retirement as 
10 
you know Chair the so called early retirement was the – was 
one of the charges or part of the so called 27 questions 
which really is the gist of this entire cross-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  So if we… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just go back to the actual question about 
the retirement I just want to … 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Maybe let me just address the Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that I can follow its relevance and so 
on ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Just to give context.  Chair if – if – let us 
two things.  One is we accept Mr Chaskalson and later 
confirmed by Mr Gordhan’s answer when I asked him that 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 239 of 315 
 
really his issue was not so much who is charged or whatever.  
What he is saying is that the complaint laid by Mr Moyane 
led to him being charged.  Okay that is – that is his 
evidence.  It cannot be changed.  So it could have been that 
Mr Moyane alleged that I stole his pen but if that alleging 
that I stole the pen led to Mr Gordhan being charged that is 
the – that is the gist of what he says.  He says that 
complaint was motivated by state capture and that is what 
led to him being charged.  So that is really the gist of this 
whole – entire exercise which is that Mr Moyane’s activities 
10 
of any nature including the laying of the charges led to Mr… 
a.  Led to Mr Gordhan’s – being charged but 
b.  That was motivated by state capture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is – is what you are pursuing this that Mr 
Gordhan said if that is what he said in the morning that the 
laying of those charges by Mr Moyane irrespective of – 
despite the fact that it was not against him was in pursuit of 
the agenda of state capture. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Advance the objectives of state capture – 
number 1. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  That he acted maliciously in doing that – 
number 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  And he was abusing a legal process for 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 240 of 315 
 
his own personal goals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  That had either nothing or little to do with 
the legitimate complaint relating to an alleged crime. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  And that is the – what I am addressing to 
say Mr Moyane and laying those charges he was addressing 
a – the [00:05:007] 
CHAIRPERSON:  A legitimate court issue. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  A complaint relating to an [00:05:09]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
that 
complaint 
relates 
to 
the 
retirement of Mr Pillay? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  Okay Chair it is even more 
complicated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  The complaint at least I think Mr Gordhan 
explained this in 2018.  The complaint and I have a copy 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was made ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes there were two components of what 
20 
Mr Gordhan was charged with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Which was part of the so called 27 
questions.  One was the rogue unit which I am going to deal 
with. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 241 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  And then the other one was the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Retirement. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Early retirement.  However Chair the 
complaint itself if you actually look at the statement 
physically it relates to the rogue unit but as Mr Gordhan said 
in one of his testimonies what has obviously then happened 
is that the Hawks … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Came across? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes expanded the scope. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  But that – all that does not change the 
fact that it was all sparked by Mr Moyane’s so called state 
capture complaint – state capture driven complaint so to 
speak. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Now Chair it is just an informal [00:05:21] 
comes in.   The Chair you said at paragraph 28 no, no 
paragraph 28 is the ruling.  The – sorry Chair I will just find 
the passage where you say you use the words… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said to the extent? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  At paragraph 15 of your ruling you 
say Chair. 
“Mr Gordhan also stated that his statement that Mr Moyane 
abused legal processes when he laid a complaint – a 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 242 of 315 
 
complaint against him is based on his experience of Mr 
Moyane’s defiant attitude and vilification of me following my 
reappointment as Minister of Finance.” 
So that is another link.  Then he says: 
“Mr Gordhan” –  
You say Chair sorry. 
“Mr Gordhan then states that he believes that Mr Moyane’s 
defiant attitude and – sorry – and vilification were aimed at 
forcing or pressuring him to resign from that position so that 
the capture of National Treasury could proceed under a 
10 
different Minister.” 
But the important part Chair is where the Chair says: 
“He then says that in the following paragraph and that is on 
page 6 that ‘this included’ he used the word ‘included’ the 
filing of his criminal complaint against me in circumstances 
that Justice Nugent found ‘unclear’ and which were later 
withdrawn this [00:08:00] so the removal of many senior 
SARS officials creating the opportunity for Mr Moyane to 
appoint a new senior management at SARS and so on.” 
So these things are – sorry – are so inter-related that … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you want to ask Mr Gordhan questions 
with regard to… 
ADV MPOFU SC:  The charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The complaint that was laid by Mr Moyane. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Which led to the charges. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 243 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which you say led to at least one of the 
charges that related to Mr Pillay’s retirement? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.  Okay alright. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me hear Ms Le Roux. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV LE ROUX:  Chair after all of that I am not sure where 
we are? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes well at least now my understanding is 
10 
that Mr Mpofu wishes to ask Mr Gordhan questions about the 
fact that Mr Moyane laid a criminal complaint during whose 
investigation the Hawks came across the retirement issue of 
Mr Pillay.  That is what he says? 
ADV LE ROUX:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LE ROUX:  So Chair let me just state for the record the 
facts as they stand in the affidavits that were filed with 
respect to cross-examination and as I have understood the 
cross-examination so far. 
20 
 
Mr Gordhan accepts that Mr Moyane did not name 
him in the complaint.  That the complaint is about the unit 
and that the Hawks investigation produced 27 questions – 27 
questions 
dealt 
with 
unit 
and 
pension. 
The 
charges 
announced by Sean Abrahams are pension related. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 244 of 315 
 
 
When my learned friend though says he now wants to 
ask questions about Pillay pension I object to that because 
that does not relate to what you have granted to cross-
examine on.  Because Pillay pension on both parties 
versions now that we have seen the documents when they 
were attached to Mr Moyane’s January 2020 affidavit the first 
time we ever saw what he filed with his complaint. 
 
It is now common cause that it does not mention 
Pillay pension.  So I am concerned that we are going to 
waste time on the merits of Pillay pension’s pay-out. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you are saying if Mr Mpofu wishes to 
ask questions about charges or a charge that emanated or 
arose from Mr Moyane’s complaint that he laid it is one 
thing.  But if he wants to ask questions about the Pillay 
pension… 
ADV LE ROUX:  The merits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That did not arise from the complaint. 
ADV LE ROUX:  No Chair it obviously did because of how 
the Hawks investigated it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No when I say arise I mean… 
20 
ADV LE ROUX:  If Mr Gordhan… 
CHAIRPERSON:  When I – maybe arise is the wrong word.  
The complaint that Mr Moyane had laid did not include any 
complaint about the pension. 
ADV LE ROUX:  Yes so you have given me on why Mr 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 245 of 315 
 
Moyane laying a complaint. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LE ROUX:  About rogue unit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LE ROUX:  Causes Minister Gordhan to say to advance 
state capture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LE ROUX:  That whole debacle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LE ROUX:  Pillay pension only comes up from the 
10 
Hawks and from when Mr – when Advocate Abrahams 
announced and then withdrew the charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LE ROUX:  So I do not see how Pillay pension can fit 
into a Moyane/Gordhan cross-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Effectively what you are saying is there is 
no connection between – there is no connection between the 
fact that Mr Moyane laid the complaint that he laid and the 
fact that later on one of the charges included was a charge 
which was not included in the complaint/ 
20 
ADV LE ROUX:  Yes there is no connection for purposes of 
this cross-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes ja. 
ADV LE ROUX:  To go into that migration by the Hawks and 
the NPA. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 246 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might show that – it might be referred to; 
to support an allegation that the Hawks added that charge 
for state capture but you are saying it cannot be said. 
ADV LE ROUX:  But that is not what it… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That Mr Moyane who is responsible for its 
inclusion in among the charges that were ultimately brought. 
ADV LE ROUX:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you are saying? 
ADV LE ROUX:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV LE ROUX:  Because we do not by now the sixth hour of 
today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LE ROUX:  We do not have any connection to use that 
word between Mr Moyane and the charges other than it is the 
same case number from the complaint he files about unit 
against other people.  So I do not want us to waste time on 
the merits of charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LE ROUX:  About Pillay pension where what the subject 
20 
of this cross-examination is the complaint Mr Moyane filed 
about unit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is alright.  Mr – I am sorry Mr 
Chaskalson? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair I want to go even further 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 247 of 315 
 
possibly because I want to get home tonight. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Your ruling falls to be interrupted 
as any written document in accordance with its ordinary 
meaning and where the ambit of cross-examination that is 
allowed is – relates to three issues.  Whether in laying the 
criminal complaint or charges against Mr Gordhan.  All of 
them are prefaced with laying the criminal complaint or 
charges against Mr Gordhan. 
 
Now it is common cause that that did not happen.  So 
10 
unless – I know that Mr Gordhan suggests that laying the 
charges against the rogue unit which were not charges 
against him may have had something to do with state 
capture. 
 
But unless this ruling is amplified to embrace then I 
think two things follow. The one is that no cross-examination 
on the issue can take place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  And the second is that the 
commission or the evidence leaders cannot suggest to you 
20 
that that is a relevant issue in relation to Mr Moyane’s 
liability or non-liability for involvement in state capture 
because it will not have been an issue that is canvassed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  If we are going to broaden it. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 248 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  To make it an issue that is 
canvassed it is a different story but until that happens. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  It is not an issue on which we 
have… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  We will suggest or we could ever 
suggest that Mr Moyane had ever been at fault. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think I must – I must – I understand 
10 
completely what Mr Mpofu said and what Ms Le Roux and 
yourself Mr Chaskalson have said now I want to know the 
question that Mr Mpofu wanted to put to Mr Gordhan 
because then in the light of what everyone has said I can 
see whether it is something we should go into or not. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  Chair really all I 
am saying is Mr Chaskalson correctly says that the – unless 
if the ruling is amplified as he calls it but the ruling was 
amplified by the witness.  Because I asked him do you even 
though – even though that you accept that the charges were 
20 
not laid against you?  Do you stand by the rest of the 
accusation?  Remember Chair we are not – this is not a 
game – a little game. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Of one word here or one word there. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 249 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  The gist of the accusation is that it is one 
continue on.  Remember the evidence of the witness is that 
there is a conspiracy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mpofu let us… 
ADV MPOFU SC:  With the NPA and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us – let me hear formally the question 
you want to put to him. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes Chair can I make another proposal? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes just for the sake of progress.  The – 
the – I am – I will come back to this to this question.  So 
what I will do is I will start with the issue of the rogue unit 
which was the subject matter of the complaint and then we 
can come back to whether the Pillay issue can also be 
covered.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  We can do that we are at 
sixteen minutes past six that I think means you have had – is 
your watch – does your – what does your watch say it does? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  My watch says well we started around 
20 
about twelve and then we had … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you have had six hours at least? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How much have you had? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I am – unless if we had started at ten.  It 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 250 of 315 
 
is six now.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well my watch says seventeen minutes 
past six. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does yours say six? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Six that is what I am – ja eighteen 
something. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  The – so I am saying we started around 
about 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Quarter past . 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Twelve – quarter past twelve and we had 
a one hour break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No we started at half past eleven. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No that was Mr Chaskalson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you mean yourself.  Ja you started at… 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Ja, no when I say we I mean myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja yes ja okay no, no.  What time was it? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  About quarter past twelve. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Quarter past twelve. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes I do not want to mislead.  And so let 
us say for argument sake take away the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I have compensated… 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Let us take away the break – the one hour 
break and take away the other small breaks then we can say 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 251 of 315 
 
we started at half past one – let us say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we – we did not count – I did not 
count the lunch break. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  The hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And whenever we had a break I added. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No, no Chair I accept that. 
[talking over one another] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you accept that ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Because the reality is that the time now is 
twenty past six. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  So I am saying if you – if you take away 
the one hour break from the twenty past six then you have – 
okay let us say it is quarter past six to make it easy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  That would be six hours from quarter past 
twelve from when we started. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Then minus the one hour lunch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Lunch. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:  That is five hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  And then minus the short breaks let us 
say they all total to – then it is about four – four and a half. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I do not know [00:18:56] but I think 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 252 of 315 
 
you… 
ADV MPOFU SC:  That all starts at… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think you – Ms Le Roux what is your 
understanding of how much time we have had?  I just want 
us to be on the same page more or less. 
ADV LE ROUX:  Yes Chair it obviously feels much longer but 
it is probably about five [00:19:15] hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About five hours. 
ADV LE ROUX:  That we have used. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
10 
ADV LE ROUX:  But it feels longer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Mr Chaskalson do you also say about 
five hours? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  I am happy to go with everybody 
else’s arithmetic Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Well it is not about five hours Chair unless 
if you take away all the short breaks.  It is five hours if you 
take away only the lunch break. So let us be clear.  We 
cannot – it is impossible for it be five hours unless if we did 
20 
not have those other short breaks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if somebody – if we started at quarter 
past. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Is we started at quarter past twelve. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 253 of 315 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:  And we came up to quarter past 6 it is 6 
hours very simple thing – then it is six hours.  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  But accept that we took… 
CHAIRPERSON:  A lunch hour. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  A one hour break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  One hour and a few minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  But that is fine. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say it… 
ADV MPOFU SC:  For lunch time.  Then all the other breaks 
then subtract from the five so how can it be the five it is 
impossible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you say – you say it would be what? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Four and a half hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The breaks … 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I am rounding them off.  The breaks and 
the over … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It will be then – if on that approach it 
20 
would be four hours. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  And a bit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Either eight minutes or fifteen minutes or 
something like that 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  So on four and fifteen minutes or 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315

four and thirty I am happy to live with four and thirty. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am raising that so that we can talk 
about the way forward. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No Chair I accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  At this stage  
ADV MPOFU SC:  At least… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is your assessment of how much 
more time you are going … 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I am sorry Chair during the break I have 
got news.  One thing I can assure you is that we are not 
going to finish today.  Or at least I am not going to finish 
today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  But I thought Chair we – I could – 
because of these other parked things including the one we 
have just debated. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  So I thought I could start with this topic 
because depending on the arrears and the other issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  This – this could be my last long topic.  
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 255 of 315 
 
So I thought at least I could start with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  And see well depending on everybody. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is your assessment of how long that 
topic might take? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chair you know despite what I have said I 
have been standing here since twelve fifteen.  The – my 
assessment Chair – well depending of course on the 
answers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it depends on everything else ja. 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:  We could finish with that topic at seven 
maybe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is an hour and a half. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No that is twenty minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I am sorry – that is yes – ja no, no I am 
wrong. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  That is forty minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About forty minutes' time? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thirty nine now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja forty minutes time.  And then after – 
20 
after that topic has been done would you be left with the two 
questions that have been parked or with another topic or 
other topics? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I will be left with bits and pieces Chair but 
– and then with the – this other topic. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 256 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  The one we are debating now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whatever would be left you are – you think 
would 
take 
how 
much 
after 
you 
have 
done 
with 
a 
topic/topics? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chair please do not ask me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean I am not going to hold you to the 
minute. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I just want to have an idea? 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Can I just have a minute Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja, ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I think – I think an hour and a half Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well somewhere I might have to say this is 
all I am giving you. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Make the best out of it. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Well Chair I hope we do not get there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I hope we do not get there. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No I hope we do not get there 
20 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because we should try and ... 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But let me check maybe we could go up to 
seven and see if you cover that big topic if everybody agrees 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 257 of 315 
 
because at this stage we have got to make – decide whether 
we continue for some time or whether we just adjourn for 
another – another day. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. Okay Chair I have another proposal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Ready.  I have – I have what one might 
call a – no because this is – I was going to call it a sub-topic 
but it is related to the main topic 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja – yes, yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Because I thought I – I could – I can try 
10 
and do the sub-topic and then leave out the rogue unit issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Completely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay… 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Because if and when we come back then 
Chair and I am just trying to project for what I will certainly 
be left with either that topic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Plus this one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:  And of course depending on the ruling. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  It could be one or two or both yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay, okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you.  Let me try and do that Chair. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 258 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but let me just check where Ms Le Roux 
in terms of us going on this evening up to maybe seven to 
finish a particular topic and then adjourning or adjourning 
now where do you stand? 
ADV LE ROUX:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will all want it to finish today. 
ADV LE ROUX:  Chair I stand on the proposition that this 
cross-examination will fill as much time as you give it.  At 
some point we are going to have to say no more. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. Ja. 
10 
ADV LE ROUX:  So I am certainly in your hands I am not 
sure if Minister Gordhan has any commitments tonight? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I am going to check with him. 
ADV LE ROUX:  But I – we are – I am in your hands but we 
will at some point have to say no more time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have flexibility.  Ja, ja.  Okay alright.  
Mr Chaskalson do you want to say something? 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:  Chair I am neutral on this one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Gordhan what is your situation?  
One option is that we might continue maybe up to seven and 
20 
see how far Mr Mpofu goes with what he calls the big topic 
or other topics and then we adjourn to another date when he 
might then finish and then there would be a re-examination.  
How is your situation starting with going on until sevenish or 
there about? 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 259 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  So Chair we group of Ministers had a 
meeting at Nedlac at about six so I have missed that already 
on a very important topic.  We could well continue until 
seven but I think that we have got to if I may respectfully say 
so not go perambulation I mean there are specific rulings 
that you have given.  My – I think the counsel has argued 
that particular point and we cannot just have additions to the 
issues willy nilly.  So under your guidance seven – seven 
fifteen is fine for me and we must get over with this.  Thank 
you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us continue then Mr Mpofu and then 
maybe we will stop at seven. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you Chair.  Well Chair I have just 
received instructions of which of the – as I said the main 
topic and the sub-topic.  Unfortunately it looks like I have to 
start with the main topic and as the Chair says we will see 
how far we go. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you.  Mr Gordhan you – you – Mr 
Moyane’s complaint which you say was motivated by state 
20 
capture and all the conspiracy and so on with the NPA and 
the Hawks.  The – before it was expanded you heard the 
debate that we had.  Before it was expanded to deal with the 
Pillay retirement it was based on the rogue unit allegations.  
You agree with that? 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 260 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  From what I have read Chair it was 
in relation to what I call the investigative unit at SARS yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes okay sorry I do not want us to fight 
about terminology.  Your evidence is that the – the – that unit 
I will try to be as neutral as possible.  Some people call it 
the rogue unit others call it the so called rogue unit but 
according to you it was called the Special Projects Unit when 
it was formed and then later it was called the National 
Research Group and then when you left it was called the 
High Risk Investigation Unit that is the same unit we are 
10 
talking about? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes thank you.  So as I say when I say 
rogue unit please do not take it as if I am being provocative.  
So I will try to use – just say the unit wherever I can.  Okay.  
Now this is a very important issue because it deals with – at 
least it deals with the uncontroversial part of the Chair’s 
ruling namely that the –the laying of the charges around the 
rogue unit was either motivated by state capture or it was 
what a reasonable person in Mr Moyane’s position would 
20 
have done putting aside the question of Mr Pillay.  But it is 
also important because as you know this is a matter of 
general concern about – among South Africans there is a 
whole lot of contestation I think is the only neutral word I can 
think of now about the existence of the rogue unit in the first 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 261 of 315 
 
place and secondly the lawfulness thereof.  Would you agree 
with that summary? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I am not sure what is the question.  
Are you asking me to agree to what sorry? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  The question is would you agree with that 
summary?  What are you not sure of? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just [talking over one another]. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  In terms of the issue… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just mention the summary again. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or better proposition you...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, Chair.  I was saying, it is important.  
It is two-fold.  One, is the one that I have explained in that it 
will demarcate the real issue in this cross-examination, 
which is whether Mr Moyane in laying the charges was 
motivated by State Capture motive.  Let us call it that.  
Which is your version.   
 
Or that he was motivated by what any reasonable 
Commission of SARS faced with – with what he was faced 
with, would have done.  So I said that is the first importance.   
20 
 
Then I said, the other importance is a more general 
importance which goes beyond you and Mr Moyane, which is 
that – this is the question that is of concern to South 
Africans.  And there is a lot contestation about it.   
 
And the third proposition is that that contestation 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 262 of 315 
 
revolves mainly around two things.  One, the existence of 
the unit.  And secondly, it should exist its lawfulness.  I know 
it is a long summary.   
CHAIRPERSON:   It is better...  I was about to say, why do 
you not put each one. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And let him deal with each one.  Ja, ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay.  But I am trying to save time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Do you accept that there is general 
10 
interest in the activities, legal or otherwise, of the Rogue 
Unit amongst South Africans? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   But I do not know about the 
generalisation Chair.  If I can be helpful.  The issues that Mr 
Mpofu raises.  A, it is about lawfulness.  B, there are the 
charges where it related to State Capture. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on Mr Gordhan.  I have just asked 
him to deal with one at a time because it can be confusing if 
there are too many propositions put at the same time. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  No, that ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The first one that he has put to you is this 
one.  He says.  Do you agree that there is a general public 
interest or interest from the public in the activities of the 
unit?  Whether those activities were legal or not legal, do 
you agree that generally speaking, the public is interested in 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 263 of 315 
 
what that unit used to do? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well, Chair what I will say to that 
proposition is that the real interest is, why was there so 
much fake news around this unit?  Why were leaks taking 
place to the Sunday Times from SARS at various stage?  
 
 And why, when in the face of an opinion from Advocate 
Mefengo(?) and Khumalo dated the 1 s t of September 2015, in 
the possession of Mr Moyane, this narrative still continues?   
 
So the concern, really, as I would formulate it, is why is 
there 
this 
repeated 
reference 
to 
the 
so-called 
rogue 
10 
element?   
 
And all the suggestions about rogue behaviour, perhaps 
except one, which is questionable, have been this proof.  
There has been – the issue of evidence have been 
...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on, hang on.  We do not 
make progress when you do not answer the question that is 
asked.  We make progress if you answer the question 
because then Mr Mpofu can move on to the next question.   
20 
 
His 
question 
was 
simply 
whether 
you 
accept 
the 
proposition that the public, generally, is interested in 
knowing about the activities of that unit, whether those 
activities were legal or not legal.  Do you ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, I would not accept the 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 264 of 315 
 
proposition. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not accept the proposition? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright.  Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Mr Gordhan does not accept the 
proposition that ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, that the public has an interest in the 
rogue...   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, that is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  H’m. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Chair, if I may?  I apologise.  My junior 
was just assisting me with something. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Just...  You remember there was a debate 
when Mr Gordhan denied that he had used the word gossip? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Earlier on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   My team has checked the transcript.  He 
did use that word.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   So I thought something was playing with 
my ears. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 265 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   But anyway.  That is maybe a matter of 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I think...  Ja.  Mr Gordhan and his 
counsel can check as well. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   They can note it, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay alright. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay.  Did you hear that Mr Gordhan, that 
10 
you did say you relied on gossip?  Can you deny it? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I hear what you are saying.  But let 
us get back to the issue. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, that is the issue now.  You – do you 
accept that you lied when you said that you did not use the 
word gossip? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I did not lie.  I might have been 
mistaken.  And if there is proof of that in the transcript, I will 
concede that. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you.  Alright.  Now...  Okay 
20 
...[intervenes]  
MINISTER 
GORDHAN: 
 
 
I 
do 
not 
have 
any 
reason 
Chairperson to lie. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 266 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well, that is what they all say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Indeed. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   So...  The...  Okay the next proposition 
then was.  Insofar as anybody is interested in the – or at 
least, it has been, as you say information and misinformation 
and you are quite correct, around the issue of the unit. 
 
But do you agree with my second proposition that 
information, misinformation, even propaganda, I would go as 
10 
far.  These were two topics, namely the existence of the unit 
and if it is existed, its lawfulness.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Mpofu ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on.  I am not sure about the 
propaganda and whatever ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja, okay let ...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   ...misinformation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I will stick with the words of the witness.  
Ja, he says correctly that there had been a lot of information 
and misinformation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I do not have to add propaganda. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 267 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   So I am saying, as far as that information 
and misinformation, does he accept that it deals broadly with 
those two topics?  In other words, existence and lawfulness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So your answer Mr Gordhan was yes? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  So the – you – the unit did exist.  
10 
Let us put that to bed once and for all.  Correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And you, Mr Gordhan played a major part 
in its formation.   
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No.  I played a part in requesting 
Chairperson the then Minister of Finance to approve certain 
funding for a unit where the National Intelligence Agency, as 
they were called then, and SARS could cooperate on issues 
like the smuggling of cigarettes, abalone and other forms of 
illicit trade.  That did not work out, as I have explained in my 
20 
statement of November 2018.   
 
Secondly, the threat of illicit trade exist today in South 
Africa very seriously, particularly those who smuggles 
cigarettes and making a lot of money out of it, which has 
happened under the pandemic.  And ...[intervenes]  
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 268 of 315 
 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Is that connected with the 
unit? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am simply asking if it ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay.  I am sorry Mr Gordhan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What you are simply asking Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, whether – and I use the word large.  
I am withdrawing it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, the ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am saying whether you practise 
pressure(?) in the decision to establish the unit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright.  Not the details 
whatsoever? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja, the pandemic. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So I think Mr Mpofu says, all he is 
interested in at this stage is whether you played a large part 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, I am doing away with large 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, not the large party? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You played ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja, whether you participated in the 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 269 of 315 
 
decision to establish the unit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You participated in the decision to 
establish the unit. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So Chairperson, be patient with me.  
You see he inter-uses the words like large.  I begin to 
answer the question on the basis of the word large.  Then 
the word is withdrawn and then I am accused of all sorts of 
things. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So let me conduct the question 
10 
...[intervenes]  
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on Mr Gordhan. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Can I finish please Chairperson?  
Can I finish to the answer to a question ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you proceed Mr Gordhan. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to say.  I think Mr Mpofu, when 
he withdraws the word large, he tries – he is trying to say 
something that you are likely...  Or rather, he is trying to 
20 
reach a point where the two of you will meet because if he 
says large, you might:  I played some part but it was not 
large. 
 
So at least, he just wants to see whether you will say:  
Yes, I played some part.  Whether you call it large or small, 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 270 of 315 
 
let us not get into that but I played some part. 
 
That is what - he is trying to avoid arguments about 
whether it was a large part or not a large part.   
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Happily Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So with respect.  It started with the 
word large. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   The word is out.  And the question 
is:  Did I participate?  Yes 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  Thank you.  Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja.  Thank you.  Thank you Chair for your 
assistance.  And you participated in the decision to establish 
the unit and when you did so it was in February 2007. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I cannot remember the dates 
Chairperson. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well, you said it was done in 2007 when 
you were answering the 27 questions.  Does that help you? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Thank you for alerting me now. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   So you accept that you participated in the 
20 
decision to establish the unit in February 2007? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chairperson, if it appears in the 
answer to the 27 questions, I accept it.  The only point I am 
making. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 271 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Is that I cannot remember all of 
those dates and all of the activities.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Wait.  So ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   You cannot remember it now?  That is 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So your answer is.  If that is what you said 
in one of your answers to the 27 questions, you accept that 
that would be the date? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Whatever date there is Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  And the – at the time, the manager 
of the unit reported to the one and only we spoke about, 
Mr Pillay and Mr Pillay reported to you.  Correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Correct. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  And the unit was intended – and I 
want to say this carefully.  The intention when the unit was 
formed was that it should be housed at National Intelligence 
Agency.  Correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, as my recollection goes.  The 
first answer is no.  And the second is that, as far as my 
20 
recollection goes, it was supposed to be a joint venture but I 
cannot remember whether there was a location in the NIA or 
with SARS itself.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I can look at the cabinet memo or 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 272 of 315 
 
some document to confirm that but that is neither here nor 
there. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  Well, I will jog your memory 
because you have spoken about something else.  I was 
going to go to, which was a request that you made to the 
Minister of Finance, Minister Trevor Manuel for the funding 
of the establishment of the unit.  You remember that? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay.  Do you at least accept that that 
funding was asked for on the basis that the initial intention 
10 
was to employ and train the members of the unit and then to 
transfer them to NIA where they would continue to function 
as a unit in NIA dedicated to SARS? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I will not dispute it Chair but I 
cannot confirm it right now. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay.  You cannot dispute that that was 
the intention, or rather, the gist of the letter you sent to 
Minister Manual that you wanted money so that the...  I am 
sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  The letter I am referring you to is 
that – appears on 375 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In... 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In which bundle? 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 273 of 315 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Maybe Mr Chaskalson can help us?  In 
my bundle it is TFM-275.  That is the bundle that was given 
by the... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay it must be the other bundle because 
this one does not have 375(sic). 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja.   
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chairperson, I am not disputing

what the letter says. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja.  Oh, no, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  So can we move on? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, no, no.  It is fine.  You said you

the letter, it says:  Dear Minister.  It is from you, correct?  
Signed P Gordhan, Commission of SARS.

Page 274 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...about the letter. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, I am not interested in that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am saying, was the letter sent by you to 
Minister Gordhan(sic)?  To Minister Manuel. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, no.  To Minister Manuel. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, correct.  And the heading of the 
letter at TFM-275 is:  To fund an intelligence capability 
within NIA in support of SARS.  That is the heading you put 
on your letter.  Correct? 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I accept that, if it is there. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the date of the letter? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   It is...  Chair, 275.  It is dated...  Or 
at least, Mr Gordhan signed it on the 02/02/2007 but...  No, 
no, no.  I  am sorry.   But Mr Pillay, I think.   
CHAIRPERSON:   That is eight ...[intervenes]  
ADV 
MPOFU 
SC: 
 
 
Mr 
Gordhan 
filed 
it 
on 
the 
8t h of February 2007. 
CHAIRPERSON:   February 2007. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  It is a letter Mr Gordhan you 
appeared to have sign on the 8 t h maybe of the second 
month, 2007 addressed to Minister Manuel.  Yes, Mr Mpofu 
continue. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 275 of 315 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you.  Well, let me – while I am at 
it, let me just – I will read the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
“Dear Minister.  To find the special capability within 
in NIA in support of SARS. 
1. Purpose 
To seek approval to fund special capability within 
NIA to supply SARS and law enforcement with the 
necessary information to invest illicit economy. 
10 
2. Discussion 
Collecting 
tactical 
intelligence 
and 
variable 
means penetrating and intercepting organised 
crime syndicates.   
This is an activity which SARS does not have the 
capability including the legislative mandate to 
manage and to understand activity.” 
 
And then you say: 
“Discussions 
are 
taking 
place 
within 
National 
Intelligence 
to 
supplement 
SARS 
in 
terms 
of 
20 
capability.   
NIA is willing to create a ring-fence capability.  
Provided 
funds 
are 
made 
available 
to 
cover 
personnel costs.   
All other costs will be covered by NIA.  NIA is willing 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 276 of 315 
 
to formulise the departmental arrangement to an 
NAU.   
We, 
therefore, 
request 
that 
NIA’s 
budget 
be 
increased to fund the creating of this special 
capability.   
The estimated personnel will cost R 13.1 million for 
2007/2008, 
R 17 million 
for 
2008/2009 
and 
R18 6 million for 2009/2010.” 
 
And then again, you say: 
“Recommendation: 
10 
Request to fund the creation of a special capability 
in NIA to support SARS.  It is strongly recommended 
an approval from the minister is required.” 
 
And then it was signed by the General Manager.  I think 
it was Mr Pillay.  And then you.  And then the Deputy-
Minister, who was then Mr Moleketi.  Signed.   
 
But he said, supported.   
“However, this is a strange way of executing what I 
regard to be an economic mandate of NIA. 
It seems though it is an add on, rather than part of 
20 
NIA’s mandate.” 
 
But he approved it, subject to that.  And then Minister 
Manuel also approved it.  And...  Sorry.   
 
My question was simply that this is just to refresh your 
memory.  Do you accept that the formation of the unit which 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 277 of 315 
 
you were part of was intended to be a part of NIA.  And I am 
sure now that the answer is yes.  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Thank you.  Ms Le Roux. 
MS LE ROUX:   Chair, it is now my turn to read to you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MS LE ROUX:   Because in your 2018/2019 ruling. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS LE ROUX:   Paragraphs 63 and 64. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS LE ROUX:   Yes. 
“Mr Moyane applied for leave to cross-examine on 
the alleged Rogue Unit... 
 
What is called the Rouge Unit but... 
“...the 
alleged 
Rogue 
Unit, 
its 
existence 
and 
lawfulness. 
We noted the following.  The applicant does not say 
under this theme what it is that Mr Gordhan said in 
his affidavit or evidence before this Commission that 
20 
implicated him in State Capture or corruption in 
regard to the unit. 
Interestingly, the applicant states in paragraph 30.1 
of his founding affidavit under the theme, the issue 
play a central role in that the existence and 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 278 of 315 
 
lawfulness of the (again) Rouge Unit...” 
 
Perhaps that is the unit we should be looking at. 
“...was repeatedly and independently exhausted.  The 
likes of Minister Gordhan falsely assert that that is 
not the case.   
In this regard, I attach a copy of the Sekukane report. 
I will soon provide a copy of the KPMG report in due 
course.” 
 
That is quoting Mr Moyane.  Then at paragraph 64, you 
make the following ruling: 
10 
“The question arises.  If the existence and lawfulness 
of the alleged Rogue Unit has been repeatedly and 
independently exhausted, why is it necessary in the 
best interest of the function of the Commission to 
allow cross-examination on it? 
In his apposing affidavit, Mr Gordhan points out that 
the SARS Commission considered those issues in 
regard to the unit, concluded the unit was lawful.” 
 
And then this is the critical part: 
“For the reason that the applicant does not state 
20 
how and where in his affidavit and oral evidence 
Mr Gordhan implicated him in regard to the unit. 
I am of the view that there is no proper basis for me 
to grant the applicant leave to cross-examine on the 
issue.” 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 279 of 315 
 
 
So you already ruled at the existence and lawfulness of 
the unit is not for cross-examination because he never 
implicated Mr Moyane about it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you see ...[intervenes]  
MS LE ROUX:   So if we can move on to why he made the 
charges, rather than going back to 2009 and earlier and 
working out how the unit came.  That is the very thing that 
you said we do not need to waste this Commission’s time on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, why we ...[intervenes]  
MS LE ROUX:   Because otherwise the ruling does not mean 
10 
anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, you know how we got there 
Ms Le Roux?  You know how we got there?  Mr Gordhan in 
his clarificatory affidavit said things that he has not said 
earlier on and specifically said Mr Moyane had engaged in 
activities in order to pursue the State Capture Project.   
 
And insofar as, if you are saying to me, that does not fall 
within the latest, the last ruling.  If you say it does not fall 
within that, then that is – we can look at that. 
 
But the allegations that Mr Gordhan made in the 
20 
clarificatory affidavit, despite the fact that I had said in my 
earlier ruling, in the directions.  This was not intended to 
expand what it had been said.   
 
He made the allegations that he made because they 
were so important when he says somebody had been 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 280 of 315 
 
engaged in activities of State Capture that was pursuing the 
agenda of State Capturing which is what we are looking at.   
MS LE ROUX:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is how it came to be allowed to 
that extent. 
MS LE ROUX:   Yes, Chair.  But the clarificatory affidavit and 
Mr 
Moyane’s 
affidavit 
in 
response 
to 
that 
and 
your 
November 2019 ruling, setting out the ATE five questions on 
this topic, are still all narrowly focussed on when Mr Moyane 
lays charges.   
10 
 
Why did he do that and why does Minister Gordhan say 
that he was not a reasonable SARS Commissioner?   
 
We are now...  What we are traversing now is the entire 
unit’s narrative and trying to resurrect it, using your 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no ...[intervenes]  
MS LE ROUX:   And that is what I object to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, you see.  If you say – if you look at 
the last ruling, it is so narrow and Mr Mpofu is now going 
wider.  I think that would be legitimate to look at that and 
20 
then you have to say what falls within the narrow ambit and 
what falls outside the narrow ambit of that. 
MS LE ROUX:   Yes, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS LE ROUX:   So I did not object when my learned friend 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 281 of 315 
 
was asking questions about:  Do you accept that the public 
has been interested in this idea that there is a Rogue Unit 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes. 
MS LE ROUX:   ...that came from the Sunday Times. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS LE ROUX:   And do – are – you know, do you accept all 
of that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS LE ROUX:   That is arguable within your latter ruling. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS LE ROUX:   So now go back and try to cross-examine on 
the question of existence and lawfulness of the unit, as 
opposed to, let us get to the time period ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ja. 
MS LE ROUX:   ...where the Sunday Times is saying there is 
a Rogue Unit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I understand your point, ja. 
MS LE ROUX:   And 12-days later, Mr Moyane goes and lays 
a criminal charge. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I understand your point. 
MS LE ROUX:   Let us focus on that, rather than we had a 
Rogue Unit ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So I understand your point.  I understand 
your point.  Ja, ja. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 282 of 315 
 
MS LE ROUX:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mpofu, you understand the point? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I do Chair but it is a non-point.  The – 
what I am – really, I do not even know why we are here.  All I 
was asking Chair is a very simple question in the line that 
my learned friend says it is acceptable.  It is just that the 
answer that I got was that the witness could not remember 
that the unit was actually to be housed at NIA. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   So that is the only reason I had to go 
10 
back and remind him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   But the question is only that old one, 
which was when – does he accept that in 2007 the intention 
was that it must be housed at NIA?  Which is there is nothing 
wrong with that because it is part of the...  But in anyway, we 
are done with this now.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I cannot – the question has not even 
been answered. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us move on then. 
ADV 
MPOFU 
SC: 
 
 
Thank 
you, 
Chair. 
 And 
I 
am 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But I see we are at five to seven.  I am... 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Oh.  Okay Chair.   
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 283 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Ja, okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I promise this will be the...  I just want to 
– not to leave it hanging. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   So the point I am simply making is that 
the reason why you wanted it to be housed at NIA is because 
you knew that lawfully it could not be housed at SARS if it 
was to have the capacity to gather intelligence.  Correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   There are distinctions in the law 
Chairperson about the word intelligence and that is what 
10 
brought the opinions I referred to.  Advocate Mefengo(?) 
when ...[indistinct] opinion on the 1s t of September 2015 
[Transmission distorted - speaker is not clear.] 
 
And a similar response in and analyses in the response 
to the 27 questions, draws that distinction.  There are things 
that intelligence agency are responsible for but various 
government 
departments 
that 
[Transmission 
distorted 
- 
speaker is not clear.] collecting information/intelligence on 
operational matters that affect their particular mandate. 
 
And that is the part that responsibility.  [Transmission 
20 
distorted - speaker is not clear.] 
 
So what was intended was one thing.  What emerged 
was another, which is working within the SARS mandate and 
prescripts.  And the opinions are very clear ...[indistinct] 
came up with and has been around, it looks like for about 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 284 of 315 
 
five years in that particular regard. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, okay.  Mr Gordhan, I understand 
that.  Believe me, I do not want to get into the advocates and 
so on.  I am talking about you.  When you – because you are 
the one who wrote the letter, not the advocate.   
 
I am saying the reason why you asked for it in the 
manner which I have read it out to you, which is that it 
should be housed at NIA was because you knew that in 
terms of the National Strategic Intelligence Act of 1994, it 
says that that act prohibits the conducting of convert 
10 
intelligence gathering by structures other than the National 
Defence Force, the South African Police Service and State 
Security Agency.   
 
Hence, you were right in your letter to ask Minister 
Manuel to fund the unit that it must be housed at NIA.  It is a 
simple thing.  You – it was for that reason.   
 
Otherwise, you would ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   [Indistinct] [Transmission distorted - 
speaker is not clear.] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   ...you would have done it at...[intervenes]  
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Can I explain Chair? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I did not get involved directly into 
the discussions.  I was part of the whole – the development 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 285 of 315 
 
of an enforcement strategy and I describe that to you when I 
appeared before you in November 2018. 
 
And the enforcement evolved over a period of time, 
firstly.  Secondly, clearly, as I said – I have just completed 
my answer which says that there are two or many types of 
intelligence. 
 
Let us call it intelligence that is the responsibility of an 
intelligence 
agencies 
in 
terms 
of 
that 
legislation 
and 
operational intelligence which vary(?) at the departments 
collect from time to time.  And that is the distinction. 
10 
 
If the one collapse which is the first proposition, then we 
still needed information as to how this funding of cigarettes 
happen.  Who is responsible?  Where does it go?  How does 
it get into the marketplace?  And who are the key kingpins in 
this particular regard?   
 
How 
does 
abalone 
smuggling 
happen 
out 
of 
this 
country?  What do we lose in value?  What are the routes 
that it actually travels?   
 
Today, the Department of Environment, for example, at 
the fisheries looks into that matter.  I do not know how they 
20 
do it or what they do but I am just giving you another 
example, where in general terms, anybody who is law-
abiding would want to oppose illicit trade of one kind or 
another because that kind of illicit trade damages the South 
African economy. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 286 of 315 
 
 
So when the NIA proposition appeared to collapse in 
discussions between SARS officials and NIA officials, we 
nonetheless, still required specialisation and the capability 
to understand the phenomena I have just described. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  Thank you Mr Gordhan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are at seven. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay Chair.  I promise.  Can I just end off 
this topic?  Just this point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I just want to - just bear in mind the 
terms of that paragraph 28 that says what Mr Gordhan 
10 
would be cross-examination on. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As you – ja, okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, no, no, I am mindful, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And I am going to stick to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   The point I am making, Mr Gordhan, is 
a simple one, that the – you have confirmed the existence 
of the unit, we are now talking about its lawfulness, so to 
20 
speak.  And I am saying to you – let me put it this way, 
would you agree with this summary?   
“It became apparent to SARS that it had to enhance 
the capacity to gather intelligence of investigating - 
and investigate organised crime.  
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 287 of 315 
 
 
“It…” 
That is SARS now, 
“…decided in about February 2007 to set up the unit 
to penetrate and intercept the activities of tax and 
customs-related 
crime 
syndicates. 
 
Its 
initial 
intention was to employ and train the members of 
the unit and then to transfer them to NIA where they 
would continue to function as a unit dedicated to 
SARS.” 
We have covered that.  
10 
“The NIA, however, lost appetite for the project as a 
result of which SARS decided to retain the unit 
within its enforcement division.” 
Is that what happened? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Just explain that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you – where are you reading from? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am reading from his statement, Mr 
Gordhan’s statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What paragraph? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   It is paragraph 12. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that he can have a look at it. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Paragraph 12 of your statement to the – 
answer to the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the 2018 one? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, Chair.  
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 288 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, no, no, no, no, not the statement to 
the Commission, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is answers to the questions. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   It is the answers to the 27 questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, do you know where to find it? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Have you got that, Mr Gordhan? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I beg your pardon? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Do you have your answers to the 27 
questions? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you have your answers to the 27 
questions? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, I do not have it in front of me, 
no. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Not in front of you . Okay, that part I 
read from – we can sort it out, that I read was from 
paragraph 12 of your answer.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, without him seeing it, it might be – 
unless you take it in bits and pieces so that he can 
understand, ja. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, okay.  Yes, no, no.  Mr Gordhan, 
really, this is my last question.  I just want to round off this 
issue and I will take the Chair ’s suggestion.  You say – and 
I am sorry, I thought you had the document in front of you.   
You say: 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 289 of 315 
 
“It became apparent to SARS that it had to enhance 
the capacity to gather intelligence of investigating - 
and investigate organised crime.” 
That is the first sentence.  Do you remember that? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes, carry on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does that ring a bell?  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   “It...” 
Meaning SARS. 
“…decided in about February 2007 to set up the unit 
to penetrate and intercept the activities of tax and 
10 
customs-related crime syndicates.” 
Do you remember that? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And then the next sentence: 
“Its initial intention was to employ…” 
It is what you have just covered. 
“Its initial intention was to employ and train the 
members of the unit and then to transfer them to 
NIA where they would continue to function as a unit 
dedicated to SARS.” 
20 
That was the gist of your letter to Minister Manuel, you 
remember that part? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  Then here is the part.  Then you 
say: 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 290 of 315 
 
“Then NIA, however, lost appetite for the project as 
a result of which SARS decided to retain the unit 
within its enforcement division.” 
And I am going to for the sake of progress – and I will 
withdraw it again if you object, to put the word there to 
say: 
“As a result of which SARS unilaterally decided to 
retain the unit within its enforcement division.” 
In other words because NIA lost appetite SARS decided on 
its own to retain the unit within its division, enforcement 
10 
division.  Is that what happened? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Not quite.  So if I may explain 
quickly, Chair, so that it will not take up too much time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I already explained, so somehow 
there is a communication issue, that they have different 
intelligence mandates.   
 
Secondly, the different departments have different 
mandates. 
 
Thirdly, 
that 
all 
of 
them 
would 
be 
doing 
20 
information/intelligence collection.” 
 
Fourthly, that the legality of this unit and its 
establishment is well proven at the SARS level. 
 
And fifthly that once the NIA discussions between 
SARS officials and themselves collapsed, that was the end 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 291 of 315 
 
of that matter and NIA did whatever it needed to do and 
generally, 
if 
I 
remember 
correctly, 
there 
would 
be 
collaboration between crime intelligence, NIA itself and 
possibly sometimes military intelligence in order to track 
down and deal with – I have been using cigarette 05.05 as 
a popular example but other forms of illicit trade as well 
which undermines the South African economy.  So as far as 
the legality of the unit and the legality of its function is 
concerned, that has been repeatedly proven to be proper 
and correct. 
10 
 
Secondly, if I may sum up, the question of covert 
intelligence, which is the responsibility of an intelligence 
agency was not overlapping with what the SARS unit did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think Mr Mpofu sought to establish 
from you whether the reason why the unit ended up being 
houses within SARS was that the NIA lost appetite.  I think 
that is what he wanted to.  Otherwise the intention was to 
have it housed at – with NIA. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I have conceded that already, 
Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you.  Chair, if maybe we should 
stop at this point.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   It is unfair, I wanted to highlight one or 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 292 of 315 
 
two other things from Mr Gordhan’s statement but if does 
not have it in front of him it is just going to make it very 
difficult. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Chair, I am sorry …[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I do not mind going on, Chair. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think we – your counsel also – okay, 
maybe let us go up to half past seven then. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us see how much we can cover 
[inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay, Mr Gordhan, I do sympathise, I 
do not want to – believe me, I will not put things from your 
statement that are not there and maybe what I can do is to 
try and get a copy of this, Chair, at least from one of my 
juniors just so that Ms Le Roux at least has got it because 
she is where with us. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, we will find it, Chair, Mr Mpofu 
can ask any question he wants. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   If I am unable to answer I will say 
so.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   If that will help the Commission.

CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Thank you. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay, fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think whatever you can give to Ms Le 
Roux do give. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Mr Gordhan says in the meantime 
ask whatever question, if he is unable to answer he will 
say so. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  No, fair enough.  I am really 
10 
indebted to you, Chair, if I may organise it, Chair?  Sorry, 
Chair, just one second? Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay, Mr Gordhan, Ms Le Roux has got 
a copy.  It is signed by you dated the 30 March 2016.  Just 
to …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is copy of what now? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Of the answers to the 27 questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, the answers to the 27 questions? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, yes, that is the document that 
20 
unfortunately is not in front of Mr Gordhan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I take it I do not have it either, hey? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Chair, let me ask Mr – or the 
secretariat. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I might be able to do without for now 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 294 of 315 
 
and then I can get it later one. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes,  yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. If it becomes a problem 
we will take from there.  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   We might be able to locate it, Chair, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am sorry about that.  Yes, okay, my 
question was again a simple one that from your statement, 
if you assume that I am reading directly from it, are you 
now saying, that last sentence, is not what happened and 
10 
let me remind you what it says: 
“The NIA, however, lost appetite for the project as a 
result of which SARS decided to retain the unit 
within its enforcement division.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   He has conceded that, Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well, he said except for the last part.  
Okay, maybe I lost the second  - have you conceded 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I think he conceded that, I repeated 
it to him. 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Three times. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He has conceded it, Mr Mpofu, that 
…[intervenes] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Did you or did you not say except for 
that last part? 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 295 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No – well, I cannot recall but I 
have answered the question. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well, it is another – we will look for in 
the record, alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But at least he is accepting now that 
…[intervenes] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   That is a change to his answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is far as on behalf the unit when 
NIA had lost appetite. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Now the proposition I want to put to you 
regarding that is that that is exactly the unlawful part that 
Mr Moyane was confronted with.  Number one, it was that 
the establishment of the unit simply because NIA lost 
appetite and then you sommer decided to establish it 
without their involvement was a contravention of the 
Section 3 of the National Strategic Intelligence Act 39 of 
1994 and that was the finding of Mr Sikhakhane, that was 
the finding of various other agencies that investigated this 
20 
saga, it was also the finding of the Public Protector and 
the – it is a simple issue really, it is not – okay, I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you have made your point. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, yes, I am going to – I will break it 
down yes, let me …[intervenes] 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 296 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I think your point is – and you must 
just tell me if I misunderstand. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If it had been housed at NIA it would 
have been lawful but it being housed within SARS that 
made it unlawful. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What do you say to that, Mr Gordhan? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chair, I disagree. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course I accept we must remember 
10 
that you are not a lawyer, I guess, but you might know 
about this, ja. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, absolutely but I have actually 
repeatedly answered the same question in different forms.  
Well, let me try once more because I do not seem to be 
communicating the answer well enough. 
 
So the first point I made already is that the first 
intention in relation to a relationship with NIA did not work 
out and therefore the relevant legislation did not apply in 
that context to the NIA employed individuals for which a 
20 
budget allocation would have been made which was the 
purpose of the letter/memo signed by ourselves at SARS to 
Minister Manuel. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Secondly, I described the different 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 297 of 315 
 
types of intelligence/information. 
 
Thirdly, what remained at SARS was not the original 
conception 
and 
I 
explained 
why 
it 
was 
necessary 
throughout the world, including – because benchmarked all 
of this at the time – it was necessary to have this kind of 
capacity.  So if you go the World Customs Organisation, 
they will tell you that, that that – this is the kind of 
capacity that is actually required in order to effectively 
combat illicit trade in whatever commodity we are talking 
about.  Currently it is cigarettes and alcohol because 
10 
pandemics – the pandemic has cause limitations in that 
regard all over the world including South Africa itself. 
 
The third point, Chair, is in relation to the various 
reports that Mr Mpofu makes reference to.  Firstly, 
somewhere along the line, the mandate of …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Gordhan, you have said 
that you have dealt with this, I just want to make sure that 
this time one can understand it correctly. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Sure.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you start with the proposition 
20 
whether what you say to the position that had this unit 
been houses at NIA it would have been lawful.  The fact 
that it was housed at SARS is what made it unlawful.  Are 
you able to say I do not agree with that and this is the 
reason and then …[intervenes] 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 298 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, I cannot …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then you can elaborate. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No I do not… 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not agree with that. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, I do not agree with that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, oaky. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   And I do not agree because in NIA 
it would have had one kind of mandate under the piece of 
legislation that Mr Mpofu made reference to.  In SARS it 
had a different kind of mandate because it could not 
10 
operate under the NIA legislation, it operated in the normal 
course of CAPS and Customs enforcement for which 
information about these matters is absolute critical.  So, if 
you like, it is not the same unit we are talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER 
GORDHAN: 
 
 The 
one 
unit, 
the 
original 
conception and when NIA became disinterested and a 
second conception of the unit developed so that it would 
be within the law and the point I have made earlier on as 
well, is that we have various legal opinions including a 
20 
legal opinion obtained by Mr Moyane himself in September 
or thereabouts in 2015 in which it actually clarifies this 
concept or rather, this issue of where that intelligence 
legislation applies and where it does not apply and I also 
mentioned that in response to that particular component in 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 299 of 315 
 
the 
27 
questions 
response 
that 
I 
gave, 
a 
similar 
explanation is given as well. 
 
So as far as we are concerned, Sikhakhane was 
wrong and has been proven to be repeatedly wrong. 
 
Secondly, Judge Cronin relied on Sikhakhane and 
he was wrong because he did not entertain other views on 
this particular matter and was misguided by some legal 
people that he had as part of his panel and he later 
apologised 
for 
the 
inferences 
that 
he 
drew 
at 
that 
particular point.   
10 
 
As far as the Public Protector is concerned, I am 
not sure where in the process we are but that is a matter 
before a High Court in South Africa at the moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let me ask this question.  From 
what one has read or heard it does appear that there may 
be some opinion, opinions saying it was lawful and they 
have made the other opinions saying it was not lawful, I am 
saying opinions or rulings by different bodies, or whatever 
…[intervenes] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Investigations, ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, if that is the case or maybe I 
should not say if that is the case, if Mr Moyane says look, I 
am not a lawyer but based on what I understood to be the 
position, rightly or wrongly, I formed the view that this unit 
was not lawful and thought that it was my duty to therefore 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 300 of 315 
 
lay a complaint, what would be your attitude to that?  
Would you say no, he knew that it was lawful but went to 
lay a complaint about it because he was pursuing the 
agenda of state capture or would you say look, I accept 
that he could have thought that it was unlawful but he was 
mistaken about that and leave it at that or whether you 
would go one step further and say no, no, no, he knew that 
it was lawful but because he was pursuing state capture he 
went and laid a criminal complaint?  Which is it? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well, if one looks at the sequence 
10 
of events, I am just looking for the chronology. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I cannot find it right now.  But if 
one looks at the sequence of events, on the 16 May 2015 
is when Mr Moyane signs the complaint lodged at the 
Brooklyn police station.  On the 1 September 2015, he has 
dated the report/opinion of the two advocates.  So it must 
have been commissioned before the 1 September 2015.   
 
So even if he thought he was right in May 2015 he 
had a legal – sound legal opinion before him which said 
20 
that the unit is legal. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Secondly, all of the Sunday Times 
so-called exposures were fake news.  So there are 
supposed to be bugged calls(?) there are supposed to be 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 301 of 315 
 
all sorts of buggings.  No evidence is available on any one 
of those matters and the Sunday Times apologised for what 
it did under a particular editor sometime later on in this 
process.   
 
So I would argue that by September at least of 2015 
Mr Moyane knew that this unit was legal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   And he could have withdrawn the 
complaint if he wanted to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the date for the laying of the 
10 
complaint because I am not looking at this... 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   16 May 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us focus on May. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you able to say in May he could not 
have thought that there was something unlawful about the 
unit or are you saying well, I do not know about May but 
certainly in September I think he knew.  In other words, 
because, as I understand it, his approach – or as I 
understand 
Mr 
Mpofu 
is 
that 
well, 
if 
as 
SARS 
20 
Commissioner he thought there was something unlawful he 
was entitled to law a complaint, maybe they would say 
even obliged. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The fact that he might – it might later on 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 302 of 315 
 
turn out that he was wrong, he was mistaken, would be 
neither here nor there, he would have been acting bona 
fide, even if mistaken.  What would you say to that as in 
May as opposed to September? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Is the question for me, Chair, or 
Mr Mpofu? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, for you to say if we look at May 
when Mr Moyane laid the complaint, not in September. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of what you believe he knew 
10 
would you say at that stage when he laid the complaint he 
definitely knew that there was nothing unlawful about the 
unit but then went ahead and laid the complaint because 
he was pursuing the state capture agenda or would you say 
he may have been bona fide in thinking there was some 
unlawful but he was mistaken at that stage.  It is only in 
September where I say his pursuit of the complaint in 
September after he had got the following information about 
the opinions at that stage revealed that he was pursuing 
state capture. 
20 
MINISTER 
GORDHAN: 
 
 
He 
would 
have 
known, 
Chairperson, that the Sekhakhane report firstly was faulty 
in the sense that there was an original mandate to look 
into the question of the relationship as exposed in the 
Sunday Times between one SARS official and an outside 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 303 of 315 
 
person and then Mr Moyane is appointed, as I recollect, 
and suddenly there is a turn in a different direction where 
the unit becomes the focus, but as I recollect that Mr 
Sekhakhane 
nonetheless 
says 
that 
this 
must 
be 
investigated further.  That then results of the appointment 
of KPMG to investigate the matter and they have also 
disavowed some of their work in recent times although not 
properly yet and – so that work had to be completed by 
which time the September 2015 opinion would have been 
available as well.   
10 
 
So if one looks at in sequence what one would find 
is that he probably pre-empted this whole process, firstly, 
and if one combines that with other observations made 
elsewhere, like the Nugent Commission in respect of – and 
I have suggest it as well - in relation to, for example, the 
organisational structure, the concentration of huge power 
in the hands of Mr Makwakwa, the concentration of all tax 
settlements which we have got lots of checks and balances 
in respect of [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Gordhan …[intervenes] 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  … individuals would have absolute 
discretion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry …[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So if you look at the context, I 
cannot accept the benign interpretation. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 304 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is your answer that as far as – even 
in May when he laid the complain you say he knew that 
there was nothing unlawful about the unit and he laid the 
complaint because he sought to pursue the agenda of state 
capture.  That is your position in regard to even May, is 
that right? 
ADV LE ROUX:   Chair, I am now in the invidious position 
of having to object to your question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, just hang, you object, I will disabuse 
of it, if necessary.  Mr Gordhan, are you able to clarify? 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes, no, I certainly believe that if 
you put all of these events in sequence.  As I said earlier 
on, Chairperson, he pre-empted this process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   And if you match it to other – I 
know you get impatient when I make references to other 
things but the reality of the matter is that one cannot see 
things in isolation, they have to be seen in relationship to 
other events.  So forgive me for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, no. 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   But when one sees it in that 
context there clearly is something wrong with lodging those 
charges in May 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, part of what I am doing is I 
need to understand exactly what you are saying. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 305 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And some of the things, they have got 
certain nuances, some of the nuances are legal, others are 
different, so it is very important that I understand what you 
say in regard to certain issues because I do not want to 
attribute to you I misunderstood position.  If I say you said 
when he laid the complaint this was the position I must be 
sure that that is what you said.  Ms Le Roux?  Yes, now 
you can express your – ja. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Chair, the objection just for the record is 
10 
that the questions now being posed to Minister Gordhan 
ask him to identify what Mr Moyane knew when he laid 
charges.  He cannot do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but …[intervenes] 
ADV LE ROUX:   So all of the questions are phrased to say 
did Mr Moyane know?  You know, did Mr Moyane – only Mr 
Moyane can tell us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No… 
ADV LE ROUX:   So the reason why Minister Gordhan says 
the unit is lawful and there are – all of the opinions that Mr 
20 
Moyane has pointed to have been discredited and found to 
be erroneous, all of the – then he also says there are all 
these opinions saying it is lawful that Mr Moyane seems to 
have ignored.  But it is unfair to ask Mr Gordhan did Tom 
Moyane know that, you know, SARS had researched 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 306 of 315 
 
legality when it found – like, he does not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, of course the first answer is, he 
can say well, I do not know what he, you know, but this is 
where it arises from.  Mr Gordhan says – or rather, the 
order here says Mr Gordhan may be cross-examined on 
whether in laying the criminal complaint – I am saying 
against Mr Gordhan, against whoever, Mr Moyane was 
motivated wholly or in part by the objectives of state 
capture. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Yes, Chair, and so …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now Mr …[intervenes] 
ADV LE ROUX:   So the question that says …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on.  As I understand Mr 
Mpofu’s cross-examination, it seems to be directed at 
saying if Mr Moyane in laying the charge, believed that 
there was something unlawful about it, then he could not 
have been motivated by the objectives of state capture 
which Mr Gordhan says was the case.  So it is Mr Moyane’s 
answer and I am seeking to establish what Mr Gordhan has 
to say to that answer to say if indeed Mr Moyane ought – 
20 
there was something unlawful about the unit, even if he 
was wrong in thinking so, what would that do to Mr 
Gordhan’s proposition that Mr Moyane was motivated 
wholly or in part by the objectives of state capture.  That is 
what I was asking. 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 307 of 315 
 
ADV LE ROUX:   Yes, Chair.  No, no and that formulation 
is within the cross-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja.  Yes, yes, okay, alright, okay. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But we are at 27 minutes past so 
…[intervenes] 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Chair, could I have my final say? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   We have gone – we have taken 
one step beyond the terms of reference because we are 
10 
now investigating not a charge against Mr Gordhan that 
was laid by Mr Moyane but a charge that was laid against 
some other people by Mr Moyane.  We are about to embark 
on an even further departure from the terms of reference 
because Mr Gordhan is now wanting to address answers 
that are going to say – that are essentially, if I understand 
his answers correctly, saying well, I do not want to talk 
about what Mr Moyane did or did not know when the 
charges were lodged, I want us now to look at what Mr 
Moyane learnt in the period after and the problem is not 
20 
that he – not that he lodged a charge against me, it is not 
that he lodged a charge against people other than me, it is 
that having found other material later he failed to bring 
that to the attention of me.  So my submission is 
…[intervenes] 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 308 of 315 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No I just, yes, no, no, no I think I 
understand what was your – well maybe part of it is it is 
late in the day. 
ADV CHASKALSON SC:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV MPOFO SC:   Sorry could I just ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER 
GORDHAN: 
 
 
You 
might 
also 
find 
that 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Wait Mr Gordhan. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on Mr Gordhan. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I want to reply to the objection.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh I thought the objection has fallen 
away in the light of the – of how I explained it. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Oh, I thought it was resuscitated. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Of 
course 
Mr 
Chaskalson’s 
one 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   It had fallen away indeed but 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
The 
one, 
Mr 
Chaskalson’s 
one 
20 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:  That’s why he wanted to breathe life into 
the dead body of the objections I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I know Mr Chaskalson might not 
need to explain anything because I am not saying his one 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 309 of 315 
 
has fallen away.  I am not saying that, ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, no, no the one I was saying I have 
a right to address Chair.  Let me start again with where I 
agree with Mr Chaskalson.   The – and I agree also with 
the Chair ’s summation.  Mr Chaskalson is of course right to 
say that anything that would have happened subsequent to 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   After. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  To the laying of the charges, whether it 
is Nugent or this one or that one, it is completely irrelevant 
10 
to the real gist of what I am after.  The Chair, I cannot put 
it better, the issue we are dealing with here is the state of 
mind of Mr Moyane as on that date of May 2015, and there 
is only one of two options, it is either as we have been 
saying and we said in the affidavits, any reasonable 
Commissioner faced with whatever he was faced with 
would have laid the charge and in fact my text topic is 
going to show that he actually he was obliged by the law, 
he would have been guilty himself criminally if he did not 
do so, but we are not there yet. 
20 
 
So it is either that version of Mr Moyane or as the 
Chair summarised either that all that and he just said look 
I don’t – the summary is telling me that actually this thing 
is exaggerating the fact Chair.  If someone says look 
actually this thing was actually ...[indistinct] so there was 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 310 of 315 
 
no problem with it, and yet because he was pursuing State 
Capture he forged ahead with the charges, but those are 
the 
two 
competing 
issues, 
and 
– 
but 
I 
accept 
Mr 
Chaskalson’s point that to now we must not allow it to go 
to Nugent and whatever. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, but I think we must stop now 
because we are past half past seven. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you Chair. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chair you will remember me 
please. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes you wanted to say something Mr 
Gordhan? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes I thought it might be useful for 
the Chair to take note of this chronology, Mr Moyane is 
appointed on the 3 r d of September – I beg your pardon, he 
is appointed on the 23 r d of September 2014, of course Mr 
Sikakhane is appointed by Mr ...[indistinct] on the 3 r d of 
September 2014.  Then on the 5 t h of November 2014 Mr 
Sikakhane 
sends 
his 
report 
to 
Mr 
Moyane, 
then 
in 
December 2014 Mr Moyane appoints KPMG, as I referred 
20 
to earlier on. The KPMG investigation is still going on and 
only about September, October 2015 is apparently a KPMG 
report presented to Mr Moyane. 
 
So long before that process is completed as I said 
earlier on, on the 15 t h of May 2015 Mr Moyane lays the 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 311 of 315 
 
various complaints at the ...[indistinct] Police Station and 
then what follows is the legal opinion that I referred to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So you might want to bear some of 
those dates in mind because they are not unimportant in 
this context. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no that is fine.  I don’t think 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Can I just ask one question Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV MPOFU S:   Yes, Mr Gordhan yes we hear that, we 
will take it from there, do you accept at the very least that 
Mr Moyane that he had received a confession from some of 
the members of the rogue unit that forced him in terms of 
the – of BRICA, if he did, if he hadn’t reported the 
confession, whether the confession was true or not, he 
himself would have been guilty of a crime. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Not necessarily because on the 7 t h 
of May 2015 Mr Moyane actually asks a certain gentleman 
involved in the unit to not present himself to a Mr van der 
20 
Walt of KPMG and feign an illness for the question his 
wife, okay I am not sure about the criminal issue, that is 
for lawyers to sort out. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja. 
MINISTER 
GORDHAN: 
 
 
But 
these 
are 
strange 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 312 of 315 
 
unexplainable events until Mr Moyane takes the stand and 
tells us what his state of mind is, thank you Chair.    
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes and do you accept that the 
Sikhakane report has never been withdrawn until today, the 
one that says the unit was unlawful? 
MINISTER 
GORDHAN: 
 
 
I 
believe 
that 
the 
SARS, 
organisation amongst others, is challenging that report. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER 
GORDHAN: 
 
 
And 
there 
are 
various 
...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:    Yes, but as of today ...[intervenes]   
MINISTER GORDHAN:   If I can finish. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Sorry. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   If I can finish. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, I said I am sorry Mr Gordhan yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So there are various alternate 
interpretations and certainly Mr Sikhakane and Ms Dragab 
who were involved in that panel, maybe others were as 
well, have been found to be basing their opinions on a 
misreading of the law as far as we are concerned, and as 
20 
far as many other people who looked at these legal 
opinions are concerned as well, but as you said that is for 
the lawyers to look at. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No that is not what I said, I said to you 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 313 of 315 
 
accept that it might be a challenge but as for now it has 
never been withdrawn and that was what Mr Moyane 
...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Oh it has – Chairperson if you 
want to get into the details I am sure there are witnesses 
who can come before you and explain to you how that 
report evolved, how the mandate of the secretary had 
changed and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Can I respond please? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was simply saying do you know 
whether – do you accept that it has never been drawn that 
is all that he was asking. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   That is all. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes, but I am also explaining that 
there is a lot of critiques available on the report for the 
benefit of the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but he did not ask about that, he 
asked whether you are aware that it has not been 
withdrawn but what the effect of that is, that we can deal 
20 
with some other time, and I guess that the position is that 
it has not been withdrawn, it has not been set aside, it is 
being challenged from what you say in the High Court, we 
don’t know what will ultimately happen but I think we can 
stop here.   
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 314 of 315 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Sure, that was just for your 
information Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No thank you very much.     
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I must thank everybody for being 
prepared that we sit till late, thank you Mr Gordhan for 
being prepared, thank you Mr Mpofu, thank you Ms Le 
Roux 
and 
your 
instructing 
attorney, 
Mr 
Moyane, 
Mr 
Chaskalson, Mr Chaskalson’s instructing attorney in the 
Commission and everybody. 
10 
 
We are going to have to fix another date but 
probably we shouldn’t fix it now because probably Mr 
Franklin would be involved and not Mr Chaskalson.  If we 
seek to fix a date let’s close, we will try and consult 
everybody to see if we can do that but we in all probability 
we might use an evening session.   If we look at a date 
where everybody will get reasonable notice we might just 
fix the date and then take it from there, but thank you very 
much. 
 
I would like to see counsel from all sides in my 
20 
chambers before we disperse but thank you very much to 
everybody we will adjourn for the day. 
 
For the benefit of the public the Commission will not 
have a hearing tomorrow, it might not have a hearing on 
Wednesday as well, but if it has a hearing on Wednesday 
30 NOVEMBER 2020 – DAY 315 
 
Page 315 of 315 
 
the public will be told.  It will have a hearing on Thursday 
and on Friday. 
 
We adjourn. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thanks Chair. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.
