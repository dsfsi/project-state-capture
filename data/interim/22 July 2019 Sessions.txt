PROCEEDINGS COMMENCE ON 22 JULY 2019 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Good 
morning 
Ms 
Gcabashe, 
good 
morning 
everybody. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Good morning Chairman.  Chairman just as 
a… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Been – it has been quite some time we last saw you. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Mr Chair – Chairman you know that you 
keep us very busy doing back office work and the Vrede Dairy matter 
which is the one that is before you today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Is like an octopus with a million tentacles 
so we have been keeping busy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no that is fine.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman just as a preliminary point I do 
know that a couple of implicated parties’ legal representatives are here.  
I do not know if you simply want me to place them on record by telling 
you who they are or if you would prefer them to come up and place 
themselves on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think they should come up and place themselves on 
record if the intention is for them to be on record but sometimes they 
20 
just want to be present informally and not formally.  Maybe I should say 
those who wish to place themselves on record should come up and do 
so.  So that gives a chance to those who do not want to be placed on 
record formally to just sit there informally.  Okay thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Thank you Chairman. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137

ADV ALPHEUS DENGA:  As it please the hearing Chair I am Alpheus 
Denga.  I will be representing Mosebenzi Zwane in the proceedings.  
Thanks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Thank you. 
  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning. 
ADV TLELY:  I am Ms Tletli from Morocco Attorneys we will be 
representing Ms Namalele and Ms Qabathe in these proceedings Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second.  I do not know whether it is the 
microphone today or whether it is people speaking very softly because 
10 
with Ms Gcabashe too I felt that her voice was soft.  I think they are 
trying to do something.  Just raise your voice so everybody knows who 
you are and who you represent. 
 ADV TLELY:   Thank you Chair.  I am Ms Tleli frokm Morocco 
Attorneys we will be representing Ms Qabathe and Ms Namalele. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  
ADV TLELY:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is much better. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  It is much better thank you yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman in terms of the hearing schedule 
of the team today in fact for this week we will be leading the evidence 
of matters that occurred in relation to the Vrede Integrated Dairy Farm 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 4 of 185 
 
which we in short call the Vrede Dairy Farm.  Central to the 
investigations of the commission has been the quest Chairman to 
interrogate  
1. The decisions that were taken by various public officials and 
functionaries. 
2. The compliance with  legal prescripts by those officials and 
3. An effort to identify who the ultimate beneficiaries of the close to 
280 million that was dispersed by government between 2012 and 
2018 for this dairy project could have been. 
So there is quite a bit of evidence that we will be placing before you 
10 
Chairman.  Evidence which falls within the terms of reference this 
commission is seized with in particular term of reference 1.4 and term 
of reference 1.9.  I will not go through them Chairman because it is –  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  You have heard so much about those terms 
already. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  I – I do want to say Chairman that we have 
had a cooperation from the Department – affected departments and I 
think that is thanks to your entreaty to them every now and again to 
20 
come forward and assists us with documents.  So I do want to say they 
have been helpful and in fact Chairman we have a reference bundle 
that I will take you through. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  In a short while which is comprised of 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 5 of 185 
 
documents that were furnished by those departments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is fine.  That is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Rule 3.3. Notices Chairman we have a list 
of 3.3 Notices that have been issued.  I think all is in order in that 
regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman Rule 6.5 has relevance.  
Transcripts of proceedings that have preceded our commission 
hearings.  I have said to the witnesses as we have interviewed them 
that where they have been part of any proceedings they should please 
10 
indicate such and where possible we have tried to get transcripts.  In 
that regard Chairman you will find again with your leave that we have 
collected a couple of court records.  Because they are affidavits made 
under oath that certain people have deposed to that we have the used 
where we have not been able to speak to those witnesses we have 
been used to interrogated – have been used by us to interrogate the 
facts that have are [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman next I will then go through the 
exhibits that we will be handing up this morning. This particular chapter 
20 
falls under the HH HH – H for happy.  HH series Chairman.  The 
witness bundles for today are marked HH1 and HH2.  However 
Chairman we have been furnished with a supplementary affidavit by the 
first witness who will be Mr Jankielsohn because of your directive that 
where possible any amendments should be done prior to the hearing.  
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 6 of 185 
 
And that really is the essence of what that supplementary deals with.  It 
also has an annexure – a new annexure but the bulk of it really deals 
with just corrections that we would normally have done in the course of 
the first ten minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  So Chairman we then end up with Exhibit 
HH1.1 and 1.2 in respect of Mr Jankielsohn which we will ask you to 
admit into evidence.  When Ms Buthelezi leads the evidence of Mr 
Venter later today we will then deal with HH2.1 and I believe he too is 
trying to prepare a supplementary dealing with exactly the same issues. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  There may be one or two more and there 
may just be a 2.2 as well.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  But the base statements Chairman they 
made earlier this year are the base statements that are in those files. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.   
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman may I just… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well shall I immediately – so HH – Exhibit HH2  
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  That would be Mr Venter.  So that is for this 
20 
afternoon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is not here.  That is not before me or did – was 
it included here in this lever arch file? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman it is one lever arch file.  It is in 
that lever arch file.  There is a divider. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 7 of 185 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  That separates HH1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  And HH2.  Have you been able to locate it 
Chairman? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us say in regard to – or the statements and 
annexures relating to Mr Roy Jankielsohn and Mr Albertus Johannes 
Venter are contained in one lever arch file.  The statement relating to 
Mr Roy Jankielsohn is marked or will be Exhibit HH1 and the statement 
and annexures relating to Mr Albertus Johannes Venter will fall under 
10 
Exhibit HH2. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  That is correct Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the one lever arch file has two exhibits.  One 
Exhibit HH1, the other Exhibit HH2. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  That is correct Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Save that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Because of the supplementaries where they 
are just making those minor largely amendments. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes,  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  We have then split that to a 1.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  A 1.1 and 1.2 to accommodate the 
supplementaries.  But 1 still refers to Mr Jankielsohn’s statement. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 8 of 185 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  HH1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine.  Alright.  It may be – it may be 
that it is convenient if possible to keep each statement and its 
annexures either or the statement and annexures relating to one 
witness. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Under one exhibit.  Even if it means the file must be a 
smaller file it is much easier than if we put more than one into one 
lever arch file.  But for this one we will leave it as it is.  Ja okay. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Thank you – thank you Chairman we will 
arrange for that to be done during the tea break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Chairman then 
additional documents that we will be using over the two weeks that we 
will be dealing with Estina we have a week now Chairman and then a 
bit of a break and another week of hearings is formulated in the 
following manner Chairman.  The one is Exhibit HH Reference Bundle 
20 
A, B and C because it is – it has been filed in three files.  Those are 
the documents I say we will be referring to that we got largely from the 
departments that have tried to assist us.  The second bundle Chairman 
is Exhibit HH Legislation Bundle.  Again just for you ease of reference 
Chairman in case you need to refer to any piece of legislation. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 9 of 185 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  There again we have got an A and a B only 
because it was rather bulky piece of work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  The last one Chairman is Exhibit HH Media 
Bundle. There are a number of media articles that have been published 
on the Vrede Dairy matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  We thought it might be convenient for you 
to have the more important ones we could identify in a file and we will 
10 
use them again over the next two weeks of hearings as we call different 
witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman might I just say that what we 
have also done is take the report of the Public Protector. Again just for 
your ease of reference we know it has already been – I would like to 
think it has been handed up but that is sitting in the legislation bundle 
so as and when we need to refer to it and that particular witness has 
not got it in his or her bundle again it is just for your ease of reference 
where we can actually read from it.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might be convenient if it is not in the legislation 
bundle.  If it is either separate or it is part of – of these – I do not know 
how thick it is but you might consider making it under a separate lever 
arch file or something.  I think it would be convenient that way. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Certainly Chairman that we can – that can 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 10 of 185 
 
be arranged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  I believe that those are all the documents 
that we will be relying on Chairman might you admit them into the 
record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Thank you very much.  And the witness can be 
sworn in or the affirmation can be administered. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Roy Jankielsohn. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections in taking the prescribed 
10 
oath? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to binding on your conscience? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth; if so please raise your 
right hand and say, so help me God. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  So help me God. 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
20 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman if I might just enquire from you.  
For your convenience we have a supplementary affidavit that corrects 
particular paragraphs.  Mr Jankielsohn will deal with those amendments 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 11 of 185 
 
as he goes through the – his testimony but I am not sure if you would 
like us to just have the supplementary – how you want us to handle the 
actual supplementary statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I will – I would like to hand up – I would like you to 
hand up a copy now if possible. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  It has been put in your file this morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it here? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman only this morning though yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Would that be at the end or do you know 
where about it is? 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  At 1.2 Chairman there is a sleeve that is 
marked 1.2.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well… 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  And it is written supplementary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Mine has 1.2 Jankielsohn supplementary 
written on it Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ja okay ja.  I think it is better to – okay that is 
fine.  So it is okay I have seen where it is. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Thank you Chairman. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  What I would like to suggest Chairman is 
that Mr Jankielsohn simply gives his evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  And where he has made corrections on his 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 12 of 185 
 
original. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  He will mentioned that he – the 
supplementary statement deals with those corrections. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  If that is in order? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.   Mr Jankielsohn good 
10 
morning again.  Could you switch – yes switch on the microphone.  
Please – the documentation you have as 1. your statement that has 
been prepared and filed by the commission and we have given you 
some reference documents I will only point you to the ones that we may 
need.  I have tried to avoid dealing with them because there are a 
number of annexures in any event in your statement.  Can you go to 
page 1 of the paginated bundle – the one I would like to call the master 
copy that the commission has placed before you? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that Exhibit HH1? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  It is Exhibit HH1.  It really is 1.2 but it is 
20 
your original statement.  If you could turn to page 1 thereof – are you 
there?  Do you have it? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Am I – Exhibit HH1.1 or page 1 of the sworn 
affidavit through you Chairperson? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  You are – where you start setting out your 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 13 of 185 
 
testimony so you are at page 1 of Exhibit HH1.1.  Are you alright? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  I am there. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Good.  On that page it is entitled Judicial 
Commission etcetera sworn affidavit. Whose name appears on that 
page? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson my name Roy Jankielsohn 
appears on that page. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  If you could then hold onto that page and 
go to page 16 of the same document?   Could you confirm for the 
Chairman whose signature appears on page 16? 
10 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairman my signature appears on page 16. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  And then… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your – your one is the top one – there are two 
signatures there is that correct? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  The top signature Chairperson the deponent 
is my signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  The bottom signature is the commissioner of 
oaths. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  On what date did you depose to this sworn 
statement or sworn affidavit? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson it was at Bethlehem on the 29 t h 
day of April 2019. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:   Thank you Mr Jankielsohn.  I would then 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 14 of 185 
 
want you to go to Exhibit 1.2 which is the supplementary statement you 
have submitted.  Do you have that before – the supplementary 
statement? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  I do. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  The – on the first page of that again whose 
name appears there? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson my name appears there Roy 
Jankielsohn. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  And then on page 3 of that statement just 
before the annexure again who is the deponent who signed this 
10 
particular document? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson I signed the document. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  And when – on which date did you sign 
this? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  I signed it yesterday in Bethlehem. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Are you – are you confirming that the 
original affidavit and the supplementary affidavit contain the testimony 
that you will be giving today? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  I can confirm that Chairperson. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Then if I might – say – on the direction of 
20 
the Chairman as you go through your evidence where you want to make 
changes to the original affidavit which changes are currently reflected 
in the supplementary affidavit you will point out to the Chairman that 
paragraph such and such is one of the paragraphs I have dealt with in 
my supplementary affidavit and the amendment I have made is and you 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 15 of 185 
 
will tell him what the amendment is that relates to that.   
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  I will do so. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Yes.  Thank you Mr Jankielsohn.  I suppose 
a starting question is what brings you to the commission Mr 
Jankielsohn? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson as a member of the Provincial 
Legislature I have been as a – also as a member of the Portfolio 
Committee dealing with agriculture and rural development.  I have been 
as a member of the Legislature and a member of the committee 
involved with oversight over Provincial Government projects which 
10 
includes the Vrede Dairy Project and since I have been in the 
legislature since the inception of this project I have been involved as a 
member in dealing with this project in probing this project and trying to 
get to the bottom of this project from the perspective of a member of 
the Provincial Legislature whose job it is to do oversight and ensure 
accountability over the executive. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Could you explain to the Chairman what the 
source of the information that triggered your interest in the Vrede Dairy 
Farm might have been? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson there were two sources that 
20 
triggered my interest.  The one was during a SOPA address when the 
Premier of the Free State Ace Magashule mentioned it and at that stage 
it did not trigger any direct interest in the project because the Premier 
mentions various projects but there was subsequent to that an article in 
the Mail and Guardian which then generated my interest and prompted 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 16 of 185 
 
me to probe this project further. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Have you personally visited the Vrede Dairy 
Farm Mr Jankielsohn? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson I have visited the farm on a 
number of occasions so I am familiar with what the farm looks like on 
the ground and some of the activities that are taking place on the farm. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman with your permission we some 
visuals of the farm which we thought would be useful in giving context 
and giving an idea as to what it is Mr Jankielsohn has been keen to talk 
the commission about. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  We have asked him to kindly identify the 
visuals and just speak to them very briefly.  It at least gives you a 
context. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no that is in order. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman before we go any further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is in order. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Mr Jankielsohn you will just go through this 
on the screen as it is put up. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  So far I just see myself on the screen 
20 
Chairperson.   
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairperson while they are sorting that out 
there are very many questions that I have for Mr Jankielsohn might we 
proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us proceed. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 17 of 185 
 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  And when the visuals are ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They will… 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  We will then start. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They will indicate to you when they are ready ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  I – I thought I should ask you to give the 
Chairman an idea as to how issues are raised in the legislature just so 
that we as a country understand what your interest is and how you 
query issues that concern you in the legislature? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Thank you Chairperson.  There are various 
ways in which – through which we receive information in the legislature 
10 
and through which we are able to carry out our constitutional mandate 
which is to do oversight over the executive and to hold them 
accountable.  We have committees in the legislature and we as 
members of specific portfolio committees have the opportunity there to 
receive reports from departments.  We receive their budgets.  We 
receive their annual reports, their plans for the year and various other 
documents in that committee and we are able to probe their 
presentations to us.  We also have debates in the legislature where 
various MEC’s come and present their budgets and their plans of action 
to the legislature and we are able to debate those issues there but very 
20 
importantly is that specifically in the Free State legislature in terms of 
our rules each member of the legislature is able to ask three questions 
of any MEC’s or the Premier every week.  So we used that as an 
additional opportunity because it does happen as with the case of the 
Vrede Project which I will refer to later that when the departments and 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 18 of 185 
 
the MEC’s are in the committee that they do not always give us the 
information and they are often protected by the Chairperson of the 
committee.  But in – when we ask questions through the rules of the 
legislature they are obliged to give us replies within ten days failing 
which we can then request that those replies be placed over for oral 
reply during one of the sittings of the legislature.  So that is an 
opportunity for us to ask questions, to probe issues in the legislature 
and to get more detailed information especially in written questions 
where you can ask more detailed information than you would be able to 
perhaps do in a sitting or in committee.   
10 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Thank you.  Chairman it would appear that 
the visual presentation is ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
[VIEWING VISUAL PRESENTATION] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I take it that somebody will indicate how big the farm 
is in terms of hectares and so on in due course? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  In due course Chairman we have various 
people who will come and give you a lot more detail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  The intention this morning is to give you at 
20 
least a visual impression of the farm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  And to identify as many of the buildings as 
Mr Jankielsohn is able to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 19 of 185 
 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  But with your leave Chairman we will be 
putting it up again for specific purposes as we lead this evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Mr Jankielsohn can you start with the very 
fist slide?  Chairman is that clear enough for you? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it is. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  If you could … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is very clear. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  If you could identify – I would like you to 
start with the gate.  I know it is a very – it is not a very clear picture 
10 
but if you could give the Chairman just an idea as to where the 
entrance would be? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson if you do not mind I am going to 
use this screen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Because that one is a little bit far. 
ADV MUZI SIKHAKHANE:  Yes that is fine. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  For me to see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Right in the distance Chairperson you will 
20 
see two small walls just below the mountains that is the entrance gate 
of this facility.  So there are two walls there is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry you talk about a mountain.  I do not see a 
mountain there. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  In the distance Chairperson there. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 20 of 185 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Very far? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Very far. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  And then behind the – now we have moved 
forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is a forest there. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson if we can go back to the gate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  You will see behind that silver shed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Are those small two walls.  That is the 
entrance gate and then we have a gravel road that leads into the 
facility. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on.  I am sorry, hang on.  I see the – is it a 
shed or something? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  The grey one, the largest one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja the grey one. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  The grey shed. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Grey building. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the – ja. 
20 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Behind that the small … 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is a gate. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  The two small walls that is the entrance to 
the farm. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  You would think they were two cows or 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 21 of 185 
 
something.  Those brown stumps just in front of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes.  Yes okay that would be … 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  That grey building. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the gate? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  That is the gate Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairman they are very relevant because 
according to the initial proposal that gate was supposed to cost R2.6 
million.  So that is why it is relevant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  It is marked as 1 I see now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it possible to bring it closer, much closer to – for 
one to see it quite clearly or is that not easy? Yes something like that.  
Can you do more of that or not really?  Is that the best you can do?  
Oh. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  So those two brown protrusions… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it brick walls or what is that? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Mr Jankielsohn? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it brick walls? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson they are two brick walls yes with 
20 
the – with the gate in between yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With the gate in between? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright now I know.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  But Mr Jankielsohn can I also add to that 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 22 of 185 
 
that there has been a qualifying response to how much was spent on 
that.  Please tell the Chairman what you have also heard about the 
qualifying response just so the Chairman has a clear picture from the 
outset? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson yes the initial proposal that we 
received was that the gate would cost R2.6 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The gate? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  The entrance gate yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  To the facility which is those two walls that 
10 
you saw.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So the two walls and the gate? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The two brick walls for the gate and the actual gate? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  But in my supplementary affidavit paragraph 
9 and 10 I do indicate that in the Public Protector’s Report the former 
Premier of the Free State Mr Ace Magashule indicated that offices were 
bought with that money as well which is a guest house in Vrede Town 
20 
so the R2.6 million was also used to purchase that.  I did attach in my 
supplementary affidavit an annexure that shows that – that deals with 
the deeds search that was done around this property and the property 
was bought first by Estina for R1.2 million and was later sold to a 
private individual Mr Prasad Chandrama after that for an additional 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 23 of 185 
 
amount of R1.35 million.  And the reason why I am mentioning this … 
CHAIRPERSON:  1.35? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Million Rands. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Million okay. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes.  The reason I am mentioning that is 
because if we subtract the initial purchase of 1.2 from the 2.6 then the 
remainder is R1.4 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  And the remainder basically implies that 
those two walls and the gate were constructed for R1.2 million.  The 
10 
additional aspect of it which I mentioned in my supplementary affidavit 
is that the Premier then admitted that public funds were used to buy a 
property which was put in the name of a private company Estina and 
Estina later sold it to Mr Prasad Chandrama.  That is why it is relevant 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so public funds were used to buy property for a 
private individual? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  For the company Estina. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Who were the partners in the project but also 
20 
the implementing agents in the project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  And then they sold that at some profit? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  They sold it for some profit Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman that is evidence that will – we will 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 24 of 185 
 
be coming back to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will be provided. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  And that will become clearer as we go 
along. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Could you then identify the building that is 
closest to the gate? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson number 2 is the milk processing 
plant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am sorry.  You have those boards on the 
10 
picture there 1 and 2 and you have got the gate just on the other side – 
oh that – oh that is – those are just arrows.  Well they are prominent 
can I know what they mean that 1 and 2 what are they supposed to 
denote? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman they are simply an easy way for 
us to identify the item or the building that he is referring to.  So the 
first item he referred to was the gate that was marked 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  The second one he is now giving evidence 
on and identifying is the processing plant and it is marked 2.  As we go 
20 
through Chairman… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  I think we go through about ten pictures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then you will mark them ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  We mark them just for easy identification 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 25 of 185 
 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So is 2 a building or is it a field, what is 2?  
Okay.  So is 2 a building or is it a field, what is 2? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson 2 is the milk processing plant 
and in the initial proposal R30 million was allocated to this together 
with the milking parlour which we will see later.  So that grey building 
there is the processing plant which has a large amount of equipment in 
it and has never been used.  It is – it is dysfunctional at this stage.  In 
fact after the FDC the Free State Development Corporation took over 
the project they indicated that they will have to spend a large amount 
10 
of money to replace most of the equipment inside there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  The next building which is marked three can 
we go to that one?  What is that building Mr Jankielsohn? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson three is the workshop and 
storage facility of the farm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You know the – this arrow number three it is 
quite clear that it points to that building but the one and two is – is – 
one was the gate is that right? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  That is correct Chairman. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Somehow when I look at it – it is like it is 
pointing next to the silver grey shed you know.  I do not know whether 
there is a way of making it look like it is where it is supposed to be.  
Maybe it is not possible but you see when I look at – at these now it is 
like the two arrows are on the other side of the shed that is one and 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 26 of 185 
 
two but when I think later on if they are closer they all seem to be – to 
relate to the shed and next to the shed.  That might be my poor reading 
of these things. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  No Chairman … 
CHAIRPERSON:  If there is a way then it would be helpful.  Maybe by 
making the arrow actually touch the building that might help and make 
an arrow touch the wall – the gate then it will make it easy to – it will 
enable me not to – to get confused. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman this is really for your benefit.  So 
your comments are constructive. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  And they assist us … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Because we will be going back to this 
particular … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Visual time and time again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  If we get it right today then it makes … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then it – ja. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Things much easier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if it is possible to also have a copy of each visual 
you know a hard copy it – it would – it would also help.  So without 
looking at this later on if I want to refresh my memory of certain 
features of the – of the – of the farm then I can just look at pictures – 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 27 of 185 
 
hard copy pictures that could be arranged in due course. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  That will be arranged Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you.  I think – I think that – that might be 
quite helpful. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Are we able …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know.  It might be that they might need to do 
some work and maybe we continue and then once they are ready or 
they indicate. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Let us give it one more shot Chairman … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  And if it becomes confusing I think we 
should put it aside because this was supposed to assist you and give 
you a quick picture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  We can always come back to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is fine.  Let us – let us continue. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Gentlemen number four. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we – did we – have we spoken about the shed 
20 
because – because we are now going to talk about the two other 
buildings but there is that shed.  Have we spoken about what happens 
in that shed or not or is it – is there nothing of significance about it? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Mr Jankielsohn? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson, number three is that shed with 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 28 of 185 
 
the silver roof and you will see on the right underneath are some 
tractors and on the left there is a brick structure.  That is – those are 
the storage facilities for equipment and other items such as additional 
feed, fertiliser etcetera.  So it is basically the store – one of the 
storage sheds on the farm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and – and two does two relate to the silver shed?  
It looks like corrugated shed/corrugated iron. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson, two is – two is the processing 
plant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the processing plant? 
10 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes and if I can – if you – if you will allow 
me to explain Chair the project was a dairy but in addition to that 
Estina was meant to establish a processing plant to process the 
products of the dairy the commodity which should be milk and that is 
the – the shed number two with the equipment that was purchased 
which is totally dysfunctional at this stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No I think – I think now it - the way the arrows 
are it is helpful.  You know earlier on you would have – you would have 
heard me asking whether two related to a building or a – a feed – a 
field because it looked like it – it was pointing to beyond that silver 
20 
grey shed but what you are saying is that you are talking about what 
happens in the shed. 
Okay, thank you.  So two is whether the processing was going 
to happen.  That is the silver grey shed and three is also a shed.  It has 
got some red bricks and then it has got – what appears to be a 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 29 of 185 
 
corrugated iron roof and you say that is where they kept equipment? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE 
SC: 
 
Just to 
clarify 
for 
they 
Chairman 
Mr Jankielsohn where number three is – is where your tractors etcetera 
would have been parked but I will ask them to put up arrow number four 
just to clarify for the Chairman what number four - what that part of the 
building represented.  I know you are repeating what you are saying but 
it is easy for us because we have been there. 
It is for the Chairman to understand what is – what goes on in 
10 
that brick building – solid brick building where arrow number four is. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson, arrow number four is pointing 
to the cement between the two buildings not the silage shed.  Arrow 
number four is where the silage is stored.  So it is a storage facility. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:   
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Just – it is – a lot of the silage is kept 
underground Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  They dig holes.  They – they build a facility 
20 
and store it there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now three and four do they both relate to the 
structure that has got what appears like a corrugated iron roof and a 
part that has got what appears to be brick walls?  Do they both – those 
two arrows they relate to the same structure? 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 30 of 185 
 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  No Chairperson.  Four is a separate 
structure behind the other building at the back or next to the other 
building in the back – in the background. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I think (intervenes). 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  So it is – it is a separate structure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think … 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  I think we should … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Either whoever does the arrows is very bad or I am 
very bad in reading what it is. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chair – Chairman no it is – you are not – it 
10 
is not your – your difficulty at all.  I think we should come back to this 
once we have … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Later on. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Been able to properly identify each 
building. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It might need to be refined, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja, ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  And in the process we will also make a 
copy for you … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Of the – the presentation itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  That might make it easier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 31 of 185 
 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman if we might … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Then proceed in the meantime. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us proceed, ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  To all the other evidence.  I am also 
conscious Chairman that you have another witness whose evidence you 
have to hear today.  Mr Jankielsohn so we will come back to the 
structures on the farm but in the meantime the evidence I am going to 
take you through now drawn from your statement which I have read. 
We will first deal with your interaction with the Provincial 
10 
Government regarding the concerns you had about that particular farm.  
Secondly I am going to be asking you questions relating to your 
interaction with the Office of the Public Protector.  Third I will be 
exploring with you matters relating to the beneficiaries – your concerns 
around the beneficiaries and then any other additional matters. 
So we are dealing with the Provincial Government.  We will 
be dealing with the Office of the Public Protector.  We will deal with 
your concerns around the beneficiaries which I know you expressed and 
then lastly we will deal with any additional matters you want to bring to 
the attention of the Chairman.  Let us start with the Provincial 
20 
Government. 
The term “Mohuma Mobung” what is your understanding of 
what that term was supposed to represent? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson I was first confronted by this 
term when I was requested by Mr Mosebenzi Zwane who was former 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 32 of 185 
 
MEC of Agriculture in the Free State to meet with him in his offices at 
Glen Agricultural College on 17 November 2011.  During this meeting 
the MEC introduces this concept to us as a concept that would promote 
agri-processing in the Free State because we have a situation in the 
Free State where our agricultural sector produces various commodities. 
Many of these commodities are exported outside the province 
and then brought back into the province for the consumers to buy at 
additional cost.  So the concept as far as I understood it at the time 
was that the Provincial Government would create an environment for 
the stimulation of agri-processing in the Free State under the term 
10 
“Mohuma Mobung” and at the time in principle we supported this 
because it is important for us as the Free State to create additional 
employment opportunities for our people and to stimulate local 
economic development. 
So that is where I first was confronted by Mohuma Mobung 
but later in the affidavit you will see that Mohuma Mobung became 
more than just a concept.  It was – it later actually became a company 
connected to the Vrede Dairy Project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Mr Jankielsohn ion the documentation that 
20 
has been made available to the Commission this Mohuma – Mohuma 
Mobung has been referred to as a strategy.  It has also been referred to 
as an initiative.  If it were a strategy of Government would it have to be 
tabled in any form at all in the legislature? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson the strategies of Government 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 33 of 185 
 
are the behest of the Provincial Government Department.  So they 
would have – it would have been part of their Annual Performance 
Plans – the APPs – but it is not necessary for the Provincial 
Government to table every single aspect of their – of their work but it – 
– it would have been – it might have been tabled as part of that. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  So when Mr Zwane mentioned this to you - 
and in your statement you say it would have been at paragraph 8 – in 
November 2011 it really was a courtesy and to sound you out on what 
you thought of the idea? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes.  Chairperson it was purely a courtesy – 
10 
courtesy call and to sound us out and I went there as well to – out of 
interest what the MEC would like to talk to me about at the time. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Let us move onto the establishment of the 
Vrede Dairy Farm as a project.  I would like you to try and align the 
concept or the initiative of Mohuma Mobung with the Vrede Dairy Farm.  
Your understanding of where the Vrede Dairy Farm would then have 
fitted into that Mohuma Mobung strategy.  If you think there is an 
alignment at all. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson the Vrede Dairy Farm if it were 
to be part of what we understood as Mohuma Mobung would be that the 
20 
Vrede Dairy Farm would produce milk and that this milk would be 
processed on the processing plant which was to be established on the 
farm and that these products would then sold locally and further abroad 
nationally. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  When you first heard about the Vrede Dairy 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 34 of 185 
 
Farm as I understand your evidence it was really when the Premier 
mentioned in his State of the Province Address that this was one of the 
projects the Province would be undertaking. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes.  Chairperson during the Premier’s State 
of the Province Address in 2012 - in February 2012 – he mentioned the 
Vrede Dairy Project as one of various other projects which the 
Provincial Government would be involved in and it is a place the State 
of the Province Address where the Premier would indicate what his 
plans were for the Province going forward. 
So initially the Vrede Dairy Project would not have raised 
10 
serious alarms at all.  It would just be another one of those projects 
which the Provincial Government was planning to implement hopefully 
to benefit the people of the Free State. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  You then have also said earlier that it was 
when you read a – a media article and you have annexed RJ2 – 
Annexure RJ2 – as the media article that raised your concerns.  When 
you read this article you thought you should explore with Government 
what was going on at this farm. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson, yes.  In 2013 the Mail & 
Guardian published an article which I have attached in my annexures.  
20 
The heading of the article raised serious alarms with us because the 
heading says:  “The Guptas Land of Milk and Honey” and then it goes 
out to link a family which we did not have much interest in at the time 
and which later became relatively notorious for all the wrong reasons. 
That it basically linked this family to the farm and also raised 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 35 of 185 
 
concerns that there might be various irregularities regarding this 
project.  So that is where my specific interest was initiated. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  What steps did you then …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that – so it is the Guptas land of milk and 
money and not honey but and money.  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  That – that is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  It is the Guptas land and milk - of milk and 
money and not honey, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
10 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  I would prefer honey to money Chairperson 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  When reading such an article. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you have got money you can buy honey.  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Can I then ask you to 
explain to the Chairman the steps you took to try and find out what 
exactly was going on with this particular farm? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that may I just say that if it is possible at all – 
20 
if it is at all possible to obtain clearer articles of this article and other 
articles and whatever annexures that might not be so clear.  That would 
be really helpful. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  We will do that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In course.  Thank you. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 36 of 185 
 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Yes Mr Jankielsohn you were going to 
explain to the Chairman what steps you then took. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson as I indicated previously when 
questioned about this.  There are various ways in which we can 
interrogate.  So my first port of call was to go to the committee which I 
was a member of that deals with agriculture and rural development and 
through the committee request a report from the department on the 
specific project and we did receive a report which was signed by 
MEC Qabathe. 
I - I have attached it as annexure three on 10 July 2013 and 
10 
this report is addressed to the then Chairperson Ms Gondwana who was 
Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee of Agriculture and Rural 
Development and in this report various aspects relating to the dairy 
project are indicated.  Information which we did not have previously.  
For example that representatives of the department had visited India to 
investigate and look for various partners in this project. 
For the first time as well in this report we formally in the 
legislature are introduced to a company called Estina (Pty) Ltd who 
(intervenes). 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Mr Jankielsohn if you could just indicate to 
20 
the Chairman which paragraph you are at.  Just so that he knows 
exactly where you are.  So your first reference to the visit to the India 
would have been on first page under executive summary under point 
one.  If you just help the Chairman follow because he has not seen 
these documents. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 37 of 185 
 
He has looked at them but not studied them the way you have 
and then as you move on to the next point if you say to him if we turn 
to page 46 etcetera.  It will help, thank you. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Thank you.  Chairperson RJ3 the report point 
number one executive summary.  The second paragraph reveals that 
representatives of the department visited India.  The largest milk 
producers in the world and met with several established dairy 
producers and milk processing plants.  Many of whom they indicate 
expressed a keen interest in working with the department. 
On page 2 of that document Chairperson they indicate that 
10 
the department hereafter signed an agreement with Estina (Pty) Ltd 
with the understanding that Estina had strong relationships with several 
well established dairy producers in India to deploy this flagship project. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Can I ask you to pause again?  Was this 
the first time you were finding out that the Vrede Farm Project was a 
flagship dairy project for Government? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes.  This is the first time it came to that 
type of prominence where we were informed that it was a flagship 
project. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  And … 
20 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  And also that there is a company - again 
this was Government’s response to you – the MEC’s response that 
Government had appointed this particular company to handle - I will 
use that word loosely because I know you want to deal with the detail 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 38 of 185 
 
of the handling – to handle this particular project? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes.  Chairperson this is the first time that I 
was made aware by Government that the company Estina (Pty) Ltd were 
involved in the project.  Even though it might have been mentioned in 
the land of milk and honey media article I prefer to get first-hand 
information through reports or through our questions or other 
documents from the Provincial Government to confirm.  I prefer to use 
those source documents than to rely on – on media reports. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Yes continue.  The investment that was 
made. 
10 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  The second paragraph Chairperson indicates 
that a phased investment by partners in the project is based on a total 
projected investment of R570 million.  The first phase implementation 
of the project is based on an initial grant of the department whereby a 
total of 114 million is required per year.  This will add up to a total 
committed grant of R342 million over a period of three years and that is 
money that would have been sourced from Government.   
The second phase implementation is the processing plant by 
Estina for the amount of R228 million in the second year of 
implementation and they indicate here that they were still in the 
20 
process of – of implementing the project but later it was confirmed that 
Estina did not meet this obligation of the processing plant because it – 
it never became functional and in fact we were – Estina did not invest 
R228 million in this project as indicated. 
The other detail on it deals with the dairy infrastructure, the 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 39 of 185 
 
various phases.  The – phase one the dairy infrastructure, phase two 
the processing plant, product market and sales and then on the third 
page Chairperson it deals with this project as a flagship project.  If you 
go to the middle of page 3 Chairperson and you see a heading 
“Overarching Benefits for the Province and the Nation”.  The first bullet 
point says: 
“In line with the Agri BEE business norm stipulated 
by Government it has been agreed that a new 
special purpose vehicle be created in which Estina 
will hold a 49 percent share while the remaining 51 
10 
percent shares will be distributed to selected grant 
recipients.” 
Now later in my affidavit I deal with this in more detail 
because later I will explain that Estina received a 49 percent share of 
the project but only committed a 40 percent funding to this project in 
equity.  So there is basically a nine percent equity bonus in terms of 
shares for the amount of money that they put in and then also later on 
we will deal in more detail with the fact that they say here that 51 
percent shares will be distributed to grant recipients who were the 
intended beneficiaries of the project and these recipients never – were 
20 
never part of this project at all and were totally side-lined throughout 
the process but we will deal with that in more detail. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Mr Jankielsohn so this an official response 
from the MEC.  This is the relevance of this document outlining what 
the project is about and in a sense justifying the decisions taken on 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 40 of 185 
 
this particular project.  Were you happy with the response? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson that was the initial report from 
the MEC to the committee and based on the information of this report I 
then submitted supplementary questions in terms of the rules relating 
to questions in the legislature which I mentioned previously to obtain 
more detailed information on the funding.  For example they talk – they 
talk about funds committed – large amounts of funds committed by 
Government but they do not indicate what exactly these funds are going 
to be utilised for. 
So I used the question which I have annexed to obtain 
10 
additional information on - on this information that was given to the 
committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that since the meeting you had with 
Mr Mosebenzi Zwane and this report there had been a change of MEC 
for this department.  This report came under the name of an MEC other 
than Mr Mosebenzi Zwane.  Is that correct? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  That is correct Chairperson.  In the Free 
State Province the MECs especially regarding the Department of 
Agriculture played musical chairs.  So there is a regular changing of 
MECs in the – in the province.  We have had - even since here.  We 
20 
have had a number of other MECs who have been responsible for this 
department. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
do 
you 
– 
do 
you 
recall 
when 
Mr Mosebenzi Zwane had ceased to be MEC for this department and 
this new MEC took over or is that something that you are not sure 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 41 of 185 
 
about? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson I do not have the exact dates in 
the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  When these various MECs took office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  But the position in law is the MEC in office 
represents the views of that department irrespective of the person.  
That is – that is an official response from the MEC in office? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  That is correct Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  What – what you may wish to do if you have not done 
that already is to get the specific dates because obviously once you are 
no longer MEC for the department you are not responsible for what 
happens in the department after you have left but for the period that 
you were MEC you are responsible.  So if that information can be 
obtained that would be helpful.  Then one knows which MEC is 
responsible for what happened when. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chair … 
20 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  If – if I may – if I may assist.  It was 
MEC Zwane who was the – who initiated the project … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  And most of the implementation was under 
MEC Qabathe. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 42 of 185 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is – that is fine.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  If we might just tidy up this point 
Mr Jankielsohn by going to Annexure RJ9.  You have said that you 
interrogated the issue further.  Unless you want to deal with a different 
annexure.  I have looked at RJ9 and thought – and your statement and 
thought this might be what you want to take the Chairman through very 
briefly as the more detailed response that you referred to earlier. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes.  Chairperson RJ9 was a response to 
various 
questions 
that 
I 
submitted 
through 
the 
legislature 
to 
MEC Qabathe which she replied to on 13 November 2013 and why this 
10 
specific annexure and document is very important is because this reply 
is also what prompted me to request the Public Protector to investigate 
this project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson if I can – would you – would you 
like me to go through this – the response of the MEC? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Gcabashe will guide you which of those she would 
like you to highlight. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  I think this is a 
particularly important document Mr Jankielsohn because it sets out 
20 
what was planned in terms of funding for this project.  If you can then 
just very briefly then take the Chairman through paragraph 3.2 which 
details some of the amounts that the MEC says was spent on this 
project. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson 3.2 the question was: 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 43 of 185 
 
“What each of the respective amounts were spent 
on since the project was initiated.” 
The first bullet point the MEC indicates: 
“Establish 151 hectares of crops and fodder which 
are maize crops which are planted on 86 hectares 
…” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am – I am sorry.  Will I not understand 3.2 better if 
you start at 3.1 Mr …? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman he had – he had set out 3.1 a 
little earlier.  The 114 … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Per annum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Maybe – maybe he can just quickly deal with 
it.  Maybe I missed it.  Ja, 3.1. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson I will go through each … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Each question then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  3.1. 
“How much money has been spent on each – in 
20 
each year since the project was initiated?” 
The reply: 
“The department has committed to pay the total 
contribution of 342 million over a period off three 
years in tranches of 114 million per year.  The first 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 44 of 185 
 
contribution was done in two payments of 30 million 
and 84 million which is equal to 114 million in 
2012.” 
Question two: 
“What were each of the respective amounts spent 
on since the project was initiated?” 
Bullet point one: 
“The MEC indicates the establishment of 151 
hectares of crops.” 
And then they mention the various crops that have been 
10 
planted and also the cost of seeds, fertilizers, inputs and diesel which 
was R319 290.  The second bullet point relates to labour costs of 
1 309 097.  Bullet point three indicates that: 
“A silage bunker was built for R5 million.” 
The next bullet point indicates: 
“The construction of a gravel access road of plus 
minus two kilometres.” 
And they indicate it was completed at R1.2 million.  Then 
they speak to the cattle shed which cost R500 000.  A security gate and 
guardhouse of R2.6 million which I also indicated previously when we 
20 
dealt with the photographs.  A temporary veterinary laboratory of R300 
million. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  No.  Your reading of that number is … 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Oh. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Not correct Mr Jankielsohn. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 45 of 185 
 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Which number would that be? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  The veterinary – the veterinary.  It is 
300 000. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  300 000, sorry.  Yes.  The temporary 
veterinary laboratory of R300 000.  I am sorry.  I am talking in so many 
millions.  I – I get confused between the two. 
“Cattle feed plant of R7.35 million.  A milking 
parlour.  A 10 point static parlour and 72 point 
rotary 
parlour 
and 
milk 
processing 
plant 
of 
R30 050 000.” 
10 
So it is 30 million and R50 000. 
“The purchasing of farm equipment:  tractors – two 
John Deere tractors and various other tractors at 
R2.36 million.” 
Equipment which they indicate here are things like: 
“Ploughs, 
cultivators, 
maize 
planters, 
boom 
sprayers, fertilizer spreaders, water browser, diesel 
browser, 
spray 
guns, 
generator 
with 
welding 
machine, balers, disc mowers, harrows, wheel 
rakes, tipper trailers.” 
20 
I am going very fast through them Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  The total cost of the equipment was R3.5 
million.  The farm tools which is the next bullet point and this includes: 
“Spanner set sizes one to 36, ring spanner and 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 46 of 185 
 
screwdriver, socket set, heavy duty vice, trolley 
jack, a pick, shovel, silage fork, axe, rake, saw, 
spot lamp, grinder …” 
Which is also includes gardening tools basically. 
“Air compressor and drill machine for a …” 
What I thought was a staggering amount of R2.5 million 
Chairperson if one looks at it.  It is a couple of tools and garden 
equipment, ja.  The purchasing of dairy cows for R6.2 million and this 
is also very relevant to the Public Protector’s report eventually because 
we did get additional quotes for this Chairperson.  The next bullet 
10 
point: 
“The land surveyor, agriculturist, accounting fees, 
office equipment, insurance salaries and wages, 
professional fees, administration fees and legal 
fees together cost R12 million.” 
So it is basically all the administration around it was 12 
million and then they secured a pasteuriser, dairy equipment and 
irrigation equipment for R37.7 million Chairperson and it – it – this 
reply is very important because when one looks at it just a cursory look 
at this it immediately raises alarms … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I mean … 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  That they inflated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Two tractors - that first bullet point under – under 
purchasing of farming implements – two tractors - John Deere tractors 
and two what – I do not know what a tractor Tafe or whatever it is 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 47 of 185 
 
called is but 2.3 – R2.3 million.  Do you know what a tractor Tafe is or 
whatever?  I do not know what the pronunciation is or T-A-F-E. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson I think it refers to the fact that 
they bought four tractors.  Two different – two of one kind and two of 
another kind for 2.36 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  It is – it is – sounds so unrealistic and excessive. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson, if – if I can just stand still on 
this.  I mention it in some of my other annexures as well.  Is that during 
this time the National Department had donated about R40 million worth 
of tractors and equipment to the Free State.  So one of the issues that I 
10 
raised as well is that why is it necessary to purchase additional 
equipment and tractors when in fact many of these tractors and much of 
the equipment was standing at the showgrounds at Vrede town and 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there were tractors that were physically available 
that had been donated by the national department? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes Chairperson.  I am of the opinion that 
those tractors could have been – could have been used for this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and they were not been used they were just there 
in your understanding at least … 
20 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson they … 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that time? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  They stood at the showgrounds and various 
other storage places.  We were even informed that some of them were 
stored at this farm for a long time and then what they did with those 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 48 of 185 
 
tractors is they eventually allocated them to districts.  They formed five 
entities in the districts.  Donated these tractors to those entities and 
those entities then sold those services back to Government to plant for 
various projects and emerging farmers.  So what – what I indicated at 
the time is that those – that grant from Government of tractors and 
equipment was used to create another layer of bureaucracy and another 
layer of people who were then using this equipment to obtain funds 
from Government but that was not part of my … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Affidavit to the Vrede Dairy Project.  It is just 
10 
for background information Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman I notice we are beyond quarter 
past 11.  This might be a good time to take the tea adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let us take the tea adjournment.  We will 
resume at 20 to 12.  We adjourn. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  As it pleases. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.

CHAIRPERSON:  I saw what happened, I know you are trying to get 
things in order. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 49 of 185 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that’s fine, yes we were busy with – we were at 
page 177. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes I have a legal representative who 
would like to place himself on record, would you like him to do it at the 
end of these proceedings or at this point in time? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was he not here when we…(intervention). 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  He was not here, Chairman, when we 
started. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He should have been here at the time. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Your prerogative Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja let’s carry on he will place himself on record later 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Mr Jankielsohn we 
are going through Annexure RJ9 and you had dealt with the matters 
under 3.2 in a bit of detail, you are now at the bottom of page 177 and 
if you could just summarise what’s set out in 3.3 and 3.4, just the 
relevant parts of that and then if you could just tidy up your input on 
this particular document? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Thank You, Chairperson question 3, were 
there any outside individuals or companies have been paid any money 
in respect of this project, a) who are these respective individuals, the 
20 
next page the reply to a) says Estina…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s 3.3? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  3.3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  The next page indicate the reply being Estina 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 50 of 185 
 
and 3.3 b), what services were provided by these respective individuals 
and 
companies, 
b) 
the 
reply 
indicates 
Estina 
to 
ensure 
the 
implementation of the project in the district with due skill diligence 
regularity and expedition and complete the project but a little bit further 
on – I’m not going to read through everything Chair, with your 
indulgence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  A little bit further on, very important in the 
reply the MEC indicates, part of the responsibility of Estina is to ensure 
that sound financial management and accountability systems are in 
10 
place and provide the department with monthly and annual reports as in 
line with the monitoring and evaluation system of the Department of 
Agriculture and rural development.  Question 4, what is the total 
amount that the department plans to spend, this was replied to in the 
report as well, R570million which the department had committed a 
contribution of R342million and over a period of three years.  Question 
– with a reply to question 5, which was, when will the project be 
complete, the reply indicates the Vrede Dairy Project was initiated on 
the 5 t h of July 2012 and is envisaged to be completed by July 2015.  
What are the expected outcomes of the project for the Free State 
20 
Province and there are various overarching benefits for the Province 
and the nation here as well in the first bullet point they refer to the 
project being in line with Agri BEE business norms stipulated by 
Government.  Estina proposes that a new special purpose vehicle be 
create in which Estina will hold a 49% share and the remaining 51% of 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 51 of 185 
 
the shares will be distributed to selected grant recipients.  Estina will 
provide the required capital injection as well as technical know how 
which will be provided by Paras, it is envisaged that the integrated Agri 
Business Project will become a centre of excellence for the Free State 
and even neighbouring provinces, Chairperson and there are various 
other aspects here relating to basic business financial management 
skills that they want to implement, cooperative processing, value 
adding marketing facilities etcetera which are in the reply.  Again we 
ask, who is the private second partner and again the MEC replies at 
3.7, Estina, 3.8 how much money will the private sector partner invest 
10 
in the project, the total project cost is R570million of which Estina will 
contribute R228million.  What is the agreement in 3.9, the question is 
what is the agreement between the province and the private sector 
partner in terms of the investment and they indicate here, the 
department has entered into an agreement with Estina for the 
construction and implementation of a dairy project with infrastructure?  
The first phase of the project involves setting up the dairy parlour 
within in house capacity of up to 1000 cows to supply milk to the 
parlour.  The dairy construction will also include, among others, feed 
storage, feed slots, land cultivation for feed on 4.4 – 4 400 hectares of 
20 
municipal land.  The second phase of the project involves setting up of 
a milk and dairy products processing plant to produce packaged milk 
and other dairy products.  Estina agrees in pursuance of the project for 
the formulation of a new legal entity Mohamo Mobung Dairy Project 
(Pty) Limited wherein Estina shall hold a 49% share and the farmers a 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 52 of 185 
 
51% share. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Jankielsohn, can I just probe one 
aspect here, is it correct that – what is being communicated here is 
that Government will make the initial investment and then it’s only at 
the second phase of the project that Estina will then put up that 
processing plant. I’m looking at the evidence you have given to this 
point, is that your understanding of what was going to happen? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  That is my understanding, Chairperson in 
terms of the reply that I received from the MEC, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes continue, just to summarise the last 
10 
few points. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  If I can go to the next page RJ180, 
Chairperson I’m going to skip the top section which just deals with 
additional things that Estina will do, for example just to provide 
beneficiaries with aftercare or mentorship in conjunction with extension 
support from the department according to the scope of work for each 
project shall use local labourers to provide evidence as per the 
agreement, these are just  the last two bullet points at the top of the 
page and then they indicate, the training, mentoring and support will be 
assessed beforehand by Glen Agricultural Institute and if it is not 
20 
satisfactory it will have to be rectified by the service provider.  Now 
why this reference to the beneficiaries is important is because up until 
now, to date, these beneficiaries have been totally side-lined for the 
project and it is my opinion, Chairperson that an Agricultural project 
cannot exist without beneficiaries.  It is not Government’s job to milk 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 53 of 185 
 
cows.  In this specific project the purpose would have been to identify  
beneficiaries and then to implement the project and ensure that these 
beneficiaries are part of the project from the outset because then they 
would be able to take ownership of the project, there would have been 
in-house training of the project and they would have been given 
employment during the initial phases of this project as well but the 
exclusion of the beneficiaries is very strange to me, given that 
Government projects have one purpose and that should be to benefit 
some beneficiaries on the ground, the people on the ground and in this 
case the community of Vrede are – most of the people there are 
10 
impoverished, there’s huge unemployment and people were hoping that 
this project will bring some relief to at least those 80 people who were 
later identified to beneficiaries and unfortunately those people are still 
side-lined in this project. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Jankielsohn can we then turn to page 
207 which is yet another response to your enquiries, I’m really just 
trying to deal with how the legislature, how Government responded to 
the enquiries you made in your capacity as a member of the portfolio 
committee on agriculture and a member as the legislature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe before he does so, and please don’t forget 
20 
what the question was.  As at the time that you received this report, 
was there, in existence, to your knowledge a study or a document that 
indicated that a study had been undertaken or some work had been 
done to say, if we want to achieve these goals, using this kind of 
project, what are the steps that will be necessary, what are the skills 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 54 of 185 
 
that will be necessary, what will all this cost the department and 
whether the result of that study showed that it would be worthwhile to 
embark upon this project.  Was there any document that reflected that 
kind of homework? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson my understanding of this project 
is that certain individuals from the department and perhaps even some 
of the politicians visited India to try and find a partner for this project, 
so this project would have been, in my understanding, initiated within 
Government itself and that’s where the idea of the project would have 
come form and the documents that I received as well were only relating 
10 
to the – only relate to the presentation made by, firstly Estina – under 
the name of Estina and Paras to Government and later the department 
to the Executive Committee requesting that this department receive the 
necessary funding and one of the issues that I refer to in my bundle of 
documents as well is that – and which is also referred to by some of the 
other bodies like the Treasury – the National Treasury investigated is 
that no feasibility study appears to have been done.  One would have 
thought, as you correctly indicated Chairperson, that a feasibility study 
would be done beforehand to determine what the purpose of the project 
is, who the beneficiaries would be of this project, what the costs of this 
20 
project would entail and then also include the necessary timeframes for 
this but it appears that it – from the documentation that I’ve got this 
project, from the replies that I received was basically an agreement 
between Government and Estina, the beneficiaries were mentioned, 
almost in passing, and also used to justify the project but were never 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 55 of 185 
 
physically involved in the project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So to the best of your knowledge, no feasibility study 
had been undertaken by the department to see that this kind of project 
was worth spending the kind of tax payer’s money that was envisaged 
and that it would achieve the desired goals? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson you are correct, in my 
knowledge I’m not aware of any feasibility study and none of the 
documents that I received from the Provincial Government in terms of 
the report or replies made any reference to a feasibility study at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Mr Jankielsohn the 
objective facts, however, not the ones that were presented to you but 
the objective facts say there was a feasibility study that was 
conducted.  I just want to place this on record because we have the 
documentation and if my memory serves me well it was in October 
2013.  I know that the agreements were signed in July of 2012 and the 
feasibility study was done, Chairman might I correct myself, in October 
of 2012 a few months later.  So it was still a case of putting the cart 
before the horse. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because the feasibility study came long 
after the agreement was signed and long after any monies were 
dispersed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Just to set the record…(intervention). 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 56 of 185 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  But you are correct Mr Jankielsohn that in 
terms of the documentation that was furnished to you no feasibility 
study was attached he documentation and to the answers that were 
given to you in the legislature.  Can we then move on from that, I take 
it that you have dealt with most of the important aspects on this 
document, unless there is anything else you wanted to point to, I’d like 
to move on to the next aspect.  Shall we do that? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  We can, I’m not sure Chairperson if I must 
just answer, you said I must just hold onto the previous question while 
10 
you asked a question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes I didn’t want you not to answer Ms 
Gcabashe’s question but I think my interruption disturbed her thinking, 
she forgot that you still owed her an answer.  Yes you can give the 
answer. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Thank you Chairperson, in a reply from an 
acting MEC, Ms Olly Mlamleli on 30 April 2015, she confirmed in her 
reply that Estina was appointed as a service provider and when asked 
about beneficiaries she said beneficiaries were residents from the area 
surrounding the project previously disadvantaged and with a keen 
20 
interest in farming. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And that you’ll find on page 208, that 
particular answer under point 2? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Mr Jankielsohn.  I do want to 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137

move on, if you’re satisfied that we have at least settled the broad 
interaction you had with your colleagues in the legislature and 
responses they gave you when you interrogated the basis on which this 
dairy farm had been established.  Can we move on to the agreement 
between the department and Estina and that you will find at your RJ5, 
Annexure RJ5.  Do you recall when you were able to get hold of a copy 
of this agreement? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson I can’t recall the exact date, I’ve 
been involved with this project for several years and I can’t remember 
which documents I received and specific dates. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Who are the parties to this agreement? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson RJ5, which is a copy of the 
agreement indicates that the agreement is entered into and between 
the Department of Agriculture and Estina (Pty) Limited. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And who signed on behalf of the 
department? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson on page 143 of the document, it 
is signed at Bloemfontein on the 5 t h of July 2012 by the Head of 
Department, Mr Peter Thabethe as witness S. S Dlamini who I assume 
was the former CFO of the department if it is the same individual. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes and then on behalf of Estina? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:   On behalf of Estina singed on the same date 
in Bloemfontein a Mr Gautam managing director of Estina, Sanjeev 
Gautam and as witness Mr R J Sharma. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can you then turn to the very next page 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 58 of 185 
 
which sets out the obligations in the first phase? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson, obligations, 1) land acquisition, 
2) environmental impact assessment, 3) feasibility study, 4) water 
reticulation, 
5) 
electricity 
connections, 
6) 
include 
identified 
beneficiaries in Agri BEE entity, 7) set up of Agri BEE entity and clarify 
roles of stakeholders, the department and Estina, 8) draw a project 
plan up in line with Estina proposals which must have milestones and 
timeframes for phase 2 as approved by the department and 9) 
determine the dates for capital injection by Estina. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes thank you.  What do you know about 
10 
the acquisition of the land and so that would be the 4.4 hectares that 
was acquired at Vrede? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Four thousand four hundred hectares Chair. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes correct. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  The land, as far as I’m aware belonged to 
the Phumelela local Municipality and that Estina then signed a 99-year 
lease on this land for the purposes of implementing this project. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Is that the extent of your knowledge? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  That’s the extent of my knowledge yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You have said that you no nothing about 
20 
the feasibility study what about the EIA, the Environmental Impact 
Assessment, is that something that you might have enquired about at 
some point? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes, Chairperson, when we heard that a 
number of cattle had died on the project I was very concerned, I visited 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 59 of 185 
 
the project with Carte Blanche team who also requested us to go and 
show them this and we found a spot on the farm where a number of 
cattle had been buried next to a stream and my interest in it is that the 
stream also feeds the local town with water and if these cattle – 
besides the fact that they died which is a concern to us,  the larger 
concern is that these carcases would pollute the stream and cause 
health issues for the neighbouring town of Vrede.  We did request 
information around this and we were informed later that the carcases 
had been moved to a different spot and that there was no longer cause 
for a concern. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If you then turn to page 270 where you 
will find Annexure RJ16, this is one of the last responses you got to 
your enquiry, this particular response is dated 2015. Could you please 
take the Chairman through again, the responses that you were given as 
a committee/as the legislature to the issues that you were raising in 
that forum? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry I missed the page? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It’s 270 Chairman and it’s RJ16. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So it’s addressed to a Mr B F Mothupi who 
20 
was the table assistant or it could be a Ms Mothupi who was the table 
assistant Free State Legislature, could you speak to this document? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson this is a reply received on the 
28-04-2015 relating specifically to the agreement between Estina and 
the Provincial Department, shall I go through – Chairperson, shall I go 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 60 of 185 
 
through the questions and replies as I did with the previous? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, unless Ms Gcabashe indicates you to highlight 
on this certain of them that she’s interested in. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Jankielsohn if you could deal with 
question 2.1, I was hoping you could speak to it rather than read every 
clause, but I don’t want to rush you and I want it to be convenient for 
you to give these responses, I really just want them on the record as a 
response from the legislature. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson 2.1, what are the terms of the 
contract pertaining to the Vrede Dairy Project between the Provincial 
10 
Government and Estina prescribe regarding the cancellation of the 
project, and the reply is, the parties shall have the right to terminate 
the agreement without prejudice to any of its any other rights upon the 
occurrence of any of the following acts and then the first one on breach 
of the agreement as stipulated in clause 10, the breach of the 
agreement. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:    So we can take it where the agreement 
was breached, they could terminate the contract, that’s the first one? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And they set out all the different parts of 
20 
that breach clause? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  That’s correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can you then go on to 2.2, you’ll tell me if 
I am rushing you, I really just want this on record. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  2.2 indicates that they have the ability to 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 61 of 185 
 
suspend further payments to the defaulting party. So if the – I presume 
that if the agreement were terminated then the Provincial Government 
would suspend further payments to the defaulting party. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes can I ask you Mr Jankielsohn, you’ll 
tell me if I’m rushing you, but I actually want you to move on to page 
271 and on page 271 there is a question under 2.2 on what date was 
the contract cancelled, can you go to that point? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson the question, on what date was 
the contract cancelled, and the reply, the department cancelled the 
agreement with Estina (Pty) Limited on 13 August 2014. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Please deal with 2.3. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Whether any claims were made by Estina 
against the Provincial Government regarding the cancellation of this 
contract, if so what is the nature of the claim, b) the amount?  The 
reply, no claim was made by Estina since the cancellation of the 
contract.  2.4 whether the department intends to pay any amounts 
relating to this claim if not why not, if so how much, and the reply is, no 
claim was made by Estina since the cancellation of the contract. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If you go back to your affidavit Mr 
Jankielsohn and if you look at page 9 of that affidavit, there are some 
20 
figures that you set out in your paragraph 18.25 relating to payments 
that were made.  Please just take the Chairman through the dates of 
those payments bearing in mind that the contract was cancelled on the 
13 t h of August 2014. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson, since the cancellation of the 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 62 of 185 
 
contract the information that I have is that on 20 December 2014, and 
we mentioned the contract was terminated in August 2014 and amount 
of R29.950million was paid to Estina by the Provincial Government 
Department.  On 8 May 2015 and amount of R60million was paid to the 
Provincial Department – or to Estina by the Provincial Department and 
5 May 2016, R46.252million was paid to Estina by the Provincial 
Department, the total of which adds up to R136 202 652.00.  Now it’s 
interesting because there is a cancellation agreement between Estina 
and the Department in which they indicate that R106 252 652.00 will be 
paid by the Provincial Department to Estina based on monies that the 
10 
provincial department indicated they still owed to Estina at the time.  
There is a discrepancy between the  amounts paid and the cancellation 
agreement amount of just over R106million of R29.95million, that’s the 
discrepancy between the physical amount paid and the amount 
indicated in the cancellation agreement which is close to R30million 
and just as a side Chairperson, the Gupta leaks indicated that it was 
R30million that was allegedly paid from the Project for the Gupta 
wedding and if I can go back to the replies that I received in line with 
the questions I was asked previously, it does, to a degree, contradict 
those replies, because in those replies the acting MEC indicates that 
20 
there’s no amounts owing to Estina, nothing will be paid after the 
cancellation.  The cancellation agreement says otherwise and the 
amounts paid indicate otherwise as well. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Mr Jankielsohn if you go to page 139 I am 
taking you back to the agreement.  139.  And if you then read 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 63 of 185 
 
paragraph or clause 15.3 which falls under the heading Termination.  
Please just read that into the record and I will ask you a question as 
soon as you have done that? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  15.3 
“Exhaustion of Funds” 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson it reads as follows: 
“It is also agreed that should funds no longer be 
available to pay for the execution of the project the 
department may terminate this agreement in its own 
10 
discretion or temporarily suspend all or part of the 
project by notice to Estina who shall immediately 
make arrangements to stop the performance of the 
project and minimise further expenditure provided 
that Estina shall there upon be entitled to payment in 
full for the services delivered up to the date of 
termination or suspension.” 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Now Mr Jankielsohn had somebody given 
you a response that said, we no longer have funds for this project 
therefore we are cancelling the contract and that last little proviso 
20 
applies.  The one that reads: 
“Provided that Estina shall there upon be entitled to 
payment in full for the services rend – delivered up 
to the date of termination or suspension.” 
Would you have be able to interrogate this matter further?  Had 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 64 of 185 
 
somebody said to you this is the reason 15.3 compels us to pay for 
services that were rendered? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson I would have been able through 
the – if I was requested to do so through the processes in the 
legislature to submit supplementary questions to the relevant MEC 
based on this information. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Because this is what I understand of the 
statements and documents that have been made available to the 
commission that the project ran out of money as one of the reasons.  
They therefore had to terminate and when they terminated there were 
10 
outstanding services that had been rendered therefore those services 
were paid for post 13 August 2014? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson it is strange to me that the 
documents indicate that there had to be a cancellation of this 
agreement shortly before Estina was meant to implement their part of 
the agreement which was phase 2 to ensure that the processing plant 
was functional and also to invest an additional amount of R228 million 
into the project.  Because the Provincial Department did continue to 
fund this project to the tune of R20 million a year after the Estina 
withdrew and the Free State Development Corporation took over this 
20 
project.  So there was funding available from the Provincial 
Government to continue with – with this project.  We would have 
thought and that is one of the issues that is of concern to us that after 
spending all this money and the time frames that had passed that this 
dairy farm would be functional.  That it would sustainable and it would 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 65 of 185 
 
be self-supporting.  The fact that the Provincial Department had to 
continue to put R20 million into this project annually which it is still – 
which it is still doing as we speak indicates that this project is not yet 
functional.  It is not a sound running business concern and that it still 
requires a huge amount of government funding.  Now when the Free 
State Development Corporation took over this project they immediately 
appointed a company E’tsho Civils to take over the running of this 
project because the Free State Development Corporation is not 
mandated to milk cows with all due respect to them Chairperson.  
E’tsho Civils is a company that traditionally in the Free State builds 
10 
roads, school etcetera.  Now suddenly they were given this project.  We 
did request information regarding what the R20 million was being used 
for because we would have expected that it would be running at a 
profit.  We were informed and also on a visit to the farm itself we were 
informed that the project is not self-sustainable.  That they nor 
producing enough milk to maintain the farm and that is why the 
government had to put in additional funding.  But it is also interesting 
that of that R20 million R1 a month was paid to E’tsho Civils for 
professional fees and that is after all the other costs were dealt with.  
Now my concern is that R1 million to pay someone to milk between a 
20 
100 and 160 cows is excessive.  And even after Estina had withdrawn 
the department continued to funds into this money under a new 
partnership with the Free State Development Corporation who then 
appointed E’tsho to be their implementing agent.  Now I am just – 
Chairperson R1 million a month profit to milk between 100 and 160 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 66 of 185 
 
cows I am willing to do it by hand you know not even with machines if 
they – if they need to do that.  Anyone who has milked cows before 
knows that it is an excessive amount.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But also that – that paragraph I do not know if it is 
normal that you have read paragraph 15.3 Exhaustion of Funds.  I 
would have thought that if you embark on a project such as this and 
you had done your homework you would not embark upon it until you 
knew how much the project would cost and whether you will have funds 
to see it through to the end.  So it is rather strange to me that there is 
this clause which says in case we run out of funds.  How do you start a 
10 
project like this without certainty that you have got funds that will take 
you through?  Because otherwise if you go halfway and you cannot 
proceed because there are no longer – there are no longer any funds 
the funds that you may have spent up to halfway may be completely 
wasted and that could be a lot of money. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chair – Chairman if I could be of 
assistance? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  It is not just within the remit of this 
particular witness. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  To deal with  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  The question you have just asked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 67 of 185 
 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  There was a specific reason. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  That these funds dried up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  And that reason related to Estina. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Being the party that was implementing 
agent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Funds were then released. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not from the government? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  But a different witness will come and deal 
with that aspect Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  But if I could ask Mr Jankielsohn to – to 
just break the answer you have just given to the Chairman and just help 
20 
the Chairman understand one.  Did you know what the basic core 
competency of the FDC was?  Because you are saying that they could 
not do the job – they gave it to somebody else.  What was it set up to 
do as you understand matters? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Gcabashe I am going to interrupt you.  
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 68 of 185 
 
Just going back to the point where we were talking about now.  Another 
witness might deal with it but of course one can pick up things in terms 
of what makes sense and what does not seem to make sense and one 
accepts that sometimes what seems not to make to sense now might 
make sense when somebody who has knowledge explains things later.  
The way clause 15.3 is written at least I get the impression that it 
seems to – it seems to contemplate a situation where funds run – where 
the department runs out of funds but that might be a strict reading of it.  
That is the impression I am getting.  But it might be a strict reading of 
it.  But you can – we can deal with it at a later stage.  Okay. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Mr Jankielsohn back to my question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what this witness can do he might be able to say, 
look I am not sure and I am – I do not want to comment because I may 
be wrong but having – having been intimately involved in getting 
information about this project and so on if he is able to say anything he 
can say.  If he thinks there is something he can say that can enlighten 
things.  So – but you would know whether you have anything that can 
enlighten me on this or not. 
20 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson are we dealing with you initial 
question regarding the feasibility of the project? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Are we dealing with the Free State 
Development Corporation? 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 69 of 185 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The exhaustion of funds clause 15.3 that you read 
earlier.  That is what we are talking about.  But probably if you do not 
have a comment ready it must mean you do not have a comment on it. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson I did indicate previously that I 
do see how there was an exhaustion of funds at least on the side of the 
Provincial Government if they continued to fund the project.  I cannot 
speak on behalf of Estina. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Whether they in fact had funds to put into 
this project or not but they did receive substantial funding from the 
10 
Provincial Government as implementing agents in this project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That might tie in with what Ms Gcabashe says is 
the position namely that the running out of funds happened on the part 
of Estina at a later stage.  Or they – it might not have been running out 
of funds but there may have been problems on the part of Estina.  But 
there will be a witness you told me who will deal with this aspect. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Yes Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman the simple answer is National 
Government stopped funding.  Stopped that funding. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Because of the illegalities involved in the 
contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  But a different witness is going to deal with 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 70 of 185 
 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  So it is those supply chain management 
issues and policies that had not been adhered to that triggered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  15.l3 if you want to call it that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no, no that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  But can we deal with it in – with a totally 
10 
different witness Chairman? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  But Mr Jankielsohn can I take you to page 
312 which is RJ23 which deals with that FDC payment of R20 million in 
the year 2017 to 2018 and R51.2 million in prior years.  That is the 
point you were speaking to earlier and I am simply showing you the 
Auditor General’s Report that supports what you have been saying.  So 
my question was what was the core competency of the FDC ought they 
to have been appointed at all as implementing agents? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson the Free State Development 
20 
Corporation is set up to stimulate economic growth in the Free State.  
To support small, medium, macro enterprises in the Free State with 
funding and to run various structures.  Various things like office 
buildings and various other factories and various other things to rent 
them out, receive the rent and then use the profits for that as part of 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 71 of 185 
 
their funding for small, medium, macro enterprises.  I do not think dairy 
farming is part of that mandate at all.   
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  There are many areas Mr 
Jankielsohn that I have not specifically touched on because when we 
move to your interaction with the Public Protector some of those 
aspects will come up.  Can we then discuss the nub of your complaint 
to the Public Protector?  To assist you can I point you to RJ10 which is 
on page 184?  Please speak to the Chairman about this complaint 
number 1.  Can I also ask you to speak to the Chairman about the 
earlier complaint that you had laid with the Public Protector in 
10 
September of 2013?  And then I will also ask you to deal with the last 
complaint you laid in March of 2015?  I beg your pardon in May of 
2015.  So that is three distinct complaints you laid at the door of the 
Public Protector please address the Chairman on that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say we must go to page 314? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  184 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  184. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  And it is Annexure RJ10. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson if I may be of assistance here.  
20 
In the Public Protector’s Report on page 329 she deals with the 
complaint of 20 September 2013 on 330 the complaint of 28 March 2014 
and then on page 332 the complaint of 10 May 2016.  So it might be 
easier since the pages follow in each other for the Chairperson if I go 
through each one of them it will be quicker than having to refer to 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 72 of 185 
 
various…. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Various supplements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is fine. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson 329 of the Public Protector’s 
Reports – page 329.  It deals with the complaint and it is on page 16 of 
the report itself but in RJ329. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  So that is paginated page 329 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got it thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Yes Mr Jankielsohn. 
10 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson and I am going to read from the 
Public Protector’s Report. 
“The complaint submitted – the complainant submitted a 
complaint on 12 September 2013 with the following 
allegations of mal-administration in respect of the project.   
1. That the Portfolio Committee on Agriculture and 
Rural Development in the Free State Legislature 
around September 2013 heard from the Head of 
Department Mr Thabethe that an agreement between 
the province and the private sector parties Estina 
20 
Paras in the Vrede Dairy Project is subject to a 
confidentiality clause.” 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Please pause.  No and explain what upset 
you about this response? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson what is concern around this 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 73 of 185 
 
response if the confidentiality clause.  I am of the opinion that a project 
of this nature should not be confidential and that public funds spent on 
a project of this nature similarly should not be confidential.   
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Continue the next one. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Point 2. 
“2. That in terms of the agreement the Indian Company 
Estina and their South African partner Paras will rec – or 
the South African should be the South African company 
Estina and the Indian Company Paras will receive a 49% 
share with a R228 million investment in the R750 million 
10 
project while the 100 local beneficiaries will jointly receive 
51% shares through a government investment of R342 
million.  This implies that Estina Paras will obtain a 49% 
share with an investment of 40% to the projected cost of 
the project.  Government will thus be investing R144 
million more in the project than their private sector 
partners 
without 
the 
beneficiaries 
receiving 
the 
proportionate numbers of shares. 
3. That the project plans to milk 500 cows and produce 
40 000 litres of milk per day that will be processed 
20 
by a factory built by Estina Paras.  The department 
invested R30 million in the project last year on 
designs 
and 
environmental 
impact 
assessment 
planting of fodder etcetera.  This year an amount of 
R84 million is to be invested in infrastructure, 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 74 of 185 
 
machinery and cattle. The department indicated that 
400 pregnant cattle are already purchased for the 
project and  
4. That the Public Protector investigate the issues in an 
attempt to ensure transparency in the project as 
well as equitable share in the project for the local 
beneficiaries based on the government investment.” 
That was my request to the Public Protector on 12 September 2013. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  So let us summarise it.  First you took 
objection to the head of department saying you cannot have access to 
10 
information relating to the farm, one.  Second the inequities in the 
shareholding distribution of shareholding.  You took objection to that.  
Third you were concerned at the wastage and inflated costs that 
appeared to be associated with the cattle that were going to be 
purchased.  So that was the nub of your first complaint? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  I am just summarising it for you.  Let us 
move onto the next. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  On 2014. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  March 2014. 
20 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:   
“On 28 March 2014 the Public Protector received a further 
complaint from the complainant on the project.  The 
complainant made the same allegations as the allegations 
received on 12 September 2013.  The second complaint 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 75 of 185 
 
was: 
1. That it came to light that Estina would only 
contribute if necessary and that they are also 
benefitting from the supply of goods and services 
from 
the 
contributions 
from 
the 
Provincial 
Government. 
2. That R342 million is also subject to hugely inflated 
costs.  Some of these include among others 
construction of the silage bunker for R5 million.” 
I mention all those amounts which were mentioned in the previous reply 
10 
Chairperson.  They – with – is it necessary for me to read them again in 
detail or not? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Let us go to 2.3 in that – in that case. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  2.3 Chairperson. 
“That the Free State Government paid R2.8 million more 
for the 351 dairy cows that was necessary.  There also 
appears to be no official record of such transactions within 
the breed society that keep stud books for such cattle.  
Even though the value of the cattle bought is questionable 
the DA made enquiries about the best possible market 
20 
prices for stud cattle with the Free State Friesland Breed 
Society.  The market prices for prime cattle are indicated 
in the table which I attach – which are attached in the next 
page and the total of our investigation is that such cattle 
would cost about R3.4 / R3.374 million.   
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 76 of 185 
 
4.That recently the National Department of Agriculture 
supplied the Provincial Government with R40,4 million 
worth of equipment that included tractors and most of 
the 
other 
related 
equipment 
for 
planting 
and 
maintaining crops, purchasing additional tractors and 
equipment for the project was not necessarily and 
jointly cost a project an additional R5.8 million. 
I am summarising the amounts. 
5. That the top range rotary milking machines with 
electric sensors cost about R55 000,00 per unit.  
10 
The machines for the 82 points should not have cost 
more than about R4.5 million.  They are included as 
part of the R30 million price tag that includes the 
milk processing plant. 
6. That it appears that the payments for goods and 
services are in some if not all instances highly 
inflated.  It is also not known who the suppliers of 
the various goods and services are and whether the 
suppliers implementing agents or officials are 
responsible for the inflated prices. 
20 
7. That the agreement with Estina includes a clause 
that the service provider will be responsible to 
ensure that they comply with the environmental 
requirements has already been breached since 
complaints have been received of indiscriminate 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 77 of 185 
 
ploughing of natural fields and wetlands.  This 
cannot be done without the necessary environment 
procedures being followed and 
8. That various reports indicate that up to 50 or 100 
cattle have died since being purchased.  There is 
obviously a serious problem with these cattle and 
this is costing tax payers a great deal of money.  It 
is not known what the causes of the deaths are or 
what the cost of this is.  Furthermore that some 
carcases have been dumped next to a stream that 
10 
runs into the catchment area for water for the town 
of Vrede Zenzelene.  These have been covered with 
gravel and still pose a risk when it rains.” 
And that concludes my complaint of 28 March 2014.  Shall I continue 
with the next? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  You can. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Complaint Chairperson. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  You can but maybe we should pause for a 
minute and go to – because you know you had lengthy interactions with 
the office of the Public Protector as I understand matters.  And you 
20 
have actually annexed to your bundle of annexures your interaction 
with the Bloemfontein office which is found at page 275.  It is RJ17.  It 
is headed – it is an interim report that you got from them – a progress 
report.  You have annexed the document twice actually.  It is RJ17 and 
RJ25 but let us go to RJ17.  And the nub of my question really is they 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 78 of 185 
 
accepted your complaints. They spoke to the Department and on page 
278 you have got the response of the Department.  Further on you have 
got a note on page 279.  I am really just going through the highlights 
Mr 
Jankielsohn 
where 
the 
accounting 
– 
Accountant 
General 
investigated and prepared a report that was published in February of 
2014.  You have got responses from the Legislature that are set out in 
this document from the Public Protector.  Much as it was a progress 
report.  Were you satisfied with the responses that you were getting 
from the office of the Public Protector? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson that report which has just been 
10 
referred to was an interim report.  Basically what the report was doing 
was informing us what information they had received and from whom up 
until that stage it was not giving any conclusions or recommendations.  
But what is – what was of importance for us relating to this at 4.2 of 
this interim report they indicate that on 24 March 2014 the acting 
Accountant General informed that the Provincial Report was submitted 
to the Premier of the Free State for comment.  He was requested for a 
copy of the executive summary.  He referred us to the Director General 
of National Treasury.  And this is important to us because it implies to 
us that government was aware of the Accounting General Report which 
20 
indicated a great deal of maleficence with this project and that the 
Provincial Government specifically the Premier would of known of some 
of these irregularities that were taking place as far back as 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I take it that that Accounting General is meant to be 
Account and General? 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 79 of 185 
 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  I am quoting from them – from the document 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I know a position called Account and General not one 
called Accounting General so I take it that then it must be a reference 
to the Account and General? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes Chairperson I presume that is what the 
interim report is referring to.  But we refer to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Basically in the documents as the National 
Treasury Report. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja the National Treasury has got a position occupied 
by the Account and General.  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Yes.  Mr Jankielsohn you may want to deal 
with the very last complaint and then we are done with the complaints 
you – you referred to the Public Protector. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson back to the Public Protector’s 
Report on page 332. 
“On 10 May 2016 after the issues in the investigation 
were 
identified 
by 
the 
Public 
Protector 
and 
investigation 
was 
at 
an 
advanced 
stage 
the 
20 
complainant further submitted the following: 
1. That the appointment of Estina as partner in the 
project did not follow the necessary procurement 
processes. 
2. Estina misrepresented itself as being in partnership 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 80 of 185 
 
with the large dairy company in India namely Paras 
by marketing itself in presentations as Estina Paras.  
This could not have been overlooked by those who 
approved the project since logic dictates that Paras 
would be part of such a presentation or at least be 
requested to commit in writing as being part of the 
project. 
3. The contract was approved by the legal department 
of the office of the Premier as confirmed by the CFO 
of the department in interviews.  This is the 
10 
Department of Agriculture.  The contract clearly 
benefits Estina at the cost of the state tax payers 
and beneficiaries.   
4. The fact that Estina was both a partner and an 
implementing agent is highly irregular.  Estina 
subsequently received up to R183 million for the 
construction of infrastructure and purchasing of 
cattle for the project.  It appears that costs of some 
of the items were inflated and that the processing 
plant that was paid for is dysfunctional. 
20 
5. The fact that Estina would receive a 49% share in 
the project with only a 40% contribution is irregular 
and robs the tax payers and beneficiaries of a nine 
percent share. 
6.  Estina was allowed to abscond from the project 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 81 of 185 
 
without any accountability.  The FDC have taken 
over their management role in this project. 
7. The Mohuma Mobung part of the project including 
bank accounts in the name is unclear and appears 
to be irregular. 
8. The fact that 80 beneficiaries have been side-lined 
while they in fact should own 51 percent of the 
project implies that they were used as pawns to 
justify the project after the DA requested the names 
from them.  A meeting with some of them indicates 
10 
that they were merely names on a piece of paper 
with no further information or involvement.  They 
have a right to claim 51 percent share. 
9. National Treasury investigation has revealed various 
irregularities with recommendations of disciplinary 
procedures against both the head of department and 
Chief Financial Officer which has been ignored by 
the Provincial Government and the Premier.  The 
recommendation should be implemented. 
10. The 
questions in 
the 
Portfolio Committee 
on 
20 
Economic Affairs which includes agriculture in the 
Free State Legislature relating to the Vrede Dairy 
Project have been ignored.  In fact the Chairperson 
of the Committee will not allow any questions to the 
Department of Agriculture on the issue by members 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 82 of 185 
 
of the legislature.  The former MEC for the 
Agriculture and for Rural Development Department 
Mamiki Qabathe 
refused 
to 
answer 
questions 
relating to the project in the committee. 
11. That while FDC have taken over the management of 
the project the Department of Agriculture and Rural 
Development continue to make monthly payments 
for running costs such as food into the project.” 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Yes indeed.  Thank you.  I then will ask you 
to turn to page 3-7-4 of the Public Protector’s – of the paginated 
10 
papers which is still the Public Protector’s report where she puts – sets 
out her findings.  So this is her response to the complaints - in the 
plural – that you have referred to her.  Were you relatively satisfied 
with these findings?  With the manner in which she had attended to 
your matters? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson we were not happy with the 
manner in which the Public Protector dealt with the request for 
investigation because even though she mentioned in her report that the 
costs might have been inflated and that there were irregularities with 
the procurement and financial issues relating to the project.  She does 
20 
not deal with it specifically and another issue that she failed to deal 
with in detail was the issue of the beneficiaries which we requested her 
to look into and in fact my third complaint she ignored and then I think 
the most important aspect of that is that in her remedial action she also 
indicated that the Premier must implement remedial action and we were 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 83 of 185 
 
of the opinion that the investigation should have in fact been extended 
to look into the politicians involved with the project as the architects of 
the project and the individuals who implemented this project because 
throughout we were informed that the Premier’s Office was aware of the 
irregularities. 
Similarly his MECs would – should have been aware of the 
irregularities based on the National Treasury Report which she 
received.  They also recommended that disciplinary action be taken 
against the head of department, the Department of Agriculture and the 
CFO.  The Premier who is responsible for the appointment of the head 
10 
of department should have implemented the recommendations of the 
National Treasury Report which he failed to do and in fact while they 
were aware of the fact that the National Department had ceased 
funding of this project because of what they learned from the National 
Treasury Report and the various allegations of irregularities there. 
The – it was the politicians who continued to appropriate 
funds to this project in spite of those facts and that is what we would 
have thought the Public Protector would also have looked into and 
made recommendations on.  In fact what she basically said is that the – 
the officials are responsible for this.  The Premier must take action 
20 
against those officials and ignored much of the other – or many of the 
other issues relating to this project and also in the process avoided 
making any comments on political accountability in this project. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Given that you were dissatisfied what did 
you then do - not maybe you as an individual but you as a collective? 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 84 of 185 
 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  The – the party which I represent – the 
Democratic Alliance – then took the report under judicial review and 
subsequent to that as I indicated in my initial affidavit where I have 
received a judgment and that has been submitted to the – to the 
Commission which I also indicated we will do in my affidavit. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Am I correct in understanding that at page 3-7-4 
where the Public Protector says under paragraph 6.1.1 that: 
“The allegation that the department improperly 
entered into a public/private partnership agreement 
10 
for the implementation of the Vrede Dairy Project is 
not substantiated.” 
Am I correct in understanding that what she mean – she – 
she means there is that the agreement that the department entered into 
with Estina was in order – there was nothing wrong with it?  Is that your 
understanding of what she is saying there or is your understanding 
different? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  That would be my understanding as well 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  I am so sorry Chairperson.  I was 
distracted.  I did not hear the answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  I do apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  He says his understanding is the – is exactly 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 85 of 185 
 
what I am saying namely that the Public Protector is saying at page – 
at paragraph 6.1.1 at page 3-7-4 that there was nothing wrong with the 
agreement that the department concluded with Estina. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is saying it is his understanding that that was 
what that finding means.  Did I understand you correctly? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes.  I concur with the Chairperson. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  That is fine Chairperson.  That is not how I 
had understood his … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is not how you understood. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  His evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  But that is – if that is his understanding … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  He is entitled to it because this is an 
aspect that we will deal with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You deal with later on. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  When other witnesses come … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  And interrogate the nature of the contract. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Unless of course Mr Jankielsohn you want 
to say to the Chairman you understood the nature of the contract and 
you understood the findings of the accountant general’s investigators 
and that is why you come to the conclusion you are coming to.  If that 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 86 of 185 
 
is what you are saying you are entitled to your view. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson in terms of what the Public 
Protectors says here … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  I – I agree with you that is what she is 
saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  I do not necessarily agree with what she is 
saying here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes, ja. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  It is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I understood you to be saying exactly that because I 
was looking at what she was – what she found in this regard.  Okay and 
what your understanding of what she found is.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  That is – that is … 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:   
CHAIRPERSON:  There is still some confusion? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  No there is not Chairman because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  I – I – I am debating whether to – to 
20 
explore this further in the context … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is better or not, ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  In the context within which the Public 
Protector made this finding … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 87 of 185 
 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Because we have not explored that with 
this witness … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  But if this witness holds the view that he 
has expressed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  It really is not a difficulty because it is an 
issue we are going to be exploring … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  In the next week in any event. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Obviously his understanding might not be the 
correct one depending on certain things but that is the understanding 
he has. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the face of it that is how it seems to me but I have 
not looked at other documents and it maybe that when one looks at 
other pages and other documents one changes ones view. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  My junior says I should take one last shot 
at this Chairman and ask Mr Jankielsohn to read … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  6.1.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  It might assist him and if it does not 
Mr Jankielsohn it really does not matter too much. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  6.1.2 Chairperson reads: 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 88 of 185 
 
“The department did not enter into a public/private 
partnership with Estina in the context of Treasury 
Regulation requirements.” 
Chairperson if I may just talk to the judicial review … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  And in – in the judgment Judge Tolmay 
indicates that in terms of this report the Public Protector failed in her 
duties.  That the report is unlawful, unconstitutional and invalid and I 
concur with Judge Tolmay and not necessarily with the Public Protector 
in terms of this report. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Mr Jankielsohn … 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will look at the whole context in due course. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Indeed Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Mr Jankielsohn I do not know if you are 
aware that the Public Protector has in fact taken Judge Tolmay’s 
judgment on review.  She did so now (intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  On appeal? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  On appeal I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  On appeal.  I do not know if you are aware 
of that. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 89 of 185 
 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  I – I am aware that she has taken that 
judgment on appeal. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  On appeal, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Ja.  Okay.  Can we then wrap up with your 
views on whatever you might want – further want to say about the 
beneficiaries because I am aware that you – you had certain 
interactions with them.  Maybe you want to speak a little bit about the 
interactions you personally had with the beneficiaries or the people 
who are listed as beneficiaries in this project. 
10 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson the beneficiaries are the most 
important people in this project.  They are the ones who are supposed 
to benefit from this project, to receive some sort of livelihood from this 
project and meaning employment from this project.  So from the outset 
these beneficiaries should have been at the core of the implementation 
of this project and should benefit from the outcomes of this project. 
Our concern is based on that that the beneficiaries have been 
side-lined from the beginning from this project.  That they have never 
been involved in the project.  That they have received no benefit from 
this project and I think Chairperson that the biggest crime that is 
20 
committed here besides any possibilities of financial malfeasants and 
mismanagement is when politicians give people hope and then dash 
those hopes and that is exactly what has happened in this project 
Chairperson and I think the Public Protector’s Report contributed to 
that. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 90 of 185 
 
That they did not deal with that issue as – as the Office of 
the Public Protector should have.  So my concern throughout the 
project is of these beneficiaries.  There - there was also last year a 
beneficiary who was very local – vocal.  A local beneficiary who was 
very vocal about the project.  Mr Ngwenya who was also murdered and 
the rumour on the ground is that he was murdered because he was very 
vocal about this project. 
So there is a certain amount of fear as well among 
beneficiaries and there are a few of them who are very brave who have 
actually spoken out about this project but we - that is one of our main 
10 
concerns.  No agricultural project should exist if not for the purpose of 
the beneficiating individuals on the ground. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Thank you.  I would suggest to you that is 
not only certain beneficiaries who are afraid of – of speaking about this 
matter but the officials as well who are reluctant to give information on 
what they know of the Vrede Dairy Farm Project.  Would you agree with 
that? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  I would – I agree with that Chairperson.  
Within the Free State we do have a culture of fear among officials.  
Officials are appointed in their positions in terms of a specific 
20 
Government Policy – the KDA Policy – and there is a culture of fear 
that if you speak 
out 
about any 
malfeasance 
there 
will 
be 
consequences. 
You could lose your job.  You could be side-lined and 
intimated but in the specific case in February 2013 it is alleged that – 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 91 of 185 
 
well we know for a fact that Moses Tshake was abducted, kidnapped.  
He was tortured and he was murdered and he was working within the 
department and it is alleged - and this is where the allegation comes in 
– it is alleged that that he was looking into and questioning some of the 
payments that they department was making towards Estina and no one 
in Provincial Government has come out and disputed those allegations 
at all and that adds to the culture of fear within the Provincial 
Government that ultimately you could die if you speak out. 
We also have another incident the former Head of the 
Department of Police, Roads and Transport who – whom the former 
10 
Premier Ace Magashule at this individual’s funeral indicated that he 
was poisoned.  We have questioned at length the Government about 
this and whether they in fact investigating murder and we still have not 
received a satisfactory response because if a Premier stands up and 
says someone – a senior person a head of department has been 
poisoned and then fails to lay criminal charges, fails to give additional 
information. 
It adds to that fear within the Provincial Government and in 
this specific case it is officials who had to appear in court on charges 
based on this project and not the politicians and we know that it is the 
20 
politicians who give the instructions and it is the officials in 
Government who have to implement those instructions and it is very 
difficult I put you for an official Chairperson to say to the MEC or even 
their Premier I will not implement this because I regard it as illegal.  
That person will not be in that job for very long. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 92 of 185 
 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  If … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether the Law Enforcement Agencies 
have investigated these crimes that you have referred to and whether 
that is – it is known where those investigations are or is that something 
you do not know? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson law enforcement agencies - 
because I did submit questions through to Parliament through our 
representatives in Parliament because the National Department of 
Police do not report to the Province.  They report to Parliament.  So I 
used our channels through Parliament to ask questions about the 
10 
Moses Tshake murder. 
The reply was yes there was an investigation but they there 
were not leads or no information as to who the perpetrators were of the 
crime.  So this case no one has ever been detected, arrested or 
charged for that specific incident.  In relation to the second example 
that I mentioned of the former head of department.  I also submitted 
questions to the police. 
The MEC for Police in the Province relating to that issue 
because it is – it is – it is in the Province as well.  They did inform me 
that they are investigating it.  I also asked whether the body had been 
20 
exhumed to determine whether in fact in an autopsy the individual had 
been poisoned.  They failed to give me a reply on that and I have 
submitted an additional question relating to that to the MEC to try and 
find out whether in fact this investigation is progressing because it is 
not as if there is no evidence. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 93 of 185 
 
You just have to do an autopsy to determine whether this in 
fact took place especially if a senior person like the Premier of the 
Province makes such an allegation.  What I did do in addition to that is 
I laid criminal charges against the former Premier of the Free State at 
the Parys South African Police Service where - where he made these 
allegations. 
In terms of the Inquest Act because the Inquest Act indicates 
that if you have knowledge of a death of an individual which was not 
due to natural causes you are obliged to report it to the South African 
Police Services.  Something which the former Premier failed to do and 
10 
in terms of that Act I was able to lay criminal charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what happened to the complaint you laid with the 
police about the former Premier not complying with that requirement of 
the Inquest Act that you have just mentioned? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson I have received no … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was your complaint investigated? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  I have received no formal feedback from the 
South African Police Services that they are in fact investigating this.  
The only reply I received was through my question to the MEC of 
Police, Roads and Transport that they are looking into it.  That I did 
20 
lodge a complaint.  They gave me the case number and they said they 
are looking into it but I have received no formal feedback from the 
South African Police Services themselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long ago was that when you laid the complaint? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson it is about two years ago 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 94 of 185 
 
already. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I can understand to some extent if the 
investigation into the death or murder of somebody takes quite some 
time but as I understand the last complaint that you were talking about 
now was a complaint that you laid with the police against the former 
Premier.  That the former Premier failed to report to the police that he 
knew that the particular person was poisoned. 
That should not take two years to investigate.  Am I correct 
that that was your – the complaint you laid – the last complaint you 
mentioned? 
10 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  That – that is correct Chairperson but that is 
the nature of the beast that we are dealing with in the Free State 
unfortunately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And from what you have said I got the impression that 
you were present wherever it was where the former Premier said that 
this person had been poisoned.  So in other words … 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is something that you personally heard. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson I was not present.  What we did 
is we got the media reports which quoted the Premier … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Relating to this and submitted them as 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman just for reference purposes 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 95 of 185 
 
Mr Jankielsohn there is a media bundle – a very small bundle that has 
been given to you.  It may just be in the box to your left.  It is titled 
EXHIBIT HH Media Bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe we can identify it after lunch? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Maybe we should do that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I see it is time.  We are going to take the 
lunch adjournment and then in the meantime that can be identified and 
then we will resume at five past two.  We adjourn. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Ms Gcabashe are you ... 
ADV LEA GCABSHE SC:  Thank you for the indulgence Chairman.  
Chairman just ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  Yes we are, thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  And the instructions I am being given is to 
20 
explain to you Chairman that your files have now been separated, you 
have an HH1, which is in one file, that will be Mr Jankielsohn’s affidavit 
and annexures, there is an HH2, which relates to Mr Venter in a 
separate file, so there are two distinct files now as you requested. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let’s correct, let’s put that on record because 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 96 of 185 
 
initially you said these are in one lever arch file so whoever reads the 
transcript will know that that has changed, the lever arch file that I said 
earlier on is marked Exhibit HH1 and Exhibit HH2 which I said contains 
in part the statement of Mr Jankielsohn, Mr Roy Jankielsohn, and 
annexures to that statement as well as the statement of Mr Albertus 
Johannes Venter and Annexures now only has the statement of Mr Roy 
Jankielsohn and Annexures – the statement and Annexures relating to 
Mr Albertus Johannes Venter are now in a separate file marked Exhibit 
HH2. 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  Thank you Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  The next one Chairman is the Public 
Protector’s report, there is now a reports file so it is marked HH 
Reports, it is a distinct file on its own. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I do not have that one, or is it somewhere there? 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  Chairman I am being advised that it is 
there.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, there’s a separate file marked Exhibit HH and 
reports there’s a file which has got among others a report by the Public 
Protector. 
20 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it only Public Protector reports? 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  At this point in time Chairman, we are likely 
to add to it as more witnesses come forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay, I see there’s another one, there’s also 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 97 of 185 
 
another lever arch file marked Exhibit HH and that is media bundle.  
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  Correct Chair and then last Chairman the 
presentation that we would like to make, just as we close not right now, 
we have printed those pictures, might I suggest Chairman that we 
simply put that into the reference bundle right at the back of the 
reference bundle or would you prefer it to be in a completely different 
bundle? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we could put it at the end of some bundle, but 
I know you showed it to me but it is not on my desk and that may be 
because I did not give it to anybody to put it on my desk, thank you.  
10 
Do you suggest that we put this at the back of ...[intervenes]  
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  The reference bundle Chairman, they are 
rather large, we’ve got A, B and C of the reference bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay ja.  So that can be put there once we have 
used it. 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  Yes sir, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  Chairman to go back to where we were 
earlier on, Mr Jankielsohn you were really dealing just before we broke 
for lunch  with the culture of here in the Free State and reservations 
20 
people have, the reporting you had undertaken in respect of what the 
former Premier had indicated at a meeting etcetera.  What I did want to 
bring to your attention and really it is more for the record than anything 
else, in the media bundle I had asked you to find, I trust you have it 
now.  If you go to page 29 of the media bundle there you will find an 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 98 of 185 
 
article relating to Moses Chake, I was simply wanting you to have a 
very quick look at it and confirm that this is the incident you referred to 
in relation to what happened to Moses Chake and the fact that it seems 
to be one of those investigations that is incomplete. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  That is correct Chairperson, it is the same 
person to whom I referred previously. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  Mr Jankielsohn I then want to go back to 
your statement and look at specific paragraphs that I have glossed 
over, just in an effort to satisfy you that all the evidence you wanted to 
10 
bring to the attention of the Chairman is in fact on record.  If we could 
start at paragraph – your paragraph 18.3 which is on page 4, which 
also speaks to Annexure RJ7.  You will find Annexure RJ7 on page 169 
– page 168 I beg your pardon, 168.  If we just start with what you say 
at 18.3 Mr Jankielsohn, are you ready? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes I am ready. 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  If you could then just speak to the issue 
you raise at 18.3 of your affidavit? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson what I was referring here is to 
the Public Protector’s Report and specifically where she indicated on 
20 
24 June 2014 the Acting Accountant General informed that the 
provisional report was submitted to the Premier of the Free State for 
comment and what I was indicating in my affidavit is that the Premier 
must have been aware of the various irregularities and malfeasance 
that the Accountant General indicated were taking place in the Free 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 99 of 185 
 
State but in spite of that they continued to appropriate funds to the 
project, and in fact as far as I am concerned ignored the findings and 
recommendations of the Treasury Report.    
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  Mr Jankielsohn so you have just been 
looking at paragraph, your paragraph 18.31, am I correct? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  That’s correct. 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  Can I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I see 18.3 but not 18.3.1. 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  He misheard me Chairman so I am going to 
take him back to where I wanted him to be.  We will come back to 
10 
18.3.1 at a later stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  Mr Jankielsohn can we go to page 4 of your 
– of the paginated papers, so the top right hand number 004. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  If you will bear with me Chairperson I just 
have to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let’s make sure you’ve got the – that you have 
got the file that she is talking about is the file that has got your 
statement. 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  And then it is page 4 of your sworn 
20 
affidavit.  I then asked you to look at paragraph 18.3, where you make 
some observations and at the end of the observation you refer the 
Chairman to Annexure RJ7 and it really goes to whether Parras was or 
was not involved in this deal Mr Jankielsohn.  Do you want to speak to 
the issue just to put your views on record. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 100 of 185 
 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  For the record Chairperson what I was 
referring to in this specific reference is that the presentations made by 
Estina to Provincial Government and then by the Department to the 
Executive Council indicated that Estina had the support of a large dairy 
company called Parras in India and that in this specific article that I 
refer to in RJ717 that the article indicates or the investigator who wrote 
the article indicated that they contacted Parras who said that they were 
not involved in the project at all, and they might have or might not have 
been, I don’t have the specific information on that, but in all my 
interactions in the replies that I received from the MEC’s, which are 
10 
part of my bundle, in the reports that the committee received there was 
only mention of Estina and Parras wasn’t mentioned in those reports 
and I would have thought that this is a very important aspect of the 
project that they have the expertise form Parras, because we know that 
Estina is an IT company it is not a dairy company and they would 
require the support of Parras in order to run to initiate and run a dairy 
farm, but in all my interactions both in my visits to the farm and the 
information that we received from the Provincial Government there was 
no further reference to Parras.  So I am not aware if Parras was in fact 
or was not involved in the project, except based on the information from 
20 
this media article and my personal interaction. 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:   If I look at page 169 of the paginated 
papers, which is the article that you have annexed, that’s RJ7, bullet 
point 2 notes that the Department did no due diligence on Estina or its 
claimed partnership with Parras, a major dairy company in India.  
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 101 of 185 
 
Parras subsequently denied any involvement, that’s the point you’re 
making, amongst others.  
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes. 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  Thank you.  I just wanted us to cover any 
little bits that you had not had time to testify to.  Can we then just deal 
with paragraph 18.7 and just your broad references to the CFO, is there 
anything in particular that you would like to bring to the attention of the 
Chairman in relation to the manner in which the CFO discharged her 
duties? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson the National Treasury Report did 
10 
indicate that some of the mismanagement and the misdemeanours took 
place as a result of the actions of the Head of Department and the CFO 
and both of them should be subjected to disciplinary action but in a 
transcription of the Accountant General Report the CFO also 
substantiated many of the issues which I’ve raised here regarding 
Mamamabung and various other issues, so it is there for the record. 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  Also in paragraph 18.7 you mentioned that 
Mr Bertus Venter is the official, the legal advisor who drafted the 
agreement between Estina and the Department, are you there?  So it’s 
your paragraph 18.7 that I am looking at Mr Jankielsohn. 
20 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  I do have it Chairperson. 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  I don’t know if you would like to just speak 
to that point as well. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes Chairperson besides the fact that the 
Accountant General Report, the National Treasury Report was 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 102 of 185 
 
submitted to the office of the Premier and he must have been aware of 
what was taking place there and then continued to appropriate funds to 
it, we also confirmed with Mr Bertus Venter in committee in the 
legislature that the contract was drafted in the office of the Premier, 
and that is the contract between Estina and the Department of 
Agriculture. 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  But the reason he was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you – I’m sorry – do you know by any chance 
whether the Department of Agriculture had its own legal advisors who 
could have drafted the agreement, rather than it being drafted in the 
10 
Office of Premier when it was an agreement relating to the Department 
of Agriculture? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson I am not aware that individual 
departments had someone who were capable who might have been 
capable of drafting such an agreement.  I know that some departments 
do have legal advisors to assist the MEC’s, but I am of the view, my 
assumption is that larger contracts of this nature would be drafted in 
the office of the Premier whose job it is to do oversight and monitor all 
the activities of other departments and this is a very important contract, 
it was in fact a flagship of the province which was noteworthy enough 
20 
to be mentioned in the State of the Province address of the Premier so 
I presume there should have been substantial interest from the 
Premier’s office in this project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the mere fact if the position is that for example 
provincial departments did not have legal advisors of their own and 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 103 of 185 
 
they all made use of legal advisors in the office of the Premier were 
never and made (indistinct) it would cast a certain picture to the 
situation but if the position is that each department has got its own 
legal advisors but an agreement that related to a particular department 
which had its own legal advisors was actually drafted in the office of 
the Premier it may, and I put it no higher than, it may cast a certain 
picture but it may be that agreements that are not complex are dealt 
with by legal advisors in different departments but when it comes to 
complex agreements maybe they are taken to the legal advisors in the 
office of the Premier because those legal advisors may be are much 
10 
experienced legal advisors.  I just wanted to check whether you know 
anything about whether government departments have their own legal 
advisors, but you are not sure whether every department has got its 
own legal advisor. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson being a flagship project I would 
think that it would be drafted in the office of the Premier but I think that 
the next witness, Mr Bertus Venter, who is that person in the Premier’s 
Office would be better able to reply to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  Save that Mr Jankielsohn in paragraph 18.6 
20 
he explained the centralisation of certain functions, if you could just 
link what you say in 18.6 to the answer you have just given to the  
Chairman. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson what I am saying is that as I 
mentioned previously that the Departments may have their legal 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 104 of 185 
 
advisors but that the important aspects regarding to legal matters are 
centralised in the office of the Premier and that is how I understand the 
Provincial Government to function. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  And they have been so centralised since 
about 2010, more or less.   
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  I cannot give an exact date for that 
Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  The next point Mr Jankielsohn arises on 
10 
page 8 at paragraph 18.23, now at paragraph 18.23 you really complain 
in the very last sentence, you summarise your complaint, and that is 
the complicity of MEC’s and possibly the Premier according to one or 
two other paragraphs where you say they really have failed to take 
responsibility for what happened at Vrede, at the Vrede Dairy Farm.  
Maybe it’s just convenient to give you all of the paragraphs that deal 
with this complicity issue that you address, so it would be 18.23, 18.27, 
18.34, 18.38, 18.30, I beg your pardon 18.50 and 18.51.  The central 
point you make there is senior people in government appear to be 
refuse to want to take responsibility when things go wrong.  I don’t 
20 
think there’s anything you want to add to the comments you’ve made 
during your evidence. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson I think my comments are quite 
clear that people, senior people in government knew what was 
happening at Vrede, they cannot deny that they knew what was taking 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 105 of 185 
 
place there, in spite of that they continued to appropriate provincial 
government funding to that project and still do so today. 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  Then if I ask you to look at paragraph 
18.41, which we ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, I’m sorry, when you say they continued to 
allocate funding to the project up to now in circumstances where the 
agreement with Estina was cancelled some years back, do you know 
why there would be a funding being allocated, nevertheless despite the 
cancellation or is the position that the Department is obligated in some 
way to spend some money because there are cattle there and so on, or 
10 
what is the position? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson after the withdrawal of Estina as 
I mentioned previously the project was handed over to the FDC who 
then appointed a company, Edshu to do the physical work on the 
ground and there are cattle there that need to be milked, so I presume 
that they continued to allocate funding firstly to ensure that the project 
was not in vain, that those existing cattle are still being milked, but 
secondly if they were to shut down the project it would be a huge 
acknowledgement that the project has failed and I don’t think the 
government wants to acknowledge by closing down the project that it 
20 
would – that it has failed and there is no way I think at this stage that 
the project can continue probably without the traditional funding 
because the cattle that are there are already aged, because they didn’t 
do the necessary management of the dairy cows and they are not 
producing enough milk to ensure that they even pay for their own feed, 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 106 of 185 
 
those cattle, and that’s the information we received on our visits to the 
farm itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV LEA GCABASHE SC:  I then had taken you to the incident where 
MEC Zwane as he then was refused to respond to questions you raised 
in the house and the Speaker didn’t come to your assistance.  I don’t 
know if you want to take that any further? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson just in terms of the MEC and the 
Premier’s responses when we raised the issues of Vrede Project, the 
former MEC, Mamiki Qabathe, in one of the committees refused to 
10 
answer questions relating to the Vrede Dairy Project, she was protected 
by the Chairperson of the committee at that time.  In another instance 
when the former MEC Mamiki Qabathe of Agriculture became Speaker 
the then MEC Zwane, because as I mentioned they play musical chairs, 
you know, one day it’s this person, the next day the next person, when 
MEC Zwane was MEC he also during a sitting of the legislature refused 
to reply to questions, he said he’s already answered them.  We hadn’t 
received the replies to those questions, and I then wrote to the then 
Speaker, Qabathe, to ask her if she would use  her position as the 
Presiding Officer to force him to reply to those questions and I never, 
20 
ever received a reply from her office relating to that. 
 
In other instances when I raised the issue of the Vrede Dairy 
Project in debates the MEC’s and the Premier opted rather to use 
personal insults against myself and my colleagues in opposition rather 
than deal with the substantive issues that we raised during our debates 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 107 of 185 
 
and that continues to take place up until now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well what you are raising Mr Jankielsohn is a very 
important issue for this Commission.  I have said in the past in the 
hearings and in media briefings of this Commission that if at the end of 
the work of this Commission I find that there was State Capture in this 
country one of the things I will have to look at is what made State 
Capture possible.  What facilitated State Capture?  What environment 
made it possible.  What structures and what bodies provided for in our 
Constitutional dispensation, in our legal systems, failed to do their job, 
which if they had done maybe State Capture would not have happened 
10 
at all, or could have been arrested before it went too far, and one of 
the areas I am interested in is how the National Parliament and 
Provincial 
Legislatures 
performed 
their 
oversight 
constitutional 
obligations during the relevant times and what I say about State 
Capture applies to corruption, even if it is corruption hat is not – that 
doesn’t fall under State Capture. 
 
How are portfolio committees in the National Assembly and in 
the National Parliament and in Provincial Legislatures performing their 
oversight obligations when they become aware of wrongdoing, of 
corruption, within the Executive, within Government.  What do they do?  
20 
Do they do their job the way they are supposed to do it, do some 
members of Parliament in certain portfolio committees not perform their 
constitutional obligations properly because they are party, the party 
from which they come is the same party that is in the Executive?   
 
If it is so what is it that needs to be changed in our 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 108 of 185 
 
Constitutional arrangements to make sure that in the future we won’t 
have State Capture again, we won’t have corruption reaching the levels 
that it has reached in this country.  So I am very interested in getting 
information as to how in the National Parliament and in Provincial 
legislatures members of Parliament and members of the Legislature of 
all parties including members of Parliament and members of the 
Legislature who belong to the party that dominates the Executive, 
Provincial Executive, how do they perform their function, their functions 
of oversight. 
 
Mr Bloem, Dennis Bloem gave evidence before me and said 
10 
earlier this year and said when he was still a member of the ANC in the 
National Assembly at some stage in the past and he was a member of 
the Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services.  When he raised 
certain issues with regard to the Minister responsible for Correctional 
Services issues of corruption he said his Chief Whip if I understood him 
correctly called him and said something to the effect like take it easy 
you are not an opposition party member.   This is our own Minister.  Is 
that the right thing?  Is that kind of attitude the right attitude for  
1. A party to tell a member of Parliament or is the position that a 
member of Parliament irrespective of what party they come from 
20 
if they exercise they perform their constitutional obligations of 
oversight they are supposed to perform that without fear from 
their own parties and their parties should not instruct them not to 
do their job the way they should do their job. 
I am interested in all of those things and I am interested in the 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 109 of 185 
 
experiences of people who have been inside Portfolio Committees 
whether in the National Parliament or in Provincial Legislatures to say 
this is what happens.  Because it may well be that if those people, if 
members of Parliament and members of Provincial Legislatures 
performed their constitutional obligations of oversight vigorously 
without fear that maybe if they perform those duties vigorously they will 
be victimised by their own parties and so on.  It may well be that the 
levels of corruption in the country would not be where they are and that 
it may well be that if state capture did take place in South African 
maybe it would not have taken place or it would have been stopped at 
10 
an early stage.  So I am interested in evidence relating to that and I 
would be grateful if you are able to go back and look at the debates in 
the Provincial Legislature or in relevant committees where some such 
issues were raised and the manner in which certain members of 
Parliament dealt with them is not the way they should have dealt with 
them and as a result oversight was defeated.  Okay.  You understand. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  I understand Chairperson would you like me 
to comment now or would you prefer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you can comment now if you are able to but if it 
is something that you – that needs more thought and more homework 
20 
you can go back and prepare something that would be much more 
meaningful and make arrangements to make it available to Ms 
Gcabashe and then arrangements would be made whether you would 
need to come back and give evidence about it or how it could be used. 
But it is very, very important.  Okay. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 110 of 185 
 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes.  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  May I make a comment on that please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson I think this is a classic example 
of how the Legislature and its committees have failed the people of the 
Free State by not allowing this issue to be interrogated at its inception 
and when the – the alleged irregularities took place and how committee 
chairpersons blocked opposition members attempts to probe these 
issues.  And now when opposition members in Parliament raised the 
10 
issue we were – we were ridiculed and insulted by the governing party 
in attempts to deviate from those issues to something irrelevant.  But I 
think Chairperson what is very important here is that members of the 
Legislature and Parliament take an oath of office that they will protect 
the constitution.  And the constitutional mandate of the Legislature is 
hold the executive accountable individually and collectively and if we 
fail to do that then we are in fact in breach of our oath of office.  And I 
think one of the problems of that is the political bosses are the 
Premiers and the MEC’s they have control over the members of the 
Legislature and Chairpersons of committees because we work on a 
20 
proportional system where a list is submitted and those people in 
charge decide who is where on those lists.  So the same culture of the 
fear – of fear that – that exists in the Provincial Government also would 
exist in the Legislatures and even Parliament.  And I was a member of 
Parliament from 2000 to 2006 so I am aware of how that functions as 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 111 of 185 
 
well.  Chairperson I think the remedy to this would be to look at the 
electoral system.  We have a proportional system at Provincial and 
National level.  At local level we have a hybrid system of first past 
opposed and proportional that balances itself out.   So I think the 
problem at National and Provincial levels specifically lies with the 
electoral system and people are accountable to the political party and 
not necessarily through the proportional system to the people that 
elected them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no thank you, thank you very much.  I – I do want 
to say that and this is partly or the benefit of the legal team and 
10 
investigators.  I am interested in – in members of Provincial 
Legislature, members of the Executive in the Provinces who may have 
adopted positions when members of the opposition sought to carry out 
their oversight obligations who may have taken positions that defeated 
or had the potential of defeating the very purpose of the existence of 
oversight obligations and those committees to be called here to explain 
their conduct in regard to specifics.  And this Vrede Dairy Farm topic 
might just be an appropriate one because if somebody is asked 
questions.  If an MEC is asked questions to account how tax payers 
money is being used in regard to this project and refuses to answer 
20 
then it is very important that we should know whether that person had 
any acceptable grounds for refusing to answer and if they did not have 
acceptable grounds we may have to look at what is it that made them to 
adopt stances that sought to defeat oversight.  That – so you might 
wish to have a look at that because then we will be talking specifics.  
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 112 of 185 
 
They might be able to come and put up an explanation that no on such 
and such a date I had answered this question here is proof or 
something like that.  But it is important to have a look at these issues 
because when one looks at the levels of corruption in our country it is 
important to see those who are given an obligation to take steps to 
make sure there is no corruption or if it is brought – corruption is 
brought to their attention that they take steps to stop it.  What have 
they been doing?  Thank you.   
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Mr Jankielsohn let us 
then move onto the last – well the pen ultimate aspect actually and that 
10 
is the evidence you set out at paragraph 18.50 on page 13 of your – of 
the paginated bundle and that flows into 18.51 all the way down to 
18.54 really.  The issues you raise here relate to the report of the 
Account and General of February 2014.  And much as that report we 
know is a report that continues to be a work in progress Chairman.  You 
have made certain observations here you may or may not wish to bring 
specific ones to the attention of the Chairman.   
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Thank you Chairperson this is almost a 
summary towards the end of some of the arguments which I have 
already made.  And I indicate in 18.49 on page 13 that if one considers 
20 
the content of the National Treasury Report as well as the context of all 
the information that I have set out in previous paragraphs in my 
affidavit then the Premier Mr Ace Magashule, the former MEC Zwane, 
former MEC Qabathe, acting MEC Lamlele and Former MEC of Finance 
Elsabe Rockman were were pertinently aware of the issues and 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 113 of 185 
 
problems relating to Estina and in spite of that allowed substantial 
payments to be made towards this project while being pertinently aware 
of these issues.  I also indicate that the failure to implement the 
disciplinary recommendations of the National Treasury Report against 
the former Head of Department makes them complicit in the greater 
Estina scheme.  And that they ought to also have implemented these 
recommendations.  They were supplied with evidence of serious 
maleficence in this project and they deliberately ignored it Chairperson.  
They were also aware of the skewed allocation of shares towards 
Estina which I mentioned and that Estina never contributed any of its 
10 
own funds with the Department.  In spite of that they also continued to 
pay funds over to Estina.  The contract was drafted in the office of the 
Premier and indicates that the Premier should have been aware of this.  
I also mentioned that this is just – is not just a normal agricultural 
project it was a flagship project in the Free State and there was a great 
deal of media interest in the – not only the project itself but also the 
allegations of misconduct and the irregularities that took place there.  
The other aspect relates to the what I think was a misrepresentation by 
Estina to the extent perhaps of which Paras were involved in the 
project they must have been aware of this because as I indicated in the 
20 
documents and the replies I received Paras was never mentioned.  It 
was always only Estina.  They must have been aware given the fact 
that the presentation that was made to the Executive Committee was on 
behalf of Estina Paras not just Estina.  If I was MEC or I would – I 
would have asked that question, where is Paras these are the guys with 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 114 of 185 
 
the skills an IT company is not meant to implement a dairy project so 
why are they not mentioned in any of those documents?  The continued 
Chairperson to appropriate funds to this project in spite of all of this.  A 
very important issue. They were aware that there were no beneficiaries 
in this project.  We were informed that for MEC Zwane when questions 
were raised by the Department, the National Department and by 
ourselves in the Legislature regarding to a list of beneficiaries that it is 
alleged that and the beneficiaries will be able to confirm this they are 
coming to give evidence tomorrow that he drove – that they drove 
around with a loudhailer informed people to meet at the community hall, 
10 
took down names of people who might be interested in farming and then 
submitted that as the beneficiary list.  They were aware from the 
beginning that even because there was not perhaps a feasibility project 
– a feasibility study that was carried out that there were no 
beneficiaries of the project.  And as I indicated previously a project of 
this nature cannot exist without beneficiaries.  And they were complicit 
in side lining these beneficiaries because they were aware of them and 
because even today with all the amounts of funny – money that 
continued to be – to be appropriated to this project these beneficiaries 
are still not benefitting from this project.  They – they are the real 
20 
shareholders of the project and even though we speak of a 51% 
allocation of shares it is my opinion that these beneficiaries should 
eventually be 100% shareholders.  Why would a Provincial Government 
want to hold shares in a diary project when people on the ground in 
Vrede are suffering from unemployment, poverty and inequality?  
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 115 of 185 
 
Chairperson the last issue relates to the cancellation of the project 
without penalties to Estina.  The documents indicate that a resolution 
was taken by the Executive Committee that this contract would be 
cancelled.  We also know that funds were paid to the – to Estina after 
the contract was cancelled and they allowed this to take place.  As a 
collective Chairperson because it is an Executive Committee that took 
this decision.  From the Premier right down to all the MEC’s were 
involved in that committee.  
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Thank you Mr Jankielsohn.  The only point I 
want to up with you from the evidence you have just given is that 
10 
relating to Paras and I just want to point you to your Annexure RJ6 
which is at page 148 of the paginated bundle.  And it is a presentation 
on Mohuma Mobung but it has the Paras and the Estina names on it.  
You are not satisfied that this is sufficient evidence that there was 
some relationship between Estina and Paras? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson what we have here is a piece of 
paper with Paras’ name on it.  There might even have been an 
agreement between Estina and Paras which I was not aware of but if 
Paras were meant to be the people that supply the necessary skills and 
expertise to the project and even training to the non-existent 
20 
beneficiaries then surely we would have seen them on the ground?  
Then surely they would have been mentioned in the many documents 
that we received from the Provincial Government and I did not see them 
there Chairperson.   So perhaps they look – perhaps it is a paper – it 
was like the beneficiary list where the beneficiaries were not involved 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 116 of 185 
 
perhaps Paras were the same.  If they were the company that was 
meant to give the expertise but they were just non-existent and not 
involved. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Yes thank you.  The last… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sorry.  What was said to be the relationship 
between Estina and Paras in terms of your understanding from the 
beginning?  What were you told was the actual relationship between the 
two? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson Estina was originally an IT 
company so they would not have the necessary expertise to implement 
10 
and initiate a dairy project.  So they would need some assistance from 
outside and as far as I understood Paras was the company that would 
partner with them with the necessary expertise.  So Estina would be the 
people who basically got the contracts and signed the contract but 
Paras would be the brains behind this project with the necessary 
expertise.  And that was – that is my understanding of what the 
relationship should have been between Estina and Paras and perhaps 
the failure of the project is perhaps proof that – of Paras’ non-
involvement in this project. Because it appears that even with the 
inflated prices and things that – there was not the necessary expertise 
20 
to run a dairy farm of this magnitude. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if the – if the true position is that Paras was not 
involved and was never involved then what we have would have been a 
dairy farm project that was run by IT people? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson that is correct.  I cannot say 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 117 of 185 
 
that they were never involved at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paras? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  What I am saying is I have never seen them 
involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  And the project failed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman it is important probably to bring 
10 
to your attention and Mr Jankielsohn’s and we have discussed this but 
it is a document it is does not – he has never seen really that there is a 
memorandum of understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Between Paras and Estina. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  But somebody else will deal with this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will talk to it ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  The point Mr Jankielsohn makes is in all the 
enquiries he made nobody bothered to show him this particular 
20 
document or explain the relationship between Estina and Paras. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you.   
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Mr Jankielsohn then the last aspect that 
you may want to touch on is again the relationship between Estina and 
Wagerfield.  If you go to page 371 of the paginated papers the Public 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 118 of 185 
 
Protector mentions these parties at her paragraph 5.3.17 and 18.  You 
may want to make some comment on who Wagerfield is or was and what 
you understood of that relationship? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Thank you. Chairperson before I deal with 
this specific instance I just want to take you back to the article of the 
land of milk and honey which the Gupta’s were alleged to be – to have 
been involved and benefitting from this project.  And if one looks at the 
evidence presented by the Public Protector in her report and I would 
like to go back two pages to page 369 paragraph 5.3.12 of the Public 
Protector’s Report.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson the Public Protector indicates at 
5.3.12 invoices obtained from the Department on the additional 
purchase of animals were the following and it is interesting to note that 
the animals that were bought were bought from various people but 
bought by a company called Vargafield not Estina.  And then if we go 
onto the page 371 that was indicated paragraph 5.3.18.  The Public 
Protector indicates a search done on the CIPC website indicated that 
both companies are still registered separately with the sole director of 
Estina being Wasram Kamal and the sole director of Vargafield being 
20 
Sanjay Grover.  Now I also confirmed this in a company search and it 
appears that Mr Sanjay Grover is a resident of Dubai.  He does not live 
in South Africa.  His company is registered at the same address where 
that guest house which I mentioned right in the – initially which was 
bought with the – the gate and the guardhouse.  It was some of those 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 119 of 185 
 
funds were bought that they used the same address Vargafield and 
Estina in their company documents.  Now just a basic online search of 
Mr Sanjay Grover indicates that he appears to be the financial advisor 
of the Gupta family and he also through another company registered in 
Dubai has a 10% share in Mabengula together with other shareholders 
such as Duduzane Zuma and a person called Rajesh Gupta.  Also a 
company which it is alleged the former Premier Ace Magashule’s son 
was also employed by.  So this raises further question relating to the 
role of the Gupta’s in this project and perhaps confirms that initial Mail 
and Guardian article that they were probably involved in this project.  I 
10 
also confirmed on the ground with individuals who were present that 
when this property which I mentioned the guest house which was the 
offices of the Estina company was purchased that there were members 
of that family present during the purchase of that property which further 
confirms some of the allegations made in that land of milk and money 
not honey article. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Jankielsohn.  I 
think that last portion you have dealt with brings us squarely to the 
supplementary affidavit – statement that you have made and I really 
just want to very quickly take you through the amendments that you 
20 
would like the Chairman to note.  The very first one really is a fairly 
minor one.  You have corrected paragraph 3 of your original affidavit, 
13 of your original affidavit by correctly identifying RJ1 as the SOPA 
document and RJ2 as the Mail and Guardian article.  You would agree 
with that? 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 120 of 185 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  And then at paragraph 18.24 of your 
original affidavit you make a minor correction again and that is the date 
on which the Estina agreement was cancelled. The correct date is 
August 2014 and not April 2016 as you had indicated? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Then again 18.26 again relates to that 
change of date.  18.26 instead of April 2016 you would like that date to 
be substituted by August 2014? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  When you get to paragraph 18.28 you there 
the whole paragraph be deleted in its entirety and substituted with a 
new paragraph.  Could you please read your new paragraph into the 
record it is your paragraph, your evidence? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  In reply dated 28 April 2015 to a question to 
the MEC for the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development 
regarding whether disciplinary action was instituted against the senior 
officials as recommended in the National Treasury Report the Acting 
MEC for the DARD Ms Ollie Dlamlele indicated that no disciplinary 
action was instituted which indicates further that the report was 
20 
deliberately ignored.  I attach hereto annexure RJ16 a copy of said 
reply. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  You – do you wish to make an further 
comment on that point? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  No Chairperson. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 121 of 185 
 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Thank you.  Then we look at 18.56 again 
would you please read the part in bold which you want substituted for 
what you had in your original version.  Can you please read this into 
the record? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  I further wish to place on record that in a 
reply to the Public Protector as indicated in her report attached as 
annexure RJ25 former Premier Ace Magashule indicated the following 
where I also advised that a guest house which was procured in the town 
of 
Vrede 
to 
accommodate 
individuals 
responsible 
for 
the 
implementation of the project is included in the amount of R2.6 million.  
10 
It was necessary to buy this property given the fact that there we no 
facilities in existence on the land in question at the commencement of 
the project.  The Premier further committed to an assessment of value 
for money to be performed by the Free State Provincial Treasury. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Then your last insertion 
which is your – the new paragraph 18.57 there you really just deal with 
the fact that you are annexing documents to this supplementary 
affidavit which you mark as RJ26 and those documents speak to the 
issue you raised earlier that is the property that was purchased in 2012 
for 1.2 million and that changed hands – you have given that testimony 
20 
already. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  The only issue I will ask arising from this is 
I just found it rather curious reading the Public Protector’s Report that 
all her questions appeared – well the ones I was looking at appeared to 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 122 of 185 
 
be directed to the Premier much as they really related to the 
Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.  Is that the way you 
would normally do things in the Free State?  The MEC was not the one 
whose responses are recorded here but the Premier’s? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson one would think that both the 
MEC and the Premier and the department would have been questioned 
and requested for information by the Public Protector. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman if you will indulge us just for five 
minutes of going through that presentation that did not quite work when 
we started off this morning.  The team has been ready, willing and able 
10 
to take you through that.  Mr Jankielsohn we are going to go back to 
that presentation that gave us a bit of trouble in the morning. 
If you could take the Chairman through the various buildings 
on the farm so that he gets a sense as to what is there and at – we 
have given you a copy Chairman of the presentation.  The very last 
page of that hard copy has got the figures that MEC Qabathe mentions 
in RJ9 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  As monies that were spent on those 
particular items. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  So we thought it might help inform you as – 
as you look at the pictures even at your leisure later on as to what the 
official response was in 2013 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 123 of 185 
 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  To where the money had gone to in respect 
of the buildings that we are going to show you now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think the hard copy is really quite helpful to 
me.  Yes, thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Thank you.  Thank you gentlemen.  
Mr Jankielsohn are you ready? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  I think if you start at building – at number 
four because I think the Chairman is happy with one, two and three. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman, can we start at four?  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may start at four. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Thank you Chairperson.  From my memory of 
my visits to the farm four is a silage bunker for which R5 million was 
allocated.  Building number five which would be to the left of four – 
there we are – is the cattle feed plant where the silage is mixed for 
feed to feed the dairy cattle.  The amount allocated in the presentations 
for this is R7.35 million. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  R7.35 million for that building where arrow 
20 
number five is? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that for the building – for the walls and that what 
looks like corrugated iron.  Is – is that what you are – is that – is that 
what your understanding is of what the 7.-something million was for? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN: 
 
Chairperson 
the 
figures 
that 
I 
have 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 124 of 185 
 
presented here on this document are based on the replies that we 
received from the MEC.  My visits to this farm – the understanding that 
I got from my visit is that those are the buildings that are referred to in 
that document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  I cannot verify whether the full amounts were 
spent on these buildings … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  But at least in the replies … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  That is what we were informed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Would be spent on these buildings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Number six – building six. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Building six is the office and milking parlour.  
R30 million was allocated for this but this is also combined with the 
processing plant which we saw in the previous slide close to the gate. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Yes.  There will be one – a couple of other 
pictures of that processing plant.  Number seven. 
20 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Number seven is the veterinary facility for 
which R300 000 was allocated.  Eight is a maternity facility – R500 000 
together with item nine which is a cattle shed was allocated for those 
two facilities.  So nine – eight and nine which is a cattle shed was 
R500 000. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 125 of 185 
 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Number 10 is just a … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean those are – well nine seems to be a structure 
without a wall.  I may be mistaken.  It is – but it looks like it is some 
poles and there is a – there is corrugated iron serving as a roof.  Is 
that how it was when you went there? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is poles that are put into the ground and then on 
top of the poles – (clearing throat) excuse me – then there is a roof 
that is made of corrugated iron. 
10 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes Chairperson.  Obviously with the fence 
around it as well because it has to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  House the cattle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and is that – that clearly seems to be the case 
with regard to number nine.  Number eight does appear to have some 
walls.  Is that correct or not? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes.  Number eight does have walls.  It is 
the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Maternity facility. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  So it does house calves … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  And they need walls around them. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 126 of 185 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But eight and nine you say on your understanding 
cost about – together cost about R500 000? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Huh-uh. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  I thought it had been – it was seven million.  
Have I got it wrong?  The feeding shed is that where we are? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Numbers eight and nine. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Numbers eight and nine together 500 000 
with item nine, yes.  Thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, huh-uh. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  And then 10/11? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Number 10 is just a cattle kraal.  No amount 
is specified.  I do not think much money would have been – so it is 
basically just a fenced in area where the cattle are held. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Number 11. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you never know.  You would be surprised.  Yes.  
So you do not know the amount spent on number 10.  Is that – is that 
what you say?  You do not know what amount … 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  There is no specified amount Chairperson … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No specified amount, yes. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  But I would not think if there is just a fence 
around we would be talking more than R1 000 or R2 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well with evidence that I have heard in other matters 
here, ja. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 127 of 185 
 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson then numbers 11 and 12 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Anyway number 11. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Are feeding sheds.  The cattle are brought in 
and fed because in a dairy ideally cattle would be given certain rations, 
certain types of feed dependent on their production.  So they are fed 
according to that and it is a – it is – it should be a very scientific 
process and 11 and 12 are the feeding sheds which are – which it is 
mentioned cost R7.35 million which is also rather … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Together? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Rather excessive. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Together? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Together yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What I see - and you must confirm because you have 
been to the farm – what I see both in regard to the shed at 11 and the 
shed at 12 is that it appears that it is some poles.  There - there is no – 
there are no walls as such.  It is poles maybe made of steel I am not 
sure and then there is a roof provided but I do not see any wall.  Is that 
correct? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  That is correct Chairperson.  Inside this 
facility there would be steel structures where the cattle are brought in 
20 
individually each with their own feeding trough.  They would fed there 
and then led out of this feeding facility. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you say the amount for the – for the two 
sheds and whatever is inside in terms of those feeding troughs you say 
the response from the department was that it cost – they cost - those 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 128 of 185 
 
two sheds cost R7.-something million? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  7.35 that is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairperson I – I believe that if you look at 
the picture that is up now especially the one on the extreme left is that 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  What the cattle feeding shed would be – 
would be like from the inside Mr Jankielsohn? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  That is correct yes. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  And that is what costs 7.3 million for two of 
those? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the hard copy what - where – where is that? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  It is – it is number 11 Chairman.  It is 
towards the back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Number 11. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  I think the penultimate … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that at page – page 11? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  On page – page 10 at the bottom Chairman.  
20 
It is item 11 at the top … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  But page 10 at the bottom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Oh yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  So that is the structure on the inside. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 129 of 185 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  The one at the bottom on the right 
Chairperson is the cattle shed that you were referring to which does not 
have walls around it which is numbered nine in the previous slide.  I 
see they do not have cattle in there.  They have horses in there when 
the photograph was taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, ja.  You are still at page 10 ja.  Okay, yes.  
Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Then if you could just describe to the 
Chairman what the picture is that is up on the screen now. 
10 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson on the far left is the photograph 
at the top of the processing plant and the other photographs are just 
random photographs of the facility on the inside. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  That is the milk processing plant on the 
inside? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  So those big tanks are the tanks that you 
would be using for churning milk and making cheese or yoghurt or 
whatever? 
20 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  That is correct. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Would facilities like this – I do not know if 
you have any expertise on this at all Mr Jankielsohn – have these 
single brick walls I see you have very, very thin walls here.  Is that 
formal for a – a building such as this? 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 130 of 185 
 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson I am not able to answer whether 
that would be normal for a building like this.  It does appear to be 
rather frugal. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  It cost in the middle – in the region of 30 
million this particular - with the contents this particular plant. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  With the dairy yes and one must also go and 
look at some of the equipment that was indicated in the MEC’s reply 
because I presume that – some of that money might also have been 
used in this facility. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Yes.  Those particular items:  the car and 
10 
those tractor tyres where would those be kept? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson this would be in the workshop 
and the storage shed. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  So it really is just a building with walls and 
the – and they – they keep this particular equipment in it? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Then you have the next picture.  Just 
describe to the Chairman what this is? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson this is the cattle feed plant.  
This is where the feed is mixed.  So they would mix bails of – of feed 
20 
together with silage and then perhaps grain – a different kind of feed 
grain to - in order to produce the feed which is fed to the dairy cows.  
As I indicated it is a scientific process to feed dairy cattle and to give 
them the correct feed. 
I am not an expert on that and I am sure there – one would 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 131 of 185 
 
be able to find someone who can – who can deal with that. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  We have a witness who will be dealing with 
that Chairman and then if we look at the maternity facility just to give 
the Chairman an idea as to what that facility looks like. 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Yes Chairperson.  That is the maternity 
facility.  That is where the calves are weaned – that are weaned are 
taken away from their mothers and would then be fed separately on 
some sort of formula to raise them up until they are able to go out into 
the field. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Now Chairman just for the record these 
10 
pictures were taken in March this year.  Just so you know when they 
were taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Mr Jankielsohn are there any other matters 
you would like to raise with the – with the Chairman before we – we 
close? 
MR ROY JANKIELSOHN:  Chairperson I think I have dealt substantially 
with most of the issues which I wanted to raise.  What I would like – 
would like to do in closing is to thank the Chairperson and the 
Commission for delving into the issue of the Vrede Dairy Project.  It is 
20 
very important for the people of the Free State but more important for 
those beneficiaries who have been given some hope for a better future, 
for a job and ownership of something and whose hopes have been 
dashed by the inactivity of this project. 
So we would like to thank the Chairperson and the 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 132 of 185 
 
Commission for the opportunity to come and speak to this – to this 
issue and for dealing with this issue in the Commission for us as Free 
State it is very important. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Chairman I have no further questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you very much.  Thank you very much 
Mr Jankielsohn.  It is quite clear that you have played a - a very 
important role in seeking to establish exactly what happened with 
regards to this project and who should be held responsible and you 
sent complaints to the Public Protector and it is seems that you have 
played a very important role and we thank you for – for that and – and 
10 
again going back to the issue that we discussed earlier on about 
members of the Provincial Legislature how are they exercising their 
oversight functions in the Provincial Legislatures. 
Are there things that are done by their parties which 
undermine their oversight obligations?  Are there things that are done 
by the Executive to undermine their oversight obligations?  Are there 
things that are done or said by certain members of Portfolio 
Committees and of the Provincial Legislature which defeats the very 
purpose of having these oversight obligations for members of Provincial 
Legislatures and the very purpose of having these oversight committees 
20 
and if so what may need to be done to make sure that if in future 
similar problems arise they would be dealt with differently for the 
benefit of the citizens. 
So it is important that if at all possible you and other 
members of the Provincial Legislature and the same thing applies to 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 133 of 185 
 
members of the National Parliament.  They must look at – at those 
issues and see whether there are not issues they can bring to the 
Commission to say over the – over X number of years we – maybe we 
just have this constitutional obligations on paper. 
When we try to exercise them we are defeated by people who 
do not want oversight functions to be carried out properly or do not 
want accountability to be shown.  So it is important to – to look at that 
and if there is any information or evidence that can be put forward that 
that be made available to the Commission so that it can look at what 
recommendations it can make to make sure that oversight obligations 
10 
and the oversight mechanisms are improved or are strengthened.  
Thank you very much.  You are excused. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Thank you Chairman.  Might we just have 
three minutes to remove – so I can remove my papers? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Ms Buthelezi is indicating that she might 
have to run through to about five – 5 o’ clock if that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – that is fine. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Is alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are at 25 past now.  Shall we take five minutes?  
20 
Is that enough to change? 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  That is sufficient Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay we will take a five minutes adjournment. 
ADV LEAH GCABSHE SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137

your indulgence, my name is Sibiso Ramagale, I act for the former 
Premier, Mr Ace Magushule and I just wanted to place myself on record 
and to also state that we have received a number of Rule 33 notices 
which we will be responding to in due course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no that’s fine, and you were present when I 
spoke to a group of legal representatives of various persons? 
MR SIBISO RAMAGALE:  That’s right, in your chambers, that’s right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you very much. 
20

Page 135 of 185 
 
State. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Much of what he will be delivering today 
will be contracts the he drafted or his office drafted as well as the 
opinions that he gave. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I don’t know whether whenever an evidence 
leader starts there is something wrong with either their voice or the 
mic. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  I will bring it closer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s much better. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Chair I was saying Mr Venter will be dealing 
much with the contracts that he drafted or that were drafted in his 
office and the opinions that he gave relative to the Vrede Dairy Project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  May I ask that the witness be sworn in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you.  Please administer the oath or 
affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
20 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  I am Albertus Johannes Venter. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection with taking the prescribed 
oath? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 136 of 185 
 
conscience? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you give will be the 
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?  If so, please raise 
your right hand and say so help me God. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  So help me God. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  (duly sworn, states) 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you Chair, to orientate you Mr 
Venter the bundle which contains your statement is marked HH2, Chair 
10 
there is a supplementary affidavit on that bundle which is marked 
HH2.2.  The first part of the bundle has – is marked HH2.1, it contains 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well even if it was simply attached not as 2.2 just as 
a secondary to that file, but it’s okay the way it is done, that’s alright. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes the HH2.1 it is the one that contains 
his original statement, and I would also ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what makes it confusing because when 
20 
somebody reads the transcript and sees HH2.1 they might look for a 
lever arch file that has got that on the spine. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes, Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I wonder whether we shouldn’t simply have this as 
Exhibit HH2, full stop, and it has got a number of things inside 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 137 of 185 
 
including the supplementary affidavit. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   I have no issues with that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, so we don’t refer to HH2.1 and HH2.2, we just 
refer to each item as it appears. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that fine? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   That is fine and let’s ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  And later on you can take out the dividers that say 
2.1 or 2.2 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   I will do so Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes, Ms Gcabashe would like to know if we 
could do the same with Mr Jankielsohn’s file as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes please, yes, yes, ja. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   We will do so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you.  Chair I would like to then 
orientate Mr Jankielsohn that the file containing your statements and 
annexures is marked HH2 and there are other files that I will refer you 
to, our reference file which has file A, B, C, I will only refer you to A 
20 
and B and there is a legislation file as well which is my HH legislation 
file, I will refer you to file A of that particular bundle of documents, yes, 
thank you.  Mr Venter on Exhibit HH2 there is a document, an affidavit 
that appears from page 1 to page 5 of that document.   
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  I see it Chairperson. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 138 of 185 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Do you confirm that is the affidavit you 
prepared for the Commission? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes indeed it is my affidavit 
Chair. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes, and the signature that appears on 
page 5 of this document is that your signature? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes it is. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you, then Mr Venter would you 
please give us your qualification and your employment history.  I am 
interested in your employment within the Free State Government. 
10 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Thank you.  Chair I have a 
BJuris LLB degree, I am an attorney admitted to the High  Court, I 
started my career in the legal profession as a Public Prosecutor and 
after seven years I switched to the side of the defence and I started 
with a firm of attorneys, completed my articles as it was known at that 
time and I practiced in that firm for about 11 years.  Just as background 
– my apologies Chair I am suffering from a bit of the flu, but just as 
background the firm had a human rights practice and I got involved in 
human rights cases, I did a lot of cases for the liberation movements 
prior to 1994, unions as well as for civic organisations and the reason 
20 
why I am saying this is that post 1994, in about September 1994 I was 
approached to form part of an interim management committee for the 
three police forces in the Province, apparently the thinking at National 
level was that one force should not manage the other until the 
composite structure for the police services as we know it now has been 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 139 of 185 
 
finalised so I was part of that management team, and I also became 
part of the National Change Management team dealing with change 
management of the police post-1994 and it dealt from simple issues 
such as uniforms to more complicated issues such as structures and 
components.  A part, or whilst involved in these committees I continued 
to practic4e and then in the beginning of 1996 the post of Head of 
Department for Safety and Security as it was known then was 
advertised, I applied and I was fortunate to be appointed following a 
selection process.  That is how I arrived in government. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes, and are you still within the 
10 
government at this stage? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes Chairperson I was 
transferred in – at the end of 2002 to the post of Chief State Law 
Advisor which became vacant at that point in time, the previous 
incumbent retired and subsequent to that I was given additional 
responsibilities and functions to the extent that my post was upgraded 
or – ja upgraded is the right word, to that of Chief Operating Officer, 
which I occupied up to about 2007, when that post was abolished and I 
was transferred to the post that I currently occupy. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes and for how long have you been in this 
20 
post? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  The current post from 2007 up 
till now. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Who do you report in your current post? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  I report to the Director General. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 140 of 185 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you.  As someone or as a senior 
official within the Free State Government and someone who is based at 
the office of the Premier could you give us an overview of the structure 
of the office of the Premier? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson the organisational 
structure of the office of the Premier, and I am referring to Office of the 
Premier because that is how the department is referred to in the 
schedule to the Public Service Act, has four main divisions and we refer 
to it as Programs, Program one is the program that houses the office of 
the 
Director 
General, 
the 
Chief 
Financial 
Officer, 
the 
person 
10 
responsible for Executive Secretariat services, security services, risk 
management and internal audit.  Program Two is my program for which 
I am responsible.  It deals with human resource management, and that 
includes labour relations and employee wellness and so on.  It includes 
skills development, there are three components which is a training 
institute, a bursary management as well as a broader provincial skills 
development where we engage with the SETA’s to try and get funding to 
train people in the Free State.  Legal Services is also reporting to me, 
IT, Information Technology and Communication Services, I hope I have 
not left out any.  Program three deals with policy and planning, it’s a 
20 
unit that looks broadly at the strategies of government whether it fits 
into our Provincial Growth and Development Strategy and how it fits 
into the National Development Plan and the Medium Plan Strategic 
Framework and that unit will do impact assessments and propose policy 
changes from time to time to make sure we are more effective and 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 141 of 185 
 
comply with what is expected from us if we look at the National 
Development Plan.   
 
We have some time ago created a fourth program monitoring 
evaluation and the functions of that unit is mostly to look at annual 
performance plans of departments, look at the State of the Province 
Address, budget speeches of MEC’s, engagements which politicians 
have with a community where certain commitments are made and then 
list all of those commitments and track progress with that.   
 
It supports also the various committees of the Legislature, 
dealing with departments, that unit provides a report to that – to the 
10 
Committee of the Legislature on which the report the Committee 
engages the particular departments.   
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you and does the Premier have 
advisors, if so what would be their role? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes Chairperson I perhaps 
forgot to mention the inner office of the Premier but it’s a fairly small 
staff component looking at support to the Premier, him or herself, Chief 
of Staff and a number of officials.  The Premier may appoint two 
advisors, I must perhaps just indicate that Section 12(A) of the Public 
Service Act provides the authority to appoint advisors.  These advisors 
20 
are not employees, they are excluded from being employees in the 
Public Service Act per definition and there is a directive issued by the 
Minister for Public Service and Administration which determines the 
conditions and the benefits of these advisors.  They are as such on the 
payroll of government to put it like this. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 142 of 185 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you.  These advisors do they play 
any role in implementing government projects for example would they 
have a role to play in implementing the Estina Dairy Farm project? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson no, they are simply 
there to provide advice.  The directive to which I have referred makes it 
also very clear that such advisors should assist from getting involved in 
the operations of the department.   
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you.  You gave us a supplementary 
affidavit this morning where you make reference to the appointment of 
an advisor that was appointed in 2012, Mr Narayan, was – just tell us 
10 
about his appointment, what you know regarding his appointment.  
What was he appointed to do? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I don’t have any 
personal knowledge, I was requested by the investigators of the 
Commission to provide them with a copy of the letter of appointment.  I 
had with the permission of my Director General engaged with the Chief 
of Staff who provided me with a copy of that appointment letter and that 
letter, copy is attached to my affidavit. That person was not part of the 
advisors appointed in terms of Section 12 (2), there was mentioning 
made in an earlier state of the province address of the previous premier 
20 
that he would appoint an economic advisory council. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes is that Premier, Magashule? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is correct. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  And that council consisted of a 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 143 of 185 
 
number of - if I remember correctly there was a number of imminent 
people from the private sector who served on that committee. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes do you now any – do you know 
anything about him travelling with the HOD for the Department of 
Agriculture in March 2012? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Try not to – let him give evidence, try…(intervention). 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Let me rephrase rather Chair, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess he has heard so, ja give evidence. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I was not 
personally involved in any of the travel arrangements, I became aware 
10 
of it late on when it emerged, I think when the Hawks executed the 
search and seizure warrant, it was one of the documents they were 
looking for and that is why I know that there is such a document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank You Chair, Chair more evidence will 
come from other witnesses regarding this aspect, I just wanted to 
clarify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but if he became aware of a certain document 
that reflects (indistinct) he can give evidence about what he saw in 
terms of that document. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That document you are talking about what did it 
reflect? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:    Chairperson I – if I remember 
correctly and I must say I think it was approval for a trip overseas to 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 144 of 185 
 
India for the Head of the Department who was supposed to be 
accompanied by Mr Narayan that document was a document which, I 
think was in the archives of the Department of Agriculture so it was not 
a document that I sourced and handed over to the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay do we have that document, will it come later or 
is it something we don’t have? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   It’s something we do have it, I’ll just have 
to find the correct reference, I’ll ask Mr Venter to confirm it later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Ms Molefe is helping me to locate that 
10 
document, thank you. Then let’s go back to your programme what I your 
role in your programme? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I manage the 
various components to which I’ve referred earlier but given the amount 
of legal work that we have or that we are responsible for, I also handle 
certain matters myself and that includes certain advice, opinions that  
we are requested for, oral opinions, some contracts, although I do a 
little and then also a number of litigation that I handle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So as Deputy Director General of Corporate 
Administration and Coordination there are certain units or sections that 
20 
fall within your authority that you are responsible for, is that right? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you said there are three of them, is that correct? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:    Chair it’s a bit more than three 
it’s Human Resource Management, Human Resource Development 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 145 of 185 
 
which 
is 
– 
both 
have 
sub-divisions, 
Information 
Technology, 
Communication…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay but one part of your responsibility or part of 
the responsibility of your section is giving legal advice, is that correct? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes Chairperson I have a team 
of six people at this point in time it includes myself, while 
legally…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry that is? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Six. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Legal advisors? 
10 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes including yourself? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Including myself, people who 
are legally qualified. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay yes and, I think earlier on when you were 
describing the office of the Premier I got the impression that initially, I 
thought you are within the office of the Premier but I think later on 
when you were explaining it appeared that, that might not necessarily 
be the so, you are for something much wider and then the office of the 
Premier is a smaller office, is that correct? 
20 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes, Chairperson, that is correct 
and it is unfortunately, or unfortunate that the confusion is created by 
the naming of that department in the Public Service Act because when 
one refers to office of the Premier, many people envisages the four 
walls within which the Premier sits, whilst we have a component of 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 146 of 185 
 
approximately 600 people at this point in time, there’s a large number 
of community development workers which forms part of a component 
known as the Intervention Unit which try and deal with issues on the 
ground and it’s part of the monitoring evaluation programme that I’ve 
referred to earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now I know that with provinces there would be a 
Director General of the province and then there would be heads of 
departments whose political heads are MEC’s.  You are Deputy Director 
General, are you Deputy Director General in terms of the province as 
such and the person you report to is the Director General of the 
10 
province as such? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson, no my – although 
the Director General has wider functions than a head of department if 
one looks at Section 7 of the Public Service Act.  My responsibilities 
relates only to the department which we call the office of the Premier 
and that component programme…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay now I understand so – but the office and 
person that I referred to as the Director General of the province, is that 
same person or the holder of that office also in effect the Director 
General of he so-called office of the Premier, is that correct? 
20 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes Chairperson that is, indeed 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay, no thank you.  So you would be reporting to 
that person and you are Deputy Director General Coordination -  
Corporate Administration and Cooperation in the office of the Premier, 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 147 of 185 
 
in that department? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay now I understand, thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you Mr Chair.  Mr Venter the 
document I wanted to refer you to is on page 669 of reference Bundle 
C, those two in front of you, Bundle C page 669. So there will be a 
small c on the spine reference Bundle 88 then a small c on the spine. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  C? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I have Bundle C 
10 
here but it starts at page 839. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think mine starts on that page number as well Mr 
Venter. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   I’m looking at the wrong number, I’m so 
sorry Chair, the correct number it’s 1323, the bundle is the same but 
the page number – I was referring to the wrong page numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What’s the page number? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   1323. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1323? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes it’s not really visible on my copy 
20 
because there’s something written on top of it, but I’m told it’s the 
correct number, it’s under tab 91. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes I do have it. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes is that the document that you saw 
relating to Mr Narayan’s trial? 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 148 of 185 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please wait for me Ms Buthelezi, yes I’m also there. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you, can you please identify that 
document and tell the Chair what it contains? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson, it could be the 
same document, I must confess that the previous time that I looked at a 
similar document was quite fleeting but it looks like the document that 
I’ve seen at the time when the Hawks executed the warrant. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes it goes up to page 1326, can you 
confirm that? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes indeed. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   And would you please then tell us 
…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I’m sorry Ms Buthelezi doesn’t the document go 
up to 1324 and then there’s an Annexure to it that starts at 1325? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes so it’s not the same document? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes the Annexure starts from page 1325. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   But it’s related to this document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Yes, thank you. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson the document is 
headed, request for approval for head of department for Agriculture, Mr 
P M Thabethe, and Ashok Narayan to attend a strategic meeting with 
the strategic partner in India from the 29 t h of February to the 4 t h of 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 149 of 185 
 
March 2012 in support of the expansion of dairy farming in the Free 
State. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Thank you, for the record Narayana is spelt 
Narayana (name spelt), thank you and then…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said earlier on Mr Venter that the document that 
you saw was an approval of a trip I think to India by Mr Magashule, I 
see that this document, at page 1324, although it has three signatures, 
the two signatures which are suppose to – well the one which is for the 
MEC is supposed – the MEC is supposed to have crossed out one of 
two, there’s recommended and not recommended and nothing is 
10 
crossed out as it seems to me and just above the name of the – of Mr 
Magashule is says recommendation 4.1, approved – not approved by 
and then nothing is crossed out but there seems to have been a stamp 
that was put there and it’s not legible I don’t know whether whatever 
was written on this stamp indicated that the Premier approved or not 
approved but I thought I would draw that to your attention to – do you 
have anything to say? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson if I may guess, it’s 
not very clear but it look rather like the type of stamp that would be put 
onto a document when payment needs to happen. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but my question was really aimed at establishing 
whether – since you said the document that you saw was one in which 
Mr Magashule was approving a certain trip and this doesn’t seem to 
approve anything.  My question was whether you think this is the same 
document that you saw? 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 150 of 185 
 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson it could be, I did 
not look at that first document with quite intentively due to the 
circumstances prevailing at that point in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Obviously by signing the intention was to do one of 
the two but without crossing out one, it’s not clear which one? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay, I don’t know if you are able to assist Ms 
Buthelezi but I just – it caught my attention that he did not cross 
out…(intervention). 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   Any election. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja he didn’t elect to say he was approving or not 
approving. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  I understand Chair and I noticed that.  But I 
would like to refer Mr Venter to the annexure to this document that 
appears from page 1325.  What does that document inform you – if I 
may? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson it looks like a quote 
from a travel agency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Like a what? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  A quotation from a travel 
20 
agency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay ja. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and the document on page 1326 what 
does it inform you? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson it is probably the 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 151 of 185 
 
second page of the quotation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that not – ja that is – that seems like a…. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  But for a different person now? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that not a second page of the document at page 
1325? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm?  Looks like the same page 2 of the same 
document. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes it is Chair.  Mr Venter the person that is 
quoted for flights on page 1325 could you please give us the name that 
10 
is there? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is Mr Thabethe Mabana 
Peter. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And what position did he hold at the time? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  He was the head of the 
Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and on page… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this was I see that quotation was dated 24 
February 2012.   
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the position he held at that time? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. And on page 1326 whose name 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 152 of 185 
 
appears there? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is Ms Ashok Narayan. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And what position did he hold at the time 
according to your knowledge? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean what name appears at the top?  There is 
another name appearing at the bottom?  You mean the one at the top? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes the one at the top yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay that is Mr Narayan yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I - I do not know. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  You are not… 
10 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  What position he occupied at 
that point in time. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  He did not hold any position within your 
government? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  No not that I am aware of. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Chair there will be witnesses 
that will testify to – with regards to this trip as well as the approval and 
the people who travelled.  May I –  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  I will leave it here at this stage thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But to the extent that it is meant to say that the 
Premier approved. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There might be need to – or there might be a need for 
evidence to show approval other than the letter because the letter does 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 153 of 185 
 
not seem to show approval or disapproval. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Noted.  Noted Chair thank you.  Let us then 
move to the first time that you Mr Venter you heard about the Vrede 
Dairy Project when was this? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson that was during the 
meeting of the executive council which I attended in I think it was on 
the 13 June if I remember correctly. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Which year? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  2012 my apologies. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  You may proceed. 
10 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  It was a presentation which was 
made by the then head of department Mr Thabethe in which the project 
was – was explained to the executive council and there was also a 
request made for an additional allocation to the budge of the 
Department of R84 million in order to execute this project. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the reference to the Department here now is the 
reference to the Department of Agriculture? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Indeed my apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and what was your view on the project 
20 
at the time? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson it sounded like an 
excellent project.  When I listened to it how it was presented. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you could just indicate the essence of what 
you were told – what the executive council was told this project was 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 154 of 185 
 
about, ja? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson it is a long time ago 
but I still remember it well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  The picture that I formed in my 
head when it was presented was that the farm – the [Kruinoslust] farm 
which was the farm on which this project was to be executed will be 
divided into portions on which emerging farmers would be – or which 
would be allocated to emerging farmers to – to milk cows on it and then 
to milk the cows and that milk which has been produced would have 
10 
been picked up.  There would have been a service picking up all the 
milk from the emerging farmers on the farm.  That milk will – would 
have eventually been processed by a processing plant but it was not 
enough to make the processing plant a viable economic option and 
therefore a milking parlour had to be constructed in terms of which or 
through which milk would be produced in high volumes.  But that 
milking parlour would then be used to train these emerging farmers to 
become dairy farmers using the latest equipment and technology 
instead of milking the cows wherever they were housed.  My 
understanding was that the processing plant would then be run by 
20 
Estina or not by – it will be constructed by Estina.  It was their 
responsibility to construct the milking – the processing plant and that a 
company would be established in which Estina and the beneficiaries 
would have shares and the beneficiaries would then from the sale of 
the products that are being produced at the processing plant received 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 155 of 185 
 
dividends as shareholders in that company.  What made it sound 
particularly good was and I think Mr Jankielsohn referred to as well that 
was beneficiation within the province.  Our milk has in large quantities 
been exported outside to the province where it was processed.  But 
what made it attractive was the fact that the town of Vrede or 
Phumelela and the farm was close to the N3.  So it was – would have 
been easy to transport these processed products to Gauteng as well as 
to KwaZulu Natal where there was apparently a big market for that.  So 
it sounded very well at that point in time.  And I may just add that the 
processing plant had – was supposed to produce milk, fresh milk, 
10 
yogurt, butter, cheese.  Whatever milk products there is this plant was 
supposed to produce it.  That was my understanding of what was 
presented. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  If I may refer you again to the 
reference bundle A at page 323.  Page 323 of bundle A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Chair I will be only using A and C on the 
reference bundles and if you could just leave those two next to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 300 and? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  23. 
CHAIRPERSON:  23.  Okay thank you.  You can proceed. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  What is – could you please 
identify that document and tell us what it informs us? 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 156 of 185 
 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  It is a resolution of the 
executive council following the presentation which was made by the 
Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and what is the dates on that 
document? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  13 June 2012. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  And what does it tell us? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  It basically records the 
resolution of the executive council.  There are various resolutions.  One 
is that the executive council approved the following recommendations. 
10 
1. The implementation of the proposed integrated Vrede Dairy Agri 
business project. 
2. Under that supports the sourcing of additional funding of 
R84million for this current financial year from the province.  Then  
b. The executive council further agreed that 
1. Where possible the department should meet the cost and will be 
later refunded and engage other relevant departments. 
ii. The matter to be further discussed in the Treasury Committee as 
a matter of urgency. 
iii. FDC should play a role especially from the business point of 
20 
view. 
v. For the next three years the Department of Agriculture will have 
to pay R113 000 it looks like but it is probably million. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes as someone who was at this meeting 
did you understand why there would be – why there was some sense of 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 157 of 185 
 
urgency that is referred to on – on the third last point from the points 
that you have just read? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chair If I remember correctly the 
matter of urgency was because of the fact that it was a project which 
was mentioned in the State of the Province address of the Premier and 
there was – there was an obligation to implement that project in that 
financial year.   
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  And if I look at points number 3 from 
the top from the points that you have just read to the record – sorry it 
is point – actually it is point number a ii that the [indistinct] was 
10 
supporting the sourcing of the additional R84 million.  How much was 
initially budgeted from this project if you know? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson if I remember 
correctly the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development 
indicated that they reprioritised funds from other projects and they 
were able to get R30 million together but they need another R84 million 
in order to get to an annual cost or an annual contribution of this 
project with R114 million. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay.  So the original amount budgeted was 
R30 million is that what you – is that your evidence? 
20 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I am not sure… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It has got to be more than that. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  One will have to look at the 
Appropriation Act that was approved by the Legislature. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 158 of 185 
 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  At that point in time to see what 
was originally budgeted but as I say as my memory serves me correct – 
if my memory serves me correct the Department reported in that 
meeting that they reprioritise funds from other projects as well to get 
that R13 million together. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Then – let us then go back to 
your statement.  I will – I will take you to paragraph 2.1 it is on the first 
page of your statement where you deal with the opinion that you gave 
to the Account and General of the Province.  Would you please take us 
through this opinion that was provided to the Account and General? 
10 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson this opinion was 
provided by Advocate Ditira in the unit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is in your unit? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  She is in my unit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  She was approached by the 
Account and General in the Provincial Treasury Ms Fourie at that point 
in time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there would be – I am sorry.  You know earlier on 
we talked about an Account and General so there would also be a 
20 
person holding the position of Account and General in a Provincial 
Government as opposed to National Government? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and the one you are talking about here is a 
provincial one? 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 159 of 185 
 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  Yes.  You actually attach 
that opinion or a letter or correspondence as Annexure A it appears on 
page 6 of bundle HH2.  Would you please take us – what was the 
opinion about and what – were you – was sought that you clear? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Ja.  Chairperson I may just 
perhaps say that on the 18 t h when Ms Fourie engaged with Advocate 
Ditira I was out of the office I was not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  But Advocate Ditira phoned me 
and expressed her concern about the June contract and the June 
contract is a contract which the Department concluded with Estina. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Somewhere early in June. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Of 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Chair there will be a witness that will take 
us through that conference.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  This witness did not have any knowledge 
thereof. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Please proceed. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 160 of 185 
 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So as you understood the position the person in your 
section was approached by the Provincial Account and General for 
what? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  For advice on that June 
agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh on the agreement between the department and 
Estina? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay yes continue. 
10 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  When she phoned me and raised 
her concerns I contacted the then Director General. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  And the advice from the then 
Director General was that we should in our advice to the Provincial 
Treasury request that the Treasury Committee refer that contract back 
to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  To have a look at it again.  Now 
the reason why the Treasury Committee was mentioned is that the 
20 
resolution of the Executive Council which I read out just now referred 
that this matter must be referred to the Treasury Committee because 
there was a significant budget issue to be addressed at R84 million.  It 
is normally something that a Treasury Committee which is a sub-
committee of the Executive Council would look into and interrogate 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 161 of 185 
 
before any final decisions were made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So was the person in your unit asked by the Account 
and General, the Provincial Account and General for an opinion whether 
the agreement between Estina and the Department was valid legally, is 
that what was asked? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Ja Chairperson… 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you understood the position? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes that is how I understood it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  And there were certain concerns 
10 
raised by Advocate Ditira. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  The validity … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the agreement? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson in the private 
sector the meeting of mines normally results in an agreement but in the 
public sector when a bid is advertised and the bid is awarded that is 
the guiding – your guidance to prepare an agreement and your 
20 
procurement process normally provides you with the deliverables from 
both parties to enable you to at least capture that in the agreement 
amongst other things that you normally find in an agreement.  And at 
that point in time if I remember correctly there was a judgment of the 
Supreme Court of Appeal and I think it was TEB Properties versus the 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 162 of 185 
 
MEC for Health and Social Development North West in which the court 
ruled that when an agreement is inconsistent with your bid documents 
the agreement is void in as far as it is inconsistent and it is very – it 
was very important for us to make sure that every or any agreement 
that we prepare would be consistent with what was the outcome of the 
procurement process.  And at that point in time it was reported to me 
that it appeared as if there was no procurement process and the 
agreement would be as a result of that void – that was the issue that 
was reported to me. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you and which – where was this 
10 
agreement drafted?  Who drafted this agreement? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson it was not my unit.  
I do not know who drafted it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  It was submitted to Treasury and 
from Treasury it was forwarded to our offices but I have no idea who 
drafted it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I may have interrupted you at a time when you 
20 
were saying you spoke to the Director General after a person in your 
unit had spoken to you about concerns relating to this agreement and 
that you said that the Director General gave you certain advice.  I think 
I interrupted you at that level – I interrupted you and Ms Buthelezi at 
that level.  Ms Buthelezi was that covered or did I take you off track? 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 163 of 185 
 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I think I mentioned 
it but I will repeat it. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  The advice that was received 
from the Director General is that in the response to Treasury we should 
indicate that the Treasury Committee should submit that agreement to 
our office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  For proper interrogation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and then what happened to this 
agreement?  Was it actioned or was it declared invalid and that was the 
end of it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh well let us hear first.  Did you – was Treasury then 
asked to submit it back or submit it to your office? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes.  Chairperson in the advice 
which Advocate Ditira wrote to the department it is on page AJV6 
attached as Annexure A to my affidavit.  In point 4 she wrote that we 
suggest that you proposed to the Treasury Committee that the 
agreement and the procurement documents be sent to us for review. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes then what happened following that 
review process? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I had a meeting 
with then Head of the Department Mr Thabethe indicating to him what I 
have related to you earlier how important the procurement process is to 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 164 of 185 
 
us.  When he came to meet with me he brought along an international 
agreement concluded between South Africa and India on agricultural 
cooperation as well as I think the Black Economic Empowerment 
charter.  And I indicated to him although that could be an important role 
players or documents to be considered in drafted the agreement we are 
still very keen to look at the procurement process and to see what the 
deliverables are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  He indicated that he will submit 
it to me and after that meeting I engaged Advocate Ditira again.  I may 
10 
just perhaps explain that all new work that comes in for legal services 
comes through my office and I allocate it to the legal advisors in terms 
of the amount of work that they are managing at that point in time.  
Since she was involved in this I thought it appropriate that she should 
continue with it and a letter was then drafted by her which I gave 
certain input into requesting the Head of the Department for certain 
information in order to enable her to prepare the agreement.  
Subsequent to that there was correspondence exchanged between her 
and the Head of the Department of which my office was copied which in 
those correspondence that information did not come to the fore. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is now the information to what effect? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  The information which was 
requested in the first letter by Advocate Ditira to enable her to prepare 
an agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 165 of 185 
 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chair if I may just mention? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did that include information about whether there had 
been compliance with procurement procedures? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that was not supplied? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That was not supplied. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  I may just mention that the 
concern which was also raised by Advocate Ditira is that there was 
supposed to be a R30 million initial payment but in the first agreement 
10 
it was not clear what exactly the deliverables for that R30 million was 
supposed to be.  And what we agreed then is that we should get the 
information and rather prepare a proper agreement that at least covers 
that R30 million.  Because that was the concern which Treasury raised 
to say there is a R30 million payment that must be made but we are not 
sure - If we look at the contract what is supposed to be delivered for 
that R30 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  Thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  Then Mr Venter then that 
agreement was never actioned upon, is that your evidence?  The first 
20 
agreement that… 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  No Chairperson I do not think 
that agreement was implemented.  In the next week I am aware that 
there were certain engagements between Advocate Ditira and the Head 
of the Department and officials from Treasury.  I was on leave that – 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 166 of 185 
 
the subsequent week and Advocate Swanepoel was acting in my place. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And what was the date of that week? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I think it was from 
the 2 n d to the 6 t h of July 2012. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I just want to make sure I follow.  When 
Advocate Ditira called you after she had been approached by the 
Provincial Account and General there was already an agreement 
between the Department of Agriculture and Estina.  And she was asked 
to give a legal opinion on whether that agreement was valid.  And she 
10 
was concerned about the validity of the agreement with special 
reference to what appeared to have been lack of compliance with 
procurement procedures, is that right? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And she expressed that to you and you had a 
discussion with the Director General and the Director General’s advice 
was your unit must ask the Provincial Treasury to send the agreement 
to you.  Was it to your unit?  Was the agreement ever sent to your unit? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson our decision was to 
be proactive to request that information. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Before even… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before they sent the – they could send the 
agreement? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Ja.  Before the agreement even 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 167 of 185 
 
arrived. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  So that – so the – would… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the information was requested which included 
information about whether there had been compliance with procurement 
procedures and although there was a response there was no specific 
response in regard to whether there had been compliance with 
procurement procedures, is that right? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  So Chairperson in the next 
week. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  When I was on leave there were 
certain engagements – it would be hearsay if I relate that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but between your department – your unit and 
who? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  The Department of Agriculture 
Treasury was involved.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That I am aware of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  There may be other officials as 
well. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 168 of 185 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  And I was then informed that 
another – a new agreement was drafted and that that agreement was 
signed and that was on my return to office on the 9 t h July. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes are you now referring to the agreement 
that you referred to on paragraph 2.2 of your statement that is the 
second agreement? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes Chairperson that is – that is 
it.  It was signed on the 5 July. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and where was this agreement drafted?  
10 
Who drafted this agreement? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson the agreement was 
drafted by Advocate Ditira. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  From your office? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  From my office and I understand 
that Advocate Swanepoel who was acting in my place also made certain 
inputs.  I was unfortunately at a where I could not receive emails. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Through the cell phone network.  
I could receive a short message but the moment there was a bulky 
20 
attachment it simply did not deliver. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay from what you know who requested 
that this second agreement now be drafted at your office? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I am not sure if it 
was a specific person. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 169 of 185 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  But it could be emanating from 
the fact that we said we need an agreement that provides deliverables 
for that 30 million because the first agreement was not clear about it 
and I think it was one of the issues the Treasury raised to say we have 
a problem with the 30 million because we are not sure for what it is to 
be expended. 
So that second agreement was supposed to address the 30 
million but also pave the way for the rest of the implementation of the – 
of the project. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Mr Venter would you please make us 
understand why this – this agreement that was for the Department of 
Agriculture was being drafted at the Office of the Premier. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I maybe a bit 
lengthy but pardon me please.  Chairperson I cannot really say what 
happened prior to 1994 but immediately after the 1994 elections there 
was resolve from Government to create a strong legal unit within the 
Office of the Premier and I am aware of it because at that point time 
while still practicing I served on at least two panels when we made 
appointments and one of those panels was for the state – the Chief 
20 
State Law Advisor who was the person who retired into which post I 
was – was transferred and at that point in time departments did not 
have legal advisors. 
Although they were appointed subsequently but the resolve 
was also that in the Office of the Premier in that department there 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 170 of 185 
 
needs to be a very strong legal component.  One of the reasons being 
that in terms of the old Treasury instructions that legal advisors central 
component had a role to play in advising accounting officers on issues 
with financial implications and the same instructions at that point in 
time provided that contracts had to be submitted to the State Attorneys. 
Now when the PFMA replaced those instructions the State 
Attorneys indicated to us that we have no obligation anymore in terms 
of the Treasury instructions.  So you will have to look at the contracts 
yourselves which we carried on.  A lot of legal work had been referred 
to us at that point in time and in 2005 we formalised the relationship to 
10 
some extent where the Director General concluded a protocol for legal 
services with the various accounting officers. 
Basically just indicating when we are requested for legal 
advice how should it be structured and how should it arrive at our office 
and what is our response and timeframe.  So it is basically just short of 
a civil level agreement but we refer to it as a protocol for legal 
services.  In that time or subsequent to that we discovered as – as 
legal advisors in the Office of the Premier that in instances where bids 
were awarded and that awarding of a bid was made subject to a service 
level agreement that in many instances the service provider drafted 
20 
their own agreements submitted to the department and they signed it 
and those agreements did not necessarily protect the Government. 
So I – I made a point to – to raise that with – with my Director 
General on – on more than one occasion and I also – we picked it up 
and in commercial contracts in the private sector it is quite prevalent 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 171 of 185 
 
that you get an indemnity clause where the parties agree to indemnify 
each other under certain circumstances and I pointed it out to the 
Director General and I think I mentioned it also to a meeting of heads 
of department.  I am not sure. 
That we have come across agreements which were signed 
which include an indemnity clause in which the particular department of 
or the accounting officer the head of the department indemnifies the 
service provider against whatever it was and I pointed it out to them 
that in terms of the PFMA Section 66 determines that only the MEC for 
Finance can issue, go and borrow money, issue a guarantee or an 
10 
indemnity or committee a department for a future financial commitment 
but more importantly I pointed it out to them that I think it is Section 86 
of the PFMA creates a crime if you are not authorised – if you are not 
the MEC and you sign an indemnity or issue a guarantee and so on and 
I indicated to them in blunt terms that if you have done it you have 
committed a crime. 
All that needs to happen is for you to be arrested and so 
serious it is.  So please send those agreements to us and then in 2010 
a – this directive was issued and I cannot say it is because of the 
things that I related.  I have no idea what motivated it because it was 
20 
mentioned firstly in a meeting that the Premier had with CFOs, heads of 
Supply Chain Management and heads of department and subsequently 
repeated in the Executive Council that all contracts must be submitted 
to my office for the State Law Advisors to – to consider. 
I must immediately also just say Chairperson that it is not in 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 172 of 185 
 
all procurement processes where a – a service level agreement or a 
subsequent 
contract 
is 
necessary 
and 
many 
instances 
the 
specifications in the bid document is sufficient enough to create a 
relationship on – on acceptance by a bid – by the accounting officer to 
constitute a proper agreement and in many instances delivery of a 
single item is required and the time is specified in the bid. 
So it is unnecessary to – to basically repeat what is already 
in existence but some agreements – ag – some bids are advertised 
subject to the signing of a Service Level Agreement where it is 
necessary to manage service to be delivered over time and the 
10 
payments and whatever is necessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Mr Venter.  So in – when you get 
these requests to draft a contract for the department how far do you 
go?  Do you interrogate the service – Supply Chain Management 
processes that have been followed?  What is it exactly that you look at 
to enable you to draft these documents? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson when we have 
arranged with the legal advisors and departments and we work with 
them.  It is our purpose to build their capacity as well.  So we do not 
20 
want to just keep all the - the franchise to legal knowledge under our 
wings.  We – there is a duty on us to build capacity in departments and 
we are trying our best to do it and I must say there is no currently more 
stability in departments and there are more capacitated legal advisors 
in departments which makes our job a lot easier but we – we have an 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 173 of 185 
 
arrangement with them that once a contract is submitted to our office it 
must be a draft. 
They must first prepare a draft and when the draft arrives it 
must be accompanied by all the procurement documents.  The bid 
minutes of the bid adjudication Bid Evaluation Committees so that we 
can go through the bid what was submitted what was accepted and how 
– what the deliberations in the committees were to enable us to make 
sure if there appears something out of that committee meeting 
especially the adjudication committee that we can capture it into the 
agreement but that is the standard practice at this point in time. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  With regards to this particular 
contract what information did you have in preparation of this contract - 
the Vrede Dairy Farm Contract, Estina and the Department of 
Agriculture Contract? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson the project – there 
was a project proposal which was supposed to be attached to the 
agreement and I do not think it was but reference was made to it so 
that information was available at that point in time.  It was supposed to 
be Annexure B to that agreement but it was not attached to the 
document that was signed. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Procurement information was there … 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson there was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the deliverables. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  There was a submission that I 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 174 of 185 
 
have seen where the head of the department approved the appointment 
of Estina on a deviation from the procurement process which was 
authorised in terms of Treasury Regulations 16A6.4 but in that 
submission it was not clear what the reasons for the deviation were. 
There is a subsequent or not a subsequent a Treasury 
Instruction basically dealing with the threshold values when you must – 
when you can procure without quotes, when you can procure with three 
quotes, when you can procure on quotations from all the service – 
possible service providers on the database and then above 500 000 it 
must be a bid. 
10 
That Treasury Instruction also indicates that when an 
accounting officer decides to deviate from the bid process there are 
certain things that must be done and that was not in that submission 
and some of it – two of the things that need to be done is one, a copy 
of that must be submitted to Treasury and to the Auditor General and it 
was an audit issue later on that I became aware that the Auditor 
General had issues because those requirements were not complied 
with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is what you are saying among other things that you 
were provided with documents in order to enable you to draft the 
20 
agreement and one or more of those documents suggested that either 
there had been an approval for deviation from procurement processes 
or procedures or that one or more documents indicated that a request 
should be made for approval for deviation. 
Which of the two did the documents in front of you suggest 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 175 of 185 
 
was – was the case? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I am aware of the 
submission that request the deviation and it was approved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh there – oh there was a request among a document 
containing a request for deviation among the documents that were 
given to you? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That I became aware of yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you became aware of? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And at some stage you also became that the request 
10 
for deviation had been approved? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And had been approved by the right authority? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  The right authority although 
there were compliance issues … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  In that document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Who exactly in your office 
concluded or drafted this document? 
20 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER: 
 That if 
you refer to the 
agreement it was … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes the agreement. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  The Advocate Ditira. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It was Advocate Ditira? 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 176 of 185 
 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That is correct. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes because I want to refer you to certain 
clauses in this document.  If you may be able to assist.  On page 8 of 
the - this agreement I am interested in Clause 2.  I will start reading 
from Clause 2.1 that: 
“The department has in line with the vision Mohuma 
Mobung initiative identify the need to establish a 
dairy project in Vrede.  The Government of the 
Republic of South Africa and India entered into a 
memorandum 
of 
understanding 
on 
agricultural 
10 
cooperation which include promotion of agricultural 
trade and investment.  The department has met 
Paras Dairy the largest private milk producer in 
India who has technical no how and has the right to 
the international brand names and has agreed to 
work with the department.” 
Is there any agreement that you had sight of between the 
department and Parag? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER: 
 
Chairperson 
no 
not 
the 
department and Parag.  I have never seen such an agreement. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you come across any agreement that involved 
Paras even if it was not with the Department of Agriculture in regard to 
this project? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson there may be an 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 177 of 185 
 
agreement between Paras and Estina … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  But is not part of my file 
content. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  I think if i am not mistaken the 
previous witness has mentioned something … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  But … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  It is not part of the documents 
that we … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That came to you? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Ever received. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  Then let us move onto 
paragraph 2 – Clause 2.4. 
“Estina is the counterpart of Paras Dairy in South 
Africa and therefore sole provider who can execute 
20 
the project.” 
What I want to understand from this clause is that this what is 
your understanding of a sole provider? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson if you read the 
clause it means it is the only entity at that point in time who could 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 178 of 185 
 
provide the service and in discussions afterwards with head of the 
department he mentioned that as one of the reasons why he did – 
deviated and just as an example I think when we consulted with the 
evidence leader used the example of Microsoft. 
So we all use Microsoft and if we want to procure from 
Microsoft we cannot go to other companies to buy products if we want 
Microsoft products as a platform for instance.  So we – we have to 
procure from Microsoft and they – Microsoft is the sole provider at that 
point in time for whatever needs to be procured. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  In – in your view would you consider a dairy 
10 
farmer as a sole provider? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe the question maybe – you should put it this 
way bearing in mind your understanding of what this project was about 
what do you think about the statement that Paras Dairy was the sole 
provider of this kind of service? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I have to rely on my 
memory on issues which were raised during the audit and the response 
thereto and why I am aware of it is the previous MEC for Finance 
created an intervention committee where issues in the annual audit that 
has been raised by the Auditor General is submitted and the relevant 
20 
officials from a particular department are then called to that meeting to 
come and explain why this audit query is raised and whether it can be 
resolved or not and my memory on – on the reasons for this deviation 
comes from that committee and again my apologies.  It is a long time 
ago and I … 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 179 of 185 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Did not expect the question so I 
did not do any research to see if … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  I have any paperwork … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  But if I remember correctly what 
was related in that meeting was that various companies in South Africa 
were approached to form part of this initiative and there was no 
interest.  So … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That was your understanding of what had 
happened? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That was my understanding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether it was factually so you do not know? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  I have no idea Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair and if I may refer you to 
the next page – page 9.  It is Clause 2.5.  This clause states that: 
“Estina is willing and able to execute the project 
and has necessary experience and expertise in 
20 
connection therewith.” 
We have heard the evidence earlier on from Mr Jankielsohn 
that Estina was actually an IT company.  Was this interrogated when 
this contract was drafted? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry where were you reading from Ms Buthelezi? 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 180 of 185 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  The next page Chair.  It is page 9.  It is 
Clause 2.5 of the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  It is right on top, thank you. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson I am not aware 
whether it has been interrogated and the extent if it was but from my 
own perspective when I am supposed to draft an agreement on behalf 
of a (indistinct) department I will be very reluctant to include clauses 
like that because you are commit yourself in an agreement that the 
service provider has the capacity to do it and once you have agreed 
10 
that you are bound to what you have agreed whether or not it is the 
truth eventually. 
You commit yourself to a specific statement of fact in an 
agreement and it will be very difficult then to – to get out of it based on 
the fact that there was no – no capacity.  So I would not include it as if 
I have to – if I was the drafter of this agreement. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Is this something that one would expect 
that someone in your office should interrogate before committing to this 
clause in the contract? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Yes Chairperson.  I think it is 
20 
unfortunate that it slipped in.  It should not have been there. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you and you have already told us 
that you have gotten some - the information from the department in 
order to enable you to draft this contract.  Other than that information 
what else informs you on what terms you should include in the 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 181 of 185 
 
contract? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  Chairperson except from the 
project proposal that must have been there as I have indicated there I 
am aware of a number of engagements between the legal advisors in 
our office and the department and the information which is captured 
here could be from – from those engagements in all probability. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  On paragraph 2.3 of your statement it 
is on page 2 of your statement you tell the court the request that you 
received from the Municipal Manager of Phumelela Municipality.  
Please take us through that request and who was the Municipal 
10 
Manager at the time? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER: 
 
Chairperson 
the 
Municipal 
Manager was Mr (indistinct) and the advice which he sought from us 
was a lease agreement which were to be completed between Zayna 
Investment and the municipality.  Now Zayna Investment is the 
company that was established to run the - or to manage the processing 
plant in which the beneficiaries were supposed to have shares.  The 
matter was again referred to Advocate Ditira and she prepared advice 
to Mr (indistinct) which is attached as Annexure C to my Affidavit AJV27 
in the bundle. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  What was the – the – what opinion 
was sought from you if …? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER: 
 
Basically 
whether 
that 
agreement which was submitted to the Municipal Manager to sign was 
in order. 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 182 of 185 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And what was the agreement about? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  That was a lease agreement in 
terms of which this Zayna company would lease the farm from the 
municipality. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and what opinion then did you give 
Mr (indistinct)? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  The opinion was that if you look 
at the MFMA as well as very regular – various regulations that it – it 
was simply not achievable.  The Minister – there was a four percent 
share allocation made to the – to the municipality but there is no 
10 
authority in any piece of legislation for a municipality to become a 
shareholder in a company unless it is a municipality and there is a lot 
of other regulations which regulate the establishment of municipal 
entities and so on. 
So basically what the opinion indicated was that it is not a 
viable option and it concludes at the end indicating that there are other 
options which should be explored.  For instance it reads in the last 
paragraph 11. 
“Alternatively we suggest that the municipality make 
the land available to the Department of Agriculture 
20 
to build a dairy and to enter into a lease agreement 
with community members and then Estina can 
obtain a piece of land outside the municipal land 
and build the processing plant. That will not pose 
any legal challenges to the proposed transaction.” 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 183 of 185 
 
We alerted the municipality to the fact that if Estina is 
supposed to receive any dividends which it was from the proceeds of 
the processing plant and that processing plant is established on 
municipal land it will be a public/private partnership and there is a – 
quite 
an 
intricate 
and 
complicated 
process 
for 
public/private 
partnership to be established and that was why it was indicated that 
Estina should get land outside the municipal land. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Chair I am advised that it is 
almost 5 o’ clock or is it 5 o’ clock.  I still need about an hour and a 
half.  I believe if we start at 09:30 tomorrow I should be done by tea 
10 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I thought – I thought we would be able to finish 
both witnesses but obviously we – we are not able if at 5 o’ clock we 
are not done yet.  You say you … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  We … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Think you need – need another hour? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes because there are some contracts that I 
still need to take and opinions that I need to take the witness through. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and if we may start early tomorrow … 
20 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:   
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you generous or conservative will you say an 
hour? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  I think … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is 30 minutes doable or it is not doable without doing 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 184 of 185 
 
injustice to the matters? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  I do not think it will be doable Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not think it will be doable? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  No.  I do not think it will be doable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No we will – I asked if we can have the air 
conditioner switched on because I was feeling it is hot.  I see it has 
been switched off so it is – it is even hotter.  I want it to feel cold but it 
is okay because we are adjourning or was I the only one feeling hot? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  I do as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think somebody is punishing us.  Okay.  No we are 
10 
going to adjourn but I think we – we - I think there would be a 
challenge starting at half past nine tomorrow.  So let us start at 10 
tomorrow … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if necessary we can also go up to five tomorrow 
and maybe if need be on that depending. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, but we can – we can discuss in the morning in 
terms of how it – whether it would be looking like we might need to go 
beyond five but we can go up to five if we need to but obviously if we 
20 
finish at four it is fine. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will try and use more time if necessary to try and 
– and make as much progress as we can.  I think I am under the 
impression that Ms Gcabashe had asked for – for that.  If I am mistaken 
22 JULY 2019 – DAY 137 
 
Page 185 of 185 
 
she will remind me.  Okay.  Mr – Mr Venter are you available tomorrow 
at 10 o’ clock?  Will you …? 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  I have made arrangements to 
stay over Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERTUS JOHANNES VENTER:  I will be here tomorrow.
