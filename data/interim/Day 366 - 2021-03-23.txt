ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you Chair.  If I may then 
proceed to outline the program for the next three days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  That is today is the 23 r d, the 24 t h and 
the 25 t h March. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  As I indicated to the Chair this week 
the commission will hear evidence regarding the South 
African Revenue Services and in our contention and the 
SARS evidence is central to the commission’s mandate to 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 6 of 362 
 
inquire into allocations of state capture.   
 
SARS has featured prominently in allegations of 
state capture and it will be contended that the actors in 
question weakened and misdirected operations of SARS 
particularly its compliance functions, rendering it less 
effective and all for unlawful purposes and accordingly the 
SARS evidence falls squarely within the commission’s 
Terms of Reference.   
 
A particular feature of the SARS evidence Chair is 
its connection with the so called Nugent Commission as the 
10 
Chair will be aware the Commission of Inquiry into tax 
administration 
and 
governance 
by 
the 
South 
African 
Revenue 
Services 
known 
colloquially 
as 
the 
Nugent 
Commission operated under Terms of Reference published 
on the 18 t h of June 2018 and the commission was required 
to inquire into make findings on and report and make 
representations concerning 18 specific issues. 
 
Chair there is an overlap between the work of that 
commission and the present commission.  The Nugent 
Commission focussed on irregularities at SARS including 
20 
what it found was the seizure of SARS by Mr Tom Moyane 
and others whilst on the other hand this commission is of 
course 
investigating 
state 
capture 
of 
public 
entities 
including SARS. 
 
So the central question to be answered by the state 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 7 of 362 
 
capture commission fell outside of the scope of the Nugent 
Commission references 
 
To determine the correct guiding dividing line 
between what is a permissible topic of inquiry for this 
commission and what is not because it has already been 
dealt with it is necessary to consider briefly what was 
investigated and found in the Nugent Report. 
 
And in the final report the Nugent Commission made 
the following overarching findings. 
 
The first was that there had been a massive failure 
10 
of integrity and governance at SARS demonstrated by what 
SARS once was and what it has become.  That state of 
affairs so it was found was brought about by the reckless 
mismanagement of SARS on the part of the former 
Commissioner Mr Moyane. 
 
What 
occurred 
at 
SARS 
said 
the 
Nugent 
Commission was inevitable the moment Mr Moyane set foot 
there because he dismantled the elements of governance 
one by one and that was described by the Nugent 
Commission as seizing control of SARS as if it was his to 
20 
have. 
 
Furthermore the failure of good governance was 
manifest inter alia from the fact that senior management 
was driven out of or marginalised at SARS.  Senior 
management 
appointed 
by 
Mr 
Moyane 
were 
simply 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 8 of 362 
 
compliant and neglected their oversight function.  The 
development 
of 
SARS’ 
sophisticated 
information 
technology 
systems 
was 
summarily 
halted. 
 
The 
organisational structure of SARS that provided oversight 
was pulled apart.  The scent was stamped out by instilling 
distrust and fear.  Accountability to other state authorities 
was defied and capacity for investigating corruption was 
disabled and then finally instead of fostering a climate and 
a culture of healthy descent the Nugent Commission found 
that 
Mr 
Moyane 
engendered 
a 
culture 
of 
fear 
and 
10 
intimidation and there was a purging of competent officials. 
 
Now Chair I have no doubt that this commission has 
no desire to repeat the work of the Nugent Commission nor 
does this commission seek to re-enter the fray on the same 
basis.  In the absence of any judicial review of the Nugent 
Commission’s Report those findings of course stand and no 
evidence in contradiction of any such finding we would 
submit should be admitted. 
 
While the remit of that report was wide there are 
certain issues which were not investigated by Judge 
20 
Nugent and which are now the focus of this commission’s 
work in relation to SARS. 
 
And matters concerning SARS which were not within 
the remit of the Nugent Commission’s work or in respect of 
which evidence was not led and which are relevant to this 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 9 of 362 
 
commission’s inquiry will properly form the subject matter 
of testimony this week. 
 
And so Chair the focus will be on the consulting 
company Bain’s actions in connection with SARS and Chair 
will recall that the Nugent Commission concluded that Bain 
had not told the full story. 
 
Secondly there will be an emphasis on Mr Moyane’s 
role in SARS and it will be recollected that Mr Moyane did 
not give evidence before the Nugent Commission. 
 
And then thirdly evidence of the impact of the 
10 
capture of SARS upon the institution. 
 
And so Chair whilst the Nugent Report makes 
detailed findings as to the institutional dismantling of 
SARS 
this 
commission’s 
mandate 
requires 
that 
the 
strategic 
significance 
of 
this 
capture 
of 
SARS 
be 
contextualised within the big picture of the state capture 
inquiry. 
 
If 
I 
could 
briefly 
then 
just 
highlight 
for 
the 
commission the – the patterns and processes of state 
capture and where the evidence that will be led fits in. 
20 
 
The Nugent Commission’s findings and the evidence 
led showed that the repurposing of SARS followed familiar 
patterns and processes of state capture that have been 
observed in other state institutions.  And SARS offers we 
would submit one of the clearest demonstrations of this 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 10 of 362 
 
pattern of repurposing observed in other state owned 
entities and state institutions. 
 
And this includes so the evidence will show the 
collusion between SARS, the executive and Bain with a 
planned and coordinated agenda in relation to SARS well 
in advance of either Bain or Mr Moyane’s appointment. 
 
Secondly the purging of competent top officials and 
the climate of fear. 
 
Thirdly 
the 
strategic 
positioning 
of 
compliant 
individuals and 
10 
 
Fourthly the restructuring and deliberate weakening 
of institutional functions and all of those are common 
features which this commission has heard in relation to 
other institutions. 
 
In addition we will intend that the evidence to be 
led bears out the pattern of procurement irregularities 
which have so far loomed large in the evidence heard by 
this commission and that would include the collusion and 
the award of a contract.  The irregular use of confinement 
and condonation to avoid open competition, transparency 
20 
and scrutiny and thirdly the use of consultants that justify 
changes that were really only necessary to repurpose 
SARS. 
 
Chair the witnesses that will be heard this week are 
as follows: 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 11 of 362 
 
 
Firstly today the commission will hear from Mr Athol 
Williams who is a former Bain and Company employee. 
 
Secondly tomorrow we will hear from Mr Vlok 
Symington who is a senior employee of SARS. 
 
Thirdly Mr Johan Van Loggerenberg who was a 
former SARS employee. 
 
And then finally on the 25 t h from Mr Tom Moyane 
the former commissioner of SARS. 
 
And then Chair an arrangement has also been made 
that Mr Moyane will conclude his cross-examination of 
10 
Minister Gordhan in an evening session which has been set 
for today the 23 r d March. 
 
If I may then briefly take the commission to the 
essence of the evidence that will be led.  In relation to Mr 
Athol Williams a I have indicated he was a Bain and 
Company employee.  He was employed in various roles.  
The ones we are interested in for purposes of the 
commission today are firstly that he was engaged as an 
independent 
consultant 
from 
September 
of 
2018 
to 
December 2018 to oversee an investigation that had been 
20 
commissioned by Bain into the award of the contract with 
SARS and the work which it did at SARS. 
 
Then from January of 2019 until May of 2019 he 
was employed as an independent advisor to develop a so 
called remedy plan for Bain. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 12 of 362 
 
 
Then thirdly from May of 2019 to August 2019 he 
was employed on a part-time basis as a partner serving on 
the Bain Africa Oversight Board. 
 
And then fourthly he resigned at the end of August 
of 2019 because he was on the view that Bain had not 
been 
transparent 
with 
him 
and 
the 
South 
African 
authorities 
regarding 
their 
investigation 
into 
what 
happened at SARS under their tenure. 
 
And he made various media statements in 2019 that 
Bain was withholding information about the restructuring at 
10 
SARS and their work at SARS. 
 
Mr Williams was approached by this commission for 
an interview which was held and pursuant to that a 
summons was issued against him to produce books and 
documents which he did and subsequently he furnished the 
commission with an affidavit dated the 23 r d July 2020 and 
annexures thereto and that will form the basis of the 
testimony that is to be produced today. 
 
Chair 
you 
are 
aware 
that 
Bain 
launched 
an 
application which is to be found in file SE2 44/2020.  In it 
20 
they applied for leave to cross-examine Mr Williams, leave 
to make oral and written submissions to the commission 
and then also an order that confidentiality. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just – just one second Mr Franklin.  Yes 
you may continue. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 13 of 362 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you.  Chair the – the 
application asked for various relief as I have said and the 
third prayer was that confidentiality be maintained over 
certain portions of Mr Williams’ affidavit and its annexures 
and for those to be withheld from public disclosure. 
 
I am happy to say Chair that in discussions with my 
learned friend Mr Cockrell we have managed to narrow the 
ambit of that application considerably.  You will have seen 
that there was an annexure X which was updated and that 
had various categories and in relation to each of those 
10 
categories Bain had originally asked that the evidence be 
kept confidential. 
 
In relation to the first of those sections so called 
sensitive personal information regarding whistle blowers it 
has been agreed that the personal details of two persons 
who are referred to in the affidavit will be redacted and not 
referred to in relation to the other two people Mr Williams 
will say that he has been given specific permission by 
those people to reveal their identities.  So that has been 
dealt with. 
20 
 
In relation to the category of so called legally 
privileged 
materials 
and 
information 
included 
in 
the 
affidavit there was a relatively long list I understand that 
Bain will persist and place on record that they still regard 
certain of the information to be led as privileged and 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 14 of 362 
 
confidential but they do not seek any relief in relation 
thereto and Mr Cockrell will no doubt outline that for the 
commission. 
 
Then in relation to the so called commercially 
confidential information that too falls within the same ambit 
of the agreement i.e. although it is maintained that it is 
commercially sensitive and no relief will be sought in 
relation to that. 
 
And the final category was investigations by foreign 
regulatory and other bodies referred to in Mr Williams’ 
10 
affidavit and the approach of the commission is that there 
is no reason not to refer to those in investigations.  I 
understand that Bain will contend that they ought not to be 
referred to but there is no specific relief that is sought in 
relation thereto.  
 
And then that really deals with the application in its 
totality and the Chair has indicated to – to Bain via the 
secretariat that the application for leave to cross-examine 
and to make oral and written submissions will be dealt with 
in due course on a date to be arranged by the commission. 
20 
 
The – the sole remaining issue then regarding Bain 
and what it requires is a request which was directed to the 
commission in a letter dated the 26 t h of November 2020 in 
which it seeks permission from the commission that 
affidavits would set out its version of events concerning its 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 15 of 362 
 
role at SARS be publicised by some or other means at the 
same time as Mr Williams’ testimony is uploaded onto the 
commission’s website. 
 
I 
understand 
Mr 
Cockrell 
will 
motivate 
that 
particular request and the approach of the legal team is 
that there is no basis to exceed to – to that request. 
 
So that is the position in relation to Mr Williams and 
the Bain application.   
 
There have been various other responses to Mr 
Williams’ affidavit and there have been letters which have 
10 
been received as well as affidavits which have been filed 
and applications for – to cross-examine.  I need not go 
through all of those.  They are collected together in one of 
the SARS bundles and the representatives of certain of 
those persons have placed themselves on record. 
 
Proceeding then to the second of the witnesses who 
will give evidence this week that is Mr Vlok Symington.  He 
is currently an employee of SARS and a senior legal 
advisor. 
 
He 
is 
represented 
and 
tomorrow 
the 
representatives will place themselves on record.   
20 
 
He was asked by the commission to submit himself 
to an interview in connection with an incident which has 
been described as a hostage incident that occurred at the 
SARS offices in October of 2018 and he ultimately provided 
the commission with an affidavit dated the 2 n d of November 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 16 of 362 
 
2020 which will be the subject matter and focus of his 
testimony. 
 
And consequent upon that various other people also 
gave affidavits which are also bundled in the – in the SARS 
bundle. 
 
Similarly such applications as there are to cross-
examine as well as Mr Symington’s own application to 
cross-examine various people will be as I understand it 
dealt with by the Chair on a date set by the commission. 
 
The third witness is Mr Johan Van Loggerenberg 
10 
who as I have said is a former SARS employee.  He was 
also 
approached 
by 
the 
commission 
regarding 
the 
commission’s investigation into compliance units at SARS 
and the fate of those units and how they have been 
affected by the restructuring which took place under Bain 
and Mr Moyane and he provided the commission with an 
affidavit dated the 11 t h of November of 2020 which will be 
the subject of the testimony that he will present. 
 
There have been various applications which have 
been 
served 
in 
relation 
to 
Mr 
Van 
Loggerenberg’s 
20 
testimony.  We are in the process of attempting to resolve 
those if we can if not then the Chair will be asked to hear 
and determine those applications. 
 
Chair apart from that and there are bundles which 
have been prepared and which are for the commission.  
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 17 of 362 
 
Returning then to the proceedings for today I understand 
that the commission would first like to hear Bain’s requests 
and that will be done via Mr Cockrell.  Thereafter I will lead 
the evidence of Mr Williams and following that in the 
evening session the cross-examination of Minister Gordhan 
by Mr Moyane’s representatives will take place. 
 
So against that background Chair may I ask that we 
deal with the residual Bain issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And invite Mr Cockrell to make his 
10 
submissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Franklin.  Mr Cockrell are 
you ready to address me on Bain … 
ADV COCKRELL SC:  Yes thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may go ahead. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:  Sorry Chair I – I heard you say 
invite me to address you and then I am afraid it went dead 
on my side. I could not hear what you were inviting me to 
address you on I apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh no – on the Bain application that is – 
20 
ja that is what I said. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chair I will not 
have to detain you for very long.  I am very grateful to my 
learned friend Mr Franklin for that very fair summary of 
where we are.   
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 18 of 362 
 
 
I need to address you on two issues.  I need to 
bring 
you 
up 
to 
speed 
with 
where 
we 
are 
on 
the 
confidentiality application and then I need to address you 
very briefly on the application by Bain in order to publish 
its own affidavits. 
 
May I address those in turn?  Chair you will know 
the application by Bain and Company had a number of 
prayers in the relief.   
 
Prayer 4 sought relief in relation to confidentiality.  
As my learned friend Mr Franklin pointed out there was an 
10 
annexure to the notice of motion Chair it was a long 
annexure, Annexure X.  We – Bain reduced that annexure 
in the course of last week and in the course of Friday we 
have reduced it even further Chair.  So what has happened 
is there is no longer any point of contestation between us 
and the commission regarding the various categories of 
documents. 
 
And Chair I need to make it clear the reason why 
Bain and Company has effectively decided not to persist 
with that application is it is very conscious of the fact that 
20 
the commission is working under time pressure and it 
wants 
this 
commission 
not 
to 
feel 
that 
it 
is 
being 
obstructionist or trying to obstruct the working of the 
commission. 
 
And so where Bain and Company comes out is this 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 19 of 362 
 
– is this Chair – if you were to go to Annexure X in the 
amended version I will go through those categories very 
briefly and it is large in the line with what my learned 
friend Mr Franklin said. 
 
Chair Annexure X really had four categories.  The 
first category was sent with personal information included 
in Mr Williams’ affidavit and the view taken by Bain is that 
because those four people had not given consent for their 
identity 
to 
be 
disclosed 
their 
identity 
was 
therefore 
confidential. 
10 
 
We are now told by the evidence leader that Mr 
Williams has permission from two of them and so the 
agreement we have reached with the evidence leader Chair 
is that the identity of the remaining two will be anonymised 
that there is agreement between us in that regard Chair we 
do not seek a ruling from you.        
 
Chair the second of those categories the privileged 
information Chair I need to place this on record you will 
know that Mr Williams came into possession of various 
documents in the course of his employment by Bain and 
20 
Company and the view taken by Bain and Company is that 
some of those documents are privileged.   
 
Chair I see my screen has frozen are you still 
there? 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can still see you – we can hear you. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 20 of 362 
 
ADV COCKRELL SC:  Chair – thank – thank you Chair.  
Chair those documents in some cases came from the 
external legal advisors to Bain and Company Baker and 
McKenzie.  In other cases they came from the in-house 
advisors to Bain and Company.  In many cases those 
documents are core privileged they are labelled privileged. 
 
The view taken by Bain and Company is that those 
documents are privileged and remain privileged but Chair 
for the reasons I have given earlier Bain no longer seeks 
any ruling from you regarding the confidentiality of those 
10 
documents.  Chair I say again Bain and Company does not 
wish to hold up the workings of this commission and so it 
has agreed not to persist with that application. 
 
In short we are so privileged over those documents 
but Chair we no longer seek a ruling from you in relation to 
the second category legally privileged documents. 
 
Chair the third category commercial is confidential 
information again Bain and Company has decided not to 
persist with that application.  We no longer seek any ruling 
from 
you 
regarding 
to 
the 
confidentiality 
of 
those 
20 
documents. 
 
And 
Chair 
then 
finally 
the 
fourth 
category 
investigations by foreign regulatory and other bodies.  
Chair those are allegations in Mr Williams’ affidavit which 
refers to interaction between Bain and Company and 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 21 of 362 
 
regulators in other jurisdictions.  The view that Bain and 
Company took is because those regulators regarded the 
interactions as being confidential it was not within the 
power of Bain to waive confidentiality.  And so we had a 
discussion with the evidence leader last week and we 
ascertained whether the evidence leader was comfortable 
eliciting the fact of those interactions and the view taken 
by the evidence leader is that the commission had no 
difficulty in that regard. 
 
So Chair the – the position of Bain and Company is 
10 
it regards those interactions as being confidential but it no 
longer asks for any relief from you Chair.  In other words if 
the 
evidence 
leader 
has 
no 
difficulty 
eliciting 
that 
information Bain and Company does not seek any ruling 
from you regarding confidentiality in that regard. 
 
And so Chair where all of that goes is we are in the 
– may I say happy position where no ruling is sought from 
you in relation to any of the confidentiality portions of the 
Bain and Company application Chair. 
 
There is agreement between ourselves and our 
20 
learned friends Mr Franklin as to how the evidence will flow 
and we do not seek any ruling from you.  I simply place on 
record what the position of Bain & Company is.   
 
Chair, that then brings us to the second part on 
what I have to address you on and here, unfortunately, we 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 22 of 362 
 
do seek a ruling from you.  Chair, you will not find it in the 
Bain & Company application.   
 
This is, in fact, something that was contained in 
the letter by Bain & Company to the Commission on the 
26 t h of November 2020.  And Chair, the position is this.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Bain & Company has submitted two 
affidavits to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Mr Franklin, do 
you have a copy of that letter?  The letter of November 
10 
2020 that Mr Cockrell is referring to? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or is it in the bundle here? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, Chair, I will endeavour to locate 
that for you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   The letter... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you may continue. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Yes.  Apology, Chair.  I cannot refer 
you to the bundle because I do not have it but maybe 
20 
summarise the letter...  [Speaker not clear – distortion in 
transmission present] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   My learned friend, Mr Franklin, will 
make it available to you in due course. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 23 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Chair, the position is this.  
Mr Williams filed his affidavit, his witness statement.  
When Bain & Company applied to you for various forms of 
relief, Bain & Company put up two affidavits.  One from 
Mr Min and one from Mr Moolman.   
 
And the difficulty that Bain & Company now finds 
itself is this.  It is simply not sure whether it is in a 
position to publish those two affidavits once Mr Williams 
commences his evidence.   
10 
 
And Chair, that is the basis of the relief that we 
seek from you today.  What Bain & Company is asking for 
is, is permission from you that it, Bain & Company, can 
publish those affidavits.   
 
My learned friend, Mr Franklin, with respect, 
misunderstood it.  He seemed to think that we were asking 
you for an instruction that the Commission must publish the 
Bain & Company affidavits but that is not part of our relief 
Chair.  We do not ask the Commission to do anything.   
 
All that we ask for is permission that Bain & 
20 
Company, should it decide to do so, can publish its own 
affidavits, the end form it considers appropriate.   
 
And Chair, the reason why we ask that relief 
from you is.  If one goes to Regulation 11(3)(b).  Chair, not 
the laws of this Commission.  These are the regulations.  
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 24 of 362 
 
Regulation 11(3)(b) is drafted, with respect, with a slightly 
obscure form.  This is what it says. 
 
It says: 
“No person shall without the written permission 
of the chairperson: 
a) 
Disseminate 
any 
documents 
submitted to the Commission by any person 
in connection with the inquiry or publish the 
content or any portion of the content of such 
document...” 
10 
 
So Chair, what the regulation is saying is.  No 
person shall without your written permission disseminate 
any documents submitted to the Commission or publish the 
contents of any such documents.   
 
And Chair, may I say, the contravention of that 
provision is a criminal offence in terms of Regulation 12.  
And Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  What ...[intervenes]  
ADV COCKRELL SC:   ...and it is not just it is a 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, what regulation is it again? 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   What regulation is it again? 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Chair, it is Regulation 11. 
CHAIRPERSON:   11? 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 25 of 362 
 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Regulation 11(3)(a). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay.   
ADV COCKRELL SC:   So Chair, when one reads that 
regulation ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   ...it is not immediately obviously 
whether it prohibits Bain from publishing its own affidavits.  
It is a Bain affidavit but Bain submitted it to this 
Commission.  On one reading what the regulation is saying 
is 
that 
Bain 
is 
prohibited 
from 
disseminating 
that 
10 
document, its own affidavit because it had published it to 
the Commission. 
 
But Chair, even if that is not the correct reading 
of that regulation, the difficulty Bain would still find itself in 
is, 
the 
Bain 
affidavit 
are, 
of 
course, 
referring 
to 
Mr Williams’ affidavits which also... to the definition. 
 
So even if Regulation 11(3)(a) does not prohibit 
Bain from publishing its own affidavits, it would still have 
that effect in as much as the Bain affidavit is cross-
referring 
to 
Mr 
Williams’ 
affidavit. 
 
And 
so 
Chair 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct]  
ADV 
COCKRELL 
SC: 
 
 
...application... 
by 
Bain 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Cockrell, let us just try and see if we 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 26 of 362 
 
understand what paragraph A says. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There are two possible interpretations, it 
seems to me.  There is no doubt that the prohibition relates 
to any document submitted to the Commission.  So Bain’s 
affidavit, once it has been submitted to the Commission, 
would fall under that.  And then it says document by any 
person in connection with the inquiry.   
 
I suspect what you are saying is that the 
reference to any person is not a reference to a document 
10 
of the person who seeks to disseminate the document.  If 
that is what you say. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
So 
that 
might 
be 
one 
possible 
interpretation.  Another one might be that the prohibition is 
intended to make sure that any document that is submitted 
to the Commission, even your own document, you may not 
publish without the written permission of the Chairperson. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now on the face of it ...[intervenes]  
20 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...the interest that would be sought to be 
protected by that prohibition are the interest of the 
investigation of the Commission.  So if that is correct then 
there may be difficulty in the interpretation that would say:  
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 27 of 362 
 
I am free to publish my own affidavits that are submitted to 
the Commission and I am free to do so without the written 
permission of the Commission. 
 
Because the mischief that is sought to be 
avoided would be the same whether I am publishing or 
disseminating my own affidavit or disseminating somebody 
else’s affidavit.  I think that might be the difficulty with that 
interpretation. 
 
Whereas, if you – if we adopt the interpretation 
that the reference to any person includes the deponent to 
10 
that affidavit or the oath of that document, then that 
interpretation seeks to make sure that any document that 
has been submitted to the Commission is now part of the 
Commission’s investigation. 
 
And 
to 
protect 
the 
investigation 
of 
the 
Commission, nobody should disseminate that document 
without getting the written permission of the Commission.  I 
would be inclined towards that interpretation, rather than 
the one that says that as long as it is your affidavit, you 
can publish it even if you had submitted it to the 
20 
Commission. 
 
But you might have something to different to 
advance 
or 
you 
might 
say 
whatever 
the 
correct 
interpretation is, this is what you would like to say. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Yes.  Chair, with respect, from our 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 28 of 362 
 
perspective it does not matter which interpretation is 
correct.  May I say, with respect, you are entirely correct 
Chair.  Regulation 11(3)(a) could be read as prohibiting the 
author of the document from publishing his or her own 
documents or it could be read that it is only referring to a 
third person.   
 
But Chair, from Bain & Company’s perspective it 
really does not matter because Bain & Company has 
written to you, seeking your permission.  So no matter 
whose interpretation is correct, it runs to be on the right 
10 
side of you Chair.  If I can put it bluntly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   So no matter which interpretation is 
correct, the provision falls away if the Chairperson gives 
written permission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no ...[intervenes]  
ADV COCKRELL SC:   And that is what Bain & Company 
was saying to you in the letter Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   ...saying perhaps the regulation 
20 
does not apply to Bain & Company’s own document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   But even if that was or were 
correct, Bain & Company would still have a difficulty 
because it would certainly apply to Mr Williams’ affidavit. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 29 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   And Bain & Company is referring to 
Mr Williams’ affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   So Chair, with effect, on either 
interpretation... 
 
[Speaker 
is 
unclear 
– 
distortion 
in 
transmission.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the ...[intervenes]  
ADV 
COCKRELL 
SC: 
 
 
On 
either 
interpretation 
...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   ...what Bain & Company is asking 
for 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think the reason why I was looking at 
the two possible interpretations.  I thought that that could 
have been behind you emphasising that Mr Franklin may 
have misunderstood your position to be that, you were 
asking the Commission – you are asking for my permission 
to allow the Commission to disseminate or publish.   
 
And you are saying, no, that is not what you are 
20 
asking.  You are asking to be allowed to publish yourself.  
So I was wondering what the significance is in terms of the 
difference, 
whether 
the 
publication 
is 
done 
by 
the 
Commission or by yourself because in the end, it is 
publication.   
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 30 of 362 
 
 
So I was wondering whether there was any 
significance to be attached to that that is based on the 
regulation.   
 
But I think it is clear that you are saying, 
whatever the interpretation is, you want to make sure that, 
if the correct interpretation is that everyone who has – 
everyone who wants to publish a document that has been 
submitted to the Commission needs the written permission 
of the Chairperson, you want to make sure that you are on 
the right side of the law.  So that is – that I understand 
10 
now.  Yes? 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   That is quite correct Chair.  So the 
letter... written, in respect, to your workings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   What Bain & Company was saying 
in the letter is, there may be some interesting... for debate 
but our interpretation in terms(?) of Regulation 11(b)(a). 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   But he does not want to have those 
debates.  He just wants to be on the right side of the law 
20 
and so the letter... out of respect to you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   And such as ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think that maybe ...[intervenes]  
ADV COCKRELL SC:   [Indistinct]  
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 31 of 362 
 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to this.  It will help you...  Hallo, 
Mr Cockrell? 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It will help you... if you have an idea 
what I have in mind.  My immediate concern is, why that 
should be done in this case whereas normally it is not 
done.  But of course, you may say:  Well, other people 
have not applied for written permission.  We have applied 
for written permission.  But that was my immediate reaction 
10 
to the request.  And why... why ...[intervenes]  
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Chair, I do not know what other 
parties have done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I am terrible sorry.  We – there is 
something not so good with the technology.  So you, 
obviously, will address that.  But the – what has been 
happening over the past three years is, basically, that an 
affidavit will become public when the witness or the 
deponent to that affidavit has given evidence in public.  
Now why should we not stick to that in this case? 
20 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Chairperson, may I apologise?  I do 
not intend to interrupt you, obviously, but there is a big 
time lap between – on the Zoom connection, unfortunately.  
So I do apologise if it looks like I am interrupting you.  I 
have no intention of doing that. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 32 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no, no.  Ja. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Chair, the... [transmission lost] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I think maybe we might have 
to adjourn to see whether the technicians cannot solve this 
problem.  I am sorry Mr Cockrell.  We might have to 
adjourn a bit to see whether the technicians cannot solve 
this problem.  I think there is both a delay but also I do not 
know whether they say the network is unstable and whether 
that can be fixed.  Should we adjourn?   
TECHNICIANS:   [No audible reply]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Five minutes? 
TECHNICIANS:   [No audible reply] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Then let us adjourn so that the – 
our exchange can flow smoothly.  We will adjourn for about 
five minutes to give the technicians the opportunity to fix 
the problem.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   It looks like Mr Cockrell does not have 
any signal. 
20 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   I am here, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are there, okay. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   I am here, Chair, and …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   We cannot see you but if you can hear 
me we can continue. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 33 of 362 
 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   It tends to go on and off again. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I was told the problem has been 
sorted so but I think the technicians will continue.  Let us 
continue. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Chair, can I say from my side I can 
see the signal is much better because I was getting a 
signal to indicate it was unstable at the venue and that 
signal how gone away.  So I am happy to continue, Chair, 
even you cannot see me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   As long as you can hear me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no that is fine, I can hear you much 
better, it is just that I cannot see you now but we can 
continue in the meantime.  I have had the opportunity 
during the short adjournment to read the letter that you 
were 
referring 
to 
in 
terms 
of 
which 
they 
requested 
permission to publish this affidavit.  So I have looked at it.  
Subject to what you might say, I do not see anything that 
justifies that Bain be treated differently from everybody 
else in that letter. 
20 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Well, Chair, may I address you on 
why that would cause a difficulty for Bain. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Mr Williams... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes?  Oh. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 34 of 362 
 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Will be (indistinct – recording 
distorted) that Mr Williams’ affidavit going to be released. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Hang 
on, 
hang 
on, 
Mr 
Cockrell 
…[intervenes] 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   But the difficulty for Bain is, 
although it is a privileged …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hello, I am sorry, we could not hear you 
for a few seconds so I think start afresh please? 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Yes, Chair.  Chair, I do apologise.  
Chair, Mr Williams will give his evidence today.  As I 
10 
understand what you said before the short adjournment, 
the practice of the Commission is that Mr Williams’ 
affidavit would then be released into the public domain.  
Now Bain and company has applied for leave to cross-
examine (indistinct – recording distorted), we do not know 
whether Bain has applied. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, we continue to have problems in 
terms of technology, there are times where I cannot hear 
you.  I am looking at the technicians whether they need 
some time.  I mean, I do not mind if we do not see you as 
20 
long as …[intervenes] 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   I turn my video off, that sometimes 
helps. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If it does it is fine.  
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Sometimes they freeze up some 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 35 of 362 
 
bandwidth, Chair, I have turned off my video. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, maybe start afresh. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   That may be easier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just start afresh and let us continue and 
see. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Yes, Chair, I do apologise for this, I 
really do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no, that is fine, that is fine.  I 
think you had just staying saying the problem for Bain, if it 
was to be treated in accordance with the practice that we 
10 
have would be and then I could not hear.  I think you can 
start from there. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Chair, let me back up.  What you 
put to me is that the practice of the Commission is once a 
person gives evidence before this Commission its affidavit 
will then be released into the public domain.  That is what I 
understood your statement to be about the practice that 
the Commission …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   So what that means is when Mr 
20 
Williams gives his evidence today his affidavit will then be 
released into the public domain but the difficulty for Bain 
is, although it has applied for leave to cross-examine Mr 
Williams, it has not yet been granted leave to cross-
examine and indeed he does not even know when its 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 36 of 362 
 
application for leave to cross-examine will be heard and so 
the difficulty is, if someone today were to ask Bain at the 
conclusion of Mr Williams’ evidence today, what do you say 
about Mr Williams’ evidence, what Bain would want to do in 
the ordinary course is to say well, see the two affidavits we 
have filed with the Commission but Chair, with respect, if 
the narrow reading of regulation 11(3)(a) is correct, it 
means that Bain cannot do that.  So they cannot refer 
anybody to the affidavit they are filing and it may be even 
worse than that, Chair, because if Bain is advised that it 
10 
cannot release the affidavit, it may be in a position where 
it cannot even summarise what it says on an affidavit 
because that they also be seen to be in contravention, the 
Section 11(3)(a) 
 
And so the difficulty for Bain, Chair, is although it 
has filed affidavits before you, it does not know when its 
application for leave to cross-examine will be heard and 
so, with respect, if you were to refuse it permission, Chair, 
which Regulation 11(3) permits you to grant, it would in 
effect leave Bain in a most untenable position where it is 
20 
unable to respond if anyone were to ask it what is your 
response, Bain and Company, to the evidence of Mr 
Williams and Chair, you will know the evidence of Mr 
Williams 
said 
some 
pointed 
things 
about 
Bain 
and 
Company. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 37 of 362 
 
 
And so, Chair, with respect, where all of that is, 
where all of that comes out, in our respectful submission, it 
is just a question of fairness to Bain and Company.  I say 
again, we are not asking to publish on the Commission’s 
website, that is no part of the relief Bain and Company 
asked for on the letter to do, all that Bain and Company 
wants to do is it asked by a client or by a media 
representative what is your response, it wants to be able to 
refer to the affidavit that was filed and, Chair, with respect, 
that is just a matter of fairness to Bain and Company 
10 
because, without it, Bain and Company in effect in a 
position where it is unable to respond to what Mr Williams 
has said and that just does not seem fair, Chair, in our 
respectful 
submission 
precisely 
because 
Bain 
and 
Company does not know when its affidavit will be released 
in accordance with the practice that we have referred to 
Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   If you – you spoke about …[intervenes] 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   But Chair, I think before the tea 
…[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, you also spoke about the 
possibility of Bain preparing a summary of what its 
response is as opposed to publishing the actual affidavit.  
It may well be that that is better than publishing the whole 
affidavit, I am not sure, but if that were to happen, would 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 38 of 362 
 
that not satisfy the fairness requirement that you talk about 
to say well, at least here is a summary of our response, we 
are not publishing what is in the affidavit, we are not 
publishing the affidavit itself but this is here is a summary 
of what our response is, our points to the evidence of the 
allegations by Mr Williams.  What do you think about that 
as an alternative to publishing the actual affidavit? 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Chair, may I say, with respect, it 
would certainly be better than nothing.  It may – the very 
possibility you posit to me, Chair, would probably still 
10 
require 
your 
permission 
because 
Regulation 
11(3)(a) 
prohibits a party without your written permission from 
publishing the content or any portion of the content, of 
such a document.  But, Chair, I understand what you are 
putting to me, is well, if Bain and Company is refused 
permission to release its entire affidavit could it not at 
least prepare of a summary of its affidavit?  And my 
response is, that would also require your permission, 
Chair, under Regulation 11(3)(a) and that is a bare 
minimum, that is what Bain and Company would ask for. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:    But, Chair, what I would say, and I 
make the submission with respect, is in some ways it is 
worse for the party, the party has gone on affidavit to put 
its version, it is now forced to cull that version on affidavit 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 39 of 362 
 
and try and give a potted summary of that version.  In 
some ways, Chair, the likelihood of inaccuracy is greater 
when a party tries to summarise his affidavit than if it 
simply released the whole affidavit. 
 
But, Chair, I do take your point, what you are 
putting to me is if the practice of the Commission is not to 
allow a party to release a document including its own 
document before it gives evidence, then what you put to 
me is well, would it not at least be fair to Bain to be able to 
release a summary of that affidavit and at a bare minimum, 
10 
Chair, what is what we would ask for.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, because …[intervenes] 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   So the first prize, Chair, would still 
remain for Bain to be able to say here is the affidavit, but, 
Chair, with respect, if you are not minded to grant that, at 
a minimum we would at least ask for permission to release 
a summary of that affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you see, what I am thinking is that if 
one moves from the premise that the mischief sought to be 
avoided by the regulation is possible interference or 
20 
impediment 
of 
the 
investigation 
being 
done 
by 
the 
Commission it may be that the publication of a full affidavit 
with all kinds of details might be more problematic 
compared to a publication of maybe a summary of what the 
response is.  That is what I am thinking, that maybe the 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 40 of 362 
 
publication of all the details in the affidavit might be more 
problematic 
in 
terms 
of 
whatever 
investigation 
the 
Commission must still do in relation to that affidavit 
compared to a summary.  That is what is in my mind. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   But, Chair, let me start by saying, 
the one thing Bain would not want to do is undermine 
workings of this Commission so the whole reason why it 
wrote the letter to you, Chair, was out of respect for the 
workings of the Commission.  So if, Chair, your view is that 
the mischief which Regulation 11(3)(a) is directed, if you 
10 
are of the view that it would produce the mischief that is 
sought to be averted if the entire Bain affidavit were to be 
released and, of course, Bain and Company would respect 
that.   
 
But, Chair, with respect, Bain and Company cannot 
be in a worse position than if it had not submitted an 
affidavit to this Commission.  So if Bain and Company have 
never submitted an affidavit to the Commission there would 
be nothing to prohibit it issuing anything it wanted into the 
public domain in response to what Mr Williams said and so, 
20 
with respect, Chair, it would be completely unfair for Bain 
and Company to be worse off because it has gone on 
affidavit to you than if it had never submitted an affidavit to 
you.   
 
And so, Chair, it does seem at a bare minimum that 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 41 of 362 
 
Bain must be able to do is to respond publicly if asked.  
The difficulty for Bain is, on your prima facie reading, 
Chair, on Regulation 11(3)(a) it cannot then – it cannot 
quote even a portion of its affidavit, it would have to give 
what is really a summary of that affidavit and I believe 
what you are positing to me, Chair, is well, would that not 
be enough as a matter of fairness to Bain?  And Chair, my 
response is again, with respect, it is certainly better than 
nothing.  With respect we would have thought it is simply 
much better for Bain and Company to say here is the 
10 
version on affidavit for Bain and Company to try and 
summarise what it said on affidavit. 
 
But I come back to my original response to your 
question, Chair, Bain and Company would respectfully ask 
for permission to release the entire affidavit.  If your view 
is that that would produce a mischief that the regulation is 
designed to prohibit then at a bare minimum Bain and 
Company would require your permission, Chair, to release 
a summary of that affidavit.   
It would release that to whoever it wishes to release 
20 
it to, it may be asked by a client, it might be asked by a 
media representative, we do not ask for the Commission to 
assist us in how we publish it, we simply do seek your 
permission that we may publish it in some or other form if 
we were to be asked. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 42 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you see, part of what I had looked at 
is what the effect would be if in every case where a 
witness is about to testify, those implicated by the witness 
are allowed to publish their affidavits in response.  It 
seems to me that we may as well not have this regulation/  
You know, as I see it, the regulation seeks to say – to lay 
down the norm, to say the norm is do not publish but the 
Chairperson is given the authority to depart from that norm 
and provide written permission and one would say there 
needs to be something special in order for the Chairperson 
10 
to authorise a departure from the norm because otherwise 
if there is nothing special and the Chairperson authorises a 
departure from the norm, tomorrow there is going to be 
another person who is implicated by tomorrow’s witness 
who says I also want to publish my affidavit in response, 
the following day another one and because there is nothing 
special that needs to be shown, then the publication 
becomes of affidavits of implicated persons when the 
witness testifying is – the witness implicating them is 
testing becomes the norm then you may as well not have 
20 
the regulation.  That seems to me that is something that I 
have to reflect on as well.  What do you say to that? 
 
And when I look at the letter, as I said, it does not 
seem to me that it pleads any special case, it simply says 
Mr Williams makes very serious allegations against Bain.  
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 43 of 362 
 
All kinds of witnesses come here every day and make 
serious allegations against people, you know, so I do not 
see anything that puts Bain’s case outside of the normal.  
What do you say about that approach? 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Yes.  No, thank you, Chair, I am 
grateful for the question.  Chair, we would accept that 
Regulation 11(3) has an escape valve which requires you 
to exercise your discretion on an ad hoc basis.  In other 
words, Chair, it contains the general prohibition but then 
says the Chairperson can give permission which release 
10 
the affected person from the ambit of the restraint. 
 
So, in our respectful submission, you would have to 
consider every case on an individual basis and consider 
whether an appropriate case has been made.   
 
If you were to give permission to Bain, Chair, I 
understand your concern to be but then what does the 
Chair do tomorrow or on Wednesday if another person 
applies?  With respect, the answer is you would be 
exercising your discretion on an individual basis and it 
have not precedential effect going forward. 
20 
 
So the case made out by Bain in the letter is simply 
this.  It has gone on affidavit, it does not know when that 
application is going to be heard and then very serious 
things 
are 
said 
by 
Mr 
Williams 
regarding 
Bain 
and 
Company.   
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 44 of 362 
 
Chair, I do hear what you say, you say well, very 
often serious things are said by implicated parties in your 
proceedings but, Chair, you would have to read Mr 
Williams’ 
affidavit 
carefully, 
consider 
that 
Bain 
and 
Company is still trading company, in other words it is a 
company which is still working with customers and you 
would then have to consider whether a proper case had 
been made out. 
And, Chair, may I also, with respect, suggest that 
the 
other 
thing 
that 
the 
Chair 
should 
take 
into 
10 
consideration 
is 
this. 
 
It 
would, 
in 
our 
respectful 
submission, be perverse if you were better off not filing an 
affidavit before the Commission in terms of responding to 
what someone were to say about you.  If you do not submit 
an affidavit to the Commission well there is nothing to stop 
you saying whatever you want when that person says 
things about you in proceedings before the Commission.   
Here what Bain and Company have done, entirely 
properly, is it read the affidavit of Mr Williams, it put up 
two affidavits in response.  It would be unfair for Bain to be 
20 
in a worse position because it has gone on affidavit and, 
with respect, that may well be one of the outcomes if the 
discretion were to be exercised in a way that is not 
favourable to Bain, Bain and Company would then have 
been in a better position by not going on affidavit and, with 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 45 of 362 
 
respect, that would not be a sensible outcome.  But Chair, 
I instructions 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, I hear your point about that and I 
will hear what Mr Franklin has to say about it.  It may well 
be that the approach – the approach is well, those who – 
those implicated parties who want to operate within the 
regulations will not go outside of the regulations, they will 
say if my case is no different from everyone else who gets 
implicated, that means I cannot apply for or I cannot get 
written permission for a departure from the norm but if my 
10 
case is special then I will apply and if the Chairperson is 
persuaded that my case is special, there will be a 
departure from the norm.   
 
And then, of course, there may be parties who 
decide to operate outside of the regulations and do their 
own thing, you know, and say well, we will just publish, you 
know, we will not submit affidavits and we will publish 
outside of the regulations or they might say well, we will 
publish first and then submit to the Commission because 
then if we do it that way, we are not in breach of the 
20 
regulation.  
 
So I am saying I hear the point you make but, of 
course, I think you also accept the difficulty of – the 
difficulty that the case made out for written permission 
must – there must be something special to say the least 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 46 of 362 
 
about the circumstances or the case because if it falls 
within the norm, the cases that have been here, it is simply 
says the witness has made serious allegations against me, 
allegations of impropriety, corruption and what, what, what, 
what, allegations of corruption and impropriety get made by 
witnesses in the Commission every day.  So if that is 
enough for me to authorise to provide written permission 
then I am going to have to provide it all the time and then 
we may as well not have the regulation but I do appreciate 
that that is a point I have made, I have put to you and you 
10 
have addressed it.  So maybe I should let you say what 
you might need to say before I allow Mr – whatever else 
you might need to say before I allow Mr Franklin to 
respond, if there is still anything you would like to say. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Chair, may I just make two points in 
response to what you have put to me.  The one is this, 
Chair, as I said earlier, the whole point of Bain and 
Company writing to you was in order to be respectful 
towards the workings of the Commission, so we are 
especially mindful when you put to us but the mischief at 
20 
which Regulation 11(3)(a) is directed may be undermined if 
parties were given licence to release their affidavits before 
the evidence is in fact given.  Chair, we hear what you say 
and we are respectful of that but may I simply say it is not 
obvious to us how the mischief would be undermined.   
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 47 of 362 
 
A party comes before you, a party submits an 
affidavit to you.  The party does not know when its 
application, in this case for leave to cross-examine, will be 
heard and does not know what the outcome would be.  
Chair, with respect, it is not obvious to us how the 
workings of the Commission would be undermined if that 
party were to be given leave to release its affidavit. 
And, Chair, it ties in with my second point.  It is 
about the time lag between when the evidence implicating 
the person is given and when in due course the subsequent 
10 
evidence is given. 
In this case, Chair, we simply do not know when 
Bain and Company’s application will be heard, we do not 
know what the outcome will be and if permission were to be 
given to cross-examine, we do not know when that cross-
examination is going to happen, but it could be a long 
delay, Chair, so when you say to me well, should there not 
be extraordinary circumstances for me, the Chair, to 
exercise my permission under Regulation 11(3)(a)? 
The other thing we would respectfully draw your 
20 
attention to is the uncertainty regarding how long it will 
take before Mr Williams’ is cross-examined, if he is ever 
cross-examined at all, Chair. 
But, Chair, those are the only two additional points I 
would make, I do believe that I have responded to all of 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 48 of 362 
 
the submissions – I have responded to all of your 
questions the best I can, Chair. 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, that is fine.  Let me say that 
Mr – or Bain’s application for leave to cross-examination 
Mr Williams can be dealt with.  What I do not know is 
whether all the affidavits are in, whether any responses 
and so on, but it can be dealt with – or yes, I think there 
are, there are, there is a response from Mr Athol – I can 
see that and I see it is towards the end.  I take it that if 
10 
there is no replying affidavit from Bain it means it has 
elected not to reply, is that correct, Mr Cockrell? 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Chair, with respect, it is too early.  
So we received Mr Williams’ affidavit, it was around about 
five o’clock on Friday, as I recall.  If my memory is playing 
up, Chair, my learned friend will correct me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   But my recollection was it was on 
Friday evening.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   And, Chair, we have not yet had an 
opportunity to study it and to make a decision regarding 
whether Bain and Company will be filing a replying 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 49 of 362 
 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   That [indistinct] 27.50 must be 
made, Chair, but my client has not had enough time to 
study the answering affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I want to say that – I wanted to say 
that the application could possibly be dealt with at some 
stage even this week so I think the sooner you make a 
decision whether you want to file a replying affidavit or not, 
the better.  But if it is not heard this week I am sure I can 
allocate time for it next week.  So that is one. 
 
Two, the undermining – I just mention it now – I 
10 
thought would be if I grant Bain’s application to publish the 
affidavit, its affidavit, when Mr Williams testifies or when 
he has finished and Bain’s case is not different from every 
other case, then the undermining would be that if I am to 
be consistent I would have then to grant written permission 
in every case that simply falls within the normal case under 
the regulations and that means the affidavits could be 
published in their entirety and, of course, if the idea that 
application of material submitted to the Commission for 
investigation may be prejudicial to the investigations of the 
20 
Commission, then once we have that regime then that 
undermines the work of the Commission, because then it is 
as if the regulation prohibiting application is not there.   
You understand? 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Sorry Chair, I do understand, and 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 50 of 362 
 
perhaps we are with respect – we are missing each other.  
I do understand the proposition you put to me, you say well 
if there is nothing special about that case wouldn’t I as the 
Chair have to give permission on all future occasions, and 
then you say wouldn’t that prejudice the workings of the 
Commission. 
And the only query I raised was Chair, even if that 
were correct, let us assume for the sake of argument that 
in most cases, you would then give written permission 
under the regulations given the VA.  It is not obvious to us 
10 
why that would prejudice the workings of the Commission 
because these are people who filed affidavits before you 
and all that they asking permission to do is to release into 
the public domain, what they have said on affidavits before 
you.  
And with respect Chair, the proposition that that 
would undermine the working of the Commission is not – 
Chair we fully understand if someone were to leak an 
affidavit that should not or has not been authorised there 
we fully understand that would indeed prejudice the 
20 
workings of the Commission, but what has happened here 
Chair it is the author of the affidavit is asking the 
Commission to release the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the disclosure of such information, 
while investigations are going on, could be prejudicial to 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 51 of 362 
 
the investigation, is it not?  The disclosure of information 
on matters that are still being investigated, could be 
prejudicial to the investigation, is it not? 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   With respect Chair, I can only say it 
is not obvious why that could be prejudicial because what 
is being disclosed is what the person has said on the 
affidavit, it is his or her evidence.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay thank you. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   And so Chair, the issue you are 
grappling with and may I just say as we do fully understand 
10 
why you are grappling with it.  You say, well, Regulation 
11(3)(a) gives me the Chair a wide discretion.  How do I 
exercise my discretion?  
And Chair, the one response, which I should give, 
which I think I submitted earlier but let me say it again, 
you may well take a different view where someone comes 
before you and ask for permission under Regulation 
11(3)(a) to release an affidavit or some other evidence that 
he or she is not the author of.  But Chair, in this case what 
makes the case extraordinary with respect is it is Bain and 
20 
Company saying, I want you to release my own affidavit 
and so Chair you say but then wouldn't I always have to 
give my permission under Regulation 11(3)(a).  Well it may 
well be where a party comes before you and says, I want to 
release my own affidavit.  
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 52 of 362 
 
But Chair, that would not say anything about the 
much more difficult case, which is where someone comes 
before you and says, I want permission to release some 
evidence of which I am not the author and then one 
approach that in a completely different way, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   The only submission we try to make 
and that we snapshotted is the concern you have that it 
may create a precedential effect where a party wants to 
release its own affidavit.  The concern is Chair you put to 
10 
me, 
would 
that 
not 
prejudice 
the 
workings 
of 
the 
Commission?  
And our response is, it is not obvious how it could 
prejudice the workings of the Commission because it is 
simply a version on affidavit by that person regarding what 
he or she did or what he or she says in response to 
someone else's affidavit.   
The version may turn out to be wrong or it may turn 
out to be wrong, with respect, if it is wrong, it is always 
going to be wrong, maybe releasing into the public may in 
20 
an affidavit that had turned out to be wrong are not going 
to prejudice the workings of the Commission in this 
submission. 
 
So 
Chair, 
before 
the 
tea 
adjournment 
Regulation 
11(3)(a) 
may 
not 
even 
apply 
on 
one 
interpretation, I put it no higher than that.   
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 53 of 362 
 
It may not even apply where a person seeks 
permission to release his or her own affidavit but if it does 
apply and what you put to me Chair, is that is your prima 
facie interpretation.  If it does apply, then in our respectful 
submission there would be no prejudicial consequence of 
this Chair saying, well, it does apply but I will take a more 
generous view when it comes to exercising my discretion 
under 11(3)(a).  
When you are the author of the affidavit, then if 
someone else comes before me seeking permission, in 
10 
other words, there would in effect be two categories.  One 
where you are the author of the affidavit, and the second 
category where you are the author of the affidavit and 
Chair, you may well approach those in completely separate 
ways.  
But the concern you have that it would undermine 
the workings of the Commission, if you were to have a 
general rule that you are prohibited from releasing your 
own affidavit in advance.  My respectful submission, it is 
not obvious to us how that would prejudice the workings of 
20 
the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, the other thing, which I almost 
forgot to raise with you is, I see that Bain in its 
application, while applying for leave to cross examine Mr 
William, did not apply for leave as I read it unless I have 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 54 of 362 
 
missed it, for leave to adduce evidence itself and subject 
itself to questioning by the Evidence Leaders and the 
Chairperson. 
 
Is 
there 
any 
particular 
reason 
why…[intervene] 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   That is not part of the...[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there any particular reason why? 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   That is not part of Bain’s 
application Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, why is that do you know, or is that 
something you have no instructions on?  You know, it is 
10 
important, that the…[intervene] 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   No, Chair I do not have any 
instructions on that I can only…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let me mention it to you, let me 
mention to you.  We have mentioned these, if Bain for 
example, had applied for leave to cross examine, you know 
for leave to adduce evidence of give evidence, it may well 
be that arrangements could have been made, that whoever 
was going to give evidence from Bain would have been 
accommodated this week.  
20 
So that Bain could, within a few days of Mr Williams 
giving evidence have the opportunity of also putting up its 
side of the story before the hearing that is a possibility.  
But also, if somebody wishes to cross examine, whoever 
implicates them it may well be that is the right thing for 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 55 of 362 
 
them 
to 
subject 
themselves 
to 
questioning 
by 
the 
Commission.  
So I mentioned that, simply because I noticed that 
there is only an application for leave to cross examine but 
also, I must mention to you that something has crossed my 
mind with regard to Bain in relation to the Nugent 
Commission.   
I have not gone back to that report for some time 
but the Nugent Report, Nugent Commission Report, but I 
did read it at a certain stage and I recall that, if I recall 
10 
correctly, somebody who was testifying on behalf of Bain 
did 
not 
complete 
his 
evidence 
before 
the 
Nugent 
Commission, and the reason that was apparently advanced, 
was that he was sick or something I cannot remember. But 
my recollection is that Judge Nugent did not seem to buy 
that story.  
And I certainly left with the impression after reading 
the reports that Bain had decided not to cooperate with the 
Nugent Commission, and not to complete its evidence and 
subject itself to questioning in the Commission.  Now, 
20 
when I see that it does not apply, or leave to adduce 
evidence in this Commission, but applies for leave to cross 
examine, Mr. Williams, I wonder whether they are prepared 
to submit themselves to questioning by this Commission, or 
whether they just want to cross examine, and make written 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 56 of 362 
 
submissions, and not subject themselves to questioning by 
this Commission.  You might not be able to say anything 
about this, but I am just raising it with you because it has 
crossed my mind. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Well Chair, those are all very 
important questions, and let me respond to them and let 
me tell you what is on the record.  So when you asked me 
what is the reason for something not being in the Bain 
application that is obviously not something that I can deal 
with.  I can only tell you what is in the application.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   And ask for leave to cross examine 
it, and ask for leave to make submissions.  It does not 
seek the to give evidence before this Commission. 
Chair number two, on the record that point has been 
taken by Mr Williams in the affidavit he filed on Friday.  I 
think I am summarising it, sturdy enough when I say that is 
one of the point taken by Mr Williams.  He says: 
“Well, Bain and Company should not be entitled to 
cross examine him if they are not tendering a 
20 
witness.” 
Now Chair, that is a fight for another occasion, we will 
have to have that fight when we move our application for 
leave to cross examine in due course.  What I do tell you is 
that at the moment, that is not part of the Bain and 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 57 of 362 
 
Company application.  Chair, what you refer to in the 
report of the Nugent inquiry I believe that is Mr Massone.  
Chair, Mr Massone was said at Mr Williams in his 
statement, as I understand it Chair, Mr Massone is 
separately 
represented 
because 
he 
is 
no 
longer 
an 
employee of Bain and Company.  
 
And so my understanding and if I am wrong, I am 
sure one of my learned friends will correct me in due 
course, 
but 
my 
understanding 
is 
he 
is 
separately 
represented.  Certainly I do not hold a brief for Mr 
10 
Massone Chair, I hold the brief for Bain and Companies 
South Africa and they no longer employ Mr Massone.  
So Chair, the evidence you referred to before 
Nugent and the finding of Judge Nugent that Bain and 
Company 
did 
not 
cooperate 
fully. 
 
That 
indeed, 
is 
something referred to by Mr Williams in his affidavit and it 
is also referred to in the affidavit by Mr Min that serves 
before you Chair, there is a version in Mr Min’s affidavit in 
response to that.  
But Chair where all of this goes is the point you put 
20 
to me is, does Bain and Company seek leave to give 
evidence before you?  And the answer is no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then the next question is, is it 
prepared to submit itself to questioning by the Commission, 
if the Commission wants them to do that? 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 58 of 362 
 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   Well Chair, that is something I 
would have to take instructions on.  I am just not in the 
position to answer that question.  I fully understand the 
point of the question but Chair for today, I am not in a 
position to give an answer to that question.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is fair enough. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:   That is something my client would 
have to consider and I would be happy to ask them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, that is fair enough.  Mr 
Franklin, maybe I should take the tea break and then let 
10 
you address me after that. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   As you please, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we are 26 minutes past 11, we will 
resume at 25 to 12.  
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  I realised Mr Franklin that we have taken 
much longer than I think we all thought we would with this 
20 
application. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it does raise some important issues, 
so okay, alright.  Let me allow you to address. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Yes Chair, I was asked whether Mr 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 59 of 362 
 
Cockrell might take an opportunity to raise the point of 
clarification with the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  So if I may hand back to him before I 
reply? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Alright.  Yes, Mr Cockrell. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair, thank 
you to you and I have noted my learned friend.  Chair, let 
me see if I can perhaps expedite this.  Chair, in response 
to your question could my client live with a summary rather 
10 
than publishing the full affidavit?   
 
The response I gave to you is in some ways that 
might make my client’s life more difficult, because he 
would have to get a summary that does not reproduce parts 
of the affidavit, but having said that Chair, I have taken an 
instruction during the adjournment and my client’s attitude 
now is it does indeed ask for permission to publish a 
summary of the affidavit.  
 
It no longer applies for permission to publish the 
full affidavit and Chair, I said repeatedly in my address to 
20 
you, my client would not want to do anything that is 
undermining 
of 
the 
work 
of 
this 
commission. 
 
The 
proposition you put to me is it may undermine the work of 
the commission if the full affidavit were to be published in 
these circumstances, and that is why my client now simply 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 60 of 362 
 
seek your permission to publish a summary of the affidavit 
and not the full affidavit Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright thank you.  Mr Franklin? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you Chair, if I may respond 
briefly to the two topics that have been addressed by my 
learned 
friend. 
 
The 
first 
concerns 
the 
question 
of 
privilege.  As he made clear we no longer seek a ruling in 
that regard and because of the accommodation that has 
been reached, but Bain has none the less placed on record 
that it does still assert privilege over the identified 
10 
documents.  
 
If I may briefly respond to that, simply to put on 
record for purposes of the commission a denial that there 
is in fact privilege that attaches to any of those documents, 
as the evidence will reveal Mr Williams was appointed in a 
special 
role 
to 
oversee 
an 
investigation 
which 
Bain 
initiated into its own conduct, and the repeated refrain was 
that it wished to play open cards, reveal the truth and do 
right for South Africa.  
 
So we do not understand how it can simultaneously 
20 
make that assertion and then when it comes to revealing 
documents which are the product of that investigation, to 
claim privilege over them.  In any event all of the 
documents that are sought to be introduced were given to 
Mr Williams pursuant to his mandate.

So we simply place that on record, that in our view 
there is no proper claim of privilege.  Secondly, in relation 
to the letter and the request that Bain be given permission 
to publish its affidavits or now it seems a summary and for 
the purposes of record, may I just identify the Bain letter 
from Baker McKenzie, dated 26 November 2020. 
 
It is found in SARS Bundle 02, Exhibit WW5, which 
is the correspondence bundle at page 93.  Our submission 
is this.  Regulation 11(3)A we would submit does deal with 
this situation.  It regulates this situation.  It says that no 
10 
person 
shall 
without 
the 
written 
permission 
of 
the 
Chairperson disseminate any documents submitted to the 
commission by any person in connection with the inquiry or 
publish the contents or any portion of the contents of such 
document.  
 
That with respect covers the situation that Bain 
finds itself in, where it has brought an application to cross-
examine, and it has in support of that, attached a number 
of affidavits.  So we would submit that with respect, the 
Chair ’s prima facie view is correct that Regulation 33A 
20 
governs the situation. 
 
The upshot of that is of course that it is within the 
Chair ’s discretion to grant the permission which has been 
sought or not and we would submit that there are a number 
of compelling reasons why that permission should be 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 62 of 362 
 
refused.  
 
The first is that the mandate of the commission is of 
course to investigate matters of public and national 
interest concerning allegations of State Capture corruption 
and fraud.  So by its very nature, that is the subject matter 
of the evidence which the Chair has heard for months on 
end.  
 
But there is nothing particularly unique about the 
evidence that is being introduced which implicates Bain.  
Secondly, we would submit that granting the request would 
10 
result in Bain not being treated equally with other parties 
who have been implicated in matters placed before the 
commission. 
 
That 
is 
a 
central 
feature 
which 
we 
ask 
the 
commission to take into account, and what would happen 
we would submit, is that one would have a situation where 
all 2700 I am told is the number, implicated persons would 
then regard themselves as also entitled to ask the same 
relief and if one looks at the Bain situation, there is 
nothing unique in the grounds that are set out in its letter.  
20 
 
All it asks for is a right to publish in order for it to 
be treated fairly.  Every implicated person could mount 
exactly the same argument and so one has a difficulty in 
granting 
what 
should 
be 
an 
exceptional 
remedy 
in 
circumstances 
where 
the 
circumstances 
are 
not 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 63 of 362 
 
exceptional.  
 
Secondly we would submit that publication of the 
affidavits would defeat the purpose of its application to 
cross-examine Mr Williams in any event, and it is perfectly 
entitled to publicise if it so wishes in answer to any query 
that might be raised. 
 
Yes, we have heard the evidence given by Mr 
Williams, but we want to let you know that we have applied 
to the Chairperson to cross-examine and his evidence will 
be tested in due course if we are granted permission.  That 
10 
is a perfectly adequate safeguard for addressing the 
concern which they have.  
 
Really it comes down to this Chair, my learned 
friend articulates why there is a difficulty for Bain not to 
get permission and my answer to that is that the difficulty 
is faced by everyone for permission equally, and so we 
would submit that the upshot is that practically one would 
need to depart from the norm in all cases, because these 
facts are not unique.   
We also with respect believe that the point raised 
20 
by the Chair is very significant, because what Bain wants 
is to blunt the import of Mr William’s testimony with 
affidavits of its own in circumstances where it is not 
prepared to put up any witness who will himself or herself 
be subjected to cross-examination. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 64 of 362 
 
That is a case of having one’s cake and eating it 
and where fairness is called an aid, we would submit that it 
would be blatantly unfair for that situation to be allowed.  
My learned friends have said that a summary would suffice 
and as I understand it, it would be a publication of a 
summary of the contents of the affidavits which currently 
serve before the commission as part of Bain’s application.  
That via media whilst it may sound attractive, we 
submit falls fowl of precisely the same considerations 
which I have set out, because all it is is a shorter version 
10 
of the evidence which is sought to be put up, and for the 
same reasons that I have articulated, we would submit that 
that would be inappropriate.  
So the principle is either permission is granted or 
not, it does not ameliorate the factors which I have 
outlined in opposition to the grant of the permission by 
saying we are content with a shorter summary.  So in 
conclusion on this, we submit that Bain is attempting to 
secure for itself a right which no other party has sought or 
being granted.  That there is certainly no proper basis 
20 
upon which the Chair can grant that permission and we 
would ask that the Chair refuse the permission.  
Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Mr Cockrell, do you want to 
respond to that?   
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 65 of 362 
 
ADV COCKRELL SC:  Chair, let me respond very briefly.  
My learned friend [indistinct – 00:10:36] submission he 
says that Bain will not be treated equally because other 
implicated parties as I understood it have not applied to be 
placed in the same position. 
 
Chair, I [indistinct – 00:10:50] through your website 
this morning.  I am not aware of any implicated party who 
would sought permission under Regulation 11(3)A.  So with 
respect, the fact that Bain is the first party to do so, is a 
point in its favour.  
10 
 
So with respect Chair, we simply do not understand 
the submission that Bain is seeking to be treated in a more 
favourable way than other parties.  The bottom line is that 
Bain is the only party who has sought your permission 
under Regulation 11(3)A and that should count in its favour 
and not against it.  
 
My learned friend then said that if Bain were to be 
granted permission under Regulation 11(3)A, it would 
defeat the purpose of the application to cross-examine Mr 
Williams.  With respect Chair, we simply do not understand 
20 
the submission.   
 
There 
is 
an 
application 
to 
cross-examine 
Mr 
Williams, that will be heard in due course.  some of the 
issues you raise with me Chair and they become of some 
importance in that debate, but all that Bain is seeking 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 66 of 362 
 
permission to do now, is to release a summary of the 
affidavit that is placed before you, and how that would 
defeat the purpose of the application to cross-examine is 
simply not apparent to us.  
 
Chair, as regards to the summary, my learned friend 
says well, that is objectionable for the same reasons as 
the full affidavit.  Again Chair, with respect to my learned 
friend, we simply do not understand the submission.  The 
one thing you have not heard a word of from my learned 
friend, Mr Franklin, is how would it undermine the workings 
10 
of the commission if Bain & Company were to be given 
permission by you to release the summary of its affidavit.  
 
I want to focus on that because that was the full 
[indistinct – 00:12:32] of the debate you and I had earlier, 
and your concern was that releasing the full affidavit may 
undermine the work of the commission, and now the debate 
is would releasing a summary undermine the work of the 
commission. 
 
We listened closely to our learned friend.  We did 
not understand there to be a single submission regarding 
20 
why the work of the commission would be undermined.  
Chair, with respect it is completely counter intuitive, 
because what in effect you would be saying to an 
implicated 
party 
is 
when 
you 
are 
implicated 
in 
the 
evidence, you cannot even refer to the affidavit you have 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 67 of 362 
 
placed before the commission. 
 
You cannot refer to it by way of a ...[indistinct] 
summary.  You cannot refer to it by way of a full summary.  
In effect if you were asked to give comment, there is 
nothing you can say because any answer you give is likely 
to anticipate what you have said on affidavit.  
 
My learned friend says well, you can simply say we 
have applied for leave to cross-examine, but that is no 
answer at all Chair.  So with respect Chair, it does seem to 
us that the critical issue for you Chair, would be in what 
10 
meaningful way would it undermine the work of this 
commission if Bain & Company were given permission 
under Regulation 11(3)A to publish a summary of the two 
affidavits if it is placed before you. 
 
Chair, I do not know if you have had a chance to 
read those affidavits.  May I say they are very full 
affidavits and say for example the debate you and I had 
Chair, about what Judge Nugent found regarding Mr 
Massone, that is a topic dealt with in one of the affidavits.   
 
The two very lengthy affidavits would not be 
20 
published in their full form in the amended version of what 
Bain & Company now seeks.  All they ask for is permission 
to publish a summary and with respect Chair, it would be 
entirely unfair not to grant that permission to Bain & 
Company because in effect you would be muzzling that.  
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 68 of 362 
 
 
You would be muzzling them until some unidentified 
future time, even when Mr Williams has given his evidence, 
and so with respect Chair we would continue to ask for the 
relief in the attenuated form in which my client now asks 
for it.  
 
All it asks for is your permission under Regulation 
11(3)A, to publish a summary of the two affidavits it has 
submitted before you and Chair, with the greatest of 
respect to our learned friend, there is no meaningful 
answer to why that permission should not be given.  
10 
 
On the contrary it would be extraordinary if the 
permission were to be refused because it would create a 
most bizarre outcome where an implicated person is unable 
to say anything about his or her version.  So with respect 
Chair, 
we 
would 
continue 
to 
ask 
for 
that 
relief 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV COCKRELL SC:  In modified form, in which I have 
explained it.  Thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I wonder whether there would be any 
20 
merits in looking at the possible interpretations of the 
regulation and seeing whether one of them places less 
restrictions on an individual’s right compared to another 
one, and whether there may be an ... whether the correct 
interpretation may well be one, whether it may well be one 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 69 of 362 
 
which allows that. 
 
Now I am going back.  I know we have dealt with 
this earlier to say which is the correct interpretation.  In 
terms of the one interpretation it was my, the one I was 
inclined, towards which I was inclined was to say the 
regulation means anybody.  
 
Nobody is permitted, including a deponent to an 
affidavit, to publish a document that has been submitted to 
the commission without the written permission of the 
Chairperson.  The other one being well, if it is your ... if it 
10 
is your deponent, if it is your affidavit, maybe the 
regulation does not cover that.  
 
It is only if you seek to publish somebody else’s 
document or another document, or but of course there was 
the issue that I raised to say we need to look at what 
mischief was sought to be prevented from happening.  So 
that there is that, but you made the point that whichever 
interpretation you believe you should apply for leave and 
that is why you, that is the approach you have adopted.  
 
Do you want to say anything on this?   
20 
ADV COCKRELL SC:  I just want to make this submission 
Chair.  Even if the interpretation were to be adopted which 
says Regulation 11(3)A does not stop Bain from publishing 
its own affidavit, the difficulty Bain would still have is the 
Bain affidavit referred to Mr William’s application.  
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 70 of 362 
 
 
That is why I said on any version we would require 
your permission.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV COCKRELL SC:  In other words, even if [indistinct – 
00:18:35] adopted, there would still be a problem because 
Bain [indistinct – 00:18:41] to Mr William’s affidavit.  That 
is the point I am making.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess one of the serious difficulties is 
simply that there seems to be nothing special in Bain’s 
circumstances 
compared 
to 
the 
norm, 
but 
you 
have 
10 
addressed that, we have dealt with that.  Let me hear Mr 
Franklin ...[intervenes]  
ADV COCKRELL SC:  May I quickly ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you want to say something on that? 
ADV COCKRELL SC:  It is difficult for me because I have 
had some involvement with the commission over the years, 
but I do not speak in the way in which you function.  So I 
simply do not know the applications you have had before 
you, but may I simply say the applications by Bain & 
Company contains two very substantial affidavits.  
20 
 
So I do not know Chair, whether that is the norm of 
the sorts of affidavits we have before you, but I would be 
surprised quite frankly if any other applications before you 
had affidavits of that length.  So if you say what is different 
about the Bain affidavits, or the Bain application. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 71 of 362 
 
 
Bain & Company put two affidavits before you 
containing a detailed narrative.  It says I want permission, 
I want your leave to cross-examine.  The difficulty Chair is 
unless the permission were to be given to Bain to publish a 
summary of those two affidavits, it would be very difficult 
for it to say anything meaningful.  
 
If it were asked by a media representative or by a 
client what is your response to Mr William’s evidence.  
That is so unfair Chair.  So when you say what is special 
about Bain, we would say firstly would you have regard to 
10 
the length of the affidavit, and the level of detail in that, 
and then secondly would you consider the position of Bain 
if it works by [indistinct – 00:20:46] what answer could they 
give, unless they were given your permission in order to 
publish a summary of that few very detailed affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Franklin, do you want to deal 
with the issue I raised, and I just want to also say to a 
certain 
extent 
is 
it 
not 
correct 
that 
there 
is 
some 
unfairness or there may be some unfairness if somebody 
raise all kinds of things about you and you are not able to 
20 
respond and put your side of the story. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Yes, thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And if there is or may be unfairness, the 
next question may be whether that is the unfairness that 
attaches to the regulations as they stand and as long as 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 72 of 362 
 
they stand that is it, as opposed to any unfairness that 
might arise from a decision under those regulations.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Yes, thank you Chair.  Just on the 
first issue, the question of the proper interpretation of 3A, 
as we see it, the phrase any person should be given its 
ordinary English meaning and it must cover any person.  
That would include Bain within its purview.  
 
That must be clear.  If that is so, then you are given 
a discretion as Chair to give permission or not, so we are 
back to where we were.  As far as the potential for 
10 
unfairness which you have raised is concerned, we submit 
that there is none, because of the scheme of the rules and 
the regulation with which the Chair is very familiar.  
 
It runs along these lines.  The commission calls a 
witness.  If the witness implicates parties A, B and C in 
wrongdoing, then the commission is required to use a Rule 
33 notice to those implicated persons.  They are then put 
on notice that allegations of impropriety have been levelled 
against them.  
 
If they fall into that category, they are then 
20 
accorded certain rights.  Those rights are to apply for 
cross-examination of the accuser and or to apply to lead 
evidence themselves or present evidence themselves.  So 
that addresses the audi ulterim partem issue.  
 
It addresses a situation which would otherwise be 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 73 of 362 
 
unfair, where an accuser is entitled to say what he or she 
likes about a person with impunity.  They have to 
understand that if they implicate somebody, they may be 
cross-examined by that person on the evidence which was 
put forward, and also that person may be allowed by the 
commission to him or herself give evidence.  
 
That scheme is perfectly fair.  It accords the usual 
rights which we all understand in the legal practice.  We 
would submit there is no room for a via media, and 
especially one in respect of a party who has seen fit not to 
10 
present evidence himself or herself, and more importantly 
to subject themselves to cross-examination. 
 
What Bain wants, is to try to blunt the testimony of 
Mr Williams, by way of publishing of affidavits, without 
simultaneously 
asking 
for 
the 
deponents 
to 
those 
affidavits, come before this commission to give that 
evidence and to be cross-examined.  
 
That is unfair.  So we would submit in answer to the 
points raised by the Chair, that the construct of the rules is 
perfectly fair.  It builds in the safe cards that and one 
20 
would want to see, and what is being asked for here is not 
something which would be granted, because there are 
adequate rights which exist for Bain in any event, and we 
would also contend that it would be a not a salutatory 
practice 
for 
implicated 
parties 
to 
adopt 
this 
same 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 74 of 362 
 
procedure.  
 
So we certainly do persist with the opposition to the 
publication.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So just to summarise your points or your 
approach.  You say the commission operates within the 
framework of obviously the constitution, the Commission’s 
Act, the regulations and the rules and you say that 
framework makes provision for fairness to happen in a 
certain way, and that means if you are implicated by a 
witness you get even a Rule 33 notice.   
10 
 
That is part of the [indistinct – 00:26:26] rule and 
that is part of fairness.  You are then given an opportunity 
to apply for leave to adduce evidence, to cross-examine 
and to call any other witness you wish to call so as to put 
your side of the story.  
 
That frame work may well mean when one reads the 
relevant 
regulation 
and 
other 
parts 
of, 
and 
other 
regulations, may well mean that your side of the story you 
are not able to tell your side of the story at the time that 
you would prefer.  
20 
 
But you will be given a chance to tell your story.  
Particularly if you wish to, me and you, comply with the 
regulations and the rules.  In other words you apply for 
leave to adduce your evidence and if you want leave to 
cross-examine, you get it through that.  
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 75 of 362 
 
 
You will get that chance and unless your case is 
exceptional, there is no ground to seek to find fairness 
outside of that frame work.  
ADV 
FRANKLIN 
SC: 
 
With 
respect 
the 
Chair 
has 
summarised my points more than adequately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  No, thank you.  Mr Cockrell, do 
you ... what you wanted if I were to grant you leave or the 
written permission would be, would be for your client to 
publish the summary at least at the same time as when Mr 
William’s affidavit gets made public by the commission.  
10 
 
Is that right?  Or did you want to publish it while Mr 
Williams was still continuing with his evidence?  I did not 
think it would be the latter. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:  Chair, in the letter to you, Chair the 
letter to you seeks permission to publish what would now 
be a summary at the moment when Mr Williams commences 
his evidence.  Chair, if you would regard that as being 
prejudicial you would then fix a more appropriate time 
frame at which my client can release the summary.  
 
In other words if you wish it to be later on, we 
20 
would be in your hands in that regard, but the letter seeks 
permission to publish what would now be a summary at the 
time when Mr Williams commences his evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, part of the reason why I was asking 
is that I was thinking that maybe I could give my decision 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 76 of 362 
 
tomorrow morning?  I think Mr Williams is likely to take the 
whole day, we already have taken half a day.  Would that 
be fine with you?   
ADV COCKRELL SC:  I need to take - I am reluctant to say 
it would be fine with me because I would need to take an 
instruction in that regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:  If you could just bear with me for a 
few seconds.  May I just take an instruction?  Chair I am 
sitting in Cape Town I apologise and my attorney is in 
10 
Johannesburg. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright where – are we going to 
need to adjourn for you to take instructions or not? 
ADV COCKRELL SC:  No – no there should be no need 
Chair if you could just bear with me for a few… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:  If you can just bear with me for a 
minute or two Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV COCKRELL SC:  Chair thank you for the indulgence 
Chair.  My instruction is if the Chair – if the Chair is able 
to rule on that tomorrow that would be acceptable to my 
client.   
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 77 of 362 
 
 
Chair may I simply say this so that the point is not 
lost in the wash.  The submission made by the commission 
with respect to them is really quite extraordinary because 
if you consider what it means assume my client in due 
course is refused leave to cross-examine well on the 
commission’s logic it means my client can never release its 
affidavit and in fact can never even release a summary of 
its affidavit.  In other words will never be able to give its 
version in response to Mr Williams in the public domain. 
 
It is a most astonishing contention but that is the 
10 
logic of what the commission is saying to you.  Now say 
there is a period during which my client can say nothing 
that period may come to an end but if it does not come to 
an end my client is in effect 00:02:32 in perpetuity.   
 
Well Chair it is a most extraordinary proposition and 
Chair what you said at the commencement of the address 
after the adjournment is well would one not have to 
consider the different competing rights that are relevant 
when one interprets Regulation 11(3)(a).  Well Chair the 
right to freedom of expression is the only response that is 
20 
relevant because this is my client with its version.  Its 
version happens to be one he has put in affidavit before 
you.  What the commission is saying is for a period of time 
and potentially in perpetuity my client cannot give its 
version in the public domain.  Well with respect Chair that 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 78 of 362 
 
is an extraordinary attitude to be taking and we submit that 
it is not the submission that has any merit whatsoever.   
 
But Chair subject to all of that Chair we would – we 
would respectfully ask you to rule on that and we 
understand that you will rule on that tomorrow morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV COCKRELL SC:  Thank you Chari. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no I will do that tomorrow morning 
but I have given you this further bite at the cherry I just 
wonder whether Mr Franklin wants to say something about 
10 
this last point that you have emphasised. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Chair I have made my submissions 
with respect that is the construct of the rules and no doubt 
it contemplates that an appropriate decision will be made 
in relation to the requests for leave to cross-examine or to 
present evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright.  Then I – I will give my 
decision tomorrow morning.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  As it pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Are you ready to call Mr 
20 
Williams or you need a few minutes to… 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  No we would – we would wish to call 
him if we could. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Let us do that ja.  You may 
administer the oath or affirmation. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 79 of 362 
 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR WILLIAMS:  Athol Williams 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to making the 
prescribed affirmation? 
MR WILLIAMS:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you – sorry – do you affirm that the 
evidence you will give will be the truth; the whole truth and 
nothing but the truth; if so please raise your right hand and 
say, I truly affirm. 
MR WILLIAMS:  I truly affirm. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Williams for 
availing yourself to come and assist the commission. 
MR WILLIAMS:  Thank you Chair.     
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Mr Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Good morning Mr 
Williams. 
MR WILLIAMS:  Morning. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  You have a bundle before you which 
is marked SARS Bundle 01.  You have that? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct I do. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Please turn to the paginated page on 
the left hand side that is SARS 01-011 – page 11.  You 
have that? 
MR WILLIAMS:  I am there. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  You see that is a start of an affidavit 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 80 of 362 
 
in your name please turn to page 119 of the same bundle.   
MR WILLIAMS:  I have got it. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  You see that there is a date 20 
August 2020 and a signature, can you confirm that this 
document from page 11 to page 110 of SARS 01 is an 
affidavit attested to you by – by you on the 20 August 
202o0? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair I did. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And can you confirm the truth and 
accuracy of that affidavit? 
10 
MR WILLIAMS:  I can yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you Chair I would ask that the 
affidavit be admitted as Exhibit WW1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit of Mr Athol Williams which 
starts at page 11 will be admitted as an exhibit together 
with its annexures and will be marked as Exhibit WW1. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  As you please Chair.  Mr Williams I 
intend to take you to various parts of this affidavit and its 
annexures and we shall do so topic by topic.  I will ask you 
to answer my questions in relation to specific issues which 
20 
are put before you.  If we could start please with your 
qualifications 
and 
experience. 
 
You 
deal 
with 
it 
at 
paragraph 14 page 17 of the affidavit.  In each instance I 
am referring to the page number in SARS Bundle 01 and if 
I change bundle I will of course tell you.  Please go to 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 81 of 362 
 
paragraph 14. You have that? 
MR WILLIAMS:  I am there. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And can you confirm that you have a 
Bachelor ’s Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Wits 
University, 
a 
Master ’s 
MBA 
from 
the 
Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, a Master ’s Degree MSC in Finance 
from the London Business School, a Master ’s Degree MPA 
from Harvard University in the United States, a Master ’s 
Degree MSC in Political Theory from the London School of 
Economics. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Franklin what – from what 
page are you reading? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  At page 17. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 17. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Paragraph 14 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. Yes okay thank you. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you.  I was busy outlining the 
various degrees that Mr Williams has.  The penultimate one 
is a Master ’s Degree MPHIL in Political Theory from Oxford 
University.  You confirm that that is correct? 
20 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And is it correct that you are 
presently busy with a Doctorate Degree which is a DPhil 
from Oxford University as well? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 82 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  How many Master ’s Degrees have you 
got Mr Williams?   Is it four or five? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Five. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Shew. 
MR WILLIAMS:  I clearly need more hobbies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is – that is very commendable.  
That is very commendable.  Yes. 
MR WILLIAMS:  I think – and I think that is relevant to part 
of the role I was called to play at the Bain was – blow my 
back and was in business. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WILLIAMS:  First three degrees qualified me in 
business, the last three in ethics. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WILLIAMS:  Five degrees in corporate ethics. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WILLIAMS:  So I basically retrained myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WILLIAMS:  Midway through. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Then if I could deal briefly with your 
career at Bain we are of course interested in the latter part 
but would you look at paragraph 21 on page 18.   
MR WILLIAMS:  Yes I am there. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 83 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must just say on a light note Mr 
Williams that you cannot have so many Master ’s Degrees 
and not complete the Doctorate so you have to complete 
the Doctorate. 
MR WILLIAMS:  I am trying Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Mr Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you Chair.  If I could run 
through this which I doubt will be controversial.  You first 
joined Bain in 20 – in 1995 as a Summer Associate or 
intern as is generally known.  Is that correct? 
10 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And then thereafter you had three 
periods of full time employment.  1996 to 1997 in Boston.  
1999 to 2001 in London and Boston with extended periods 
in New York and then 2009 to 2010 in Johannesburg. 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Is that correct?  Let us jump forward 
to your time in Johannesburg which you deal with in 
paragraph 24 page 19 of the statement.  You joined Bain 
as a partner in September 2009 in Johannesburg after they 
20 
approached you with an offer.  They were restarting their 
South African operation after having left the country in 
2002.  Then could you just explain please when you worked 
for 
that 
period 
September 
2009 
up 
to 
2010 
in 
Johannesburg what was the setup at that office?  Who was 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 84 of 362 
 
in charge and who were your colleagues? 
MR WILLIAMS:  So when it started in late 2009 there were 
very few of us.  There were two partners and one part-time 
partner and the idea was we were going to need to have a 
managing partner, the boss essentially.  And so for 2009 
we kind of just got the office going a bit but in early 2010 
the managing partner arrived and this was Mr Vittorio 
Massone.  So he arrived from Italy as the Head of the 
South African business. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  But Mr Massone, M-a-s-s-o-n-e. 
10 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  He is the man who gave testimony 
before the Nugent Commission? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Alright.  Was there also a Mr 
Moolman at the office at that time? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct.  So myself and Mr 
Moolman were the two South African partners and then Mr 
Massone came he was the third partner then. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Right in paragraph 25 you have set 
20 
out certain concerns which you had at that time regarding 
Mr Massone.  Could you summarise them for the Chair? 
MR WILLIAMS:  So Chair very early on in 2010 after Mr 
Massone arrived in fact myself, Mr Moolman and some of 
the other senior people in the office began to be concerned 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 85 of 362 
 
about the way Mr Massone was behaving towards clients, 
the way he was interacting with other people. 
 
Concerned enough that we contacted – myself and 
Mr Moolman contacted the London office – the South 
African office at that point reporting to London.  We were 
so concerned about whether this person Mr Massone was 
the appropriate person to be the business based on his 
behaviour that we contacted the London office and asked 
them to come and investigate what was happening in South 
Africa. 
10 
 
And some of the things that were happening was – 
where I personally doubted Mr Massone’s ethics.  I 
doubted whether he was honest, I doubted whether we 
could trust what he was saying.  I got to a point where one 
of my clients said to me if you bring that person along 
again Athol we will not speak to you.  Mr Massone was 
shouting at people in the office.   
 
And so we did not feel you know as the evidence 
leader suggested I – my career with Bain started in 1995 
so as a career Bain Consultant I knew the culture vain Bain 
20 
fostered and the way we interacted with our clients and our 
people.  And we did not feel that Mr Massone represented 
that. 
 
So we asked the head of the London office to come 
and investigate.  He then came to Johannesburg and we 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 86 of 362 
 
were convinced that Mr Massone was going to be relieved 
of his duties but he was not.  And so the way we 
interpreted that was it was Bain Global basically endorsing 
Mr Massone’s behaviour. We had told him – we had told 
him our concerns, they still kept in that position so much 
so they 00:15:01 after that I chose to leave the business 
on those grounds. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Right and you went to London as you 
have said for a short while.  You returned in 2010 Mr 
Massone was still in charge of the office. 
10 
MR WILLIAMS:  Ja. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  You then resigned in 2010 and you 
took on a role of senior advisor on ad hoc basis? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Alright.  You worked then in 
permanent employ of Bain for the period from 2010 until 
2018. 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct.  I was not a permanent 
employee ever again from 2010. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Alright.  Then if we could go ahead to 
20 
2018.  You were aware that the Nugent Commission of 
Inquiry as we call it colloquially was set up in 2018 and 
took evidence from various parties including Mr Massone.  
You heard the testimony that was given by Mr Massone? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 87 of 362 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  What was your reaction to it and 
what did you do about it? 
MR WILLIAMS:  I was shocked to hear Mr Massone’s 
evidence Chair.  In a way given my concerns back in 2010 
already hearing – hearing the allegations against Bain and 
hearing Mr Massone’s evidence did not surprise me in a 
way.   
 
In fact it was you know my worst fears coming 
through because I suspected that he probably was not 
going to be an ethical leader.  I left the business, was not 
10 
part of the business and here eight years later I saw a 
manifestation or heard a manifestation of my earliest 
concerns. 
 
Upon hearing his testimony I did not get two things.  
The one was I wrote an email to Mr Massone’s boss 
effectively who I had not met but I knew who he was and 
expressed my disappointment as a former Bain partner, 
someone who was still proudly associated with Bain that 
we had raised the concerns in 2010 they are now 
materialising in a very negative and damaging way. 
20 
 
So I expressed my disappointment.  I basically said 
in many ways we are not surprised but then I did offer my 
support still as a loyal Bain person of long standing that if 
there was a way I could help Bain through this crisis I 
would. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 88 of 362 
 
 
The 
second 
thing 
I 
did 
was 
to 
contact 
an 
investigative 
journalist 
because 
I 
saw 
there 
was 
a 
journalist writing quite a bit about the Nugent Commission 
and so I offered as a Bain partner – former Bain partner 
that if I could be of any assistance I would offer that 
assistance. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Right.  Could I ask you to look at 
Annexure AW7 which is at page 135.   
MR WILLIAMS:  I have got it. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  That is an email which you sent to Mr 
10 
Moolman dated the 6 t h of September 2018 is it correct that 
you set out there some suggestions as regards to the role 
that you might play? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair.  I had – Mr 
Massone’s evidence to the Nugent Commission ended at 
the end of August 2018.  A few days after that Mr Moolman 
had sent an email to all ex Bain employees.  So Bain 
alumni I was included in that.  So I got this email from Mr 
Moolman saying that they are dealing with this crisis. 
 
I did not reply to Mr Moolman with my same 
20 
disappointment I had expressed to Mr – Mr Massone’s boss 
saying this is just unacceptable.  Mr Moolman had called 
me and we had a phone call – in fact I think we might have 
had two phone calls.  So we had a phone call where he 
basically said is there a way I can help them given my 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 89 of 362 
 
knowledge 
of 
Bain, 
my 
knowledge 
of 
management 
consulting and my knowledge of ethics of business ethics 
was there a way I could help them.  And I said I will give 
that some thought.   
 
The next morning – ja the next morning or the same 
night just after that phone call I set out a few thoughts and 
the one thought was around things Bain could do you know 
think about whether they need to acknowledge the harm 
they have caused with a – issue an apology absent plan 
around restitution.      
10 
 
So some of the very standard things you would 
expect of anyone who wants to make amends for something 
that they had done wrong.  I think importantly from my 
standpoint I – I express a willingness to get involved in the 
short term and I said I am willing to help but be very clear 
what I have called a hierarchy of interest.  I want to be 
clear to Bain that if I was going to help them it was going 
to be in the interest of South Africa.  And I said at the 
bottom of the list for me is Bain then myself then South 
Africa. 
20 
 
So where there is going to be conflict or a decision 
to made about what was right – the right thing to do I 
wanted them to be clear that if I got involved my prime 
interest was doing the right thing for South Africa and that 
is the basis on which I engaged. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 90 of 362 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Right you refer to a statement to the 
Bain team please look at AW3 page 125 to 126 is that the 
statement that you are referring to?  
MR WILLIAMS:  Page 125. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Left – top left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page?  Is it 125? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair.  So that – this was 
the email that was sent by Mr Moolman to all of Bain’s 
10 
alumni.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Alright we will see different iterations 
of this as we go on.  Then please look at AW4 at page 128 
that is an email dated the 4 t h of September 2018 from you 
to Bain Africa Alumni and you addressed it to Mr Moolman 
– that is Tiaan, is that correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And just summarising it you took 
issue with his description that Bain Alumni may be deeply 
uncomfortable and you said that that surely realises the 
20 
real impact on Bain.  Is that the message that you 
conveyed? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That was exactly the message Chair for 
the – the reason I – I reacted so strongly to this was as a 
management 
consultant, 
as 
a 
business 
advisor 
your 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 91 of 362 
 
reputation is it and I think 00:21:17 most professions your 
reputation is all you have got and I state my reputation 
hugely on the fact that I was former Bain partner.  That 
was – that was what I carried as an element of pride.  And 
so these things that were happening in my mind was 
destroying this asset that I felt I had and I felt that the 
statement from Bain trivialised that damage that all of us 
as former Bain employees carried from having 00:21:44 
Bain employees.  And I was a Bain partner.  I was a senior 
person at Bain and so the calls I got from my clients CEO’s 
10 
in South Africa saying Athol you assured us who gives the 
impression of Bain as a company of integrity look what is 
happening now.  So I was very disappointed in the – where 
they trivialised the issue. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Yes please turn to AW5 page 130.  
That is a response from Mr Moolman to you dated 5 
September 2018 in relation to the press release correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And reading from the third paragraph: 
“What I can assure you is that all current 
20 
Bain employees mine self included are 
having an even harder time also through no 
fault 
of 
our 
own. 
 
We 
are 
facing 
an 
incredibly difficult situation and we are now 
– sorry – only now learning some of the real 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 92 of 362 
 
facts.  There is a very genuine desire from 
Manny Maceda – M-a-c-e-d-a down to the 
team in SA left to address this disaster to 
do the right thing.  Since the real facts 
started to come out on Friday I have pulled 
into a process to find the right way forward 
true to our values.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry – I am sorry Mr Franklin.  You 
have left me behind. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  I am sorry. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was still at page 128 but I think you are 
on another page now. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Yes 130. 
CHAIRPERSON:  130.  Okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And Chair I have… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Read out the third paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes I see it yes, ja. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Into the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Yes so that – that was the – the view 
expressed by Mr Moolman to you at that time. 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Alright you – you have told the Chair 
that you had offered yourself as a potential consultant as it 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 93 of 362 
 
were in order to assist Bain in the predicament it found 
itself.  Correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Please turn to AW8 on page 138.   
MR WILLIAMS:  I have got. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  As I understand it this was a prelude 
to an agreement that was concluded. 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And it is dated the 7 t h of September 
2018 an agreement between Bain and Company South 
10 
Africa and Mr Athol Williams and just summarising again it 
sets 
out 
an 
intention 
to 
enter 
into 
an 
independent 
contractual agreement amongst the responsibilities you 
would 
be 
given 
and 
William 
shall 
observe 
Bain’s 
compliance 
with 
ethical 
business 
practices 
and 
professional standards.   
 
And then paragraph 5 if I may read that out. 
“If Williams is not satisfied that Bain has 
acted or intends to act in a manner that will 
address his concerns he shall in no way be 
20 
restricted from bringing his concerns to the 
attention 
of 
an 
appropriate 
third 
party 
outside of Bain and Williams shall not be 
deemed 
to 
be 
in 
breach 
of 
his 
confidentiality obligations to Bain in such 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 94 of 362 
 
an event.” 
 
So just pausing there it speaks for itself that there 
appears to be a sentiment expression between you and 
Bain that you should be allowed to have access to such 
information as you wish in order to bring concerns to an 
appropriate 
outside 
party 
if 
you 
believe 
that 
was 
necessary. 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And then in paragraph 6  
“Bain further agrees that in the event of a 
10 
situation arising under Section 5 above it 
shall not assert any claim of legal privilege 
to 
prevent 
Williams 
from 
bringing 
his 
concerns to the attention of an appropriate 
third party.” 
Is that the understanding again under which you – you 
worked eventually? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And you have obviously been party to 
the application that was brought initially for a number of 
20 
the annexures in your statement to be kept from the public 
– from public disclosure.  What is your comment on that 
attempt in the light of these two paragraphs? 
MR 
WILLIAMS: 
 
Chair 
my 
understanding 
from 
the 
discussion I had with Mr Moolman and with the – the 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 95 of 362 
 
discussions I had that led to this letter of intent was that 
they really wanted to do the right thing in South Africa.  
These were again – these were not strangers to me.  The 
leadership at Bain now were all people who started with me 
20 odd years ago so I have known them all for many, many 
years and so that just comes with a level of trust.  So in 
my interpretation something has gone wrong at Bain and 
that needed to be dealt with.  But now Bain wanted to 
make sure the right thing was being done and – and the 
evidence leader mentions Manny Macedo and Manny 
10 
Macedo was the worldwide management partner – the 
worldwide management partner of Bain.  The insult was 
saying we want to do the right thing.  And this is even 
written in capital letters.  So my understanding was that I 
had this open access – I was going to work from inside 
Bain but my reason for being there was not to protect Bain 
my reason there was to make sure we did the right thing 
for South Africa.  And if for whatever reason I thought 
there was a conflict or I was not happy with what Bain was 
doing or how they were conducting themselves I was free 
20 
to go to a third party with that concern.  So when I see an 
application that then says the materials that I have gained 
is legally privileged and that Bain has taken great liberties 
I must say Chair with describing me in all sorts of 
horrendous ways like being dishonest and being disloyal 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 96 of 362 
 
and being disgruntled and being uninformed I obtained that 
information in the context of being asked by Bain to do the 
right thing for South Africa and that was the – that was the 
context in which I revealed all of that information to the 
commission. So that application, that attitude that I am 
contravening the intent of my engagement is strange to 
me. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Please look at Annexure AW12 page 
147.  I could actually see that that goes onto page 148 and 
then has Terms of Reference from 149 to 150.  Is that the 
10 
agreement which was concluded between you and Bain and 
Company South Africa Inc on 7 September 2018? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair.  So subsequent to 
the one page letter of intent we then entered into this more 
comprehensive agreement. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  I am going to highlight certain parts 
of it on page 147. 
“Dear Athol we are thankful that you have 
agreed to provide independent oversight of 
Bain’s investigations into its work at SARS.  
20 
This service agreement – the agreement is 
effective as of September 7, 2018 by and 
between Bain and Athol Williams and…” 
 
I do not need to read the rest.   
“This agreement describes how Bain and or 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 97 of 362 
 
its affiliates may engage you to provide 
oversight of the investigation.  Find its 
services and how you will provide services.” 
 
And it then contains various other provisions but I 
am interested in are the Terms of Reference that are 
referred to in the body of the agreement.  Those appear at 
page 149 to 150.  Is that correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Under the first heading Context first 
bullet point it is recorded  
10 
“Bain 
is 
cooperating 
with 
the 
Nugent 
Commission of Inquiry – the commission to 
understand the facts of Bain’s engagement 
with SARS in 2014 and 2015.” 
And then if I could look at the second bullet point. 
“To 
reinforce 
Bain’s 
commitment 
to 
transparency to the commission and to 
support Bain’s ...[indistinct – word cut] with 
the Commission, Bain has secured the 
services 
of Athol 
Williams. 
 
Bain... 
in 
20 
respect of independent advisor.” 
And the third point.   
“Bain’s 
intent 
in 
securing 
Mr 
Williams’ 
services is that he does what is right for 
South Africa without restriction.” 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 98 of 362 
 
And then the fourth. 
“Mr 
Bain’s(sic) 
role 
is 
to 
provide 
independent oversight of the external and 
internal 
investigations 
that 
Bain 
are 
conducting.” 
I am just stopping there...   
MR WILLIAMS:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And those are self-explanatory, but 
can you explain to the Chairperson what were the internal 
and external investigations that are referred to here? 
10 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, so I was not engaged to conduct 
any of my own investigation.  Bain had started, after 
Mr Massone’s 
testimony, 
Bain 
had 
started 
amongst 
themselves, amongst the internal legal team and some of 
the senior people to begin to ask questions about what had 
happened at SARS.  So that was classified as the internal 
investigation.   
 
That was, I think, largely ad-hoc, just to get a 
quick 
sense 
of 
what 
was 
happening. 
 The 
external 
investigation 
was 
the 
investigation 
where 
Bain 
had 
20 
retained the services of Baker McKenzie, a law firm, to 
conduct 
a 
more 
comprehensive, 
a 
more 
thorough 
investigation. 
 
But going to what happened at SARS that in due 
Bain’s work in many of the SOE’s because Bain had worked 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 99 of 362 
 
across most of the SOE’s including parts of government as 
well.   
 
So this – so my role was – and this was – it was 
my understanding, no president for this.  There was no 
handbook that I could go.  I did not have training on how to 
provide oversight to an investigation but the intent was 
clear.   
 
The intent was:  Athol, we want to do the right 
thing here.  We will give you access to what Baker 
McKenzie is doing.  You will have meetings with them.  You 
10 
can see the documents.  You make sure that, at the end of 
this investigation, we can – you can write a report where 
you give your assurance as an independent person.. 
 
I might say you have pseudo independent, right, 
because I was not associated with Bain but I was now 
independent - you can give the public assurance that this 
investigation 
was 
independent 
and 
it 
was 
reported 
truthfully.  That is how I understood my role.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Continuing with the Terms of 
Reference.  At the bottom of the page there is a heading, 
20 
Operating Procedures.  The first bullet point: 
“Mr Williams will have full access to the 
interim and final reports of the internal and 
external investigations and will have weekly 
meetings 
with 
the 
leads 
of 
these 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366

investigations...” 
 
I am just pausing there.  What interim and final 
reports are contemplated, as you understand it? 
MR WILLIAMS:   I think it is, if it makes sense, confronted 
to – so the interim investigation sort of wrapped very 
quickly.  So it was – the idea was, if that continued, I 
would have oversight of it but preferable that... extended 
because the external investigation became the focus. 
 
But the idea was that Baker McKenzie, you will 
have under... conducting the investigation would produce, 
10 
ultimately, a report of their findings which should go to the 
Nugent Commission.  So that was the intent.  And an 
interim... 
 
I think if I remember correctly there was – we 
were mindful of the timing of the Nugent Commission.  So 
the idea was to give the Nugent Commission an interim 
report which would give the commission an update of the 
findings but with a final report later on.   
 
So the understanding was that Baker McKenzie 
are going to produce these two reports, an interim report 
20 
and a final report and I was to have access to both of 
those. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And as it turns out.  Were you ever 
given access to an interim or a final report empowered by 
Baker McKenzie? 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 101 of 362 
 
MR WILLIAMS:   I was not Chair.  Despite my constant 
pleading for it and arguing for it, I was not given access 
during this contract... 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright.  Then look at page 150 
under the heading, Outputs.  The second bullet point which 
says that: 
“Mr Williams and the commission are free to 
communicate directly on matters relating to the 
commission’s investigation, et cetera...” 
 
And then it said: 
10 
“...with respect to any such communication...” 
 
First sub-bullet: 
“...Bain agrees that it shall not deem any such 
communication 
by 
Mr 
Williams 
with 
the 
commission to be at breach with Mr Williams’ 
confidentiality obligations to Bain. 
And secondly, Bain agrees that it shall not 
seek to assert a claim of legal privilege to 
prevent 
Mr 
Williams 
from 
beginning 
his 
concerns to the attention of the commission...” 
20 
 
That 
is, 
mirrors, 
it 
seems 
the 
similar 
two 
provision that were in your letter of intent. 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct Chair.  Can I also mention 
that – because there is mention of the commission, the 
Nugent Commission.  I had, through an investigative 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 102 of 362 
 
journalist, I contacted – established a connection with 
Judge Nugent and so again to make this role of mine or it 
was already bizarre, even more bizarre.   
 
We established this understanding between Bain 
and myself and Judge Nugent that I will speak to both 
parties.  So Judge Nugent had a copy of my contract.  He 
understood what I was there to do and he welcomed 
comments from me, information from me, all...  all of these 
communications 
but 
he, 
Judge 
Nugent, 
welcome 
communications from me.   
10 
 
So this idea to be able to communicate with the 
commission... I was free to do that in my contract and 
Judge Nugent and I had a strange number of emails and 
had a few – one or two face-to-face meetings as well. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright.  We will get into the detail of 
what was used as a consequence of the investigation but 
can I ask you to look at para 7, page 13 of your statement 
or affidavit, rather? 
MR WILLIAMS:   I have got it. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   What you say is: 
20 
“This affidavit relies on documents and emails 
that I received or used during my 16-month 
period of engagement with Bain...” 
 
Now I am just pausing there.  You give the Chair 
an idea of what document production exercise was carried 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 103 of 362 
 
out by whom and when you were shown such documents... 
MR WILLIAMS:   So Chair, I think these documents can be 
divided into three categories by the three roles, different 
roles I played at Bain as the evidence leader described 
earlier.  So during my role as this – providing oversight of 
the investigation.   
 
I – like I said earlier, I had meetings with Bain, 
with their lawyers, with the Baker McKenzie’s investigators.  
In fact, there were meetings I had with only the Bain, 
Baker McKenzie’s investigators without Bain.  So I had 
10 
opportunity to ask questions and engage with them. 
 
What Baker McKenzie had started doing was to, 
because 
the 
concern 
about 
the 
widespread 
possible 
improper behaviour within Bain, had begun accessing the 
devices of many of its personnel.  So laptops, cell phones, 
looking at Bain’s server.  So from that search, they have 
collected vast volumes of documents.   
 
Baker McKenzie went through a process of 
reducing that from, I think, it was a few million documents, 
as I recall, down to a much smaller number but all those 
20 
relevant documents that they had classified as relevant, 
those were shared with me so that if – in fact it all came to 
me by email.   
 
So there were periodic updates, face-to-face 
meetings but also these documents that came into our 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 104 of 362 
 
possession as part of that role.   
 
So I was given these documents or Baker 
McKenzie had alerted me and others to something they 
found which they thought was relevant.  So the bulk of the 
documents that I got and I presented to the commission 
came during that period.  So it was documents that Baker 
McKenzie had found from Bain’s staff and shared that with 
me. 
 
I do not – well, I know it was not everything that 
was collected because this idea of privilege emerged again 
10 
and so I do not know what the full set was collected.  I just 
know what I received but I know that it was established 
that there were none – they were privileged documents that 
I would not see.  I would only see the non-privileged 
documents. 
 
So that was that first period.  Then in the second 
period where I was this independent advisor then helped to 
develop their remedy plan, I received no new documents on 
the investigation.  So, to the extent that there are 
documents here, they are emails, basically.  And then the 
20 
period when I was employed by Bain, I received more 
documents and many emails.   
 
So when I say I produced documents.  What I 
mean is, I produced emails.  I produced none of the 
documents that are included here.  Everyone of the 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 105 of 362 
 
documents 
included 
in 
my 
affidavit 
are 
documents 
presented to me by Bain or Baker McKenzie. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right.  And you have set out the 
process 
by 
which 
you 
received 
those 
documents 
in 
paragraph 7.1 and following of your affidavit.   
[Speaker ’s voice drops – unclear] 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct.  It is what I have just 
described. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   You also have face-to-face meetings 
with 
Bain 
employees 
and 
with 
Baker 
McKenzie 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Franklin, just remember not to speak 
too far from the ...[intervenes]  
MR WILLIAMS:   I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From the ...[intervenes]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I am sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If it moves, you could move it closer if it 
is more convenient for you to put your file on the other... 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   What I had asked the witness is 
whether during the course of his engagement he had 
meetings with Bain employees and also Baker McKenzie... 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 106 of 362 
 
MR WILLIAMS:   I did Chair.  So a lot of Baker McKenzie 
meetings were structured meetings around what they had 
found and whether I had any questions.  The Bain meetings 
were less structured.  I was given access to the office and 
so there were times where consultants would come into my 
office and raise their concerns, share their experience with 
me.   
 
So I got a sense from formally what had 
happened but also from people in a coffee area or at the 
lifts, cornering me and saying:  I think you should know 
10 
about this. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right.  Could I ask you?  Your final 
conclusion, before we get into the detail, what was it?  
Was it that Bain had come clean with the commission and 
with South Africa or not? 
MR WILLIAMS:   It was definitive not.  I – like I mentioned 
earlier Chair.  I looked at my role as, did Bain with Baker 
McKenzie 
conduct 
a 
comprehensive 
and 
rigorous 
investigation? 
 
And there, largely, I said yes because I thought 
20 
the terms of reference were adequately designed.  I have 
these meetings with Baker McKenzie.  So I knew where 
they were looking, who they were speaking to, what 
documents they reviewed.  So I felt comfortable with the 
comprehensiveness of an investigation. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 107 of 362 
 
 
The parts I could not be comfortable with was, I 
could not attend the interviews.  So I felt that those 
meetings where they were interviewing staff as opposed to 
just reviewing documents was very relevant but those 
interviews were regarded as privilege and I was denied 
access to the interview notes that came from those 
meetings. 
 
So I could not be sure of what happened in those 
interviews.  So I – in my view it was, it seemed 
comprehensive except for the fact that I could not get 
10 
access to those interview notes. 
 
On the truthfulness part.  There I – two parts.  
One.  Judge Nugent kept writing to me as did Bain, saying 
that Bain are being evasive, they are obfuscating, they are 
not – you know they were assembling documents only when 
he asked for it.  They are not addressing the real concerns.   
 
I knew what Judge Nugent’s conclusion was.  
Mine was simple.  I was hired to judge or make a – form an 
opinion on whether Bain had reported truthfully to the 
commission.  I was going to judge that by looking at Bain’s 
20 
report to the commission against all the evidence and 
discussions that I have been part of. 
 
But when Bain refused to give me access to the 
findings report, I could make no assessment of truthfulness 
and in my mind Bain were, therefore, not truthful with me 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 108 of 362 
 
because I could not see the final findings and they are not 
truthful to the commission because they never submitted 
any findings to the commission. 
 
And in fact, how could evidence suggest this was 
a conscience decision on Bain’s part to not submit – to not 
file the report with the commission and not to make that 
report available to me. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright.  You resigned from your 
engagement with Bain at the end of 2019. 
MR WILLIAMS:   August 2019. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   What led to that resignation... 
[Speaker not clear – voice drops] 
MR WILLIAMS:   It was Bain continuing to withhold 
information that I thought was relevant.  You know, I had 
all these assurances and you – we have read through 
those emails earlier that Bain had full intent to do the right 
thing.   
 
Part of doing the right thing, by my estimation 
was, to make full disclosure of what had happened.  The 
fact that Bain continued even when I was employee, a 
20 
partner 
brought 
in 
to 
deal 
with 
these 
issues, 
they 
continued to withhold that that from me. 
 
Convinced me that I could not then be part of 
that.  So it was the same issue that started in the 
beginning, was withholding of what had really transpired at 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 109 of 362 
 
SARS and other SOE’s.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Now could I ask you to look at para 
9, page 15 of your affidavit? 
MR WILLIAMS:   I have got it. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Paragraph 9, page 15.  And if I can 
ask you to look ten lines down?  You say: 
“It was only after I left and after Bain made 
offers to me that I interpreted as being aimed 
at silencing me, did I really look closely at all 
the evidence in my possession and studied it 
10 
closely. 
This process started in late December 2019 
and concluded in March 2020. 
A catalyst for reviewing what I had in my 
possession and organising it was the summons 
I received from the Zondo Commission in 
January 2020. 
Putting together the contents of the 500 plus 
documents and emails, combined with the 
numerous phone calls and meetings that I 
20 
attended at Bain plus my knowledge of Bain.  
Management consulting and business ethics, 
has allowed me to develop the sequence of 
events and understanding that I present in this 
affidavit...” 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 110 of 362 
 
 
I think that is self-explanatory but is that an 
accurate recordal of what in fact transpired?  Did you took 
a closer look at the totality of this evidence through the 
prism of your experiences as a Bain partner and employee 
and put together what we have before the Commission 
today? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct Chair.  I – when I – in 
2018 and during my oversight role – my work was really 
geared toward assisting the Nugent Commission which was 
focussed squarely on what was happening at SARS.  So 
10 
the extent I looked at and reviewed evidence and had 
discussions with Baker McKenzie and Bain, was very 
targeted, largely, on what was happening at SARS. 
 
After 
I 
had 
left 
Bain 
and 
the 
Commission 
approached and I said I have got documents that I think 
might be useful to the Commission, I then looked at 
everything I had, not just what was relevant to SARS and it 
is when I looked at all – everything I had, actually formed a 
very different view that I had in 2018 when I was engaged 
to provide an oversight. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right.  And then in paragraph 45, 
page 27 you have also explained that in the sections which 
follow in the affidavit, you rely on information contained in 
documents and emails that were in my possession during 
the period of my engagement with Bain and that those are 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 111 of 362 
 
the ones you have exchanged with employees of Bain or 
those conducting the investigation i.e. ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Franklin.  Was 27 the 
paragraph or the page number? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   At...  45 was the paragraph.  27 is 
the page... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, thank you.  Okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Just... I was just 
highlighting that: 
“The emails and documents or both that I 
10 
exchanged with employees of Bain or those 
conducting the investigation, that is Baker 
McKenzie, or emails and documents that were 
given to me by employees of Bain or people 
conducting the investigation...: 
 
Is that an accurate summary... 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Chair, I am about to proceed into the 
detail of the affidavit and I wonder if this would suit Chair 
to adjourn for the lunch break? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes-no, that is fine.  We will adjourn for 
lunch.  We are meant to have the evening session for the 
continuation 
of 
Mr 
Gordhan’s 
cross-examination 
by 
Mr Moyane’s counsel this evening.   
 
The evening sessions normally start at four or 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 112 of 362 
 
five.  It may be that during the lunch break you might wish 
to consider what should be done in – at that time and if 
need be talk to all concerned.   
 
One approach is that we will continue with Mr 
Williams, stop at a certain time, maybe five o’clock.  Have 
that cross-examination take place which I think should not 
go beyond an hour and then resume with Mr Williams after 
that.   
 
Now I am mentioning that, that I am alive to the 
fact that not everybody might be aware that my expectation 
10 
is that we could go into the evening but I know there are a 
lot of people who are aware now that we are trying to use 
as much time as possible to try and finish.   
 
So what one option is that we will do that but 
obviously it is subject to hearing if everybody that needs to 
be here or anticipate is able to or whether there are any 
problems But I think to a large extent people try to make a 
plan and cooperate in helping the Commission. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, we will do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Chair, just one issue.  Of course, 
there will still be re-examination... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, ja, there will still be re-examination.  
Oh, so that could it beyond an hour. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 113 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is one – the one option is that 
we will stop with Mr Williams at a certain time, maybe five 
o’clock, maybe six o’clock.  The other parties could wait a 
bit where we still continue a bit but obviously not too long.  
We do not want to keep them waiting for too long.   
 
And then maybe, depending on how long the re-
examination takes, most of the re-examinations that we 
have experienced in the Commission have been reasonable 
short.  Then we need to see whether we would want to 
continue after that or that will be too late for some of the 
10 
people affected.   
 
I – as we approach the end of the time for oral 
evidence in the Commission, are more and more prepared 
to sit quite late but obviously that is not always convenient 
to everybody and that has to be taken into account.  So.   
 
But another option might be that we stop with 
Mr Williams at a certain time today, this afternoon or 
maybe this evening or whatever time.  And then continue 
tomorrow morning with him and finish with him before we 
start the next witness.   
20 
 
So I thought I would raise this thing so that 
maybe during the lunch break you could reflect and so 
when we come back we can have some discussion.   
 
And to the extent that whatever we plan to do 
might affect people who are not here now.  There might be 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 114 of 362 
 
a need for some discussion.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair.  We will 
investigate all that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright.  We will take the lunch 
adjournment and resume at two.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you able to tell me anything about 
10 
later today?  You will let me know later or now? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   No, I will let you know later but the 
preliminary indication, Chair, is that we would not want to 
continue with Mr Williams after the cross-examination/re-
examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Because not knowing precisely when 
that will be. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And, if necessary, with your leave, 
20 
we will rather continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, that is fine. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And that is in order for Mr Williams. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  No, that is fine. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, before lunch, Mr 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 115 of 362 
 
Williams, you had set the scene for the Chair and you had 
explained how it is that you came to take this oversight 
role in relation to the Bain investigation.  I would now like 
to proceed to some of the detail of the affidavit and if you 
could turn to page 27 of your affidavit, there is a heading: 
“Bain’s entry into the public sector through a paid 
intermediary.” 
Do you have that?   
MR WILLIAMS:   No, not yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just remember not to be too far from the 
10 
microphone.  Okay, no, that is fine. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  Right, so for this 
section I would like you to start please with AW18 which is 
on page 176.  AW18, 176, do you have that? 
MR WILLIAMS:   I have got that. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, that is a contract which is 
headed: 
“Business 
development 
and 
stakeholder 
management contract.” 
And we see from page 179 that it was concluded on 1 
20 
November 2013 and it is between Bain and Company South 
Africa Inc and a company known as Ambrobrite (Pty) Ltd, is 
that correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Now before you get into the detail of 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 116 of 362 
 
that could I ask you who is Ambrobrite, to your knowledge? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, by Bain’s own due diligence this 
company Ambrobrite did not have any internet presence, 
no website, never filed financials, had a tax certificate 
which SARS seemed to think was fraudulent, no trading 
history, no financial statements.  So this Bains’ due 
diligence found that.  This company today does not exist.  
Even in this contract the name changes from Ambrobrite to 
Ambrorite, it is not clear whether they exist today.  Per this 
contract and I understand it, is a company set up by two 
10 
gentlemen, Mr Duma Ndlovu who is a TV producer, I think 
he produces the TV show Muvhango and Mr Mandla 
KaNozulu and both of them are artists, they do they 
creative work and so they describe themselves as an 
events management company, this is not a business 
consulting or management consulting company, this is an 
events company.  This is an events company. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, please turn to page AW19, 
page 189 to 190.  That appears to be an extract from a 
website of some sort.  Do you know what this is? 
20 
MR WILLIAMS:   Page 189, you said? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Correct. 
MR WILLIAMS:   This is a website which is actually – so 
one of the Ambrobrite principals, Mr KaNozulu – so this is 
his personal website where he describes his credentials 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 117 of 362 
 
and his background. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, could you go back to the 
contract itself starting at 176?  Firstly under paragraph 1, 
the parties involved, these are two people who have been 
identified 
by 
you, 
Dr 
Duma 
Ndlovu 
and 
Mr 
Mandla 
KaNozulu.  Are those the two people you referred to 
earlier? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct, Chair, the two Ambrobrite 
principals. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright, then under paragraph 2: 
10 
“Current context.  It is said that Bain and Company 
SA in collaboration with Ambrorite has identified the 
government and state owned enterprise sector as a 
strategic priority.” 
Then if I could go to the second paragraph under that 
heading: 
“In addition, Ambrobrite intelligence has allowed 
Bain in the last few months to acknowledge that in 
the next few years a number of state owned 
enterprises 
and 
agencies 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
20 
leadership and strategic changes and will require 
significant 
transformation 
and 
turnaround 
processes." 
Then the last paragraph on that page: 
“Bain and Company South Africa is of the opinion 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 118 of 362 
 
that a collaboration of Ambrorite would substantially 
benefit its business and the probability of success 
in this sector.” 
Just pausing there, I take it you are familiar with this 
contract, you have looked at it before?   
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct, Chair, I have. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   What did you understand to be the 
objective of the contractual engagement been Bain and 
Ambrobrite? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Well, Chair, there is what they state in 
10 
this contract and then what – I think what materialised and 
what happened but what they state in this contract in and 
of itself is shocking.   
For them to just that statement that the evidence 
leader read that based on their intelligence.  So again, we 
are not talking about public sector consultants or business 
consultants, we are talking artists who say by their 
intelligence they know of strategic changes happening our 
public institutions and leadership changes.  For me that is 
incredibly troubling and I think that begins to hint at what 
20 
this contract is about.  
 
So as much as this contract talks about business 
development and giving Bain the strategic advice, which is 
a bizarre thought, Bain was one of the preeminent strategy 
consulting firms in the world, why would they turn to two 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 119 of 362 
 
artists to give them strategic advice? 
 
So this contract seemed to portray itself as one 
where these are local experts who were going to help Bain 
be successful.  When I read this it sounds like these are 
two individuals who are very close to politicians and are 
able to open doors to politicians for Bain. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, please look at page 177 under 
the heading C Business Development, the third bullet point 
there: 
“Facilitate the introduction or directly introduce 
10 
Bain partners to those key leaders and decision-
makers.” 
Do you know who those identified people are? 
MR WILLIAMS:   I do not know explicitly, Chair.  Again in 
the context here it says it was public sector.  Right, so 
earlier on it said this is about government and public 
sector, so I am assuming when they talk about key leaders 
and decision-makers they are talking about key public 
sector leaders and decision-makers.  And even then I do 
not think is necessarily problematic if someone says we 
20 
introduce you to decision-makers in the public sector, I 
think that is fine, I think to be introducing us to politicians, 
that becomes more problematic in my mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But even then, why should somebody 
have a contractual arrangement with somebody else to 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 120 of 362 
 
introduce them to somebody who is in the public domain? 
MR WILLIAMS:   [indistinct] 08.25 but they also say they 
can offer intelligence on procurement processes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because who, if you are talking about 
politicians, assuming that would be right, anybody can 
know who the politicians are in different government 
portfolios.  If you talk about DGs, everybody can find out 
who they are. 
MR WILLIAMS:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And why do they not phone and make a 
10 
call and ask to introduce themselves to them, why do they 
need 
a 
contractual 
arrangement 
with 
somebody 
to 
introduce them to those people? 
MR WILLIAMS:   I am assuming it is a rhetorical question, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR WILLIAMS:   Ja, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Following from the Chair ’s question 
perhaps you can just highlight on page 178 below the four 
20 
bullet points: 
“The ultimate objective of the collaboration is to 
drive commercial success for Bain and Company SA 
in the government and state owned enterprises 
sector.” 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 121 of 362 
 
I think that pretty much summarises what you said you 
understood the purpose of this to be and then under: 
“Governance and timing of the project” 
We see that: 
“The relationship between the parties will be led by 
Mr Massone on behalf of Bain.” 
Do you see that? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, over the page on page 179: 
“Financial Terms Aligned Incentives” 
10 
It then sets out the fee that will be paid to Ambrobrite for 
these services and they speak for themselves, but there is 
a retainer fee of R100 000 per month and then success 
fees, 
depending 
upon 
meets 
expectations 
or 
exceed 
expectations, performance.  Do you see that? 
MR WILLIAMS:   I do, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, now you comment on the 
quantum of that fee in paragraph 65, page 34 of your 
statement and would you go to that please? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say page 44? 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   34, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Paragraph 65 of Mr Williams’ 
affidavit.  And what I am interested in there is that you say 
in the second sentence, the third sentence: 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 122 of 362 
 
“For Ambrobrite wealth was accumulated in the form 
of payments from Bain of 3.6 million per year.” 
Etcetera. 
“This made Ambrobrite the second highest paid of 
the 52 advisers that Bain worked with worldwide 
and it was paid 50% higher than the next highest 
paid adviser.” 
Can you just look at the remainder of the paragraph and 
then 
give 
your 
comment 
to 
the 
Chair 
about 
the 
appropriateness or otherwise of this quantum of fees in the 
10 
context of your knowledge of Bain? 
MR WILLIAMS:   So, Chair, Bain does work with advisers 
around the world, it is part of their normal practice and 
advisers bring a particular narrower expertise that Bain 
would rely.  Like I was an adviser for Bain for a while.   
The advisers are typically ex-CEOs of companies, 
former public officials or former Bain partners, like myself.  
That is a typical profile of an adviser and even with that 
highly skilled experienced profile of adviser, being paid 
R3.6 million a year is not what Bain typically pays those 
20 
advisers, so already we are talking about getting advice, 
which you normally get from experienced CEOs, you are 
getting from artists and you are paying these artists far 
more than you pay those experienced CEOs and I am not 
making this judgment, it is actually in the emails, internal 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 123 of 362 
 
Bain emails where Bain’s global head of marketing writes 
to Mr Massone and says I have looked at this contract with 
Ambrorite and what you are paying them is actually the 
second highest of all our advisers and she expresses a 
concern that if anyone sees this contract they might 
interpret this as not just a fee for advice.  And so in my 
mind it is quite extraordinary to pay these artists R3.6 
million a year plus success fees for doing something which 
typically a very [indistinct] 12.56 person does. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But going back to the contract, you 
10 
remember we dealt with that part where the contract says 
Ambrorite would facilitate the introduction of Bain to public 
sector leaders or whatever. 
MR WILLIAMS:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That part does not talk about advice, is 
there another part that talks about Ambrobrite giving 
advice to Bain? 
MR WILLIAMS:   It is in the contract, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR WILLIAMS:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay, 
no 
as 
long 
as 
you 
state…[intervenes] 
MR WILLIAMS:   No, it is in the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what kind of advice, strategic? 
MR WILLIAMS:   It is strategic advice, it is advice on 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 124 of 362 
 
procurement processes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does it say so expressly. 
MR WILLIAMS:   Well, it says decision-making around 
procurement, decision-making around all things which to a 
point is knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, ja.  And, of course, if you seek 
legal advice as to what procurement requirements are, 
what procedures are, then you go to lawyers, you do not go 
to artists. 
MR WILLIAMS:   Exactly right, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Please then look 
at AW26, page 211.  At the bottom of the page there is an 
email from Mandla KaNozulu to Mr Massone and he 
attaches invoices for September and October.  Now we 
have seen that the contract was signed in November, so it 
would appear that work was being done for Bain by 
Ambrobrite prior to the conclusion of a written contract, is 
that correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct, Chair, one of the things 
20 
that Ambrobrite had done with Bain was arrange a party 
that included President Jacob Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, just repeat that please?  Mr 
Williams, just repeat that? 
MR WILLIAMS:   The evidence leader asked me or was 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 125 of 362 
 
saying this seems to indicate that Ambrobrite had done 
work with Bain before November 2013 and I was saying 
that is correct.  One of the things that Ambrobrite had done 
with Bain before November 2013 before the contract was 
signed was to arrange a party with Bain that included 
President Jacob Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   On that score please turn to page 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I note, Mr Franklin, that the email 
10 
from Mr Mandla KaNozulu to Mr Massone says: 
“Kindly find attached invoices for September and 
October.” 
And then says: 
“Please note that these are calculated at a very 
happy(?) rate.  Should you require me to adjust 
please do not hesitate to say so.” 
MR WILLIAMS:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  You may continue.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, just on the point of a 
20 
function in relation to the former President Zuma, please 
look at AW24, page 205, that is an email from Mr Massone 
to colleagues at Bain to which he says he has drafted the 
terms of the collaboration of Ambrobrite and then in the 
fifth paragraph he says: 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 126 of 362 
 
“They have started working with me in September 
e.g. on SARS, the event with the President.” 
Is that what you were referring to? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Correct, that is what I was referring to, 
Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, you earlier told the Chair that 
Bain 
itself 
through 
its 
due 
diligence 
processes 
had 
established some concerning features of this relationship.  
May I ask you please to turn firstly to page 193 and that is 
AW20.  Do you have that?  There is an email string there.  
10 
Could I direct attention to the first one and that is sent on 
the – looks like the 18 December 2013 from a Mr Geoff 
Smout, S-m-o-u-t to Bain people.  Do you know who Mr 
Smout is? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, so at that time Bain – Mr Geoff 
Smout was head of finance in London in Bain’s – sorry, 
was director of finance in Bain’s London office but he also 
oversaw finance for the South Africa office.  So a contract 
like this would have needed approval of the London finance 
team. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right and what Mr Smout says from 
London is: 
“This whole situation seems very dodgy.  Do you 
know anything about the background of the people 
who run Ambrobrite or who are named in the 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 127 of 362 
 
contract?” 
And then if we could just look at the strings which precede 
that, the one immediately below that, which is to Mr Smout 
from Mr – sorry, a Nicole Olmesdahl.  Do you know who 
that is? 
MR WILLIAMS:   So the Nicole Olmesdahl was the finance 
person in South Africa and at the time she was quite junior 
so she reported to Mr Smout in London. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And what she says as well: 
“I have just been to SARS who could not verify the 
10 
TCC and suspect it is fraudulent.” 
Do you know what a TCC is? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, the TCC is a tax compliant 
certificate.  So she had received the tax compliance 
certificate from Ambrorite, was – it looked dodgy to her, 
she even took it – sorry, I should not use the word dodgy, it 
looked unusual to her, she took it to SARS, even SARS 
says they suspect it is fraudulent. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right and then going down the page, 
the last third of the page, an email of 17 December 2013 
20 
from Mr Smout to Olmesdahl, says: 
“For some reason I do not trust the situation I would 
like to see their certificate of incorporation and VAT 
certificate too.  What else do we typically get asked 
for?” 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 128 of 362 
 
Now 
just 
stopping 
there, 
do 
you 
know 
from 
your 
investigation 
of 
the 
documentation 
whether 
these 
described by Bain itself as dodgy features wherever 
satisfactorily answered or resolved? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, from what I saw they were never 
resolved.  They – I never saw these documents, I never 
saw any emails or was not part of the discussions where it 
is seen that these were resolved.  In fact subsequent to 
this, and maybe we are going to get to it, Mr Smout himself 
then sends an email to Mr Massone saying he remains 
10 
concerned all of these things. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   But could I ask you, what is your 
comment on Bain commencing business relationship with a 
consultant prior to having concluded a written contract, is 
that normal or not.   
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, Bain is a highly professional 
organisation who would, you know, cross t’s and dot i’s 
and, you know, even I comment on the spelling errors in 
this contract, this to me just seems like it is not a typical 
Bain contract.  Something very odd just to me.  But even 
20 
this 
idea 
of 
having 
done 
business 
with 
another 
organisation without a contract to me just seems highly 
unusual and it seems the desire for this contract only 
emerges when they now have to pay Ambrobrite, so it gave 
me the impression that Bain was quite happy to continue 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 129 of 362 
 
without a contract given even with a claim they were 
working with another established business. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, going back in time, if I may, 
please look at AW25 page 207, an email from Wendy Miller 
to Mr Massone dated the 15 January, 2014.  Do you have 
that?   
MR WILLIAMS:   I do, yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And who is Wendy Miller is the – at 
Bain at the time was the global head of marketing for Bain 
and also sat on Bain’s highest management committee, the 
10 
global operating committee. 
MR WILLIAMS:   Right, she raised a number of concerns.  
I will refer you to some of them.  In the second paragraph 
she says: 
“I reviewed the contract you sent through and I did 
talk to Stuart Min about it as well.” 
Stopping there, who is Stuart Min was the global head of 
legal for Bain 
also 
serving on the global operating 
committee. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And she says: 
20 
“I just want to confirm again that: 
1.  Neither of the two people mentioned by the 
name in the contract nor any of the other 
employees of Ambrobrite are SA government 
employees. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 130 of 362 
 
2. There is no plan for money or favour changing 
hands 
between 
these 
two 
people 
or 
other 
Ambrobrite employees on any target executives 
or companies.  Either of these would be explicitly 
against the law.” 
So that is a concern that she had raised having reviewed 
the contract, is that correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And then in the second paragraph: 
“Assuming this is not the case, I come back to a 
10 
concern about the sunshine test here.” 
Are you familiar with that term and what does it refer to? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Its term used quite broadly but certainly 
in Bain the sunshine test is if we are doing something and 
it becomes publicly known, how will it appear.  So, you 
know, the culture was always we should only do things that 
we assume will become publicly known and we would be 
publicly known so it passes that test. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, it appears from the way in 
which the email is structured that Wendy Miller had posed 
20 
certain questions to Mr Massone and he then answered 
them and his answer is imbedded I imagine and the original 
it is in colour but I think one can distinguish it, can you? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, in answer to the sunshine test 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 131 of 362 
 
proposition one sees – that is referred to a way down the 
page, Mr Massone says: 
“I do not think the parallel with lobbying companies 
is right and I would not contract someone for that 
despite this being legal in the US.  It is simply 
business development arrangement where these 
people would inform us if they are aware of changes 
in the key positions in a few selected companies, 
provide us intelligence on the current situation of a 
company’s strategic and operational issues and 
10 
possible leadership evolutions, try to position Bain 
and introduce us to the relevant decision-makers.” 
That is how Mr Massone saw the engagement.  Do you 
have any comment on that? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, I think that describes quite 
succinctly what you were asking earlier about – talk about 
strategic and operational issues but it was really again for 
me very troubling this idea of identifying leadership 
changes.  Again, why would you want the artists – and why 
would even a management consulting firm be targeting 
20 
where there is leadership changes?  So the focus here was 
you introduce us to the key decision-makers where there is 
leadership changes so that we can get in there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is quite interesting when 
viewed against the background that SARS they appear to 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 132 of 362 
 
have chosen the time when there was to be a new 
Commissioner of SARS.  This is – this email is early 2014, 
that the - they started in 2013 or 2012, I am not sure. 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is quite interesting because why 
do not go there when there is somebody, whoever there is, 
who is in charge of the organisation and put your ideas 
there where you think there is something, then some 
business you would like to do there. 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, if I can make one comment on that.  
10 
To be fair to Bain in this respect, as a management 
consultant when a company has got a new CEO it is an 
opportune time to go and speak to him and her because 
they just come into the new job and they have got a lot of 
questions and issues so you could help them be more 
effective.  So that was pretty normal.  But this idea of 
seeking out information about state owned entities that are 
going to make leadership changes, for me that is just very 
unusual.   
And then your observation about SARS is exactly 
20 
right, this was the same model at Telkom.  So this was a 
model obviously set out in this contract.  So the same thing 
happened at Telkom, the same thing happened at SARS 
and probably other places as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But even with what you are telling me, 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 133 of 362 
 
why should it be when there is a new leader that you want 
to come in as opposed to saying we will examine each 
entity irrespective of whether there is a leader who has 
been there for quite some time and see whether there is a 
need to for us to assist, you know, why must it be when 
there is a new leader because the new leader could be 
somebody quite seasoned, quite experienced who does not 
need your assistance but you could have a situation where 
somebody has been there for some time but he or she has 
great need for your kind of assistance. 
10 
MR WILLIAMS:   I think it is exactly right.  I point out only 
the new leader because I think as a consultant you often 
look for – you would have – firstly, you would have 
relationships with CEOs and so you have them over ten 
years and lot of my clients were multi-year clients, but you 
have a relationship firstly.  So whenever they have got a 
need they might call.  And, as you say, Chair, you could 
look a company and observe the need and so you would 
approach them. 
 
With a new leader it is just another one of those 
20 
events where you might want to engage with them, you 
know, another one of the – you see a company’s results 
and the profits are blocked by 50%, that might be a time 
for you to go and speak to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Franklin? 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 134 of 362 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Just continuing 
with the concerns that Wendy Miller had articulated.  At the 
bottom of page 207 what she says is: 
“I am also concerned that we are trading off short 
term 
access 
for 
long 
term 
issues. 
 
If 
these 
individuals are so well-connected with the current 
President and his administration, by association 
with them Bain too will become associated with this 
faction and as will certainly be the case when he 
and his associates fall out of favour, Bain will also 
10 
fall out of favour or even worse.” 
Now if I could go then to the end of that paragraph: 
“Or they may twist this contract into an accusation 
of impropriety in how Bain is getting our business 
that we paid people close to the President to use 
their influence to get our man the CEO job and so 
we get the work.” 
This is certainly what the journalist was insinuating in the 
Telkom article, they could use this contract as evidence.  
Can you just elucidate for the Chair please, if you know, 
20 
what the reference to Telkom is and how it fits in here? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, the accusation in this article was 
that Mr Sipho Maseko was appointed as the Group CEO of 
Telkom.  He had also received this CEO coaching that Bain 
talks about.  So just like with Mr Tom Moyane at SARS 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 135 of 362 
 
would work with Bain for a year before he got appointed, 
Bain had also worked with Mr Sipho Maseko for a time 
before he got appointed as a Group CEO.  Now Bain had 
worked with Mr Maseko before or had met Mr Maseko 
before but certainly in his preparation with his new role at 
Telkom he worked with Bain, but Bain and Mr Maseko had 
also been to meetings with President Zuma and so there 
was an argument that or an allegation that there was some 
impropriety there, so what was going on that Bain works 
with Maseko, Bain and Maseko go and see the President, 
10 
Bain, Maseko and 
Mabusa, who ends up being the 
Chairman of Telkom later, together go and see the 
President, and then you know later on Maseko is appointed 
as the CEO. 
 
So, there was an article sort of mentioning all these 
questions, and of course in this context of Ambrobrite and 
some of the SARS work Wendy Miller was saying well 
those allegations can be seen to have some merit if this 
kind of arrangement of Ambrobrite be seen to come to 
light. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Continuing with Wendy’s email, at 
the bottom of page 208 it says here that there was concern 
at the fee rate and what is said in the last paragraph is 
this, 
“In your second mail you raised the point that 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 136 of 362 
 
$100K as a retainer and a maximum of 300k is not 
immaterial and higher than other advisory contracts 
in that a) the role is different and the workload is 
much higher (as an example) organise a 40 t h 
birthday dinner with the three business associations 
and the President”, 
 
And then he continues, that would appear to be Mr 
Massone’s justification for the high fee, is that why 
…[indistinct – dropping voice]. 
MR WILLIAMS:   That’s correct Chair, and part of what 
10 
he’s saying is this is no ordinary advisor role, so while we 
might hire Athol as an advisor to give us some specific 
technical advice, these two gentleman that we are hiring, 
…[indistinct 
– 
dropping 
voice] 
organise 
parties 
with 
President Zuma and ...[indistinct – dropping voice] higher 
fee. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright going further back in time, 
AW40 page 41 the bottom of the page, an email from 
Wendy and this is also in relation to the …[indistinct – 
dropping voice] contract in paragraph 3 on page 242 this is 
20 
what you said …[intervenes]. 
MR WILLIAMS:   That’s correct, verbally Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   This is what he says, 
“So, here’s my main question, how are two artistic 
producers qualified to provide us with intelligence 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 137 of 362 
 
on company’s strategic and operational issues, 
ending leadership, changes, etcetera which Vittorio, 
let me just stop there, that’s Mr Massone”? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   “Claims as the purpose of the 
arrangement.  It’s quite possible that they are well 
connected in the SA Black Business community and so 
would have independent access to this information.  Again, 
it just seems ingenuous for Vittorio to not acknowledge in 
any way that we hope these guys will use their connections 
10 
with President Zuma to influence Executive selection 
decisions.  We might still decide, collectively that this is 
what it takes to develop business in SA, others play this 
game too and so we’re willing to proceed with them, but I 
think we should have a fully informed decision and I just 
feel that Vittorio is not giving us the full picture”, 
 
I think that is self explanatory what Mr [indistinct – 
audio distorted], has identified as a problem.  Now against 
that background, I’ve taken you to a number of emails in 
which Bain himself has identified what can be described as 
20 
troubling aspects of the Ambrobrite relationship.  Please 
turn to page AW – sorry page 248 Annexure AW43, this is 
an email from Bain to Ambrobrite that…[indistinct- audio 
distorted] June 2016, you can read it, but it appears to be 
an extension of the Ambrobrite contract, is that correct? 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 138 of 362 
 
MR WILLIAMS:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Am I correct, chronologically, that 
these various concerns were raised by very senior people 
at Bain but not withstanding that the contract was signed 
on the 1 s t of November, correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That’s correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And then in addition to the contract 
that was signed there was an extension to that contract on 
the 2 n d of June 2016. 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, in fact, the contract was renewed 
10 
every six months including up until June 2016. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, could I then ask you to turn to 
your statement – sorry your affidavit and at paragraph 68 
and it’s on page 36 you highlight…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say page 36? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Page 36 paragraph 68 Chair.  You 
have highlighted what you call, unusual activities for a 
Management Consulting firm.  I am going to ask you to just 
highlight two of these, paragraph 68.1, 
“Unusual 
payments 
in 
the 
normal 
course 
of 
20 
business”, 
 
Can you explain to the Chair, what it is that you 
established 
was 
paid 
for 
as 
part 
of 
the Ambrobrite 
arrangement? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, it appears – so just the evidence 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 139 of 362 
 
that I have – I’ve seen is, Mr KaNozulu from Ambrobrite 
sends an email to Mr Massone with attachments and he 
says, attached to the invoice for the party and Mr Massone 
replies saying, he’ll take care of the payment and then 
later on Mr Massone says, proof of payment attached, 
indicating that Mr Massone or Bain had paid this amount.  
So, it’s R50 000 for a party that Bain is paying for and in 
the email, Mr KaNozulu invites Mr Massone to the party, 
but Mr Massone says he can’t make it but can you – Mr 
Massone writing,  
10 
“It would be great to greet the person, a new Youth 
League head, when he’s in Joburg”, 
 
And this – I’ve got no further fact on this, but we 
suspect who the Youth League might be around the same 
time the ANC Youth League had appointed a new President 
and so, for me, just – Bain is normally so careful  about 
being accountable and transparent with how money is 
spent.  So, this had nothing to do with client work this was 
a party that Bain had obviously agreed they were going to 
pay, Mr KaNozulu offers an explanation other than, oh 
20 
here’s the invoice which Mr Massone happily pays. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The R50 000 that couldn’t be for the – 
all 350 or was it for all 350 guests? 
MR WILLIAMS:   I’m sorry Chair, I missed that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The R50 000, initially I thought you said 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 140 of 362 
 
that was per person – no that’s for the whole party? 
MR WILLIAMS:   For the whole party, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Just to clarify that, Chair, would you 
look at page 260 Annexure AW46. 
CHAIRPERSON:   260? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Correct, it’s an invoice from an 
entity known as …[indistinct] Contracting and Trading it’s 
addressed to Mr Mandla Kwezwa who is that? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is another name by which Mr Mandla 
10 
KaNozulu goes by, I’m not sure which are his legal names, 
but those names seem to be used interchangeably, Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And that’s an amount of R50 000 for 
venue, catering, decorations, and tables, is that right? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That’s correct, Chair.  So, this is the 
invoice that is attached to that email from Mr KaNozulu to 
Mr Massone. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright, then looking at your 
statement again – affidavit, 68.2 page 36, the second of 
the 
unusual 
activities 
that 
you 
have 
identified 
is, 
20 
facilitating international government meeting and you talk 
of an email chain from 7 to 18 September indicating that 
Bain was facilitating meetings between South African and 
Italian Senior Police Officials, including Interpol.  Would 
you explain to the Chair what you found in that regard? 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 141 of 362 
 
MR WILLIAMS:   So, Chair, this to me was very bazaar, 
again…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you do that, I’m still trying to 
understand the point you make about the payment of R50 
000 being an unusual payment.  What’s the basis for 
saying, it was an unusual payment? 
MR WILLIAMS:   It’s – Bain provides advisory services to 
clients, 
clients 
pay 
Bain 
for 
those 
services, 
Bains 
expenses are normally staff and then the normal running of 
the business.  They were obviously paying for Ambrobrite’s 
10 
fees so that would be a payment. Why Bain would be 
paying for what might ostensibly be an ANC Youth League 
party, I can’t see what circumstance in Bain’s normal 
business would require them to pay for a party for the ANC 
Youth League, if indeed, this is a Youth League party. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, all you are saying is, why was Bain 
spending R50 000 on something that appeared to fall 
outside their contractual arrangement with Ambrobrite? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That’s correct Chair, and then the added 
concern, if it’s a political party, the payment to a political 
20 
party. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, if I could then just ask you to 
confirm certain propositions that you have made in your 
affidavit regarding the Ambrobrite relationship.  Please turn 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 142 of 362 
 
to paragraph 47 pages 27…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, I think I interrupted him before 
he could respond to your earlier question. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I’m sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, he…[intervenes]. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I’m sorry you hadn’t answered, 
please answer…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, he had not answered yet, ja, do you 
still remember it?  
MR WILLIAMS:   I do, yes paragraph 68.2 of my affidavit 
10 
which I’ve labelled, “facilitating international government 
meetings’, now, again I’m making this assessment that it’s 
unusual 
against 
what 
you 
normally 
would 
see 
a 
Management Consulting firm doing which is offering advice 
to its clients. It’s very possible, Chair, that a Management 
Consultant would arrange meetings in the context of the 
work it’s doing with its client.  I’ve done that, where I’ve 
said to a client, we can have an off-site meeting, my team 
will arrange the meeting we’ll see you there but what 
appears here, from this email chain is, Bain is arranging a 
20 
meeting between Senior South African Police Officials, so 
including Generals and – there’s General Zuma, the head 
of Special Projects within SAPS, General Naidoo the head 
of Interpol within SAPS and Senior Police Officials in the 
Italian Police Service.  So that just struck me as strange 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 143 of 362 
 
that Bain would be doing that and Mr Massone gives the 
instruction to his assistant to say, call these people to set 
these things up but they’re using us to arrange the 
meeting.  So, you can go through any website of Bain, look 
at any of Bain’s normal operations, what it does, it does 
not 
arrange 
international 
meetings 
between 
different 
governments and police departments. I think, actually, our 
government has Dirco to arrange international meetings 
and, 
in 
fact, 
within 
SAPS 
they’ve 
got 
international 
cooperation capability.  So, why would they then ask Bain 
10 
to do this and there’s been some interesting connections 
here because Mr Mandla KaNozulu, we learn, not only is he 
part of Ambrobrite, according to his own profile, is also an 
advisor to the Minister of Police.  So, again, I can’t 
speculate how this came about but I just looked at that 
happening, I thought that is very odd behaviour what I 
understand Management Consultants do. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you Chair I had then 
prematurely asked you to go to paragraph 47 on page 27 of 
your 
affidavit 
for 
your 
including 
submissions 
on 
the 
20 
Ambrobrite relationship and there you say, 
“By Bain’s own account Ambrobrite had no trading 
history, was unregistered and appeared to be non-
tax 
compliant 
with 
SARS, 
their 
tax 
clearance 
certificate 
was 
suspended 
by 
SARS 
as 
being 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 144 of 362 
 
fraudulent, 
and 
then 
I 
think 
the 
follow-up 
is, 
nonetheless they contacted with this entity”, 
 
From your experience with Bain, would that be a 
normal business event? 
MR 
WILLIAMS: 
 
 
Mr 
Chair, 
there 
obviously 
was, 
undoubtedly any organisation there are different viewpoints 
right, so I think that’s to be expected. I look at this, that 
when the head of finance or the senior finance person 
raises very real concerns, about this company that doesn’t 
exist virtually.  The head of marketing raises concern, the 
10 
head of legal globally raises a concern, they all seem to 
raise these concerns which in my mind says, well this 
contract shouldn’t have gone ahead but the fact it did go 
ahead meant, there was some debate somewhere, where 
some person more senior than the head of marketing global 
and the head of legal global overrode those concerns and 
for me that – the fact that someone senior overrides junior 
people, that does not concern me that might happen, just 
the nature of these concerns. So, the fact that they entered 
a contact despite these concerns, for me is extremely 
20 
unusual. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, then if you would look please 
to paragraph 51 on page 29, here you’ve made some 
observations about the way in which the contract was 
written and you have essentially said that this is not the 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 145 of 362 
 
type of wording or attention to detail that would normally 
be found in a Bain contract, is that correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That’s correct, Chair, there’s something, 
a phrase called Bain standard, is this Bain standard and as 
a junior consultant I had many managers throw documents 
at me saying, this is not Bain standard.  For me, this 
contract is not Bain standard, it just – I just wouldn’t 
recognise this document that Bain would, firstly, produce 
let alone sign. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Then please look at paragraph 52 
10 
also on page 29 and there you said that Bain were already 
working at Telkom where they expected in excess of 
R200million in fees for 2014 as Massone wrote to Meehan 
on 14 January 2014 and if I could ask you then to go to 
that Exhibit or Annexure rather, that’s at page 219, that’s 
an email from Mr Massone to Paul Meehan dated 18 
January 2014, I’m not sure if you’ve identified Mr Meehan 
before? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, Mr Paul Meehan was Mr Massone’s 
boss at the time, he’s also the person I wrote to right at 
20 
the beginning when I expressed concern to Bain about 
what was happening at SARS, it was the same Paul 
Meehan. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, if I could ask you then to look 
at paragraph 2 and paragraph 3 and 4 it appears that what 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 146 of 362 
 
Mr Massone is saying is that this is an important strategic 
initiative it’s not just about selling a couple of companies,   
“The decision with – the discussion with Boomer 
and the target SEO’s is consequent to a broader 
discussion on the country vision and strategy we 
had with the President which sees some of the 
SOE’s as keys to achieve change and economic 
development in the Country.  Zuma’s idea is to 
create a concrete legacy during his second mandate 
which will start in June this year.  The Phoenix 
10 
project was the first piece of this plan and where we 
were tested.  There are other fundamental pieces of 
that legacy which will involve the revenue service of 
SARS, the power company Eskom, and others.  
There are also other components of that legacy, 
policies, 
laws 
but 
we 
are 
clearly, 
much 
less 
involved on that.  Bain is key in the industrial 
component’, 
Can you summarise your understanding of what is 
being observed by Mr Massone? 
20 
MR WILLIAMS:   So, Chair, for me again a very concerning 
paragraph.  It seems to me that Bain had become President 
Zuma’s consultants of choice because Bain seems to have 
this 
assurance 
that 
they 
are 
key 
to 
whatever 
the 
President’s vision for the country is and his legacy.  Just to 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 147 of 362 
 
touch on some of the specifics there, there’s reference to 
project Phoenix and there are documents in my evidence 
relating to project Phoenix.  Project Phoenix, at the core of 
it, was Telkom. So, I mentioned earlier that Bain was 
involved in what was happening at Telkom. So, Mr Massone 
is saying to his boss, you know, we need this arrangement 
it’s part of our strategy we did this work with Telkom and 
the President when we were tested.  Now, again, I doubt 
the President was testing Bain’s technical skills, but we 
were tested, and we got the check mark for the work we did 
10 
at Phoenix, at Telkom and now we’ve got to target these 
other companies and enlist them, including SARS. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   In paragraph 3 of the same letter, he 
gives some figures which are attached to certain of the 
State owned enterprises.  Can you tell the Chair what 
those figures are and what you understand them to 
represent? 
MR WILLIAMS:   So, Chair, these figures would have been 
Mr Massone’s estimate of what fees Bain could earn from 
the work they could do at these State owned enterprises. 
20 
So, for example, you know, his expectation is that Bain 
could earn $10million a year at the Post Office, $3million a 
year at SARS. So, this would be – I don’t know how much 
rigour went into these numbers, it could have been based 
on actual discussions or it could be just his rough estimate 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 148 of 362 
 
of what they are but it’s clear that they had a plan to target 
these particular entities. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Then would you look at 53 of your 
affidavit page 30, there you’ve dealt with an issue of a 
relationship between the consulting company and the 
President of a country.  What is your experience of that 
and what is your comment in relation to the relationship 
that apparently existed between Bain and the President of 
South Africa at the time? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, in essence, my comment is, that it 
10 
is highly unusual for a Management Consultant to be 
meeting with the President of any country it’s just not the 
work that management consultants do. We typically work 
with Executives of companies and then we would work with 
State entities but on operational issues. Meeting with a 
Politician would be very unusual but no problem meeting 
with a President of a country, I’d love to advise the 
President of our country on some strategic issues but there 
would be no obvious gain for a Management Consultant to 
have a relationship with the President. The relationship 
20 
would be with DG’s as I said earlier or with the CEOs of 
State owned enterprises.  So, firstly, very strange meeting 
with the President. Meeting with the President at least 12 
times which is what happened, and I estimate it’s much 
higher than 12 times because Bain says its 12 times 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 149 of 362 
 
between 2012 and 2014 but they also say, there were 
meeting that went up to 2016. So, why would this unusual 
meetings be happening in that frequency all afterhours and 
behind 
closed 
doors 
or 
at 
the 
President’s 
official 
residence.  Again, I come to later where I express my 
guess at what might be happening but that, on the face of 
it just must raise our antennae of something very unusual 
going on. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right and then could I ask you, are 
you aware of any contract – consultancy contract between 
10 
Bain and the former President or Bain and the South 
African Government in relation to the former President, 
was there any contract? 
MR WILLIAMS:   No, Chair, I know of nothing formally 
between Bain and the former President. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Please then look at 57 on page 31 of 
the affidavit there you’ve said, 
“Through 
Ambrobrite’s 
“intelligence”, 
Bain 
understood 
that 
information 
regarding 
imminent 
leadership and strategic changes at SOE’s and 
20 
Government Agencies would be shared with them. 
One 
example 
of 
Ambrobrite 
deploying 
their 
intelligence on imminent leadership changes was 
their introduction to Bain of Mr Tom Moyane in 
October 2013.  The relationship had led to the 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 150 of 362 
 
supposed CEO coaching engagement that Bain had 
with 
Moyane 
for 
the 
year 
leading 
up 
to 
his 
appointment as Commissioner of SARS”. 
 
Now, I’ll flag that, we’ll get back to that in greater 
detail and then paragraph 58, is that essentially your 
conclusion on the Ambrobrite contract and what its real 
purpose was and if so, would you elucidate that for the 
Chair? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, if I just synthesise and it’s an 
obvious synthesis it appears to me that the real intent of 
10 
that contract between Bain and Ambrobrite was really to 
take advantage of Mr Ndlovu and Mr KaNozulu’s proximity 
to President Zuma and other senior Politicians and to use 
that to their advantage to gain non-public information to 
use to their commercial advantage and to gain access to, I 
think, consulting opportunities that took advantage of those 
relationships. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, earlier we looked at a release 
which was sent to all of the Bain team members, I also said 
that there were certain public statements that went out and 
20 
I’d like to take you to one of those which is AW45 on page 
252 right and in that press statement, Bain says a number 
of things but one of them is that Mr Massone showed poor 
judgement in drawing us into the SARS assignment. Now, 
could I ask you, in the light of the documentation that you 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 151 of 362 
 
have analysed, what your comment on that assertion is.  Is 
it you’re understanding that Bain was drawn into the SARS 
assignment by Massone? 
MR WILLIAMS:   The first part I would agree with that Mr 
Massone did, Chair, show poor judgement, I think many 
people in Bain showed poor judgement, not just Mr 
Massone. 
So, 
the 
second 
part 
of 
that 
statement 
I 
absolutely disagree with, it creates the impression that 
Bain, globally had no idea what was happening in South 
Africa and this lone rogue showed poor judgement to go 
10 
and contract with SARS get involved with Ambrobrite, get 
involved with President Zuma and had drawn us into this 
terrible situation, where I think emails and the documents 
so far we’ve discussed shows, that senior people at Bain’s, 
top leadership, knew what was happening, knew what Mr 
Massone was doing, they might not have known to the end 
detail that’s not required but they knew about the intent of 
this relationship, they knew what the relationship was 
meant to achieve.  So, this idea that they are shocked by 
what Mr Massone did seems – there’s no basis for that 
20 
claim. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right if I could then take you to the 
issue of the planning and the interactions between the Bain 
representatives and former President Zuma and also Bain 
and SARS prior to the appointment of, either Mr Moyane or 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 152 of 362 
 
Bain.  Just to orientate you, you know that SARS issued a 
request for proposal on the 12 t h of December 2014 and that 
followed on Mr Moyane being appointed as Commissioner 
on the 23 r d of September 2014 and Bain was awarded its 
first contract in January of 2015.  What I want to do is to 
take you to events prior to any of those key features in the 
chronology.  Firstly, meetings between Bain and the former 
President, you’ve already alluded to that and the number 
that took place.  Could I ask you to turn to AW52 at page 
306?  Now, that is a document headed, “tracker table” 
10 
meetings with former President Jacob Zuma where Vittoria 
Massone was present, you’re familiar with this document I 
take it? 
MR WILLIAMS:   I am Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Can you explain to the Chair how – 
sorry who it was compiled by and on the basis of what 
information? 
MR WILLIAMS:   So, Chair, this document was compiled by 
Bain’s legal team including Mr Chris Kennedy was the 
Senior Counsel or is the Senior Counsel for Bain as well as 
20 
representatives from Baker McKenzie.  So, these were the 
people who compiled this document, the context for this 
document was, after Mr Massone had testified before the 
Nugent Commission the Nugent Commission had sent Bain 
a number of questions and one was for asking for the 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 153 of 362 
 
details of Mr Massone’s meetings with President Zuma. So, 
this was an attempt by Bain and Baker McKenzie to answer 
that question, to get an understanding of the frequency and 
the context for the meetings between Bain and Baker – 
between Bain and President Zuma.  This document is 
compiled using Mr Massone’s memory, using Mr Massone’s 
diary, I think they might have accessed Mr Massone’s 
personal assistant as well, but it was an internal document 
to try and create this tabular form of when these meetings 
happened, who else was in those meetings, what was 
10 
discussed at those meetings. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   So, this is a work product of an 
investigation by Bain and/or its attorneys into the question 
whether Mr Massone met with former President Zuma and if 
so, on what dates and how many occasions? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That’s correct Chair, I’m not sure, I’m 
referring to Baker McKenzie as Bain’s attorneys I’m unsure 
about, I saw them as Bain’s investigators, investigating 
their work at SARS. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yet I think it is common cause that 
20 
they did carry out an assignment on behalf of Bain which 
was investigated, what happened at SARS.  By my account 
there are 17 odd meetings over the period 11 August 2012 
to July 2014 I think there – one has to read the 
commentary to see whether the degree of confidence at 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 154 of 362 
 
those meetings went ahead or not but take that as an 
approximate figure, 17 meetings over that period.  Do you 
know what the explanation was by Bain for so many 
meetings between its Senior South African representative 
and the former President? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, Bain’s explanation, starting with 
what Mr Massone has said in his affidavit was that these 
meetings were basically marketing meetings where Bain 
was seeking to display their capabilities to the President of 
South Africa.  So, this was not an intent to gain any 
10 
consulting work but merely to – as part of their strategy 
into the public sector to have the President aware of their 
capabilities. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And what’s your comment on the 
suggestion that it would take 17 odd meetings to market 
Bain to the former President? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Other than sort of laughing really loud 
and rolling on the ground, for me it’s absurd, it’s an absurd 
statement that, again, the reason why you want to be 
marketing your services to the President of the country 
20 
makes no sense.  Then taking 12 to 17 meetings to do that 
makes absolutely no sense.  The content of these meetings 
Chair, I’ve included some of the materials, the documents 
that were discussed suggest to me that these were not 
designed as marketing materials of their capabilities.  
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 155 of 362 
 
Another thing that strikes me as very odd is that they have 
removed 
their 
corporate 
identity 
from 
all 
of 
these 
documents.  Again, if I’m trying to market myself to your 
business for you to tell your friends about it, I’m going to 
put my logo and my content details, huge on this document 
but here again, very unusually Bain has removed all of 
their logos and names from these documents.  So, to me 
this strikes me as not, merely, marketing meetings to the 
President. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, then if I could ask you to look 
10 
at AW83 page 464 which is an email from Mr Massone who 
…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry Mr Franklin can we just have – 
I want to say 5 minutes to 10 minutes, but 5 minutes is too 
short.  So, let’s just make it 10 and then we resume, we 
adjourn.   
INQUIRY ADJOURNS    
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, continue.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you Chair.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Mr Williams I had been asking you 
about the meetings that had been taking place between 
former President Zuma and Mr Massone, as displayed in 
the tracker table.  I want to take you to an annexure which 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 156 of 362 
 
is AW83, page 464.  
 
That is an email from Mr Massone to Franson, 
Dutiro so Franson and Dutiro and to Nkano, all of Bain.  So 
if I could take them in turn, Mr Franson? 
MR WILLIAMS:  So Fabrice Franson is a partner at Bain.  
In fact he led the day to day operations of the Bain project 
at SARS. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Mr Dutiro, for the record DUTIRO? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair, Mr Dutiro at the time was a partner 
at Bain but he has subsequently left Bain. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And is it Ms Stefani Timpano, 
TIMPANO? 
MR WILLIAMS:  It is mister.  Mr Stefan Timpano is also a 
partner at Bain, was in Johannesburg and Lagos.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Right.  That was an email dated the 
26 t h of February 2014, the subject is: 
 
“Quick note, please keep confidential.” 
 
And Mr Massone says: 
 
“Guys, met president yesterday night in CT.” 
 
I presume that is Cape Town? 
20 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  “All good.  There was also a Tom (a 
guy we met via SARS) and it really seems he 
is getting that job after election.  He was very 
friendly with me and seems a smart guy to 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 157 of 362 
 
work with.” 
 
This appears to be evidence of the meeting in Cape 
Town between Mr Massone and the former president but 
why I highlighted it is that it appears that Bain were given 
information at this point that Mr Moyane is likely to get the 
SARS appointment.  
 
Is that how you saw it? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair.  So this meeting in 
Cape Town was between Mr Massone and the president.  
That ties up with the tracker table, that date and of course 
10 
Bain had met ... and of course Bain had met Mr Moyane in 
October 2013 already.  
 
So a few months before this meeting and that is 
why he is making reference to the guy RE SARS, but my 
understanding of this email is that Mr Massone was given 
some assurance or indication that Mr Moyane was going to 
get the SARS job, which is seven months before he is 
actually appointed.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, clearly in that second or third, the 
second line of the email refers to the person referred to as 
20 
Tom, as the guy they had met about SARS.  So they had 
met this Tom prior to this and probably prior to the meeting 
with the president, and they had met Tom about SARS, and 
then he says: 
 
“It really seems he is getting that job after 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 158 of 362 
 
elections.” 
 
And they were going to elections in 2014. 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  In South Africa, and Mr Tom Moyane was 
appointed in the second half of 2014 if I recall correctly? 
MR WILLIAMS:  September Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and Mr Pravin Gordon in his 
statement in evidence before the commission, said that as 
Minister of Finance between 2009 and 2014, he had or his 
department, national treasury had invited applications for 
10 
the position of Commissioner of SARS, and they had 
received the quite a high number of applications and he 
had then suggested to President Zuma that President Zuma 
since he was the one who had the power to appoint I think 
the Commissioner of SARS, that Zuma could consider 
following a transparent process for the appointment of the 
Commissioner of SARS and there was a shortlist of 
candidates 
that 
applied, 
but 
his 
evidence 
was 
that 
President Zuma had not followed that process.  
 
So it is just interesting that here, a number of 
20 
months before the appointment, Bain says they had met 
somebody they refer to as Tom and that they had met him 
with regard to SARS and they say it really seems as if he 
was going to get that job.  
 
Okay, we can proceed Mr Franklin. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366

ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Then please turn 
to paragraph 73, page 40 of your affidavit.  There you say 
that: 
“Between 2012 and 2015 Bain created a series 
of document, containing far reaching plans.”  
Do you have it Mr Williams?   
MR WILLIAMS:  I do Chair, thank you. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  “Far reaching plans to not only 
restructure certain government agencies and 
state owned enterprises but also to restructure 
10 
entire sectors of the South African economy, 
whilst claiming that such restructuring would 
offer 
economic 
benefits 
and 
service 
improvements to South African society, the 
consistent theme is that of restructuring, which 
in my view was aimed at bringing as many 
organisations and as many financial resources 
under more concentrated control which would 
greatly facilitate State Capture.” 
 
Now we will get to the plans now, but that is a far 
20 
reaching allegation to make.  On the strength of what do 
you make it? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair, I make that on or firstly I think it is 
apparent that I was not at any of these meetings.  I was 
not at Bain at the time and neither was I at any of these 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 160 of 362 
 
meetings.  What I did was took these documents that I had, 
that I had obtained in the cause of my oversight and began 
sort of stepping back and saying let me read through these 
documents one by one and just see what they tell me.  
 
It is using my management consulting expertise, 
using my business expertise, what themed jumped out to 
me and one immediately that jumps out, is that all of them 
talk about restructuring.  No matter what the question was, 
the answer always seem to be restructuring.  
 
The 
documents 
were 
not 
only 
talking 
about 
10 
restructuring organisations, in fact there are two occasions 
I recall, where they talked about restructuring entire 
industries.  So under this label that Bain used of reshaping 
the South African economy, again I would argue Chair not 
expertise and management consultants typically would 
have.  
 
You would expect an economist or policy advisor to 
be doing this, but the title on these documents were 
reshaping the South African economy.  Under that title, 
they talked about restructuring the entire IT and ICT 
20 
industry.   
 
So they were going to in their proposals, in 
documents, lump together restructure Telkom with SABC, 
with South African Post Office, with SENTEC.  Smash all of 
these together and their documents say one of the benefits 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 161 of 362 
 
of this is you centralise procurement and infrastructure 
spent.  
 
Another industry that proposed restructuring is the 
energy sector within South Africa.  So the proposal is take 
Eskom, Petro SA, talk about nuclear, travel gas.  Again, 
lump all of this together.  In the documents it says we 
replace the board of Eskom, you get a new executive, 
restructure 
it 
and 
so 
we 
can 
get 
everything 
more 
concentrated in my interpretation. 
 
So these two themes Chair, just seemed very 
10 
strange again to me.  One is everything was about 
restructuring and of course we know what happened at 
SARS was restructuring.  Now Chair, I do not know if this 
is the right point to mention this.  
 
As a management consultant and as anyone with 
common sense, restructuring an organisation is something 
you do with utmost care.  In fact, that is your last thing you 
want to do in an organisation, because any organisation 
like Eskom, like Telkom, like SARS they have been 
operating for decades.  
20 
 
The amount of institutional memory and knowledge 
that is imbedded in not documents, but in people’s minds 
and how they work together, how the organisation is 
structured, how it functions, that is how it works.  When 
you restructure an organisation, you break all of that.  
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 162 of 362 
 
 
You 
break 
those 
bonds, 
you 
break 
those 
relationships, you destroy the institutional memory.  So 
there are definite occasions where you want to structure an 
organisation but it is absolutely a last resort.  You always 
want to find other ways of improving before you get to 
restructuring.  
 
At the outset here, these proposals are all around 
state held enterprises and restructuring sectors.  On that 
basis I make this allegation that it appears to me that this 
was an attempt to restructure, I mean Bain calls it 
10 
reshaping the South African economy through restructuring 
organisations and sectors.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you.  These various plans that 
you have identified in paragraph 73.1 and 73.8, you have 
said at the beginning that Bain created these documents, 
is that correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Can I take you to the first of these, 
which is AW55, starting at page 318.  That is headed: 
 
“Sizikelo reshaping South African economy.” 
20 
 
Can you tell the Chair what that name is? 
MR WILLIAMS:  So Chair, this was precursor name to 
Project Phoenix, so this was later called Phoenix, which 
was this focus around reshaping the economy focussed on 
ICT.  
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 163 of 362 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  This is dated 11 August of 2012 and 
it contains a lot of detail but are you able for the benefit of 
the Chair to highlight specific parts of it, which are 
evidence of the conclusion which you draw and articulated 
to the Chair a few moments ago? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair, the documents contains a lot of 
sensible 
analysis. 
 
There 
are 
no 
doubt 
there 
are 
efficiencies to be gained from consolidating and it is 
pointed out in this document.  It is also pointed out in this 
document that bringing together some synergies across 
10 
these different entities would enable South Africa to 
leapfrog from a technology stand point, get through digital 
quicker and deploy broad band much quicker.  
 
All of those make sense but what is interesting, is 
the 
sort 
of 
lumping 
together 
of 
these 
different 
organisations.  Your bank says out of lumping these 
together we will get a people’s bank and we have heard, 
the Chair is laughing.  
 
I am trying to be serious.  We heard recently 
politicians talk about a state owned bank.  So it is, you 
20 
know these questions of where these plans went to I do not 
know, but take Telkom, Post Office, SADC, SETA, the state 
IT agency, SENTEC, put them together and you get out of 
that some technology company and some people’s bank 
and this is going to be better  for South Africa.  
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 164 of 362 
 
 
There is just no cogent argument for that.  there is 
an argument for the cost saving, there is an argument for 
the technology lead frog, but this idea of lumping entities 
together for me it makes no sense, and then Bain sort of 
does, I think this is the presentation where they pulled 
some global benchmarks, this might not be it, and again it 
might have been relevant for some other countries to have 
done this and [indistinct – 00:14:06] benefits, but these 
things have got to be very contextual.   
 
If you must take a solution from elsewhere and drop 
10 
it here, and here specifically they talk about a bank of the 
people.  Everyone receiving the same treatment and 
conditions.  Everything guaranteed by the state.  Chair, 
this does not sound like us developing and restructuring 
these sectors for the purpose and the benefit of South 
Africa.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Right, then can I ask you to look at 
the next plan in chronological order, which is AW56, 
starting at page 322 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Franklin.  Mr Williams, the 
20 
name Sizikelo, did you understand whether that was the 
name of the project or what was that? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That was the name of the project Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR WILLIAMS:  That later became Project Phoenix. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 165 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MR WILLIAMS:  I do not know what the word means.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I think it is a Zulu word, which 
means foundation.  Ja, okay let us continue.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you Chair, the next of the 
plans is AW56.  If you could look at page 323.  This one is 
headed: 
 
“Project 
Phoenix 
reshaping 
South 
African 
economy.” 
 
And it is dated 23 August 2012.  Do you have any 
10 
particular comment on this and does it take the previous 
plan forward?  Is it more of the same, or what is your 
analysis of it?   
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair, just two comments.  The one is as 
evidence suggests, this is taking the plan a bit forward.  A 
bit more analysis, a bit more numbers added to it.  
Importantly again Mr Maseko would have been part of 
these discussions.  
 
So this was Bain along with Mr Maseko developing 
these materials and presenting to the president. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that now it is called Project 
Phoenix? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, and you still say it is reshaping South 
African economy, so it looks like it is just a name that has 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 166 of 362 
 
changed?   
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And perhaps if we could look on page 
323, the question is why Phoenix and it is said underneath: 
 
“Giving birth to a rational and regional ICT 
champion." 
 
Then there are a number of bullet points, and 
underneath that: 
 
“Leapfrogging 
economic 
development 
and 
10 
transformation 
in 
urban 
/ 
rural 
areas 
for 
citizens and SCME’s.” 
 
The next is: 
 
“Creating 
a 
world 
class 
generation 
of 
professionals, 
engineers, 
technicians 
and 
world 
class 
infrastructure 
serving 
the 
businesses.” 
 
And fourthly: 
 
“Obtaining full potential, maximum synergies, 
efficiencies and economies of scale in the 
20 
businesses and investments operated by the 
government.” 
 
Do you care to comment on those objectives? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair, I think those objectives which I 
mentioned earlier, again one reads those and they make 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 167 of 362 
 
sense.  There is, on the face of it well Chair those are all 
the good things if we could achieve them.  I guess you 
know, economist, developing economists and policy people 
I 
speak 
to 
say 
they 
are 
restructuring 
and 
lumping 
everything together is not the way you achieve those, but 
those will be great objectives for our country.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Right.  The next one is AW57 at page 
335 and at page 336.  Once again it is Project Phoenix, 
reshaping South African economy.  This time it is dated 
September of 2012.  I imagine this is a further iteration of 
10 
the previous plans, but are there once again any particular 
features that you wish to highlight for the Chair? 
MR WILLIAMS:  I think Chair, perhaps it is two pictures.  
The one is in the bottom left of page 336, the one titled 
overall Phoenix operating model, and that is where we 
begin to see the vision of how these five or six different 
state owned entities are imagined to be sort of broken to 
pieces and reassembled like a puzzle into this operating 
model and I do not understand all of the intents of these 
blocks, but one gets the sense that this is how they 
20 
imagined breaking them up and putting them back together 
again.   
 
In one of these documents, I think it is this one 
where again, they identify one of the opportunities is to 
centralise 
procurement. 
 
So 
again, 
given 
the 
large 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 168 of 362 
 
infrastructure spent across these entities, your efficiencies 
will come from better procurement effectively. 
 
So procurement seems to have been a big focus of 
these, the second picture is on the page over, on page 
337, titled Phoenix players overview.  Which is just 
showing the six companies, the six state owned companies 
and Telkom is a partly state owned, but just overview again 
of those six companies.  
 
Those are the six we were looking at, and looking at 
consolidating.  
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Are those the same six that you 
identified earlier? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair.  So if I may Chair, I 
spoke 
earlier 
about 
just 
the 
common 
wisdom 
in 
management strategy circles, around restructuring.  I 
mentioned earlier just the way we would typically think 
about it.  
 
With regard to putting different businesses together, 
again the common wisdom is there has got to be real 
strategic synergies and so I look at the post office and an 
20 
SABC.  For me those are very different businesses.  They 
do very different things.  
 
Yes, they have got a technology element, but that is 
... they are different audiences, different businesses, 
different pricing models.  So just the idea of lumping them 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 169 of 362 
 
together because you can get some efficiencies, for me as 
a management consultant that did not seem like it stat like 
the justification for lumping them together.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Moving forward in the chronology, 
AW58, page 346 is a plan dated the 25 t h of April 2013 
headed: 
 
“Infrastructure development in South Africa.  
Holistic 
approach 
to 
infrastructure 
development, initial considerations.” 
 
Again, is this a further iteration of the same ideas, 
10 
targeting the same companies?   
MR 
WILLIAMS: 
 
Chair, 
so 
this 
is 
a 
different 
plan 
altogether.  So this is no longer linked to ICT.  This is 
looking at the broader spectrum of infrastructure in the 
country 
and 
how 
we 
could 
improve 
delivery 
of 
infrastructure in the country, linked to things like railways 
and ports, aviation, energy etcetera, but I have got nothing 
more to add to this, other than it was yet another plan. 
 
You will see it is another plan, this sort of wild 
pictures everywhere that to me are sensible in some sense, 
20 
but do not lead to a conclusion that says we must go and 
restructure our entire infrastructure sector.  
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of the chronology, I see that at 
page 346 that is dated 25 April 2013.  Do you recall 
whether by that time Bain had had quite a few meetings 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 170 of 362 
 
with President Zuma, or you might not recall?   
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair, so all of these documents were 
presented to President Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, before ... afterwards or before that 
date?  I am trying to look at it ...[intervenes]  
MR WILLIAMS:  These documents were presented to 
President Zuma in the meeting.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, and the meeting is said to have been 
in April 2013? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Ja, ja.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR WILLIAMS:  Ja, so this indicates, that was the date of 
the meeting.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Perhaps I could just for the Chair ’s 
benefit go back to the tracker table at page 306.  There 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Chair, you will see the table which 
has on the left hand side the dates of the meetings and 
20 
then it has location listed attendees, and further detail and 
you will see that they begin in August of 2012.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, August 2012.  Official resident of 
the president, ja.  Massone, Zuma, Zuma, Sipho Maseko.  I 
do not know what the heading is before or above Sizikelo 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 171 of 362 
 
and then says which became known as Project Phoenix 
from 2013.   
 
I do not know what the heading is meant to be.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  It is on the previous page, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It talks about what the meeting was 
about? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what he ...[intervenes]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  That is right, it is on the previous 
page, the headings.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay, okay.  So 11 August 2012 and 
then 17 August, that is like a week later and the 12 t h, 
meeting involving President Zuma, Gabu Mabuza and 23 
August, that is another week later, a meeting at the official 
residence of the president.  
 
They have got Massone, Zuma, Zuma, Mabuza, 
Maseko.  That was quite a number of meetings at close 
intervals.  Okay, no thank you Mr Franklin.  I wanted to 
check.  So that has answered.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Yes, thank you.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And they run all the way through 
2012, 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  2014. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 172 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  As you will see on page 308.  Alright, 
then continuing with the next, if I may.  AW59, page 358.  I 
am sorry, AW yes 59, page 358.  Can you explain what that 
particular plan is please? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair, we see again the same labels.  
Project Phoenix, reshaping South African economy, but 
now you have noticed it on a Telkom branded document, 
and it is again because Telkom is central to Project 
Phoenix.   
10 
 
Again if we refer back to the tracker table, either Mr 
Maseko would have been at this meeting or Mr Jabu 
Mabuza.  So this is Mr Maseko is now in the job.  He is 
appointed as Telkom CEO in April of 2013.  This is August 
2013, and in the tracker table Mr Massone says this 
meeting was held to give the president an update.  
 
Now that Mr Maseko was in the job, to give the 
president an update on Project Phoenix.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I saw that in the meetings that we just 
had a look at in August 2012, I think I looked at three 
20 
which involved Mr Zuma as president, that there seems to 
have been no minster.  There was no minister of public 
enterprises under which I guess, I do not know whether 
Telkom 
will 
fall 
under 
that 
or 
under 
minister 
of 
communications, but there seems to have been no minister 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 173 of 362 
 
in each one of those three meetings.  
 
You have looked at maybe many of them.  Do you 
recall seeing any minister being present? 
MR WILLIAMS:  So Chair, the fact that no minister is listed 
there, my interpretation is it does not mean there was no 
minister at this meeting.  So this would be Bain and Baker 
McKenzie putting this document together based on the 
source I mentioned earlier.  
 
Part of my plea to Bain is to make full disclosure so 
they can know who was in the meetings, but beneath this 
10 
table, this tracker table, there is a list of ministers that 
Bain did present materials to.  So it lists there minister 
Malusi Gigaba, Minister of Police.  
 
So beneath that table, if you can take us to the 
table ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me, before you go there, I just want 
to understand what you are saying.  You are saying the 
fact that in the blocks that we looked at, no minister is 
mentioned.  It does not mean that at those meetings there 
was no minister.  
20 
 
So my question would be if you are going to put in 
the name of the president and you are going to put in the 
name of the CEO of the relevant SOE like Telkom and Mr 
Maseko, why are you not going to put in the name of the 
minister under whom Telkom falls, if the minister was 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 174 of 362 
 
present?   
MR WILLIAMS:  Ja, as I am saying I cannot definitively 
say, I say we did not draw the conclusion that because no 
minister ’s name was there on this page, there was no 
minister in the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no in principle you may be right.  
That is if there is a proper explanation to say the only 
people we have decided to record ...[intervenes]  
MR WILLIAMS:  Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Are the following and for this reason you 
10 
know, but if there is in the absence of any explanation one 
would imagine that there was no minister since you do not 
mention the minister, but you mention the president 
politician.  
 
Why do you not mention another politician?  You 
mention the head of Telkom, CEO.  Why do you not 
mention the minister under whom Telkom falls?  But it may 
well be that somebody can come up and say look, there 
was a reason why and here is the reason.  
 
But you were saying that they mention ministers 
20 
somewhere, is that right? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair, so I agree with your 
assessment of that topic.  Beneath the tracker table there 
were a number of minister listed that Bain affirmed that 
they had had meetings with. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 175 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR WILLIAMS:  Also discussing this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but where the Ministers are referred 
to is there suggestion that they were Ministers who were 
present at the meetings you are talking about? 
MR WILLIAMS:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or they might have met them separately? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Just to follow on Chair for your benefit 
10 
if I may take the witness back to the tracker table and in 
particular to page 308 at the very end of the table there is a 
note by the author. 
“Please note we also located a number of 
documents 
that 
we 
presented 
to 
other 
Ministers 
as 
part 
of 
Bain’s 
client 
development push into the public sector.  Mr 
Massoni was present at these meetings 
although Zuma was not for the sake of 
complete transparency a list in included 
20 
below.” 
And there is reference to the Secretary of Defence also Dr 
Zweli Mkezi and also Minister Jeff Radebe.  So there are 
other Ministers referred to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But also – but also I see in the 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 176 of 362 
 
meetings that are mentioned at page 308 April, May, June, 
July of 2014 in the relevant columns although they mention 
00:01:23 Massone, Zuma, Duma at the top they do say 
people who were in attendance, Massone cannot recall the 
identities of the other participants.  So – so it goes to the 
point we making that the – if they did not recall the names of 
other people it is just that it would be strange if you do not 
recall the name of the Minister.  But maybe they did not you 
know the focus may have been on the President.  Okay.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Then proceeding 
10 
with the next of these plans AW60 page 370 this one is 
headed Developing the SNME Sector and it is dated… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  It is 370. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  That is dated 22 May 2014 this seems 
to be concentrating on a different sector the first time.  What 
is your take on this particular plan? What was its content 
and objective? 
MR 
WILLIAMS:  Chair nothing jumped out from this 
20 
particular plan.  It is sort of – these are very high level, very 
sort of obvious things for one to consider in thinking what a 
SME sector … 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Alright let us not dwell on that one.  
The next one is AW61 page 374.  This one is the – is entitled 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 177 of 362 
 
Sirius – S-i-r-i-u-s Program reshaping South Africa’s energy 
sector and this is dated June of 2014.  And once again this 
is a new sector that we have not seen before.  Is that 
correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair and here they talking 
about the energy sector transformation.  And this is the one I 
mentioned earlier of putting Eskom and PetroSA and other 
together.  I will try and find that page –  
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that here it says at page 374 Sirius 
Program reshaping South Africa’s energy sector.  Is that like 
10 
now a sub item under Project Phoenix? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is not my understanding Chair of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR WILLIAMS:  So Project Phoenix was specifically around 
ICT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR WILLIAMS:  And then Sirius was energy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR WILLIAMS:  As I understood it.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So would this be a program on its own?  A 
20 
separate on its own for the energy sector? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Correct Chair as I understand it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Then we have another Project Phoenix 
plan AW62 page 386 and the heading on the top left is 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 178 of 362 
 
Phoenix a fundamental program for a developmental state.  
As far as you know is that a later iteration of the earlier 
manifestations of this plan? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair.  It is again a further 
development of the Phoenix Plan. The point we have got to 
here is projections of the amount – the investment that might 
be required to make Phoenix happen.  So for example on 
page 387 the bottom left hand picture Bain estimates that we 
might have to spend R140 billion on broadband infrastructure 
R40 – R50 billion on e-government etcetera.  Chair if I may 
10 
and again this is not premature in our conversation your 
question about Ministers being at these meetings there is – 
if you looked at these document and some of the emails 
there is something that Bain calls or refers to as a President 
Project.  Bain describes their work on Project Phoenix and 
with Telkom as  a President’s Project or a President’s 
Program and in an internal email Mr Masonne explains to his 
Bain colleagues what a President’s Program is and what a 
benefit of having any project designated a President’s 
Project.  And his description to his colleagues is that a 
20 
President’s Project allows you to circumvent the Minister and 
perhaps we will get – and perhaps we will get to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.   
MR WILLIAMS:  So I can then double speculate – there is a 
speculation that why Ministers might not have been at these 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 179 of 362 
 
meeting because these were President’s Projects that only 
require Bain and the relevant CEO at those meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Yes we will refer you to that at the 
appropriate time.  Then just finishing off on these plans we 
have a different one AW64 page 400 this one is headed 2014 
ANC Manifesto implementation discussion on way forward 
dated April of 2014.  This would appear to be something 
quite unconnected with the South African economy and to be 
focussed rather on a political party in the country.  Is that 
10 
content of the plan? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair.  It is again a 
departure from what Bain normally do, what you would 
expect Bain normally to be doing also departure from some 
of it other plans now clearly Bain is working with the ANC a 
political party to further their objectives. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And there is a – at this juncture if I 
could refer you to an email which is AAW63 page 398 which 
is sent from Mr Kampano to Messrs Min and Kennedy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what page? 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  It is 398 Chair – 398. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And the subject is ANC Manifesto 
documents and then it says: 
“This Stuart Chris attached the ANC documents prepared by 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 180 of 362 
 
Bain 2014 period at the time VM was helping some ANC 
officials which I do not know the name to reorganise their 
“agenda” and clarify ANC priorities.  Again not my work had 
access to them because asked about my opinion about it.  
The two persons working on it were Alexis and Mondi both 
left.” 
So this is Stephan Kampano writing to Stuart and Chris, is 
that right? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair.  And Stuart and Chris 
are Bain’s legal executives. 
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Right we have dealt with AW64 then 65 
is another ANC manifesto plan AW65 page 408.  This one is 
now dated the 23 rd of May 2014.  So it would appear to be 
the same topic just a later version of that plan.  Is that 
correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And then AW66 .. 
MR WILLIAMS:  Mr 00:09:14 just – yes he would have… 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Just a second. 
MR WILLIAMS:  Apology Chair.   
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Yes please do. 
MR WILLIAMS:  If I could go to page 406 of this ANC 
manifesto document at the bottom right – the picture on the 
bottom right it says: 
“A delivery agency could be set up to overcome execution 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 181 of 362 
 
roadblocks.” 
And my understanding of what is conceived with this special 
delivery agency is that it sits outside of the executive as 
described here and reports direct – gets its authority from 
the President and so remember this is the ANC manifesto 
implementation. The idea is that the President sets up the 
special delivery agency filled with people who can then deal 
with execution roadblocks as they describe and some of their 
powers are that they can approve projects, they can 
supervise project budgets, they can potentially has the 
10 
powers to intervene in cases of failure and even take over 
execution within Ministries of these projects. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Can you identify for the Chair where 
you are reading from? 
MR WILLIAMS:  It is page 406 the picture on the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bottom left. 
MR WILLIAMS:  Bottom right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh bottom right. 
MR WILLIAMS:  Titled A Delivery Agency could be set up to 
overcome execution roadblocks. Now again I do not know if 
20 
this delivery agency was actually set up Chair this is a plan 
and a proposal but it tells us how some of the thinking 
around what was intended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see that – that reflects a direct line 
from the President to the CEO of – or from the CEO to the 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 182 of 362 
 
President without intervention of a Minister so which seems 
to suggest that they would be that direct link.  It is like the 
CEO would report to the President. 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Alright and then the last of this set of 
plans I would ask you to look at AW65 at page 408.  Do you 
have that? 
MR WILLIAMS:  I do. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  This is reshaping South African 
10 
economy and this is March of 2014.  It would appear that this 
is a later iteration of earlier documents of the same theme, is 
that right? 
MR WILLIAMS:  The ANC Manifesto? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  No I am talking about the Reshaping 
South African Economy page 415. 
MR WILLIAMS:  415.  That is correct Chair.  So we back to 
this sort of broad talking about reshaping the South African 
Economy but importantly and in my opinion more disturbingly 
the proposal is to discuss a central procurement capability 
20 
within government.  And I can add more thought to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And where do you see that?  Where do 
you identify that? 
MR WILLIAMS:  It is right below the title Reshaping South 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 183 of 362 
 
African Economy on page 415.  There is a sub title.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Then those words Reshaping South African 
Economy were they not the same words that came after 
Sisecelo and after Phoenix earlier in earlier documents? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so they are now without either Phoenix 
or Sisecelo but the same matter – issue? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Subject. 
MR WILLIAMS:  Correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  But it seems that the focus is on 
procurement. 
MR WILLIAMS:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR WILLIAMS:  Procurement across government. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja.  It should be centralised. 
MR WILLIAMS:  Correct. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And you wanted to make observations 
about the idea of a central procurement service what are 
those observations? 
20 
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair again there are – there are cases 
where as I have said before centralising consolidated makes 
sense.  There might even be countries although therefore 
very 
few 
countries 
with 
centralised 
entire 
national 
government spend across their ministries in one place.  I 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 184 of 362 
 
mean it goes against all governance and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just sounds so foreign to me.   
MR WILLIAMS:  Well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you look at all government departments, 
nationally, provincially, local government everything being 
centralised in terms of procurement. 
MR WILLIAMS:   I think the USSR did it.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WILLIAMS:  But again this sort of level of absurdity of 
centralising in one place especially in the context again of 
10 
state capture where you say how easy would this have been, 
now it is so hard to go to Eskom and Transnet and everyone 
else let us just put it all in one place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I know it might be easy for whoever 
wants to put in bids for tenders to say we will go to one 
place maybe if we get the tender we get the tender for the 
entire procurement in the country.  But in terms of actual 
service delivery it must be – it could lead to serious delays 
and blockages I would think and inefficiencies.  Okay alright 
yes. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Alright could I ask you to draw certain 
conclusions from the plans which we have been through with 
reference to your affidavit firstly at paragraph 75 page 42?  
Para 75 page 42.   
MR WILLIAMS:  Sorry.    
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 185 of 362 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And there what you say Mr Williams is: 
“Judging by the content of these eleven 
documents that I have reviewed and attached 
it appears that Bain represented by Massone 
met with Zuma to discuss, develop and 
strategize the execution of these plans to 
reshape our economy and elements of our 
government.” 
So that is a conclusion which you reached.  And then if we 
could jump down the paragraph about ten lines from the 
10 
bottom you say 
“The identical approach was followed with 
Moyane and SARS.  Bain developed the 
SARS restructuring plan with Moyane which 
Moyane presented to the President most 
likely with Bain in attendance.” 
And then you have referred to Mr Massone’s partner – I am 
sorry yes partner self-assessment form which is AW67 and I 
would like to turn to AW67 please which is at page 420.  
While you looking can you confirm that this is a procedure 
20 
which Bain has in place i.e. assessment no doubt annually or 
perhaps more frequently of partners and as part of that a 
partner would do a self-assessment? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair.  So there is annual 
process where the first step of your assessment is you 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 186 of 362 
 
yourself assess your performance.  Each partner has a set of 
targets and goals for the year so effectively you just assess 
yourself against those targets then others will comment and 
refine that assessment. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  So let us look at Mr Masonne’s 
assessment for December of 2013 and over the page on 
page 421 the second paragraph it says the following: 
“As” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say page 421? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  That is correct 421 second paragraph 
10 
starting as a halo effect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  He says: 
“As a “halo effect” of the relationship with 
Sipho and the role we played in the Phoenix 
Project we have been involved in preparing a 
high level outside in “strategic turnaround” 
document 
on 
the 
SA 
Revenue 
Services 
SARS. 
 
The 
person 
we 
prepared 
the 
document with and who pitched it to the SA 
20 
President 
is 
most 
likely 
going 
to 
be 
appointed as Commissioner in the next few 
weeks/moths and Bain will be assisting him 
should he get the job.  SARS is one of the 
largest and highly estimated government 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 187 of 362 
 
agencies and a large Bain client in the 
previous dispensation (the ‘90’s).” 
Can you please just elucidate for the Chair what you 
understand Mr Massone to be confirming at that point in time 
December of 2013? 
MR WILLIAMS:  So Chair my understanding of the reference 
to Sipho firstly that is Mr Sipho Maseko just in the context of 
Phoenix obviously and Mr Massone’s saying to his bosses 
the benefit of us having built this great relationship with Mr 
Maseko and having implemented Project Phoenix was that it 
10 
led us to this other new relationship with SARS. And Chair 
importantly here and I know we will discuss the relationship 
between Bain and Mr Moyane later.  Mr Masonne is not 
describing to his bosses that he offered coaching to Mr 
Moyane.  No point does he actually make reference to 
coaching here.  He is saying we developed a strategic 
turnaround document for the South African Revenue Service.  
He also say this was developed with Mr Masonne – Mr 
Moyane and that Mr Moyane pitched this document to the 
President presumably to get the job.  And so in my mind this 
20 
talks about one the relationship with Mr Maseko and the 
benefit Bain saw that into SOE’s and state organs but also 
this relationship with Mr Moyane was one where Bain had 
developed a strategic turnaround document for SARS before 
either Mr Moyane or Bain were at SARS. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 188 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now this what he is saying here at page 
421 is that – is he saying that in effect on the 6t h of 
December 2013 which is about what nine months, ten months 
before Mr Moyane was appointed Commissioner of SARS so 
he is already saying at that time 6 December 2013 Mr 
Moyane had already pitched the document to the President, 
is that right? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair.  So this is even 
earlier the email you read earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is in February 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Bain had some indication. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR 
WILLIAMS: 
 
That 
Mr 
Moyane 
was 
going 
to 
be 
commissioner. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WILLIAMS:  This is even earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja this is even earlier.  Okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you Chair.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this is – this is while Mr Gordhan was 
still Minister of Finance 2013 – ja okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Then I wish to take you to another 
paragraph in which you have drawn conclusions and that is 
para 82 on page 45.  82 page 45.  There you say: 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 189 of 362 
 
“Though interspersed with some sensible 
analysis what emerges from a closer review 
of the eleven strategic planning documents 
described above is a strategy to enable 
grand scale state capture a pattern now well 
known to South Africa.” 
Is that a conclusion to which you ascribe and stand? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair I do.  On my reading of those 
documents and those plans as I described earlier the 
commission had asked me to offer and this is my opinion. 
10 
This is my opinion on reading those documents it appears to 
me that this was not just marketing between Bain and the 
President that there was some planning going on – what 
planning was going on it was not planning to improve service 
delivery at a grassroots level it was planning around 
restructuring sectors and state enterprises. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  What you then do is to set out your 
understanding of the strategy we need not go through it if – 
but I wish to just highlight the various stages that you have 
identified.  You say Stage A is create a new macro structure 
20 
in the target sector and then you have various steps 
underneath 
that. 
 
Stage 
B 
restructure 
individual 
organisations within the macro structure and Stage C exert 
control of the reshaped economy through control of those 
repurposed 
organisations 
and 
pursue 
private, 
financial 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 190 of 362 
 
enrichment through corrupt procurement or other means. 
 
Now did you see in the plans that we have identified 
for the Chair and which you have been through do you see 
elements of these stages and if so can you expand? 
MR WILLIAMS:  Chair I absolutely do. So I firstly developed 
obviously there is no document that states this plan I 
synthesize it from reading the documents and plans but then 
I went back to the documents again and said can I justify my 
assessment of the plans?  And you look at it you – if I go to 
page 47 paragraph 85 of my document I look at Project 
10 
Phoenix for example but can we see this three stage plan in 
Project Phoenix?  Well Project Phoenix is about restructuring 
the entire ICT sector well to me that Stage A of my plan.  My 
plan says or my assessment of the plan says restructure the 
entire sector first.  Well Bain is proposing restructure the 
entire ICT sector.  Stage B of my plan says restructure 
entities within the macro structure.  Well Project Phoenix 
again Bain talks about creating a bank of the people a 
separate TV company or radio company.  That is within the 
macro structure restructure then.  Then Bain talks about 
20 
appointing a new CEO and Chair of those companies and 
again we look at the appointment of the new CEO and Chair 
of Telkom. So in my mind it is not perfect – a perfect match 
but you can see elements of this plan at play in both Project 
Phoenix particularly around Telkom and then the energy plan 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 191 of 362 
 
which was again lump everything together, restructure 
Eskom.  The proposal is new chairman, new CEO and 
Chairman of Eskom.  So again put in a line management and 
then we look at the same plan at SARS. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Thank you then paragraph 87 on page 
47 you have expressed a further view which really takes us 
to what the Chair what had asked you and it is this.   
“If Bain was genuinely developing ideas to 
improve certain SOE’s or sectors of our 
economy I would expect that they would 
10 
present 
such 
plans 
to 
the 
DG 
of 
the 
appropriate ministry or the minister not to the 
president.”   
But just pausing there it appears that what the Chair had 
raised with you earlier is the sentiment that you have 
recorded here. 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  And then carrying on with para 87. 
“But there seems to have been a very 
specific 
beneficial 
reason 
for 
presenting 
20 
these to the President that one might not 
ordinarily expect.  It is suggested in the 
Phoenix document and the energy sector 
strategy document that these projects be 
designated a President’s Program.” 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 192 of 362 
 
Again that is a concept which you referred to earlier they are 
referred to in those documents and then you continue. 
“The significance of designating a project in 
this way is gleaned from an email that 
Masonne sent on 18 May 2014 to a group of 
global Bain partners after his meeting with 
Monwabisi Kalawe then CEO of SAA.” 
And then you have quoted from Annexure AW76.   Right I 
think that is self-explanatory but would you perhaps just 
elucidate for the Chair you have referred earlier to the 
10 
significance of designated a project as a President’s Project 
but in a word what is the benefit of it? 
MR WILLIAMS:  I think essentially it just – it removes 
governance and oversight.  It allows SOE’s or state organs 
to go direct to the President bypassing what Mr Masonne 
describes as the Ministers discretionary power to eliminate 
that deal directly with the President. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:  Let us go to AW76 page 447.  That is 
the email which is sent by Masonne to various addressees 
the subject is SAA and the date is 18 May 2014.  Please look 
20 
at the last paragraph on page 447.   
“The immediate concern for him which will maybe 
slow down the process in the next couple of weeks is 
the whole government issue – sorry governance 
issue. Both his board (change/add members modified 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 193 of 362 
 
DOA) and even before that his reporting minister 
(Public Enterprises).  I am told there is going to be a 
change and that they will try to make this a 
“President’s Project“ like Telkom so as to eliminate 
the Ministers discretionary power.” 
That is what you referring to? 
MR WILLIAMS:  That is exactly Chair.  So the context of this 
email was that Bain had met with the SAA CEO to do some 
work there.  The SAA CEO had raised concerns and Mr 
Masonne is reporting back to his colleagues saying but we 
10 
will  - they are working on it – I do not know who the they is 
but they are working on making SAA project a President’s 
Project and as you know from our Telkom experience once 
the President’s Project we can circumvent the Ministers 
discretionary power.  So this was an effort - they were not 
going to do this at SAA.  It is also present in those 
documents we discussed earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, one continuous to wonder 
why they had identified there to be a need to dispense with 
the ministers.  Why it was important to them that it should 
20 
be a President’s programme without a minister because I 
would imagine it could be a President’s programme with 
the minister.  Ja, I guess you might not be able to say 
anything about it. 
MR WILLIAMS:   I think it is... Chair, answer that... so as 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 194 of 362 
 
to eliminate the minister ’s discretion... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is what I am talking about.  
Why it was ...[intervenes]  
MR WILLIAMS:   Why ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Why it was important that the minister ’s 
power be eliminated.  Ja. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Why would you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Why would you that might be 
Mr Williams? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR WILLIAMS:   I got no idea Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MR WILLIAMS:   A lot of...  I have expressed a lot of 
opinion which a lot of people have said makes me a very 
bad person already.  So I am not going to... on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR WILLIAMS:   ...a thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no.  That is fine. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Could I take you out of the SARS 
20 
Bundle 01 just for a moment?  Chair, I understand you 
would have the Bain application before you which is SEQ-
44/2020. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Somebody must make sure you have got 
the bundle.  Somebody must make sure Mr Williams, the 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 195 of 362 
 
witness, has got the relevant bundle.  They are normally 
put behind the witness.  I think Mr Williams has seen other 
witnesses doing that. [laughs]  Look at the back. 
MR WILLIAMS:   They are discriminating Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja...  But you see, if you put them far 
from him, it is going to take longer and delay us whereas if 
they are all close to him it is going to be easy.  They will 
bring it to you Mr Williams. 
MR WILLIAMS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, Chair.  I think I sprung 
10 
those on the team, I am afraid.   
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  What page is it? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   So the affidavit that I wish to refer to 
is the affidavit of Mr Min which starts at SEQ-44/2020, 
page 10.  That is the beginning of the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So ...[intervenes]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And I wanted to take ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 10? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I wish to take the witness to page 
50.  You will see at the top of the page. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just hang on one second Mr Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Looking at the red numbers here, is that 
right? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   That is correct.  Top right-hand side. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 196 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And this would be page 50? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which is page 41 of the affidavit. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I just wish to direct the witness’s 
attention to what Bain have said in their application to 
cross-examine... 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   At 89, they say: 
10 
“It became clear that Mr Massone had met with 
Mr Zuma on multiple occasions. 
Although Bain was aware that Mr Massone had 
met Mr Zuma, we did not know the number or 
extent of those meetings...” 
 
And then in 90: 
“Mr Williams is right that Mr Massone pitched 
a number of ideas to the former President, 
Mr Zuma...” 
 
And the he says: 
20 
“When 
I 
first 
found 
these 
documents 
in 
September 2018, I described in a letter to the 
Nugent Commission as ideas for improving the 
well-being 
of 
the 
people 
of 
South Africa 
whereas Mr Williams describes a more sinister 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 197 of 362 
 
purpose to them...” 
 
And then over the page, still in paragraph 90, 
what Mr Min says: 
“Certainly, there is nothing in the documents 
themselves 
that 
suggests 
that 
they 
were 
intended for any criminal or unlawful purpose. 
Mr 
Williams 
identifies 
the 
proposal 
for 
centralised procurement agency in particular 
as evidence of attempts to help repurpose 
public entities and to enable state capture (the 
10 
so-called Big Scheme). 
As Mr Massone explains that the central 
procurement agency was based on a model 
operative in Italy where governance supply 
chains are centralised to take advantage of 
economies of scale and thereby derived on 
prices. 
This explanation is far removed from the 
intentions that Mr Williams attributes to the 
idea but I accept that only Mr Massone can 
20 
speak to this directly...” 
 
Just to pause there.  If I could get your 
response.  Essentially, I understand Bain through Mr Min to 
be saying nothing untoward at all about the series of 
meetings between Mr Massone and the former President. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 198 of 362 
 
 
And there is nothing untoward about the content 
of any of the plans and indeed the one particular relating 
to the central procurement agency is simply based on a 
model which is operated in Italy. 
 
So a benign stance is put on it or benign stance 
is put forward.  What is your response to that? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, it seems or firstly, as I have said, 
mine is an interpretation of what I observed with no given 
intent other than what I observed.  I – the fact that this 
happens in Italy, for me, is irrelevant in this context.  I am 
10 
not even sure what really happens in Italy from what I can 
tell.  But the fact that it is Italy, for me, it is completely 
irrelevant about whether it would work here.  It is – the 
context in which it is happening.   
 
One.  Who we were discussing this with.  Two.  
The fact that this is a set of discussions that are 
happening with our President after hours, behind closed 
door.  That means, it is not in Mr Massone’s diary even 
labelled “meeting with the President”.  It is ubaba or...  
That sort of – what is in his diary.   
20 
 
That is why no one can tell exactly whether 
these things happened or not.  It shows a level of 
familiarity.  The context of these meetings, the frequency 
of them, the nature of them, for me says, you cannot just 
denying explanation on them.   
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 199 of 362 
 
 
A central procurement agency... they offer Italy 
as an example.  I think some people might describe Italy 
as quite a corrupt country.  So it is strange that that will be 
the example they used.  The fact is, there are very few 
countries in the world that centralise their procurement 
across government.  It makes no sense to me at all.   
 
So I would reject this benign explanation of it 
because the way it is described, what is trying to achieve 
in terms of restructuring and consolidation, the fact that it 
has been presented to the President, to me, it is not 
10 
benign at all. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, thank you.  If we could go...  
You could perhaps put that file to one side and go back to 
SARS 1, Bundle 1.  And I am now going to take you to 
various plans which relates to SARS specifically.   
 
And if I could start that process by directing your 
attention to AW-68, page 423 which is an email from Mr 
Duma Ndlovu to Mandla KaNozulu and Massone, dated the 
22 n d  of May 2014. 
 
The 
subject 
is, 
Meeting 
with 
the 
Principal.  I would like to look at the second paragraph, 
20 
please. 
MR WILLIAMS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Following...   
“You should also have the new 100-days 
document 
(The 
final 
version 
that 
was 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 200 of 362 
 
discussed with Glen.) (The one that is ready to 
be presented next week.  We should also 
present whatever questions we still have...” 
 
Do you know what that is a reference to? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chairman, I think but I am not a hundred 
percent certain.  There definitely was 100-days document 
prepared for Mr Tom Moyane and that was labelled TM 100-
days but there were also other documents labelled 100-
days. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Alright.  Well, then let me rather 
10 
take you to the plan itself. 
MR WILLIAMS:   Okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Please turn to AW-92, page 492.  
That is indeed a document headed TM first 100-days, 
May 2014.  And I would like to pause on it, please.  As you 
probably know, it featured in the Nugent Commission 
hearing and I think it deserves some attention. 
 
So please would you explain to the Chair your 
understanding of what the purpose of this plan was and 
then I will direct your attention to certain parts of it. 
20 
MR WILLIAMS:   So Chair, it is fairly standard for a new – 
when Bain works for the new executive, new CEO and 
using executives at a business to develop, what is called a 
first 100-days plan.  I think President also had a first 100-
days plan.   
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 201 of 362 
 
 
But it is the idea of preparing to the extent you 
can from the outside what to expect in broad terms when 
you get there and some of the things you might not do.  It 
is effectively your agenda.  You attend this new job, you 
can expect the following things.  Based on Bain’s years 
and years of experience, typically, these are things new 
executive encounter.   
 
So it is sensitising you to what you might expect 
when you get there.  So that would be typically what the 
first 100-days document would be.  Chair, you typically 
10 
only present this to an executive when you know he or she 
has got the job.  Because why else would you present this 
100-days plan for somebody who has got the new job?   
 
So again... on the 26 t h of May 2014.  Again, 
months 
before 
Mr 
Moyane 
is 
appointed 
as 
the 
Commissioner of SARS.  So again raising that question 
around when did they know and when did Mr Moyane know 
that he has this job?  Just the – that is the one that sort of 
red flag, it jumps up is.  Why would you invest significant 
time 
with 
someone, 
presumable, 
when 
you 
have 
no 
20 
assurance that he was going to get that job?   
 
The second comment just on this document, that 
some of it got some fairly standard stuff that you will 
expect that Bain would share.  But what surprised me is 
that in some places the level of specific guidance suggest 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 202 of 362 
 
that this was not just purely based on the outside in – 
looking from the outside in.   
 
It suggests – and we can talk about what those 
might be.  That there might have been some insight 
information coming from inside SARS out.  And even then, 
Chair, as an outside being a consultant, as I have said, 
these documents typically would be to marry because it is 
based on what you might know.   
 
Now the more specific as you get as a consultant 
would depend on how well I know the organisation you are 
10 
going to.  So if I say I had been working as a consultant, 
advising SARS for ten years, I know SARS.   
 
So let me tell you Mr New Commissioner what 
you can expect because I know, I have been there for ten 
years.  No one at the Bain team had been in SARS.   
 
In fact, across Africa Bain had no tax authority 
experience.  So on what grounds Bain would develop this 
outside in expertise to begin to develop these specific 
types of recommendations, again for me, raise another red 
flag. 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Please look at page 493 at the 
bottom of the page on the right-hand side.  This is under 
the heading, Key Immediate Actions for Discussion, on the 
left-hand side and there are three steps.   
1. Keep the ball rolling. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 203 of 362 
 
2. Gain the higher ground. 
3. Take control. 
 
And then on the right-hand side of the page in 
the middle:   
“Build 
a 
healthy 
sponsorship 
spine 
to 
accelerate change and identify individuals to 
neutralise...” 
 
Then on the right-hand side, the second...  I am 
sorry.  The...  Yes, second bullet point: 
“Leverage external influences...” 
10 
 
And the third one: 
“Identify individuals that could hamper change 
– watch outs – to neutralise...” 
 
Now that is cryptic but your understanding of 
what the sentiment behind this is? 
MR WILLIAMS:   So Chair, if I can talk to the slide at the 
bottom left first, the one that has titled:  Key Immediate 
Actions.  That third column that says:  Take Control.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So are we still at 493? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct Chair.  Bottom left. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bottom left.  I see, keep the ball 
rolling... 
MR WILLIAMS:   Gain higher ground and take control. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, ja.  Gain the high ground.  And then 
three, take control.  Yes. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 204 of 362 
 
MR WILLIAMS:   I just want to point out just a few items 
there under, Take Control.  Again, this is in May 2015, 
many months before Mr Moyane ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct]  
MR WILLIAMS:   Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:   2014, is it not? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is May 2014? 
MR WILLIAMS:   May 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Slash 2015. 
10 
MR WILLIAMS:   Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR WILLIAMS:   It is May 2014, many months before 
Mr Monyane is meant, even to be announced, to be the 
Commissioner.  From the outside, supposedly, Bain is able 
to tell Mr Moyane the very last point: 
“Hi, your new assistant...” 
 
If you from the outside – from the outside 
looking in, how would he even possible think of doing that, 
suggesting that?  The point above that: 
20 
“Set up a Transformation Programme office...” 
 
Four months before he even got the job... you do 
not even know you are going to get the job but we think he 
should be setting up a Transformation Programme office.  
This talks about intent of already having a Transformation 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 205 of 362 
 
and Restructuring Programme.  The point above that: 
“Assess key roles to introduce new people...” 
 
I think that is a sensible point.  Two point above 
that: 
“Launch a forensic investigation...” 
 
Again, 
Chair, 
Bain 
would 
claim 
that 
they 
developed these documents from public information.  On 
what 
grounds... 
in 
May 
2014 
do 
you 
tell 
the 
new 
Commissioner or the supposedly Commissioner to launch a 
forensic investigation? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is your understanding of who they 
are referring to when they say:  Hire a new assistant.  They 
cannot be really talking about a PA here. 
MR WILLIAMS:   It might be a PA, Chair.  It might be...  
Well ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Why would they be bothering about 
[laughs] who the PA – what PA he would have?  That is why 
I am just asking but it may well emphasise the point you 
make, the kind of detail they might have had about things 
that are – one would expect only people inside SARS to 
20 
know.  But if they were talking about hire a new Assistant 
Commissioner, I could kind of understand. 
MR WILLIAMS:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To say:  We think you do not have in this 
structure, in the organisation.  Maybe there is no provision 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 206 of 362 
 
for an Assistant Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner. 
MR WILLIAMS:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You will need to have a deputy for 
assistant.  Then I would understand but if they are talking 
about a PA, this seems... 
MR WILLIAMS:   I think they are talking about a PA, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MR WILLIAMS:   I really think they are talking about a PA.  
And I think... question to ask Bain when they do come and 
testify.  The – and we will probably get to it later but it is 
10 
obvious I am pointing out the fact that it is absurd that 
from the outset you could know these things which must 
prove that they had someone inside SARS feeding them 
information.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  I mean, if they are talking about a 
PA, it just seems that they were really going to – lots of 
details.  Mr Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, thank you.  If I could just direct 
your attention to the right-hand side where, as I have 
shown you, the plan says: 
20 
“Identify individuals to neutralise...” 
 
Could I ask you?  Is that a term that you are 
familiar with in management consulting when entering a 
new organisation that you target individuals to neutralise? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, it is a term I have never – I would 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 207 of 362 
 
never use.  I have never had used in business or in 
consulting the idea of neutralising someone.  I have seen 
Bain’s explanation for this which is the idea of taking 
people who are detractors, people who might not support 
your plan and turn them into people who might not support 
you but they are neutral towards you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Ja.  Okay.   
MR WILLIAMS:   But this is a language that in all my years 
at Bain, all my years of consulting, all my years for using 
these approaches to thinking about your team.  I have 
10 
never used... to neutralise someone.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What else ...[intervenes]  
MR WILLIAMS:   Similar ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ... that people to keep your eye – keep 
your eyes on or what?  To say, watch them out.  Identify 
those at you must watch out.  Identify those that you must 
neutralise.  Is that your sense of what it is? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Exactly, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR WILLIAMS:   So, again, as a Management Consultant, 
20 
going into an organisation and to bring about change is 
often hard and there is resistance.  And so this is to be a 
kind of conversation I would have with the CEO for saying:  
Look, there are going to be some people who is going to 
resist this change.   
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 208 of 362 
 
 
You might just want to keep this in mind and 
then we talk how we can deal with that resistance.  It is the 
language that for me is so aggressive because I would 
never say we should find those people and neutralise 
them.  I understand what their reaction or their resistance 
might be and find ways of then addressing them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I would like you then – the next plan 
I wish to identify is AW-100, page 154.  That is known as 
SARS-2.0 and it is dated August of 2014.  I take it that you 
10 
had occasion to consider this plan?  And could I ask you to 
describe what it is and what it says? 
MR WILLIAMS:   So Chair, this I read as a level lower in 
terms of detail now.  Now we are saying:  Okay, you got 
this job.  What you have to go and do when you get in 
there?  What is the real agenda?  And if we turn the page 
to page 535, the Executive Summary, the third point.  It 
says: 
“In order to transform SARS...” 
 
And already as if that is a foregone conclusion 
20 
but: 
“In order to transform SARS into this elevated 
revenue and customs agency, the government 
will have to run a profound strategy refresh 
and focus on execution to reach SARS’ full 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 209 of 362 
 
potential...” 
 
And Chair, that language of profound strategy 
refresh is again language I would never use with regard to 
a business.  A profound strategy refresh suggests that the 
company is so dysfunctional or the organisation is so 
dysfunctional, you need to profound the redo everything 
from top to bottom.   
 
And Chair there can be no one who would 
describe SARS in that as a dysfunctional organisation 
needing a profound strategy refresh.  And so the premise 
10 
from this document is:  Okay, we have got to transform 
SARS.   
 
That is what is decided already.  It is already 
talking about set up a transformation office, you know, 
transform SARS and this profound strategy refresh.  It is 
again even before Mr Moyane even gets to SARS. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes.  And just for completeness.  I 
think that that is the point you have made in paragraph 
116, page 59 of your affidavit where you said, the 2.0 in 
the 
title 
SARS-2.0 
talks 
to 
the 
introduction 
of 
new 
20 
technology products where ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I missed the page Mr Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Sorry, Chair.  It is para 116, page 
59. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Thank you. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 210 of 362 
 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And perhaps I can take you to the 
second sentence. 
“The... was clear even before Moyane and 
Bain arrived at SARS that they would not... 
merely updating the world class organisation 
that existed but creating something different. 
That is exactly why Bain would call for a 
“profound strategy refresh” which in the SARS-
2.0 what has to be done document. 
Words 
I 
have 
never 
seen 
a management 
10 
consulting 
firm 
used 
because 
of 
its 
far 
reaching implications. 
Recommending a “profound strategy refresh” 
to 
any 
organisation 
suggests 
that 
it 
is 
completely 
dysfunctional 
and 
needs 
a 
complete overhaul of vision, mission, strategic 
plans and operations including organisation 
structure. 
One 
would 
be 
hard 
pressed 
to 
find 
any 
knowledgably person who can justify the claim 
20 
that this is what SARS needed, yet this is 
exactly what Bain set out to do as reflected in 
the SARS-2.0 document...” 
 
I take it you confirm that that... 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct Chair.  And this false 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 211 of 362 
 
sense(?) of urgency that the stuff must be done. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Then the – I hope the last plan or 
model that I have to show you is AW-97 at page 511.  
There 
is 
a 
covering 
email 
at 
page 
512 
dated 
the 
30 t h  of October 2018.  This seems to suggest that the 
document was produced during the Bain Investigation.  Is 
that correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And please look at page 513.  This 
is dated August of 2014 and it is a review of SARS 
10 
Operating Model and Structure.  Alright.  Could I then take 
you to the proposition which you have eluded to before that 
the version put up by Bain and others is that:  Yes, 
Mr Moyane was engaged with Bain to a greater or lesser 
extent before he was appointed as SARS Commissioner but 
this was simply CEO coaching as Bain normally offers to 
people in his position.  In your experience what we have 
seen, is this typical of CEO coaching which Bain offers to 
people? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Chair, I think this – what actually happen, 
20 
in a way, represents what typically happens at CEO 
coaching.  I think the level of detail that is presented in 
these plans, who these plans were presented to i.e. the 
President.  Even the fact that Mr Massone never describes 
them in his internal emails or in his assessment.  He never 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 212 of 362 
 
describes the CEO coaching.  He describes his interaction 
as developing a high-level strategic plan.  So for me this 
departs quite significantly from what I would expect to see 
from CEO coaching.   
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Could I take you to your affidavit at 
page 55? 
MR WILLIAMS:   Sorry to interrupt you.  We did not 
mention 
how 
Bain 
got 
this 
document. 
 
Perhaps 
...[intervenes]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   You want to go back to which 
10 
document? 
MR WILLIAMS:   So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it page 514? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Page ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 513? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR WILLIAMS:   [Indistinct]  
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, please go back to it and 
explain. 
20 
MR WILLIAMS:   So the email on page 512 is an email that 
emanates from the Bain’s investigation and it explains how 
– it explains the author of this document and it explains 
that the author of this document is Jonas Makwakwa who is 
a Senior Executive at SARS.   
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 213 of 362 
 
 
So again, this thesis of pre-empting restructuring 
of SARS, this is Mr Makwakwa bringing a document to Bain 
before Mr Moyane is the Commissioner and the document 
is discussing SARS Operating and Modelling Structure.   
 
Again, in my view Chair, it is addressing that 
what was happening was not just this outside in that Bain 
was 
producing. 
 
It 
was 
getting 
information 
from 
Mr Makwakwa and perhaps others informing this plan and 
that is possible why you might identify the PA needed to be 
replaced.    
10 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, thank you.  Alright.  So the final 
conclusions which you make in your affidavit on the notion 
that this was CEO coaching are in paragraphs 107 to 111 
on pages 55 to 57 of the affidavit.  In para 107, you explain 
what would typically be CEO coaching.  Is that correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct Chair.  And I make a point 
there that CEO coaching is a big investment on the 
management consultant’s part.  Typically this – logically 
you would say you would make that level of investment if it 
is a relationship you already have, but Bain did not have a 
20 
relationship with Mr Moyane or it is where you have got 
expertise about the company they are going to or Bain did 
not have that expertise or it is when you have got 
assurance that the person you are providing the CEO 
coaching to is actually going to get that job again pointing 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 214 of 362 
 
to this fact that there seemed to have been common 
knowledge amongst some at Bain that Mr Moyane was 
going to get the Commissioner job at SARS. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   And then in paragraph 108 you say 
the following: 
“The first indication that what Bain was doing with 
Mr Moyane was not mere coaching stems from an 
email Massone sends to superior [indistinct] 00.45 
on 18 January 2014 about how they intend using 
coaching in South Africa.” 
10 
That is AW90.  You say: 
“What Massone writes is not a description of 
coaching at all but developing a high level strategy 
plan with the expectation that if this plan is 
approved and the senior executive gets the job Bain 
will most likely be hired to work with the CEO in its 
detailing and implementation.” 
Is that correct? 
MR WILLIAMS:   That is correct, Chair.  And I think this 
reference was sort of – it was not – it was a broader 
20 
reference of Mr Massone explaining his strategy to his 
boss, he was saying I am going to go and engage with 
people under this umbrella of CEO coaching but really it is 
going to be about developing a high level strategy plan and 
so we help him get this job and so he will hire us – we talk 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 215 of 362 
 
about public sector again, it is not how procurement should 
be working. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Right, could I please just refer you 
to a couple of emails which relate to the question of 
whether Bain was aware that Moyane would be appointed 
before this announcement was made.  Could I think ask 
you please to look at AW67. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chair… 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I see my learned friend Mr Mpofu is 
here. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no – oh, Mr Mpofu, do you want to 
interrupt? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chairperson, yes, I wanted to object to 
something that was put to the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is that? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   It is the proposal that my client, Mr 
Moyane’s CEO – rather that the versions that were put 
were only that he underwent CEO coaching because last 
week we put a different version which has not been put to 
the witness. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I think he is talking about what Bain 
is saying. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, he said what was put by other 
people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 216 of 362 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, that is what he said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Franklin? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I am not sure I said that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well, we can play the record, that is 
exactly what he said.  I came from the back because of 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he can mention what he intended 
to say if that is not what he intended to say. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes.  What I intended to say to the 
10 
witness was that the version that has been put up Bain is 
that the interactions between Mr Moyane and Bain were an 
example of CEO coaching and I asked the witness to deal 
with that. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Chairperson, that is not …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It may be that what you say he said is 
what he said. 
ADV MPOFU SC:    No, it is not maybe, it is.  I heard it, 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:  You can play the record if there is a 
dispute, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no – yes, but if you did not intend to 
say that, he has now put it on record to say that is not 
what he intended to say. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 217 of 362 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, but Chairperson, I do not think that 
should be allowed.  You cannot …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, when you speak sometimes you 
think you have said a certain thing but you have said 
something else and people who are listening hear that you 
said something else. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then when somebody draws that to 
your attention you say oh no, I meant to say this.  So I 
would think that if somebody says look, I am sorry, this is 
10 
what I meant to say, that should correct it. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, Chair, if we were not here to hear 
that Mr Moyane’s version is being misrepresented then 
what would happen? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja …[intervenes] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Obviously we respect to what it is that 
was said, not what you thought he was saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no, no, I think we should leave 
it as this because Mr Franklin says he did not intend to say 
that, he intended to say something else but if you would 
20 
like to place on something on record in regard to that 
…[intervenes] 
ADV MPOFU SC:    I would. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, we can – maybe if we can do – you 
can do so when we start – no, no, maybe you should do it 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 218 of 362 
 
now. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I can do it now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because that other matter will be 
another matter.  Okay, just place on record what you want 
to place on record.  If you able to do it from there, that 
might be more convenient. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, I can, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Chairperson, I want to place on record 
that contrary to what was put to the witness on… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   For the record I just say because I do 
not think you were here when we started, that Mr Mpofu is 
counsel for Mr Moyane.  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   That is correct, Chair.  On the 3 March 
2021 we submitted to this Commission and affidavit of Mr 
Moyane which was a reaction to statements made by 
various persons listed at 4.1 of that affidavit as Mr Pravin 
Gordhan, Mr Vlok Symington, Mr Johann van Loggerenberg 
and Mr Athol Williams which are the affidavits that – so I 
will not deal with the other people. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   That part that is from page 18, it deals 
with the evidence of Athol Williams.  Then I will jump a lot 
of what is said.  We say in paragraph 65 that – we 
summarise the version, that you know, Chair, then we say: 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 219 of 362 
 
“It is not clear how all of the above, if true, 
translates 
into 
my 
personal 
involvement 
in 
or 
knowledge of state capture or even the capture of 
SARS and if so, for what unlawful purpose.” 
And then the specific passage, Chair, which deals with 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   With coaching. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   CEO coaching, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:    You will find that at paragraphs – okay, 
10 
there is a bit of history which I do not need to go through. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Which is paragraph 66, 67.  I think I will 
start at 66.6, Chair, I will not be long. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:    It says that: 
“During a follow up visit to the President to discuss 
the matter I happened to find him…” 
Mr Massone. 
“…in a matter with the Chairman and CEO of Telkom 
20 
in the presence of the managing director of Bain 
who introduced himself as a Mr Massone.  He 
informed me that he was assisting Telkom in 
strategy with great results.  I took his business card 
or we exchanged telephone numbers.  All this 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 220 of 362 
 
happened in the waiting area while I was waiting my 
turn to go inside.  On a subsequent date and after 
doing my own research on his company I contacted 
the gentleman and informed him confidentially that I 
was earmarked to potentially take up the position of 
SARS Commissioner if the President was to serve a 
second term, as explained above.  He in turn 
informed me that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought, Mr Mpofu, you were going to 
say something like you want to place on record that for 
10 
example your client was not given CEO coaching or 
something like that. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, that is exactly where I am, Mr 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Sorry, maybe I gave you too much 
background. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   But that is where I am going, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   It says, okay: 
“He in turn informed me about a programme of CEO 
coaching…” 
Which is what the Chair is talking about. 
“…in which I expressed an interest to undergo as I 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 221 of 362 
 
was in any event doing extensive research on the 
workings of SARS, like some of the previous 
appointees, including Mr Gordhan and although I 
felt well-qualified for the position, I did not have 
any experience in taxation but I was a generalist 
manager or a senior executive in the public sector.” 
This is the important part, Chair: 
“Indeed 
we 
embarked 
on 
the 
agree 
low 
key 
preparation and coaching covering general CEO or 
leadership training but also obviously targeted 
10 
towards my forthcoming potential posting at SARS.” 
That is the point I am making, Chair.  So there is a version 
before 
this 
Commission 
that 
explains 
that 
the 
CEO 
coaching went further than normal CEO coaching ,let us 
assume there is such a thing and also included the fact 
that there was a potential of Mr Moyane going to SARS. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And I think it is unfair to put the 
contrary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Franklin, I do not know if you 
20 
want to say anything or just proceed. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   No, I am slightly mystified by the 
ambit of the objection. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I was dealing with Bain and what 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 222 of 362 
 
Bain had said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, not that …[intervenes] 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I do not recall trying to put a version 
but if I did, I was not intending to and I will clarify that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   The version that Mr Moyane puts up 
is clearly in his affidavit and in due course, if necessary, I 
will ask the witness to comment on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   So that really is all I need to say. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I think let us leave it at that, Mr 
Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well, Chair, I am sorry, I cannot leave it 
at that.  If Mr Franklin did not say what he said 
inadvertently then he must say so.  If he did then he must 
retract, he cannot be mystified. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he has said he did not intend to 
say that, Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well, then he must retract those words. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Franklin? 
20 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I think I have made myself clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   My learned friend has arrived, I was 
not even aware he was here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 223 of 362 
 
ADV 
FRANKLIN 
SC: 
 
 And 
he 
made 
an 
objection 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, we are going to proceed. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Proceed, Mr Franklin. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you.  Chair, I see that it is 
now nearly five o’clock and as you know, the programme 
calls for the – a continuation of the cross-examination of 
Minister Gordhan and the parties were put on notice to be 
available from four o’clock and that it would start at the 
10 
latest five o’clock.  We discussed the issue of how to then 
complete Mr Williams’ evidence.  The suggestion was made 
from the Chair that it might be possible to complete it after 
the 
cross-examination 
has 
taken 
place. 
 
We 
have 
discussed the matter and we think it far preferable to 
complete his evidence tomorrow rather than this evening.  
Mr Williams is available to do so and hopefully it will not 
take too long to do that.  So with your permission may I 
suggest that we move to that segment of the day’s 
proceedings 
which 
is 
the 
continuation 
of 
the 
cross-
20 
examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   The completion thereof and the re-
examination of the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I take it when you say we 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 224 of 362 
 
discussed you include the legal representatives of the 
various parties. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yes, I have discussed informally with 
the legal representatives of Mr Williams and of Bain. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright.  Okay, Mr Williams, we 
are going to postpone your evidence to tomorrow. I think 
you should be here at half past nine and then we will 
continue with your evidence then.  I will adjourn now for 
ten minutes or so to enable whatever – what needs to be 
done so that we then start with the evening session which 
10 
will be a continuation of Mr Gordhan’s cross-examination 
by counsel for Mr Moyane and, ja.  Okay.  We will adjourn 
for ten minutes.  We adjourn. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good evening Mr Mpofu, good evening 
everybody.    
ADV MPOFU SC:   Good evening Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good evening Mr Gordhan.  His picture 
20 
is not on the screen.   Let me tell you in the meantime 
what I thought of since you left my chambers, all legal 
teams.  I think it is better 
that before the cross-
examination starts we sort out the issue of the parked 
issues. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 225 of 362 
 
So that when Mr Mpofu starts whatever time I give 
he knows he has got to – if those issues may be dealt with 
in cross-examination he has got to put to accommodate 
them within the time that is given, rather that he first 
exhausts his time and then we have the discussion. 
 
Good evening Mr Gordhan.  Can you hear me? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Good evening Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
can 
you 
hear 
me 
or 
is 
it 
...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   There was a slight interruption, 
10 
but I can hear you now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright, thank you very much.   
I have just said to the legal teams that before the cross-
examination resumes I would like us to resolve issues 
which they say we parked aside previously.  It seems that 
we should deal with them so that when I give Mr Mpofu a 
time within which to complete his cross-examination he 
knows whether his cross-examination should or should not 
include those issues, rather than dealing with those issues 
after he has finished his cross-examination. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let us – or do you want to place on 
record what you wanted to place on record, I do not think 
you should take more than five minutes for that, is that 
fine? 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 226 of 362 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   That is fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, so what I will day – good evening 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good evening. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   What I propose to do then Chair is, in 
this session of just the practical issues, is to deal with that 
matter where you giving me five minutes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And then I will then take the Chair to, 
10 
the pact issues.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   And then we go from there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you.  Chair, the first issue as we 
indicated in our letter, was something we were raising in 
the form of a complaint, I think, and where we needed a 
ruling, but the Chair does not give a ruling now because of 
time issues.  I will paraphrase it as follows Chair, the – it 
is the complaint against the Evidence Leaders or what we 
20 
call an ill-fated attempt to curtail the ambit of the cross 
examination.  
Chair had given five topics on which we could cross 
examine originally, I think they were called A, B, C, D, E to 
save time I will not go through all five.  But for shorthand 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 227 of 362 
 
and say that category one and category two issues and the 
Evidence Leaders seem to suggest that the category one 
issues have fallen away, that was the expression that was 
used.  
And that was on the basis Chair that it turned out and it is 
one of those bizarre things that everyone missed it the 
Chair, myself, and Mr Gordhans’s legal team in Judge 
Nugent.  There was a technicality as to whether the 
complaint that was laid with the Police by Mr Moyane had 
actually included Mr Gordhan by name let me put it that 
10 
way.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   It turns out that after all those learned 
people had looked at it he had not included him by name 
and I will show when we deal with that, that actually he did 
say, is laying a charge against A, B, C, D and all other 
people who might be involved, but admittedly he had not 
mentioned Mr Gordhan by name. 
Now, 
what 
then 
happened 
is 
that, 
on 
that 
technicality, the Evidence Leaders sought to say that cross 
20 
examination on issues A, B, C should fall away, because a 
chance formulation had said in so far as Mr Moyane laid 
charges against Mr Gordhan and in when we were asking, I 
then questioned Mr Gordhan and he said he stands by 
everything A to E and this is all on the record, Chair.  I do 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 228 of 362 
 
not have time now to take you there. 
And in fairness to my learned friend Ms Le Roux 
even when she objected at some stage, she also said the 
cross examination should be on those five issues.  So the 
ruling that we really wanted Chair, is that it is not going to 
increase the cross examination or attract new questions 
but it is that the cross examination should be on the five 
issues that were identified in your ruling, as it were, 
irrespective of the fact that Mr Gordhan was not one of the 
named persons. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I need you to refresh my memory on my 
ruling and I do not know whether it is in this file. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, you have got it in front of you 
Chair, it at page, PFM 771. 
CHAIRPERSON:   71? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   761, it will be your second file.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Chair, that is where it starts at 761.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And then - but I want to take the Chair 
20 
specifically to 772.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yeah.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   There you will see Chair at 27 you give 
the reasons and then you say, you said: 
“Before this Commission it must rank as the most 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 229 of 362 
 
serious allegation or statement for it to be said that 
you performed your official duties in order to 
advance 
the 
objective 
of 
State 
Capture, 
and 
speaking generally such a person should be granted 
leave to cross examine.” 
But you can just jump to paragraph 28 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   You say: 
“In the result my decision is the following, subject 
to below.” 
10 
And that was just that we had to file an affidavit which was 
done.  
“Mr Moyane is hereby granted leave to cross 
examine Mr Gordhan on A, whether in laying a 
criminal complaint or charges against Mr Gordhan, 
Mr Moyane acted maliciously.  B, whether in laying 
a 
criminal 
complaint 
against 
Mr 
Gordhan, 
Mr 
Moyane was motivated wholly or in part by or he 
sought to advance the objectives of State Capture.  
And C, whether in laying the criminal complaint 
20 
against Mr Gordhan. Mr Moyane was abusing a 
legal process for his own personal goals that had 
either nothing or little to do with a legitimate 
complaint relating to an alleged crime.” 
I will not read the other two because there is no 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 230 of 362 
 
controversy with the other two.  Now, as I have explained 
Chair, the gist really of – and Mr Gordhan again in 
fairness, I put this question to him.  The gist of what he 
was saying was that in the laying of the charges, whether it 
is against him or against whoever it was in pursuance of 
the State Capture motive, and that is the legal gravamen.   
The technicalities, like say somebody accusing me 
of doing something on a Tuesday, and then it turns out that 
I did this on a Wednesday, I still have a right to challenge 
that and…[intervene] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second and I do recall that 
what transpired was that or at least as I understood it, in 
the complaint that Mr Moyane laid it was understood or at 
least I understood that it had not included Mr Gordhan.  Is 
that factually correct? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, that is factually correct there is no 
debate about that.  
CHAIRPERSON:   There is no debate about that.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that A, should fall away because if he 
20 
did not lay a criminal complaint against Mr Gordhan the 
question of whether he did so maliciously does not arise. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, the way - in the, in the cross 
examination of Mr Gordhan that issue was clarified that in 
the laying of the charges per say is what was in pursuit of 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 231 of 362 
 
State Capture. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And also Mr Gordhan agreed that the 
laying of those charges is what led to his – not arrest, 
prosecution.  So in other words, the setting in motion, 
starting with the complaint is really what led to his 
prosecution, and that is what he was complaining about.  
So that is exactly the point I am making Chair, that 
the technicality…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The malicious, malicious…[intervene] 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   The malicious was considered. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The malicious has fallen away. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, he conceded the malicious was 
there, the motivated wholly or in part…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   He sought to advance the objectives.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, he conceded that, and then 
the…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, when you say he conceded 
you mean? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I mean, he personally in his affidavit, 
20 
he said that was motivated by State Capture motive, and 
then here, when I put it to him, he said that was part of 
the, of his complaint or rather part of the so called State 
Capture motive. And then the third one, you will remember 
Chair the thing about personnel goals, but that his 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 232 of 362 
 
personnel goals included State Capture, and that was the 
thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well every - what is common to A, B and 
C, is that they are all connected with Mr Moyane laying a 
certain criminal complaint, is that right? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, that is the issue.  That is the 
generic issue is the laying of the complaint that it 
happened.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   It just so happened that in the 
10 
list…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say it is common cause that 
factually that complaints did not refer to Mr Gordhan. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   That is common cause, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that applies to A, B and C. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, but we are saying that fact is 
neither here nor there.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no I understand I just want to, ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, basically, what you may be wanting 
20 
to do is to say, to the extent that Mr Gordhan says Mr 
Moyane in laying the criminal complaint, even if it was not 
against him, his sought to advance the objective of State 
Capture. You want to say, how did that happen, you want to 
explore that. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 233 of 362 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, as I simply want to say Chair that 
the ambit of the of cross examination must cover that part, 
obviously subject to the fact that the is that and Chair just 
give me one-minute Chair.  At page 54 of the record of the 
transcript after I put this to Mr Gordhan this is what I said: 
“Thank you Chair, anyway, the point is that.” 
And I was addressing Mr Gordhan: 
“You stand by all the sentiments expressed from A 
to E, except, of course, the technicality that the 
charges were not laid directly against you, but it 
10 
was a complaint that led to the criminal charges.  
Are we still together, Mr Gordhan?  Yes.” 
He stood by his…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So your argument is the same for A, B 
and C? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, exactly the same 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say A has a has been sorted 
out?  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is B and C that is…[intervene] 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   It is exactly the same, Chair.  In other 
words, all I am saying is that to put it simplistically, in the 
Chairs ruling, we should all just scratch out the word laid 
against Mr Gordhan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 234 of 362 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Because we know, factually, that was 
not…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And as I said Chair, Chairperson do not 
have to give a ruling right now I just wanted to place this 
on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the only thing, of course, is that if 
you are going to include them in your cross examination, 
then 
you 
should 
know, 
when 
you 
start 
your 
cross 
examination.   
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let me hear what Mr Franklin and Ms 
Le Roux have to say.  I do not know which order they want, 
who will start.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Chair, in fairness if Mr Franklin is going 
to start then that is the ruling part, the complaint part is 
the fact that we are saying that it was not in the place of 
the 
Evidence 
Leaders 
to 
seek 
to 
curtail 
the 
cross 
examination in this fashion, and that is because for two 
years before the cross examination, these utterances were 
20 
in the public domain.  
And, you know, vilifying Mr Moyane for malice and 
the State Capture motive and so on, and to now seek, to 
settle him from exploring those issues is not something 
that should be done, by, particularly by neutral observers.  
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 235 of 362 
 
Maybe it could be done by Ms le Roux but not by Evidence 
Leaders.  I do not know what the job of Evidence Leaders 
is, but it certainly cannot be to suppress the truth. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yeah, well, I do not think they would 
have been seeking to suppress the truth.  I think they 
would have been concerned about time constraints for the 
Commission and to say, the Commission should only focus 
on issues that are still alive and so on, I think that would 
be my…[intervene] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, Chair in fairness I accept that, I 
10 
accept that there is no ulterior motive.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, ulterior motive, ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   All I am saying is that the impact of that 
should not be to suppress Mr Moyane’s rights.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that is fine.  Mr Franklin and 
Ms Le Roux, have you sorted out who will speak first? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   May I just – there is certain things 
on record and deal with him?  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Chair, you will 
20 
remember how this all unfolded and obviously, what first 
happened 
is 
that 
Minister 
Gordhan 
made 
a 
written 
statement to the Commission on the 11 t h  of September and 
Rule 33 was then served on Mr Moyane and because he 
had been implicated, he was then entitled to bring an 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 236 of 362 
 
application which he did on the 13 t h of December, and he 
sought leave to cross examine Minister Gordhan that was 
opposed by Minister Gordhan. 
After considering all of the affidavits as well as 
submissions, you made a ruling Chair on the 16 t h of April 
2019 refusing Mr Moyane leave to cross examine on the 
long list of topics that he had indicated that he wished to 
cross examine on. However, there was one issue, which 
caused you some concern that involved the alleged laying 
of charges by Mr Moyane against Minister Gordhan.  
10 
And it was for that reason that you asked for a 
clarification the affidavit to be given by Minister Gordhan, 
which he did, following which Mr Moyane answered the 
clarification affidavit, and pursuant to all of that, the Chair 
made a second ruling on the 25 t h of November 2019 and Mr 
Moyane was given leave to cross examine on five specific 
topics, but on condition that he filed an affidavit.  
So that is really the ruling, which governs the cross 
examination and it is there on record.  As far as the 
procedural 
matters 
are 
concerned, 
before 
the 
cross 
20 
examination, on the previous occasion, the Minister had 
made a request to be allowed to testify via video link, 
which was granted, and also he asked for an indication of 
the duration of the cross examination because that is an 
issue that has been canvassed in the application.  And 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 237 of 362 
 
having established a position from the Chair I was 
authorised to indicate which I did verify with my colleagues 
that your indicative estimate was not more than two hours, 
this is what…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or not more than an hour? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   No, on the previous occasion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh previous occasion, yes, yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Yeah, and so that was the indicative, 
the estimation on that occasion.  So it was not for the 
Evidence Leaders to determine the duration, it is for the 
10 
Chair to do so, the Chair did do so and I want to convey 
this to my learned friend.  
And I am, of course, at a disadvantage thereafter, 
because I was not here since November my learned friend 
Mr Chaskalson stepped in on short notice for me, but I 
understand and I specifically asked my learned friend Ms 
Le Roux what the duration of the cross examination was 
and I am told that it was five hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I am not in a position to say if that is 
20 
accurate or not, and she tells me that it is accurate.  So 
the cross examination exceeded the limit indicatively that 
had been given.  In preparation for the present hearing, 
which is the resumption of the hearing, once again, the 
question of duration of cross examination is raised, and I, 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 238 of 362 
 
again, obtained from the Chair and on request what is 
the…[intervene] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am sorry Chair. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Sorry, I am busy talking.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am sorry Chair; I think Mr Franklin is 
not interested in the issue that I just raised, he is on a 
totally different issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes, no but I want to hear what he 
has to say, I want to hear what he is saying for now. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well, I have not come to that - If I will 
10 
come to that, but I was talking about the complaints. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, but I want to hear what he 
says I think he is coming to the point. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Okay, Chair I can tell you this the 
background to the present situation, we find ourselves in 
and you asked, I was asked to establish from you what the 
ruling and the indication, and your indication was not more 
than an hour if I can convey this to our learned friends. 
So, my learned friend, Mr Mpofu says it is not for 
the Evidence Leaders suppress the truth of course, that is 
20 
not what anyone is doing.  What the Evidence Leader is 
doing is conveying what is being decided by the Chair to 
be respected by, that is what we are doing.  For the rest or 
what happened on the 30 t h of November, I have to refer to 
my learned friend Ms Le Roux and I will ask her to then 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 239 of 362 
 
address the issues which have been raised in that regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   I am not able to do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, Ms Le Roux. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Thank you, Chair, let me just place two 
things on record.  The first is, by our calculation using the 
timestamps 
from 
the 
YouTube 
video 
of 
last 
times 
appearance, excluding any interventions by Mr Chaskalson 
and myself, excluding adjournments just literally when 
there was question and answer interchange between Mr 
10 
Mpofu and Mr Gordhan I counted that to four hours, 56 
minutes, and 13 seconds.  
 
That is where the five hours comes from if Mr 
Moyane legal team has done a similar exercise and come 
to a different number we can share our timestamp.  Chair, 
on this first question of whether A to C have fallen away. I 
understand my learned friend’s submission today to say 
given that it is common cause that nothing was filed 
naming Mr Gordhan can we just take five that out of A to C, 
we are obviously in your hands if that persuades you as to 
20 
how to approach the question.  
I would just say this in the course of the cross 
examination Mr Moyane his reasonableness as a SARS 
Commissioner in laying the charges that theme has begun 
in the cross examination and I assume it will continue 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 240 of 362 
 
today.  
But to the extent that is what A to C require him to 
cross examine about or entitle him to cross examine about, 
it has been covered, nothing I think is being stifled.  So we 
are in your hands if you want to delete that portion and the 
topic is certainly being covered.  
The final point is just say, it is very important that 
the record reflect that until such time as Mr Moyane filed 
an affidavit in the cross examination application.  Minister 
Gordhan had never seen the complaint that was filed.  He 
10 
testified before that he had seen a press conference given 
by two of his cabinet colleagues that identified Mr Moyane 
as the complainant in the case that resulted in the 27 
questions from the HAWKS to Minister Gordhan.  
And he explained on the previous occasion when he 
testified before you in November 2018, as well as in the 
cross examination, that that is where he got the - Mr 
Moyane file charges against me piece of information from 
and when he saw the complaint that was actually filed for 
the first time in the cross examination proceedings.  Then 
20 
he said, well, now I understand I was not named. 
But I understand that, you know, that complaint, 
case numbers became the 27 questions, became the 
criminal charges.  So just to clarify that factual position 
that it was not until Mr Moyane filed his complaint 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 241 of 362 
 
statement, after the Minister had initially testified before 
you, that it became clear that he had been doing that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV LE ROUX:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, my inclination therefore, Mr Mpofu is 
to say, to the extent that Mr Gordhan's position is that he 
stands by sought of B and C.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   A to E. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Even starting from A, I would say that, 
you are entitled to cross examine him. 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thanks, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you, chair and as I said Chair, 
just to allay anybody fears, I am indebted to my learned 
friend Ms le Roux for not blaming Minister Gordhan for 
having used that terminology of against him as I say 
everyone - I think maybe it is the fault of the newspapers, 
because everyone since then had laboured under the 
impression that that was so.  
But it is not, it is simply to say that that technicality 
20 
should not make those topics by the way.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   And we agree that then all that needs to 
happen is for the Chair in your ruling to take out the words 
against Mr Gordhan. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 242 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, that might not necessarily because 
the 
ruling 
stands, 
you 
know 
it 
is 
simply 
that 
the 
understanding now…[intervene] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay, yes that ruling must be read with 
this ruling. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, with this understanding. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Fair enough. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you, Chair and Chair as I say 
that is not going to - as my learned colleague Ms le Roux 
10 
says, some of this material was actually covered.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   So it is not going to necessarily and 
enlarge the scope it is simply to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let us have certainty about how 
much time I am giving you. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, sorry the second part of what you 
asked me to do was to take you to the parked issues, Chair 
20 
I do not know if you have got…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, ja the parked issues, ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, I do not know if you have got the 
transcript of the 30 t h of November in front of you, I was 
told that is so. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 243 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I do not think I would have unless 
somebody has prepared it, ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I was told it was on its way up so I do 
not know whether…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, what page? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Page 126, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh I am sorry, wants to say something. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Sorry, Chair just a practical question.  I 
am not sure the Minister has a copy of the Commission's 
transcript.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The one that I am about…[intervene] 
ADV LE ROUX:   The one that you are about to refer to, 
yeah. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV LE ROUX:   That version of the transcripts I am not 
sure the Minister has got it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV LE ROUX:   It is on your website; I can try to email it 
to him now.  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine you can do that. 
20 
ADV LE ROUX:   So that the Minister can have that 
transcript.  I assume the one you are going to look at is the 
one on the Commission website. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would, it should be it should be I think 
it should be. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 244 of 362 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I think, for the purposes of this 
exercise, it will not be necessary, but I agree it should be 
sent to him in case I refer to it in the cross examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright.  So we have sorted out 
the issue of you placing on record what you wanted to 
place on record, we have sorted out the issue of the of A, 
B and C and now we on the issues of part issues, ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Chair, yes page 126. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   One, two, six of the transcript.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, let us use the pagination, which is 
the red numbers at the top for consistency.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   I do not have them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not have them? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, we just downloaded it from the 
internet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, all right, 126 of the transcript? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   The typed page. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I have got it. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay, you will see there in the middle 
round about line seven, Chair oh, no line five it may be 
that I will need the argument, this is you Chair speaking.   
“It may be that I will need to be – the argument 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 245 of 362 
 
might need to be addressed to me whether I should 
allow it or not particularly parked so that we can 
make 
progress. 
 
He 
will 
continue 
with 
other 
questions.” 
He being me: 
“And if he continues there are other questions that 
might be problematic, like this one, also, those will 
be parked and then when he is done, we can apply 
our minds to all those questions that will have been 
parked, do you understand?” 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Mr Gordhan says: 
“I understand, Chair.” 
And then at page two, I am sorry Chair, 235 which I am 
told you have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got it 235. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   It is TSM 1659 for the record.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Then, after I have said something their 
Chair, just above 20, Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the first one that I was talking 
about on the other page, should we not identify that one 
first, which, which issue was parked there?  Okay, so that I 
can know what issues where were parked. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja, we have to okay, Chair.   
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 246 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were at page 126. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes it was yes, so that it starts at 125, 
ja.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes it was - if we go back to round 
about 123, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   You will remember that there was the 
issue about whether I could ask questions regarding Mr 
Zuma’s involvement with Mr Moyane so to speak, in State 
Capture and the objection that was raised at that stage 
10 
was that Mr Zuma was being implicated without being 
informed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Given notice? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, but Chair in fairness on that issue, 
subsequently, 
in 
the 
cross 
examination, 
you 
might 
remember that, I asked Mr Gordhan, I do not know where 
the reference is, I asked him about the reshuffle, his being 
reshuffled, and asked him who was responsible for that and 
he did say it was Mr Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that has fallen away. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well, it has not fallen away in the sense 
that I think the objection was unfounded because the 
witness he…[intervene] 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 247 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but what I am saying for today, we 
do not have to bother about it. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so let us look at those that I have to 
still bother about. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Then look at two…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that cuts them down to two to five 
issues? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   235, if you go to 235 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And then this one was, it was this issue 
that we just spoke about, of the A, B, C, and all that: 
“And then I did deliberately avoid this debate, 
because if he had said, No, I did not accept that Mr 
Moyane was motivated by State Capture and that I 
only accepted it.  If it was the charge against me, 
then I would not be able to answer this question but 
we are all bound by the answer that he gave, which 
20 
is.” 
And then the Chair then came in and said: 
“Can you park this question like the other one, and 
then you exhaust others, and then we can come 
back later?” 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 248 of 362 
 
So this one for intents and purposes, this is the debate 
that we have said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it is sorted out so we are down to 
one. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, then Chair if you go to page 249, 
which is TSM 1673. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To page 249, yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, okay that was the - I suppose the 
bigger issue and it was a bit complicated.  It was about 
whether, you remember Chair that in the so called 27 
10 
questions they covered two topics, the Rogue Unit, and the 
Pillay retirement.  
And as we have discussed earlier, those were 
allegedly the extension of Mr Moyane’s laying of the 
charges, which then moved on to those two issues.  Now 
the question which arose was whether I was only entitled 
to question Mr Gordhan only on the Rogue Unit, which Ms 
Le Roux conceded or whether I could also question him on 
the Pillay issue, which was part of that 27 questions. 
There was a bit of a debate, and the Chair said, we 
20 
should park that to the end.  The references to 249 and 
then the Chair said, oh no this time, it was my proposal to 
park the issue.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I said: 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 249 of 362 
 
“Yes, just for the sake of progress, I will come back 
to this question so what I will do is I will start with 
the issue of the Rogue Unit, which was the subject 
matter of the complaint, and then we can come back 
to whether the Pillay issue can also be covered.” 
And the Chair says: 
“Okay, alright we can do that, we are at 16 minutes 
past.” 
Because it was already late and we were to have that 
debate, so that was parked.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So just so that I understand.  You 
wanted to cross examine Mr Gordhan in relation to the 
retirement of Mr Pillay? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that what you wanted to cross 
examine him on. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, in the same way, remember there 
were two topics.  So the question was whether I would 
also, I would be similarly entitled to question him on the 
Pillay issue, which was the other issue that the Police had 
20 
questioned 
him 
about 
as 
a 
result 
of 
Mr 
Moyane’s 
complaint. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said something about the Rogue 
Unit. What was the position, did we deal with that at that 
time? 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 250 of 362 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, we started it – that is where we 
were on that issue when we stopped. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but what I am saying is whether 
there was any ruling about whether it should - you could 
cross examine on it? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, no that was conceded. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, on the Rogue Unit? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And so with regard to the Pillay issue, 
what was the – was there an objection or what was the 
10 
issue? 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes. 
ADV FRANKLIN SC:   Sorry to interrupt.  I have just been 
told by one of the Commission staff that there is a 
technical problem and relating to the live stream and they 
have requested a five-minute adjournment to sort that out.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. I think let us take the short 
adjournment then hopefully, it will not last longer than 
between five and 10 minutes.  Okay, we adjourn. 
20 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, Mr Mpofu now the issue of Mr 
Pillay was there an objection that it be, you include it in 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 251 of 362 
 
your cross-examination? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  There was Chair, that is why you parked 
it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, just remind me what the objection 
was and I will hear what ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  What Ms le Roux has to say? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chair, if I may just paraphrase and my 
learned friend Ms le Roux will correct me if I am wrong.  
Her objection was that the issue of the rogue unit I could 
10 
cross-examine on it, because the ... that was the just of 
the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, hang on.  Did we not say it was the 
Pillay issue ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That remained. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes, that is what I said.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I am just ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Or maybe it might be better is Ms 
20 
le Roux tells me what the objection was ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:  I can read it out.  This is what she said 
Chair: 
 
“So Chair, let me just state for the record the 
facts as they stand in the affidavit that were 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 252 of 362 
 
filed in respect of cross-examination as I have 
understood the cross-examination so far.  Mr 
Gordhan accepts that Mr Moyane did not name 
him in the complaint.  That complaint is about 
the unit and the charge is announced by Sonny 
Abrahams.” 
 
The just of the complaint Chair was that the 
charges that were laid by Mr Moyane related only to the 
rogue unit issue and the fact that, the mere fact that as the 
police went on to investigate they then included the Pillay 
10 
issue, was not according to the theory.  Should not have 
been 
a 
subject 
of 
the 
cross-examination 
because 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  You remember now Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, ja.  I kind of remember.  So the 
facts were the complaint laid by Mr Moyane did not include 
the issue of Mr Pillay’s retirement? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Retirement yes, but the charges did.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But later on or when the charges were 
20 
preferred, it was part of the charges.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Let me just check.  Ms le 
Roux, you persist in the objection or what is the position?  
I just do not want to spend time on it, in case that is no 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 253 of 362 
 
longer the case.  
ADV LE ROUX SC:  Chair, on Pillay pension specifically or 
on all the part issues? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, on the Pillay issue. 
ADV LE ROUX SC:  Yes Chair, we persist on that 
objection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV LE ROUX SC:  The complaint did not mention it.  It 
came out in the Hawks investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
10 
ADV LE ROUX SC:  It is not in the scope on what Mr 
Moyane was granted leave to cross-examine.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chair, I am sorry.  I am sorry Chair, 
trying to save time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  I must confess I was not listening. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, that is alright.  So no, Ms le Roux 
says they persist in the objection in regard to the Pillay 
issue.  So what is your argument as to why it should be 
20 
allowed to be part of the cross-examination?  I will tell you 
what I think now ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  What I am thinking, so that you know 
what my concern is.  We have to look at the ruling to see 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 254 of 362 
 
what falls within and what falls without the issues on which 
there could be cross-examination.  Now A, B, C oh, A, B, C 
I wanted to have a look at the scope.  
 
But I do not recall whether it said anything about 
charges, other than simply the criminal complaints.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  No, the complaints.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It did not say anything about charges as 
you recall? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No Chair, it did not say anything about 
the charges, but it is the complaints that led to the 
10 
charges.  That is the debate we had earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  My inclination would be that if it 
was not included by, it was not included by Mr Moyane in 
the complaint that he laid, my inclination would be that it 
falls outside.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  Of course.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thanks Chair.  No, that is fine.  Then I 
am not going to argue that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Okay, alright.  So you are 
20 
ready to start? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, I will give you an hour, you 
would have to try your best to use it to, maximally.  I am 
going to be stricter than I may have been last time in terms 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 255 of 362 
 
of both questions and answers to try and make sure that 
we focus on the issues and use this time properly.   
 
Okay.  It is twenty five past six, an hour will take us 
to twenty five past seven.  Yes. 
ADV LE ROUX SC:  Chair, I cannot believe I am the one 
delaying the start.  The commission has just emailed the 
minister the electronic bundle, which updates to the bundle 
that Mr Moyane’s legal team shared over the weekend.  If 
we can just confirm that he has received the link and has 
been able to access it.  
10 
 
Otherwise if there is a reference to a page number, 
he will not have it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LE ROUX SC:  And we could read the document to 
him, but that might delay ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, do you want us to talk to him, 
confirm what he has received or what he has not received?   
ADV LE ROUX SC:  Minister Gordhan ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You know what we are talking about? 
ADV LE ROUX SC:  Yes, Minister Gordhan, I shared the 
20 
link that was received from the commission.  It also went to 
your department email address.  Have you been able to 
download the various bundles that were attached in that 
link?   
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Chairperson, again good evening 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 256 of 362 
 
to you.  Yes, I have.  There seem to be some pages 
missing but in order to save time and in accordance with 
your ruling Chair, can we proceed and then where relevant 
I will look for the page.  
 
Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  No, that is alright.  Okay, Mr 
Mpofu?  I need to get some of these, the files out of the 
way here.   
ADV MPOFU SC:  [indistinct – 00:07:25] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think, I do not think, ja.  
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:  [indistinct – 00:07:31] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which ones do I need here Mr Mpofu, the 
files?   
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chair, you need three files.  You need 
the PFM that goes to page 382 and then the other one 
goes to page 1108 and then there is a third file, I think it is 
called something something C. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I am not going to have all of them 
here.  I will start with the one that you will start with first.  
Why are they troubling you Mr Mpofu?   
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I was hoping you do not notice Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am going, which one are you going to 
start with and as and when you refer to the others, my 
register will add them up.  So which one are you going to 
start with? 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 257 of 362 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chair, I am going to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  On the spine, I do not know whether 
yours are written on the spine.  There is one written N3B, 
application bundle.  TS Moyane application to cross-
examination J Gordhan. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I have got those, A and B.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  I combined them into one file.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Alright, I can keep two but not 
three.  
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes, you can keep those two.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  And then you will need the third one 
Chair, which is the smaller file.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It can be handed up when you refer to it.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  And then I do not know if the Chair has 
got the transcript, because I am also going to refer 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I only have got the two files, I do not 
know if they have got the transcripts.  Is it that one?   
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Move your chair this side.   
CHAIRPERSON:  When you refer to the transcript my 
registrar will give me the transcripts.  Okay.  
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 258 of 362 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Mr Gordhan, were you 
saying something? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  It is half past now sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No, I am fine Chair, thank you.  I 
found the file, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV MPOFU SC:  I am just going to get, it is 18H30. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Alright.  Okay, let us start.  
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you Chair.  Good evening Mr 
Gordhan.  
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Good evening Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I must just say I see that you are starting 
at half past.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, alright.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  That is what I was putting on record 
Chair.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you.  Okay, Mr Gordhan we I want 
us to try and be more efficient today because we have a lot 
of time restrictions.  So when I put propositions to you, if it 
is possible you give me a yes or a no answer or I do not 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 259 of 362 
 
know, but as I said earlier last time it might well be that 
sometimes there is a need for an explanation.  
 
So obviously we cannot suppress that, but I am 
going to pose the questions in such a way that you will 
either agree or disagree with that proposition that I am 
putting to you.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, maybe I can just emphasise.  It is 
important to do it that way Mr Gordhan, because it also 
helps to make sure that you do not end up dealing with 
other matters.  If you start with yes, I agree or no, I do not 
10 
agree, if you need to explain or elaborate then you can 
elaborate, but if you start by saying I agree or yes or no, it 
helps to make sure that we stick to the question. 
 
Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you Chair.  Yes.  Mr Gordhan, we 
you remember the five areas of cross-examination that we, 
I had raised just to recap.  We had said that Mr Moyane’s 
version was that the hostility between you had come from 
20 
what he called your arrogance which you denied and he 
also referred to what he called petty jealousies to do with 
his achievements at SARS which you denied.  
 
Then there was also the discussion on racism which 
was a longish discussion which you and I had, but 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 260 of 362 
 
ultimately you denied and so we were then left with two of 
those issues, which I will touch a little bit on ... I will do 
some recap, but we are left with two issues.  
 
One was that about your alleged deflection from 
your own involvement in State Capture and then the last 
one was that you were victimising him because he was a 
whistle-blower who had unearthed a lot of criminality or 
illegality that you had left behind at SARS.  
 
Do you remember that? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Yes.  
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you.  Now what I am going to do, 
for the sake of progress I am going to combine, those last 
two topics that were left I will combine them into one, 
because they are in any event related whether he is 
accusing you of State Capture or criminality or other illegal 
action, it is exactly the same thing.  
 
You and I had agreed previously that State Capture 
is unanimous to criminality, is it? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I am not sure what the question is 
Chair? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The question is whether you confirm that 
Mr Mpofu and you, the two of you agreed previously that 
State Capture is similar to criminality. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I partly agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that? 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 261 of 362 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I partly agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  Partly agree, okay.  So you do not think 
that State Capture is the same as criminality, corruption 
and fraud, money laundering and things like that? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Those are some of the aspects 
Chair, but they could include more.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  Okay, alright.  Okay, I will not argue with 
that, that is fine.  Partly agree, it is good enough for 
present purposes otherwise we are going to go back into 
10 
those long definitional issues.  Okay.  Now the, so today’s 
cross-examination therefore is going to be under this last 
theme of your alleged criminal conduct or State Capture 
conduct and so on, all rolled into one.  
 
But before I do that, I just want to tie up a few 
loose ends.  Do you remember that when we ended up I 
was asking you about the Sikhakane report, which I had 
put to you had never been set aside in any legal forum and 
I struggled to get an answer, but the Chair came to my 
rescue and my understanding is that finally you conceded 
20 
that that report had not been set aside.  
 
Is that still the position? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No.   
ADV MPOFU SC:  Do you think it has now been set aside? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Since we last met Chair, if I may 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 262 of 362 
 
explain.  There has been two judgments at the Gauteng 
High Court I believe of the full bench in respect of certain 
reports from the public protector, one of which and I quote 
from the judgment, says: 
 
“The reliance on a discredited KPMG report 
despite it being disallowed and the Sikhakane 
report 
despite 
it 
having 
been 
widely 
discredited, she also failed to engage the 
findings made in the Nugent report.” 
 
So it has not I suppose been formally been set 
10 
aside, but there is a commentary in that judgment on the 
Sikhakane report.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  Okay.  Do you understand the question?  
I am saying as at the 30 t h of November when we, when the 
Chair put the question to you, the answer was that the 
report had not been set aside.  
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Correct.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  Let us assume what you are saying is 
correct, you agree?  
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Correct.  
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you, and the judgment you are 
talking about, is that the same judgment where you were, 
where the judgment said that you had made scandalous 
and vexatious remarks? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I cannot remember the whole of the 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 263 of 362 
 
judgment Chair.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  Something like that.   
CHAIRPERSON:  He says he cannot remember the whole 
of the judgment.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  Well, yes Chair that is why I am 
changing the question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, what is the changed question? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I am saying do you remember that the 
judgment said something like you had made scandalous 
and vexatious remarks about the person? 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I cannot recall.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  Okay, well the judgment also said that 
you had made vitriolic and inappropriate remarks about the 
public protector.  Do you remember that?  It was not 
covered in the media, but that is what was in the judgment.  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I do not remember Chair, but I 
suppose the judgment itself will speak for itself.  Both in 
that respect and in other respects as well.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  I am sorry Chair.  Sir, if you go to I think 
it is C. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I think it is document C. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you tell me the bundle first, that will 
help.  In which bundle it is.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes Chair, it is the bundle with the, the 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 264 of 362 
 
very latest one, C.  Have you got it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes sir, she is waiting for the page 
number.  Once we know ...[intervenes] 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes, okay oh I see.  It is page 145.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Is 
that 
the 
paginated 
145 
or 
...[intervenes] 
ADV MPOFU SC:  The paginated one.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Have you got it Mr 
Gordhan?   
ADV MPOFU SC:  Paragraph 267 of the judgment.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got it Mr Gordhan? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I have page 145 Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  Since you say you have forgotten, 
this is what the judge has said: 
 
“The allegations in paragraph 228 and ...” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Mpofu, I remember that 
when I wanted you to identify the bundle I think you said 
the latest one.  I think for the purpose of the record I must 
say it is the one written N3C. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:  [indistinct – 00:19:45] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Application bundle, just for the transcript.  
Ja.  
ADV 
MPOFU 
SC: 
 
No 
Chair, 
I 
also 
did 
not 
know 
...[intervenes]  
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 265 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay, ja.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  It says: 
 
“The allegations in paragraph 228 and 232 
namely 
that 
Advocate 
Mkwabane’s 
competence, 
integrity, 
legal 
literacy 
and 
constitutional grasp of her powers, duties and 
functions are doubtful as well as setting out 
what 
other 
courts 
had 
said 
about 
her 
understanding of the constitution are irrelevant 
and the last, vexatious.  The Constitutional 
10 
Court warned that court should not likely allow 
vitriolic statements to form part of the record.” 
 
Do you remember that is what was said about your 
affidavit?  Mr Gordhan? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Can I get the paragraph again Mr 
Mpofu, which paragraph is it, 228? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  267. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  267, okay.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
And 
the 
question 
is 
whether 
you 
remember that the allegations that the judge is dealing 
20 
with in that paragraph which it says are irrelevant, 
scandalous and vexatious are allegations that you had 
made in the affidavit.  
 
Is that correct?   
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes, that is correct.  
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 266 of 362 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Yes, noted Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV MPOFU SC:  And you agree that those remarks were 
inappropriate and scandalous.  
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I agree that I notice or note what 
paragraph 267 says about the Con Court’s view on this 
matter, and it is followed by 268 Chairperson, where it 
says that we agree that these paragraphs, these things are 
irrelevant, scandalous and prejudicial.   
 
The allegations made in the remainder of the 
10 
paragraph that directed that one of the grounds of the 
review, namely the public protector acted with an improper 
motive and was biased.  So yes, at 267 and 268 those 
were, those are the words and 269 then refers to 228 and 
232 of my founding affidavit. 
 
Those paragraphs are struck out.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  And that in the, in another judgment 
which was a week later, two weeks later it was found that 
20 
your allegations amounted to spewing averments that are 
not supported by evidence.  That is what the full bench of 
the High Court said.  
 
That will be at page 208 of that bundle.  You 
remember that one? 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 267 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us get there first.  Page 208 you 
said.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  What paragraph at 208? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  85 Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph 85.   
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Chair, that those are from Sage 
150 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Page ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:  154 to page 275.  I did not receive.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did not receive that pages? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I am sure that Minister Mpofu is 
referring to a full bench judgment of the High Court.  It is 
obviously in the judgment.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  
MINISTER GORDHAN:  And I am sure you will get to other 
paragraphs in the judgment as well.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes, thank you Mr Gordhan.  Yes, no you 
can take it for granted I will not mislead you.  I am reading 
from the judgment.  The, and I am surprised if your lawyers 
20 
did not give you these judgments or maybe you have just 
forgotten.  
 
Any way, the ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Can I clarify please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 268 of 362 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  The attorneys acting for Mr Moyane 
sent these documents to the state attorney who sent it to 
my legal representative, who sent it on to me.  So it was a 
long train. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MINISTER GORDHAN:  And all I am saying that the pages I 
referred to are missing from this pack.  That is all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, but that is fine.  I think one can just 
read because I have got the judgment here.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  “The above submission ...” 
 
It says at paragraph 85: 
 
“The above submission does not assist Mr 
Gordhan’s case.  The public protector is 
complaining 
about 
the 
wording 
of 
the 
paragraph which he says is unnecessarily 
insulting, combative route.  They cannot just 
be ignored.  Much as we appreciate the fact 
that like any other [indistinct – 00:24:52] the 
applicants are entitled to challenge the report 
20 
of the public protector if it affects them 
adversely and they are grieved thereby.  We 
are however of the opinion that the applicants 
have gone overboard in this matter, more so 
because the averments are unsubstantiated.  It 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 269 of 362 
 
is indeed so that the public protector like any 
other high ranking official is not immune to 
criticism. 
 
We 
are 
in 
a 
constitutional 
democracy.  People in high office like the 
public protector need not be overly sensitive 
against criticism levelled against them.” 
 
I guess it covers what you wanted? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No, it does not.  If you just go on Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Then the next sentence: 
 
“The only difference is that such criticism must 
10 
be 
constructive 
and 
be 
backed 
by 
the 
necessary facts.  It will thus not assist a 
litigant in spewing averments that are not 
supported by evidence.  This is what the 
applicants have done in this matter.” 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you.  So, yes Mr Gordhan, I was 
not referring to you receiving the documents.  I was saying 
that these documents were, came out in December so they 
20 
should have been sent to you but that is fine.  You do 
accept that the quote, that quote, the first quote I read 
from had three judges.  
 
This other court also had three judges.  So six 
judges now.  This one said you had gone overboard and 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 270 of 362 
 
you were spewing averments that are not supported by 
evidence and that that should not be allowed, hence the 
material was struck off.  
 
You accept that? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I will certainly accept it and ask 
the Chair to note the final outcome of these judgments, 
which is quite damning of the public protector and her 
biased and if you refer to in the 7 t h of December judgment, 
paragraph 
290(5) 
for 
example 
the 
public 
protector ’s 
pandering of the rogue  unit narrative and a public 
10 
reference to the unit as a “rogue unit”, and as a “monster” 
and the stated desire to defeat the “monster” display a 
profound biased towards Mr Gordhan or Minister Gordhan 
and accidentally the same Minister Pillay that is Mr Pillay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
MINISTER GORDHAN:  So like that there are various 
comments in paragraph 290 on the conduct of the public 
protector.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Effectively what you are saying is you 
accept that the court was critical of you, but you are simply 
20 
saying you were not the only one of whom it was critical.  
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Certainly, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Ja, but you are the only one here.  I 
mean what has that got to do with it.  You are the only 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 271 of 362 
 
person who is being accused in this cross-examination of 
bending about accusations and insults at people without 
evidence.  
 
So it does not matter if a thousand other people are 
accused of the same thing.  Anyway, at paragraph 210 or 
page 210 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the last mentioned judgment? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes, of the last mentioned judgment 
Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 210? 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:  210 yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  It says ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  What paragraph? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  89. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  It also says: 
 
“When the averments made by the applicant in 
paragraph 38, 39, 40 are considered, whether 
individually 
or 
cumulatively 
they 
can 
be 
20 
construed 
as 
nothing 
else 
but 
gratuitous 
averments based on suspicion.  The averments 
are therefore vexatious and made intending to 
annoy the public protector.  A similar finding 
based on allegations cashed in similar terms 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 272 of 362 
 
by Minister Gordhan had been made in the 
other case, in the rogue unit case.” 
 
At paragraph 267 and 268, we have already gone 
through that.  is it fair to say that these two judgments, 
while they might as you say might have been scalding 
about other people were also very scalding about your 
penchant to in the about insults and victory hall and 
gratuitous averments without any evidence and in doing so, 
going overboard as the judge has said, and spewing 
averments that are not supported by evidence.  
10 
 
Do you agree? 
MINISTER 
GORDHAN: 
 
Chair, 
I 
confirm 
what 
the 
paragraphs in the judgment say and equally the judgment 
does not refer to other people.  It refers to the public 
protector and finally, both the judgments found against the 
public protector.  
 
I accept the paragraphs that Mr Mpofu refers to, 
that being that there were criticisms of one or two 
paragraphs in my affidavit.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  No, not one or two paragraphs.  Do you 
20 
accept that in respect of this aspect of the case of - about 
gratuitous insults to people.  The – both full benches in other 
words all the six judges actually found against you in favour 
of the Public Protector. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Chair again I am not a lawyer but 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 273 of 362 
 
when I read paragraph 290 onwards I do not find any 
commentary on those things. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I think it is obvious that you did not either 
read these judgments or they were not given to you.  The 
order that was at 273 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  273. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Okay so again as I say it is not one or two 
paragraphs it says – order 3 Chair. 
10 
“The 
starting 
out 
application 
which 
was 
brought by the Public Protector in terms of 
16 applications is granted in other words in 
favour of the – against him in respect of 
paragraph 38, 39, 40, 53, 54, 55 and 70 of 
Minister Gordhan’s affidavit.” 
Do you remember that? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Chair there are two judgments.  The 
one is the 7t h of December 2020 and the other is the 
judgment I think of the 19t h or thereabouts of December 
20 
2020.  I think it will be extremely helpful if we know which 
judgment we are referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well he is referring to… 
ADV MPOFU SC:  There is only one judgment that is on 273. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Can I finish here? 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 274 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes he is referring to the last mentioned 
one which … 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Which date? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which was written by Judge Gcabashe, 
Judge Twala and Judge Davis.  What page does it start on 
Mr… 
ADV MPOFU SC:  273 – okay where it starts Chair is 100 
and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us – other – oh it is one with three 
judges. 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:  135. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is the one with three judges. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Well they both have three judges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh did they both have three judges. I 
thought it was two. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  All the judges found the same thing 
against Mr Gordhan.  The first one was Judge Baqwa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to just clarify – are the parties 
the same because that is the one way of distinguishing? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or say what page it – where it starts it is a 
long judgment. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Well yes the first one Chair ends at 160. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh let us go to the second one because 
that is the one you are asking about. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 275 of 362 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes that is the one I was asking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where does it start? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  It starts at 168 I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  165. 
CHAIRPERSON:  165.  Okay it starts at 165 Mr Gordhan the 
one that ja it is – 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I was reading at 273 Chair so I do not why 
there is confusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see it does not tell – the one I have does 
10 
not have the date at the beginning of when it was given.   
ADV MPOFU SC:  But the date in front of 275 - 275. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja   Do you see which one we are talking 
about Mr Gordhan?  If you have got the page it starts at 
page 165 it is where you were the first applicant and Mr 
Maga – Mr George Ngakane, Virgil Magashule was the 
second  applicant and Mr Pillay was the third applicant.  And 
Mr Mpofu was reading paragraph 3 of the order at the end of 
the judgment.   
ADV MPOFU SC:  I think you are … 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Sorry Chair you can proceed I am 
looking at my computer to try and track it down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I can tell you that the paragraph, 
paragraph 3 really says that the application brought I think 
by the Public Protector for paragraphs 38, 39, 40, 53, 54, 55 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 276 of 362 
 
and 70 of your founding affidavit should be stuck out was 
granted.  That is what it says.  So Mr Mpofu wanted you to 
confirm that you – you know that this is the order that was 
granted under paragraph 3? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Since you have read it for Chair 
thank you very much and I know that.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Okay well more importantly the paragraph 
6 of that judgment was that the first and third applicant and 
you were the first are ordered jointly and severally to pay the 
10 
costs of the Rule 6.15 application including the costs of your 
counsel on the scale as between attorney and client.  In 
other words on the punitive stake. So the court has decided 
to award punitive costs against you for the insults the 
gratuitous insults that you had held without evidence at the 
Public Protector, do you remember that or was that explained 
to you why you had to pay punitive costs to the Public 
Protector even though it was not covered in the media? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I note the observation Chair. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes and the point I was making about that 
20 
is that it – now with the further confirmation of at least six 
judges within a week or two after we had been here you not 
only were told that you made false accusations of corruption 
and criminality against someone twice by two full benches 
but you were also marked at with punitive costs for doing so.  
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 277 of 362 
 
So that seems to be your propensity what you say about 
that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That seems to be? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Your propensity. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  (Inaudible) 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was the answer Mr Gordhan? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No there was not a question but the 
allegation was that that is a propensity which I deny. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja the – 
ADV MPOFU SC:  There was a question.  I said do you 
10 
agree with that? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I deny that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Vehemently. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  And it was also said that you remember 
where they was discussion about racism and belittling people 
and so on in November? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Do you know that again three judges, 
Judges Gcabashe, Twala and Davis a few weeks after the 
20 
last 
cross-examination 
found 
that 
your 
attitude 
was 
condescending towards African women namely the Public 
Protector. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Can you refer me to a paragraph 
please? 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 278 of 362 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:  So if I may – 155.  Now that would be the 
– the second judgment it is sorry Chair if I may just – oh yes 
para – page 205 paragraph 78.  And in relation to that one 
you had made an allegation that similar to the ones you 
made against Mr Moyane that the Public Protector was 
motivated by state capture and corrupt motives in issuing her 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry where are you reading from it is 
not on 78 is it? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where are you reading from? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I am not reading I am just. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay I thought you were referring us to 
page 205. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes I am. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you are not reading it. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I am just telling him – giving the witness 
context. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  In that regard you had accused the Public 
20 
Protector of being motivated by state capture motives for 
issuing 
a 
report 
against 
you 
48 
hours 
before 
the 
announcement of cabinet or the inauguration, remember 
that? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Where is the question of race in 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 279 of 362 
 
paragraph 78? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Do you remember the – just answer the 
question Mr Gordhan let us not start on you… 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No, no Chair. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Do not ask me questions. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Chair with great respect Mr Mpofu 
first referred us to paragraph 78 to illustrate his point that 
there is a so called racism in my conduct and I said where is 
the paragraph?  He then refers to paragraph 78.  Now for the 
public record nowhere in paragraph 78 is the issue of race 
10 
referred to that is the only point I am making.   
CHAIRPERSON:  No I am… 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  And I am sure you can see it in front 
of you as well Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No my recollection is that he did not 
use racism he said condescending – condescending and if 
you 
look 
at 
paragraph 
78 
there 
is 
a 
reference 
to 
condescending. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  He said that condescending towards 
applicant – two applicants. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That woman I think… 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No he referred to African women. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Chair he referred to African women. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mpofu just as a matter… 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 280 of 362 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Nowhere in paragraph 78 is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us start with the question that you put 
first. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that I can know whether Mr Gordhan’s 
answer is – is to the point or not or is not right. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No well Chair you can know that for sure 
because it is not to the point.  I have asked him a question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja what was the question? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I am telling him to the paragraph.  I said 
10 
to him that does he remember that the one of the judgments 
found that his attitude towards the Public Protector was 
condescending and then he said what page and then I am 
taking him to the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you did not read the page – the 
paragraph. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No I have not read the page yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I am just – I am just. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can put a question before reading it is 
20 
it not? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I mean I do not know what is going on 
now.  Pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you put a question to him before 
reading the paragraph? 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 281 of 362 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes I put a question he said he wanted the 
page so that is why I had a break to look for the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Now I found the page I am continuing with 
my questioning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright let me read what the 
paragraph 78 says. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No Chair – no we are not there yet.  We 
are not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but why are we coming here if you are 
10 
not going to let us read it? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Because I need to build up to the question 
that I have asked him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I thought there is a question you put to 
him after he had said where – what – refer him to the 
relevant page and that is the question that I think I missed. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Well Mr Gordhan if I may ask Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  The – I was just giving you the 
background and then you butted in and asked me a question 
20 
which is not allowed.  The – what I was saying is in relation 
to this questioning that I am about to ask you it was in 
relation to an averment made in your affidavit that the Public 
Protector was motivated by state capture and corrupt 
motives in issuing the report.  Do you remember that? 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 282 of 362 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No I do not but I think what I 
remember Chair is that the – the issue was how does a 
Public Protector arrive at a final report within 48 hours of  
receiving some submission or the other. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  The court on the other hand notes in 
paragraph 78 that it is also condescending of the applicants 
to want to argue that the Public Protector would unable to 
deal with their representations within a limited period of time 
of 48 hours.  The court in its – that is the court’s view – I 
10 
note the view it is recorded in paragraph 78 but there is no 
reference there to African women. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Nobody said there is a reference to 
African women in the paragraph.  I said the court said your 
attitude was condescending towards her and she is an 
African woman – you understand that?  Do you know that the 
court 
said 
you 
were 
condescending 
towards Advocate 
Busisiwe Mkhwebane who is – happens to be an African 
woman? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  The word condescending is in 
20 
paragraph 
78 
I 
have 
read 
it 
out 
already, 
I 
have 
acknowledged it Chair. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  And all I wanted to say to you is that 
that again a full bench confirmed that you belittling and 
condescending in the context we are talking about it means 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 283 of 362 
 
the same thing.  Belittling somebody and calling them cheeky 
and telling them to grow up is also condescending would you 
agree? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Not necessarily. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Sometimes? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I beg your pardon. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  If you say not necessarily I do not know 
what that means.  Is it sometimes condescending to – to 
belittle someone and call them cheeky and tell them to grow 
up?  What do you mean not necessarily? 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I am not sure about this line of 
questioning Chair.  So I note what the advocate says but I 
have no – no response to that and the previous occasion I 
denied any allegation of racism and my whole history as an 
activist of 50 years proves that as a member of the African 
National Congress which subscribes to the freedom charter.  
That is all I have to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well he was asking you whether you 
equate calling somebody cheeky – what was the other.. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Grow up. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Grow up when you say that to somebody 
whether you equate that to condescending? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Not necessarily Chair I mean you 
could have a – your child behaving badly and you say to the 
child grow up stop behaving like that. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 284 of 362 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Because you are behaving childishly.  
Or on the other hand somebody including a child who might 
be particularly impudent on a particular matter could be told 
you are being cheeky.  So there are many different contexts 
in which those words could be used and that is all I have to 
say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  And if he – yes – I agree with that.  And if 
you use it in relation to someone that you have agreed is of 
10 
the same age group as you would you agree that it can be 
condescending for someone of my age group? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  It can never be condescending to – for 
someone of my age group to tell me to grow up. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  And to – and that I am cheeky? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Not in the context. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Are you being serious? 
ADV LE ROUX:  Chair could I – could I place an objection on 
20 
the record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on, hang on.  Yes. 
ADV LE ROUX:  Chair could I place an objection on the 
record? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 285 of 362 
 
ADV LE ROUX:  Two points.  One Mr Mpofu is now reframing 
his question.  This all started because he stated as a fact 
and the transcript will show it if we have to go back and look 
it.  He stated as a fact that the full bench found that Mr 
Gordhan discriminated against an African woman.  The 
Minister then asked for the paragraph, he got referred to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you going back now.  We were…. 
ADV LE ROUX:  The condescending – Chair if I can make 
the second point. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  That is not true. 
10 
ADV LE ROUX:  Now we – if I can make the second point.  
Now because of how the conversation is unfolding around 
the condescending word in that paragraph in a judgment that 
everybody accepts what it says we are now going back to the 
racism topic that was canvassed at length for the last – 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but he is canvassing… 
ADV LE ROUX:  Mr Mpofu is halfway through his topic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he is canvassing it now in the light on 
the judgment about condescending. 
ADV LE ROUX:  Yes but Chair 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LE ROUX:  The point is what he is supposed to be 
using his hour for and he is now halfway through that is to 
deal with deflecting from your own involvement in state 
capture, the allegation made against Mr – Minister Gordhan 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 286 of 362 
 
and because – and discriminating against Mr Moyane could… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But remember that… 
ADV LE ROUX:  Now we are back to the conversation 
(speaking over one another). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember that if he does not use his hour 
optimally it is his – it is his – he has been… 
ADV LE ROUX:  Then he is going to ask for another hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He has been given an hour.  Mr Mpofu 
continue. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes Chair and I hope this mighty waste of 
10 
my time will not be calculated in the – in the hour because I 
do not know why my learned friend feels the need to lecture 
me about how to conduct my cross-examination.  So anyway 
incidentally 
we 
were 
still 
on 
the 
– 
on 
the 
topic 
of 
condescending which seems to be coming from all quarters.  
The… 
ADV LE ROUX:  Chair can we – can I object to that as well?  
Mr Mpofu is doing his job I am doing my job.  We do not 
need to make it personal. He does not need to take such an 
attack at me, at the evidence leaders etcetera.  If he just 
20 
asked questions from the one issue remaining we could 
actually get out of here today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chair I do not need Ms Le Roux to tell me 
how – which question to ask and when and why?  Really this 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 287 of 362 
 
is my cross-examination she must just sit down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  Let us continue.  
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you Chair.  Anyway the question Mr 
Gordhan really is a simple one that these judgments seemed 
to confirm that it is your propensity 
a. To insult people in a vitriolic scandalous manner 
without evidence and 
b. That to be condescending towards them. 
What is your comment? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I deny the – I deny that completely 
10 
and emphatically. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  You do not think this judgment says you 
are condescending – what is it that you are denying? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Your – the word propensity which 
you conveniently introduced. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Oh I see so it just happened that two full 
benches found your remarks to be vexatious, insulting, 
vitriolic, fatuitous all the words that I have used? Six judges 
that is just it does not show any propensity if that happened 
in front of those six judges, is that your evidence? 
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Chair there are two judgments that 
00:20:47 in a few paragraphs on language used in an 
affidavit as opposed to many paragraphs with reference to 
the substance of the matter and the substance of the matter 
is the conduct and the outcomes of that conduct in respect of 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 288 of 362 
 
the Public Protector parts of which I read in the one 
judgment on the 7 t h of December from paragraph 20 – 290 
onwards.  In both judgments the courts were completely 
condemning of the outcomes of or and the findings of the 
Public Protector including indicating displays of bias towards 
Minister Gordhan and Mr Pillay and I quote from the 7t h of 
December paragraph 20.90. So I think what we asking for is 
balance so that we can move on to the next question.  Thank 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mpofu. 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I tell you.  Okay the Public Protector is 
not under cross-examination now I am cross-examining you 
Mr Gordhan do you understand at least that? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Oh certainly but I think Chair the 
only point I am making is that it is important to give both 
context I think I heard you say that before to a previous 
witness and the specific matter that you might want to refer 
to.  The context is a judgment as a whole and the findings of 
the judgment and the specifics is one or two paragraphs.  
That is the only thing I am pointing out. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Anyway did – do you accept that part of 
your evidence in that – was that in reaching the conclusion 
that Mr Moyane was the state capture practitioner you relied 
among other things on gossip? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Yes I understand I used that word 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 289 of 362 
 
and I apologised for that and – and understood once the 
transcript was actually referred to.  But any other factors 
that – in that respect one can refer to in relation to Mr 
Moyane and state capture but if the Chair wants to get into 
that we can get into that. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Do you even… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I must just mention Mr Mpofu I know when 
you are on your feet you might not keep an eye on the time it 
is about thirty minutes past seven. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes Chair but I mean if I am getting 
10 
answers like this I have asked you a simple question do you 
– did you rely on gossip or not? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  So why did you say you relied on gossip? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I – well the word gossip was used 
loosely which I explained then. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  So which is which?  Did you rely on 
gossip or did you not rely on gossip? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Chairperson we have a repetition of 
the same question in different forms but if I may the word 
20 
gossip as I said was used and later I understood that or tried 
to 
explain 
that 
gossip 
is 
basically 
saying 
that 
was 
information at that time.  However I think what Mr Moyane 
needs to answer to that was quite evident is that the state… 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No please. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 290 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No Mr Gordhan, no Mr Gordhan the 
question is simple –  
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No okay fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The question is did you rely on gossip or 
not and it is either yes or no? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I have some direct – I had some 
direct information which I have now recollected at that time I 
did use the word gossip that is noted Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I did not ask you about using the word I 
said did you rely on gossip among other things? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  And the answer which I have given 
already Chair is not entirely. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Okay you partly relied on gossip.  Okay 
that is fine I can leave it there.  Alright now the – you were 
then accused by Mr Moyane of criminality.  Do you accept 
that – do you know about Precca the – the Act that says that 
if you know something about corruption if you do not report it 
20 
you yourself are guilty of a crime? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Vaguely yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes.  And you yourself knew you testified 
earlier that you knew about Mr Moyane’s involvement in 
state capture/corruption and all those things as far back as 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 291 of 362 
 
2016, correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  And have you ever reported that to the 
police? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  As I explained earlier Chair when Mr 
Mpofu was referring to criminality and corruption and so on 
in defining state capture I said it goes beyond just those 
elements.  So state capture is not only about criminality it is 
about for example hollowing out an institution of its senior 
and most capable people, hollowing out people who have 
10 
institutional knowledge, breaking up those parts of the 
institution that in this instance have to deal with cigarette 
and tobacco smuggling and  other forms of illicit trade which 
harm the South African economy and I think I have presented 
that to you as well as Chair on a previous occasion.  And 
dismantling the executive committee for example that existed 
at that particular time.  And centralising power.  Earlier today 
I believe you heard evidence about a central procurement 
entity which was quite fascinating because that is the 
easiest way in which to engage in the kind of activity that Mr 
20 
Mpofu is referring to which is criminal conduct in relation to 
procurement.  So state capture goes beyond “criminality” it 
is institutional damage on a wide scale in respect of 
governance, in respect of the operations of an organisation, 
in respect in this instance of the revenue collection and 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 292 of 362 
 
there are commentaries from the treasury in that particular 
regard as well and damage caused to the Human Resource 
capability that an institution has.  So it is a much wider… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Scope of 00:27:37 to the definition. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Well I do not know if you or even the 
Chair remembers what the question was.  It was a simple 
question I do not know what you have been going on for five 
10 
minutes.  Do you remember what the question was? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  The question was whether I had 
reported any corrupt activity in relation to the Precca Act and 
so will refers to the Act and what I was explaining to you is 
the difference between criminality on the one hand and state 
capture on the other hand as a wider concept. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Yes and when are you going to answer the 
question? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  To (inaudible). 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Did you or did you not report the matter to 
20 
the police?   I mean really 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I beg your pardon. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Did you Pravin Gordhan report the matter 
of involvement of Mr Moyane in state capture to the police 
yes or no?  I mean you do not need this family matter of 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 293 of 362 
 
rumbling. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  As far as I know Chairperson and I 
will be guided by yourself state capture in legislation is not 
defined as a crime. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chairperson it is really – I have to 
intervene. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  There might be a specific… 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Did you report the matter to the police or 
not? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Report what? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The matter of Mr Moyane’s alleged 
involvement in state capture that is what the question is.  
Did you report Mr Moyane’s alleged involvement in state 
capture to the police? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  But in – the – there has to be 
singular acts of corruption which at that point in time I could 
not identify subsequent… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the answer is you did not. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  The acts of corruption around giving 
a debt management company a contract to collect debts.  
20 
But no I did not report it because I did not see it was in the 
prevue of state capture. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you.  So the answer is no? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  I think that is what you heard. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Thank you.  So what was the last ten 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 294 of 362 
 
minutes about?  Alright.  Now the – the PFMA you were a 
Minister who was responsible for the PFMA as Minister of 
Finance.  So you should know it in and out.  Correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I am familiar with that. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  Now, when you...  I am going back 
to the issue of the “rogue unit” in the letter he writes to 
Minister Manual.  And it is fair to summarise that your 
letter was simply saying that SARS did not have the legal 
mandate to form such a unit.  Correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   As already...  Yes. 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And that was from legal advice that you 
obtained.  Correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I cannot remember the details. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay.  Anyway.  Maybe you just knew it.  
But you knew it would be unlawful to form such a unit 
without 
the 
involvement 
of 
the 
National 
Intelligence 
Agency.  Correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Sorry?  It would be illegal to...? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   To form a unit such as that one without 
the 
involvement 
of 
the 
National 
Intelligence Agency.  
20 
Hence, you wrote a letter to Minister Manual to that effect.  
Correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, the letter to Minister Manual 
was to explain why cooperation between the Intelligence 
Agency and SARS was necessary, firstly.  Secondly, why 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 295 of 362 
 
the unit to be located within the MIA.  Thirdly, to explain 
why the... necessity is for that activity.  And fourthly, to 
request finances for the unit.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Did you ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   It was the wording of the memo. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No.  Okay.  Did you say in your letter...  
And it is TSM(?)-375, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Did you prefer to a 
paragraph and page? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   375. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   375.  That is ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   You said ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Continue. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   To say: 
“Collecting 
tactical 
intelligence 
invariable 
means penetrating and it means accepting 
organised criminal syndicates. 
This is an activity for which SARS does not 
presently have the capability including the 
legislative 
mandates 
to 
manage... 
to 
20 
understand activities...” 
 
Did you write that?  Signed Pravin Gordhan. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   So then your answer is yes.  You knew 
that SARS did not have the legislative...  It would be 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 296 of 362 
 
unlawful for SARS to do something that it is has not a 
legislative mandate to do.  Correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   As I explained earlier Chair, that 
was correct. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  So if you – and this money – was 
this money given by Treasury? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I cannot recollect now. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   You cannot recollect? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well, if it is ...[intervenes]  
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   It could not have been on 
reflection because that memo and his intent were not 
persuade.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  So it could have been.  And if it 
was ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I am saying the opposite. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   You say the money was not given as a 
fact? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I say it is unlikely to have been – 
any money... either from SARS or from the fiscus to have 
20 
been made available because, as the transcript will show 
in the November cross-examination, this unit did not 
materialise in the form that was envisaged in that memo.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, but then you – but he unit was 
formed – it was operating within a few weeks of this letter.  
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 297 of 362 
 
This was in 2007. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   It was a different type of unit with 
a different mandate in accordance with the SARS mandate.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay but that is not the evidence of 
mister...  The KPMG report, the Sikhakhane report, the 
Kroon report.  All found that it was unlawful to – for SARS 
to breach its mandate.  And you know, at least in 2007, 
that forming such a unit would be beaching its mandate but 
...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   The Sikhakhane report has been 
10 
found to be incorrect in  its...  And paragraph 290 of the high 
court judgment on the 7t h of December, says that the Public 
Protector completely disregarded the Sunday Times apology 
and the Kroon apology.  So the Sikhakhane report, Chair, 
was discredited.  The KPMG report has been mutilated and...   
 
And as far as Judge Kroon is concerned, he 
apologised for the... with which he issued the statement and 
apologised for the contents thereof.  So none of the three 
have any legs left at all. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay.  Let us take that bit by bit.  You 
20 
accept that the Sikhakhane report has never been reviewed 
and set aside or challenged in court? 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you remember the answer to that 
earlier Mr Mpofu? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I want to know ...[intervenes]  
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 298 of 362 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay.  Maybe let take you...  Are you 
serious that the Sikhakhane report was discredited because 
the Sunday Times or something found it to be – to have 
weakness ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I am talking...  Sorry, Chair.  I am 
talking about the 7 t h of December full bench judgment of 
the Gauteng North Court under paragraph 20(6), the part 
where it says: 
“The Public Protector completely disregarded 
the Sunday Times’ apology ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   ...and the Kroon apology.  And 
then earlier in paragraph 3: 
“The reliance on the discredited KPMG report 
despite it having been disavowed and the 
Sikhakhane report despite it having been widely 
discredited.   
She also failed to engage with the findings 
made in the Nugent’s report...” 
 
These are quotations from paragraph 290. 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  Mr Gordhan, do you accept...  
Okay.  At some stage I think you were a socialist.  So you 
should you know the concept of time and space.  You 
accept that you are not a prophet? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   [No audible reply]  
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 299 of 362 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   In other words ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   [Indistinct]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja.  Well, I know you cannot accept as 
one of the dangers but you have not yet counted yourself 
...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I did not favour(?) either. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay.  Now do you accept that up until 
the 7 t h of December or whatever the date was and by the 
time we had sent our cross-examination and for seven 
years 
after 
– 
nine 
years, 
actually, 
since 
2007, 
the 
10 
formation of the unit, you – what we knew was that it would 
have been unlawful and in breach of the law and that was 
confirmed by these three reports.  You did not know 
prophetically that one day in 2021 there would be a 
judgment.  Did you? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I do not claim to be a prophet 
Chair at all. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Good. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   However, I do want to bring to the 
attention of the Chair that Mr Moyane did ask for an 
20 
opinion from Advocates Penngrove and Nomalo(?) which 
opinion, essentially, has said that the line of reasoning in 
Sikhakhane was wrong in respect of the lawfulness of the 
unit.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Alright.  Do you know that Advocate 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 300 of 362 
 
Brassie found that your authorisation of the retirement was 
unlawful, since you are talking about advocates’ opinions? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I am not aware of Mr Brassie’s 
view on that matter. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ag, well, that is what he found.  And 
also, are you aware that there was another report called 
the 
Khanyane 
opinion 
that 
also 
found 
that 
your 
authorisation of the “rogue unit” was unlawful? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   The Khanyane report dealt with...?  
I beg your pardon? 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   That also found that your authorisation 
of the “rogue unit” was unlawful. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Can you read the relevant section 
for me, please? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Do you know or do you not know that 
there was another report called the Khanyane report which 
found that the “rogue unit” authorisation was unlawful?  Do 
you know, do you not know?  Yes or no? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, I am not familiar with the so-
called Khanyane report.  And if you are referring to it, all I 
20 
want to know is, where does it say that? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay I will get back to that report.  So 
are you telling this Commission that you do not know what 
it found that your – like the other three, like, Kroon, like 
KPMG, like Brassie, like IGI that it found that your “rogue 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 301 of 362 
 
unit” was unlawful or rather your involvement in it? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Whatever I understand it, Chair, 
you can hand the report refer to the investigative unit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are three minutes away from the end 
of the hour Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  And did you know about the 
person who should know, more than all of us, about this – 
what is the Inspector General for Intelligence found – and 
Chair you will find this at TSM-354.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Did 
you 
complete 
your 
question, 
10 
Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, I was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   ...taking you to the reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I hope our ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say 25 ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   354. 
CHAIRPERSON:   354? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   351.  It starts at 351 Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Okay I have got 351.  Have you 
got it Mr Gordhan? 
MINISTER 
GORDHAN: 
 
 
I 
do 
not 
need 
it 
Chair 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not need it.  Okay. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 302 of 362 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   ...because I will comment on that 
once the question comes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay.  I am reading from the report.  
Once again, you can take my word for it.  It says 
...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I know it...  If I can intervene there 
Mr Mpofu?  Sorry. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chair, this report was taken on 
review and set aside by a court. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But let us wait to hear what question 
Mr Mpofu wants to put. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Ja.  Again you are pretending to be a 
prophet.  I am saying to you that at that time when you 
engaged in these illegal activities, you could not have 
known unless you are a new prophet that in 2020 
something was going to happen.  Anyway, the report says, 
paragraph at 3 – TSM-351: 
20 
“Moreover, 
it 
is 
clear 
from 
the 
project... 
document that only Mr Gordhan, Mr Pillay and 
Mr Van Loggenberg sanctioned this unit. 
There was a clear intention to keep the unit 
and its real purpose hidden from scrutiny...” 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 303 of 362 
 
 
You remember that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Mr Mpofu ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   [Indistinct] ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am sorry, Chair.  It is at the end of 
paragraph 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:   End of paragraph 3?  Okay alright. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, just the last sentence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Do you remember that Mr Gordhan? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No. 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay.  Then it also said at the next 
page 353.  There is paragraph 7, Chair. 
“There is further corroborative evidence to the 
fact that SARS knowing full well that it does 
not 
have 
a 
mandate 
to 
conduct 
covert 
intelligence 
collection 
in 
support 
of 
its 
activities, approach the MIA with a view for the 
MIA to establish a covert capacity and that... 
such to signing of an MOU... two institutions. 
However, the MOU was never signed and the 
20 
proposed 
dedicated 
covert 
intelligence 
capacity never took off. 
It is against the aforementioned background 
that SARS then took it upon themselves to 
establish 
a 
covert 
intelligence 
capacity 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 304 of 362 
 
considering the... proposed initiative with MIA 
was not successful...” 
 
Do you remember that? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No.  And I deny that it was covert, 
firstly.  And secondly.  Chair, I need your guidance on this.  
There have been a number of insinuations about criminality 
on my part and yet another one in this context was 
mentioned that I engaged in illegal activities.  Now I do not 
want to take up the Commission’s time but at the same 
time I do not want my integrity attacked and I do not want 
10 
to be insulted.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   ...words like prophet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I strongly object to that behaviour. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay.  Another ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Ask the question.  You will get an 
answer. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, let me ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Ask the question and you will get 
an answer. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I will pause.  I will pause. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 305 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on mister ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   I will go to the criminality. 
[Parties intervening each other – unclear] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Gordhan, your counsel is listening 
and she will get a chance to re-examine.  So she might get 
you to clarify some of the issues.  Mr Mpofu, your time was 
up before Mr Gordhan started.  I think I will let you finalise 
one more question or you clarify that one but we are at the 
end. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, Chair ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it is just that Mr Gordhan was in the 
process of asking and then he asked for guidance. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well, Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I should think that I am entitled to finish 
this topic, at least.  The... and with all these unnecessary 
interruptions Chair and ramblings on.  I hope you have 
taken that into account because ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   ...rambling ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Because about 15 or 20-minutes of time 
20 
has been wasted by both Mr Gordhan and his counsel. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, just...   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it is extra time.  It is five minutes.  It 
is extra time, it is five minutes, okay? 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 306 of 362 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Alright.  Well, before we get that.  I 
think the picture is clear.  The criminality that you are 
guilty of.  Firstly, you are guilty of perjury because you lied 
about saying that you relied on gossip and you gave 
contradicting accounts of that.  So it is a criminal offence 
to do that.  It is called perjury.  You understand that? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I note your comment. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  The second criminality on your 
part is that having identified that Mr Moyane was involved 
in what you called state capture and motive to get to 
10 
demoted or taken out of your job which you and I agreed 
earlier that state capture of organ corruption or at least 
can be synonymous.  You failed to report that to the police 
and you breached Section 34 of ...[indistinct].  That is the 
second criminality.  The third criminality ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   [Indistinct]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am sorry.  You want to comment? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Oh, sorry, sorry.  Go ahead. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, no.  The third criminality is the one 
we are busy with now which involves you having knowingly 
20 
authorised a unit which is in breach of the intelligence 
legislation in this country and I am busy with that right 
now.  You understand? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   [No audible reply]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am not saying you agree but do you 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 307 of 362 
 
understand what I am saying? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   It is a strange question Chair.  I 
note what he is saying. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  Okay.  So can I continue now?  So 
at page 354 ...[intervenes]  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chair, may I respond to those 
allegations? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So, firstly, I deny that I did perjury 
myself.  Secondly, I think it is for you as the Chair of the 
10 
Commission to decide whether Mr Moyane is finally guilty 
of state capture or not.  I made the reasonable inferences 
at a particular point in time which are fully justified by 
labour developments.  And thirdly, the ...[indistinct] report, 
as I mentioned earlier on, is also discredited, reviewed and 
set aside by a court of law. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  Ja but not on the basis that I am 
questioning you but anyway that is a matter for argument.  
The report says this quote at 354 Chair. 
“This, in fact, means that SARS being an 
20 
organ of state should request intelligence from 
the agency and it is not mandated to create its 
own intelligence collection capacity. 
The establishment of a capacity within SARS 
with 
the 
capability 
of 
exercising 
powers, 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 308 of 362 
 
objects and functions which are exclusively 
reserved of the Intelligence Services is clearly 
illegal...” 
 
And then the next, paragraph 5, it says: 
“Mr Van Loggenberg, Mr Pillay and Mr Gordhan 
established this unit and recruited persons 
with a specific skill set to engage in activities 
outside the SARS mandate...” 
 
And it was on that basis that the IGI proposed 
that you and the others be charged.  Do you remember 
10 
that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   I know that it was, as you are saying, 
later reviewed but at least this – the part that I read to you 
where the extent or they were valid until that point.  
Correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I will allow the answer and then your 
time is up Mr Mpofu.  Answer Mr Gordhan. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Chair, in the first instance, very 
similar to Advocate Sikhakhane and his refusal to allow 
20 
...[indistinct – audio distorted 00:18:00] would call them.  
The Inspector General of Intelligence never interviewed 
me.  There were one or two phone calls to try and set up 
an interview but it never actually occurred.  Secondly, as I 
said before, the IGI report was actually set aside.   
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 309 of 362 
 
 
And thirdly, that was in fact, as the Commission 
will note from the various evidence that it has before it, the 
height of the period of state capture.  And it is well-know 
that the IGI offers or parts offers they are compromising in 
that particular regard as well. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So that is all I have to say Chair.  
Thank you. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I am sorry Chair.  I really have to put 
this.  I wanted to ask for a comment but it is for the record.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   The...  If the Chairperson can go to the 
first volume? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if it is for the record, you can just 
mention what volume, what page and then say that. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Chair, it is Volume – you call it VE-3, I 
think or... 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes.  It is the statement of complaint of 
Mr Moyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   At page 31 thereof. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 310 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And...  Well, Chair will decide if you 
allow me to ask a question but let me put something on 
record first. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   That the statement itself, Chair, on 
page 1, you will see that it is headed as follows. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
“The 
statement 
of 
complaint 
in 
order 
to 
10 
satisfy...” 
 
This is Mr Moyane’s – this is the celebrated 
complaint statement that was supposed to be motivated by 
state capture. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
“The statement of complaint in order to satisfy 
my legal obligation to report allegations of 
corruption in compliance with the provisions of 
the Prevention and Combating and Corrupt 
20 
Activities Act of 2004...” 
 
And all I wanted to establish, Chair, from the 
witness was whether he was aware that this statement, the 
genesis of the statement was actually the fact that 
members of the “rogue unit” had confessed to Mr Moyane 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 311 of 362 
 
and as a result thereof he – in discharging his own 
obligations.  Otherwise, he would have been guilty of 
criminality.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you can place it on record and 
...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well, I would like to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...asking questions.  Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  He will not need to answer.  You 
can just place on record that that is your understanding of 
the position. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   So I cannot put a question? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, do not put a question. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Well, the – should I then ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You can place it ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   What I was going to ask him.  Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, do not.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   This...  Chair...  Okay that part that I am 
referring to.  And then I also want to refer to the one just 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 312 of 362 
 
above that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   ...where it says the – Mr Moyane’s 
statement says the S v Helgard Lombard, Johan de Waal, 
Ivan Pillay, Adriaan Janse van Rensburg, that is the guy, 
the gentleman who was known as Ollie, and that Helgard 
Lombard and Johan de Waal were the people who had 
confessed to Mr Moyane about their involvement, their 
involvement and that of Mr Gordhan in the “rogue unit” 
activities including bargaining the office of then NPA. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And then paragraph 19 of that 
statement, which is the last one, the last paragraph.  It 
says – Mr Monyane says: 
“I hereby institute criminal proceedings against 
all individuals mentioned in paragraph 3 above 
including those individuals who were in the 
line of command...” 
 
And that would include Mr Gordhan. 
“...and knew or ought to have reasonable 
20 
known of the illegal activities to the criminality 
investigated, face the criminal justice system 
and the rule of law in respect of allegations of 
corruption, money laundering, racketeering, 
conducting 
covert 
intelligence 
of 
the 
NPA 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 313 of 362 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I have to stop you ...[intervenes]  
ADV MPOFU SC:   “...and any other charges which 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   “...and other prosecuting authority may 
deem fit...” 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   So those are – that was the reason why 
the complaint was raised Chairperson.  Not to mambo-
10 
jumbo but state capture motives that we heard from 
Mr Gordhan. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Somebody must sanitise the podium.  
We are at nearly quarter to eight.  I will give you a chance 
to 
re-examine 
but 
maybe 
we 
should 
take 
a 
short 
adjournment before that happens.  We will take a ten 
minutes’ adjournment.   
 
We adjourn.

INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms le Roux, we have got you but we do 
not have your client. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   You do, you do, Chair. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 314 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Gordhan is there now.  Yes, Mr 
Gordhan, your counsel will not conduct a re-examination to 
clarify certain matters. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms le Roux, how much time do you think 
you estimate you would need?  I just want to have an idea 
so that we can see whether we... 
ADV LE ROUX:   Chair, I think it is probably going to be a 
little over an hour.  I would think sort of an hour and 
fifteen.  I will try to do it as quickly as possible. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV LE ROUX:   And I had structured so that it is 
schematic and that we do not have to go to bundles and go 
to documents as much as possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine, that is fine.  
Okay. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Thank you.  Good evening, Minister. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Good evening, Advocate. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Mr Gordhan, I would like to clarify certain 
facts so that the record before the Commission is clear and 
20 
I would also like to give you an opportunity to respond to 
certain themes and accusations which were made in the 
cross-examination.  I have grouped these issues into eight 
topics and I hope to get through them quickly, so I would 
ask that you answer just the question that I pose and 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 315 of 362 
 
hopefully we can then make some progress. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   That is fine. 
ADV LE ROUX:   So, Chair, the first topic I would just like 
to make sure we are absolutely clear on the record is 
exactly what happened with respect to the charge – to the 
complaint filed by Mr Moyane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV LE ROUX:   So, Minister Gordhan, when you testified 
in November 2018 for the first time before the Commission, 
why did you think Tom Moyane had laid charges against 
10 
you? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Because that was the narrative 
firstly.  Secondly, two former ministers, Mahlobo and 
Nhleko said at a press conference in 2016 that Mr Moyane 
had laid complaint against me and they named me 
specifically.  They also made a number of wild allegations 
about half a million rand or few hundred million rand being 
spent on equipment.  That was never actually true and 
never found.  And as you pointed out Advocate to the Chair 
earlier on, all this only emerged – the real facts only 
20 
emerged once we had the affidavit made available by Mr 
Moyane.   
So in the period 2016 and when the affidavit lodged 
in terms of the complaint was made available, Mr Moyane 
did not actually take the opportunity to clarify that in fact I 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 316 of 362 
 
am not one of the people against whom the complaint was 
lodged. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Thank you.  Then, Chair, I would like to 
move on to the second topic which is there was a theme in 
the cross-examination and its statement that Mr Moyane 
has made repeatedly in his affidavit in the application to 
cross-examine 
that 
he 
acted 
as 
a 
reasonable 
Commissioner, that when he lodged the criminal complaint 
he was acting as a reasonable Commissioner.  Tonight we 
heard that he also acted, and as the document makes 
10 
clear, to discharge his obligation under PRECCA,.  But he 
says that throughout this period when he laid the criminal 
complaint and then throughout your pursuit by the law 
enforcement agencies that he had merely done his duty as 
a reasonable Commissioner and I would like to test the 
proposition 
with 
you 
because 
you 
were 
SARS 
Commissioner for many, many years and through that 
period SARS has always been a target of attacks. 
So I would like to explore with you, if you had been 
Commissioner and certain things happened, how would you 
20 
have reacted so that the Commission can evaluate Mr 
Moyane’s version, that he was a reasonable Commissioner, 
and Minister Gordhan’s version that he was furthering state 
capture. 
So the first topic I would like – first example I would 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 317 of 362 
 
like to cover under that, is let us just orientate ourselves in 
time.  Mr Moyane begins his term as Commissioner on the 
1 October 2014.  Less than two weeks later on the 12 
October the Sunday Times publishes its first story, SARS 
bugged Zuma, the start of what we now call the rogue unit 
narrative.  If you had been Commissioner and the front 
page of the Sunday Times had that story, what would you 
have done in response to that article? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well, firstly, I would have asked 
the people mentioned in the article to explain the article to 
10 
me.  If I found that there was cause for concern I would try 
to get somebody within SARS, of an independent person to 
evaluate the first and then establish whether there is a 
serious concern in this particular regard or not and then, if 
necessary, 
either 
discipline 
the 
relevant 
individuals 
concerned, if they have crossed the line, so to speak, or 
take whatever legal or other actions that I would be 
advised to take by a legal professional and I am confronted 
with this every other day in respect of one entity or 
another.  But what also became apparent, as you point out, 
20 
is that subsequent to the 12 October 2014, what was 
suspicious was the leaking of information from personnel 
files within SARS as well about the pension matter and 
other matters related to some of the senior people at SARS 
as well and the question is, well, if this is confidential 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 318 of 362 
 
personal information within SARS, who is actually leaking 
it and why is this being done and what is the context in 
which it is actually being done as well.  So, where 
necessary, investigations will be pursued and if proper 
legal advice says that I must lay charges, then we will do 
so accordingly.   
 
A comparative example for reasonableness and 
action as a Commissioner is what did Mr Moyane do in 
respect of Mr Makwakwa and in that particular regard you 
have a dossier of some sort given by the Financial 
10 
Intelligence 
Centre 
to 
Mr 
Moyane 
and 
that 
dossier 
indicated that Mr Makwakwa was receiving funds in his 
account from various sources and it took Mr Moyane I think 
some four months only after this matter became public in 
one form or another to reluctantly act on that matter.   
 
So if this was consistent practice by a consistent 
and 
professional 
Commissioner 
of 
the 
South African 
Revenue Service then there had to be even-handedness in 
terms of all of the matters. 
 
But what was interesting as well, which has not 
20 
emerged, Chairperson, is that whole issue of one of these 
witnesses being asked to – so KPMG [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Gordhan …[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I am not sure if it falls in the ambit 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 319 of 362 
 
of this, but again just taking the theme of reasonableness 
and professionalism in one’s conduct. A witness is told 
pretend that you are sick and you are not available but you 
have set up the KPMG investigation to be undertaken and 
yet to telling a witness to “play truant” and play sick at that 
point in time.  So …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, Mr Gordhan, …[intervenes] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So those are some examples. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on.  Ms le Roux, if you 
want to compare the question of how one person or one 
10 
Commissioner 
would 
have 
acted 
in 
terms 
of 
reasonableness, should we not look at the same facts, if 
the same facts are known to them?  I think that is much 
more helpful otherwise we are going to all kinds of 
scenarios.  But in these facts who would you have – if you 
knew these facts about this matter, how would you have 
reacted or acted. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Yes, Chair, and that was my question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV LE ROUX:   If you had picked up the Sunday Times 
20 
what would you have done?  The Minister said he would 
have talked to the people involved in the unit, he would 
have investigated the source of this and he would have 
taken 
steps 
against 
them 
if 
[inaudible 
– 
speaking 
simultaneously] 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 320 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But, was Mr Moyane aware of the 
Sunday Times article? 
ADV LE ROUX:   Yes, Chair. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that – has that been canvassed? 
ADV LE ROUX:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Because he takes certain steps on the 
back of the Sunday Times article. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, if he knew that then I think that 
may be fine. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I was not sure that …[intervenes] 
ADV LE ROUX:   No, no, he …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. Let us continue. 
ADV LE ROUX:   On that Monday morning, you know, he 
took steps about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Accepting the truth of that story. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue then. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Mr Gordhan, do you know if Mr Moyane 
spoke to any of the unit members on – after the 12 
October, first article about the alleged unit? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Again I cannot give you absolute 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 321 of 362 
 
details but I believe – well, Mr Mpofu referred to so-called 
confessions, I do not know the context and the actual 
content of the confessions by Mr Lombard and another 
gentleman.  The second issue that is in the media over 
time as well, Chairperson, if the truancy question, as I 
framed it earlier on, pretend that you are sick and you are 
not available so that KPMG cannot question at that point in 
time, I am not sure what happened thereafter.  And there 
might well have been other interactions that I am not aware 
of. 
10 
ADV LE ROUX:   And Minister Gordhan, we will cover both 
of those topics but do you know if Mr Moyane ever spoke 
to, for example, Mr van Loggerenberg who was the 
manager of the high risk investigation unit? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I do not know. 
ADV LE ROUX:   On the 9 November 2014 there was the 
article that said the unit had run a brothel, it is common 
cause and in the public domain that Mr Moyane disbanded 
Exco as a result of that.  It is also common cause and in 
the public domain that the Labour Court overturned those 
20 
suspensions.  If you had read an article a few weeks after 
the first one that said there was a brothel being run, what 
would you have done as a SARS Commissioner? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   The same as I indicated earlier 
on, try to establish the true facts and whether these were 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 322 of 362 
 
just wild allegations and again understand the context in 
which the allegations were being made and then decide the 
appropriate line of action having consulted legal and other 
people within the SARS senior management [indistinct] 
12.31 who over the period from 1998 to the time I left in 
2009 I had learnt to trust in terms of their judgment and 
the advice that they would actually offer. 
ADV LE ROUX:   In the months that followed, the Sunday 
Times published more than 30 articles that made more than 
50 different claims about the activities of the unit.  These 
10 
included accusations of murder, interception, break-ins, 
bug-ins, eavesdropping …[intervenes] 
ADV MPOFU:   Chair… 
ADV LE ROUX:   Members purchasing lavish cars and 
homes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second? 
ADV LE ROUX:   If you had been SARS Commissioner 
what would you have done with each one of these articles. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU:   Thank you, Chair, I do not want to interrupt 
20 
my learned friend but where I come from re-examination 
covers matters that were covered in the cross-examination, 
not new material that was not covered in the …[intervenes] 
ADV LE ROUX:   Chair, this is not new material, the cross-
examination …[intervenes] 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 323 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let him finish, Ms le Roux. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Can I just finish talking?  And these 
topics that are being covered, Chair, this is the second 
one, I was waiting, hoping maybe we were going to move 
on.  I do not know where it comes from about the 30 
Sunday Times articles and so, how that arises from the 
cross-examination because that is new evidence.  Not even 
been given by the witness but being given by me learned 
friend. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Chair, the cross-examination covered the 
10 
reasonableness of Mr Moyane’s conduct when he went and 
laid charges.  The cross-examination said everything he 
did 
when 
he 
was 
SARS 
Commissioner 
was 
not 
in 
furtherance of state capture but was the conduct of a 
reasonable SARS Commissioner.  We are testing that 
proposition with the examples of a slew of Sunday Times 
articles and where Mr Moyane does not respond to them, is 
that reasonable?  That is what we are covering.  I can 
move on from the media articles if you like.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Ms le Roux, you are saying for the 
20 
second time that you were testing something.  The 
regulations say you re-examine to clarify so which might be 
different from what happens in litigation, the purpose under 
the regulations of re-examination is to clarify matters that 
might not have  - might not be clear arising from the 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 324 of 362 
 
evidence that has been led and the cross-examination that 
has happened. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Yes, Chair, and the cross-examination 
was not clear as to the basis for the contention that Mr 
Moyane was reasonable so we are clarifying and assisting 
the Commission by saying let us look at what Mr Moyane 
did, was that in fact reasonable because you are going to 
have to make a determination on whether Mr Moyane acted 
in furtherance of state capture or not and that is what we 
are busy testing. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well …[intervenes] 
ADV LE ROUX:   If he remained silent in the face of 
various things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let us go back to the question and 
as you approach each question if you can just bear in mind 
I will be asking myself what is being clarified.  That is what 
is going to be important. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second?  Mr Mpofu, is there 
anything left? 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, Chairperson, again I hope I do not 
have to do this again.  Apart from what you have said, 
Chair, all I am saying is that the “evidence” is now coming 
from my learned friend about the 30 Sunday Times articles, 
did not come from the witness, that is a fact.  The second 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 325 of 362 
 
thing is that re-examination by definition is the same as 
leading a witness in chief because that is your own 
witness.  So she cannot lead the witness, she is actually 
doing worse than leading the witness, she is actually 
giving evidence but she is not allowed to lead the witness 
and she is not allowed to give evidence, that is all.  And  
she must stick to clarification of issues that were raised in 
cross-examination.  Thank you. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Chair, let me move on, we are wasting 
time. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, please.  Yes, yes. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Mr Gordhan you testified that Tom 
Moyane had exculpatory evidence that he failed to share 
with law enforcement regarding the Pillay pension charges.  
Do you recall that evidence? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
ADV LE ROUX:   What exculpatory evidence were you 
referring to? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I was referring to an opinion given 
by Mr Vlok Symington in I think on whether the pension 
20 
was acceptable in terms of the regulations that are 
applicable at the time and the second one was an opinion 
by Mr Mapahkela(?), an attorney acting for Mr Moyane who 
specifically said that the pension issue is not of a criminal 
nature and will not – he would not advise that complaints 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 326 of 362 
 
to criminal charges be laid in respect of the pension issue 
and those were not made available to the NPA, as I 
understand it and remember it and as a result finally on the 
– is it the 31 s t I think of October, Chairperson, in 2016 the 
then head of the Prosecuting Authority Mr Abrahams 
withdrew the charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Chairperson, really, this is more than 
frustrating.  How can my learned friend ask for clarification 
on the Pillay issue.  When I raised the Pillay issue on the 
10 
30 November she objected that it should not be part of the 
cross-examination.  Today you ruled, Chair, that it should 
not be and I accepted that.  So how on earth can she ask 
on that very topic that I was not supposed to question 
about and now want clarification? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I understand your point.  Ms le Roux? 
ADV LE ROUX:   Because, Chair, you permitted the 
question and the answer was given.  Minister Gordhan was 
not given the opportunity to explain what exculpatory 
evidence Mr Moyane had before he filed the complaint.  I 
20 
am asking him to clarify that for you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you say the question was asked and 
he answered? 
ADV LE ROUX:   Yes and he – but he was not given the 
opportunity to explain what exculpatory evidence on the 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 327 of 362 
 
pension …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us move on, I have taken note.  
I cannot remember, I thought I said that there would be no 
cross-examination but you were listening.  If you say there 
was a question and there was an answer before I ruled.  
So let us move on. 
ADV LE ROUX:   I will move on, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Mr Gordhan, you testified this evening 
about an opinion received from Adv Trengove regarding the 
10 
lawfulness of the establishment of the unit at SARS.  Do 
you know what that opinion said about the Sikhakhane 
report’s finding that the unit was unlawfully established.  
Can we just get that clear on the record? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   In essence, that Mr Sikhakkane’s 
understanding of the law was wrong.  Secondly, that a 
distinction can be drawn between the kind of intelligence 
that an intelligence agency has the right to collect and 
have in its possession versus intelligence/information that 
a Home Affairs department or a SARS or whatever other 
20 
entity would and need for its operational purposes and in 
essence, if one takes it at a very practical level, if one 
says that SARS’ role is to manage its customs activity in a 
way in which our borders are secure and illegal or illicit 
economic activity does not take place and smuggling does 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 328 of 362 
 
not take place then clearly it needs the information on who 
are the smugglers, which warehouse are the cigarettes 
stored in, how are they distributed so that excise taxes can 
be levied and, if need be, criminal charges laid and that 
has happened in the past if you look at the SARS annual 
reports. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Mr Gordhan, do you know whether people 
involved in the management of the unit and given that this 
is common cause, I think I can say it was Mr Pillay, do you 
know whether his detailed rebuttal to Sikhakhane was ever 
10 
provided to law enforcement by Mr Moyane? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I am not aware of the detail there. 
ADV LE ROUX:   You testified this evening about Mr 
Moyane telling Helgard Lombard not to go to KPMG and 
telling him you are not well.  Can we just start with who is 
Helgard Lombard? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I think he is one of the gentlemen 
mentioned in the complaint.  So, Chair, your attention was 
drawn to page 1 of the bundle that Mr Mpofu distributed 
and he read [indistinct] 22.19 and Helgard Lombard, De 
20 
Waal, etcetera, etcetera, or he might not have read that 
part, he referred to the statement part but Mr Lombard’s 
name 
appears 
as 
the 
first 
name 
in 
the 
affidavit 
accompanying the complaint. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Have you ever met Mr Lombard? 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 329 of 362 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Not that I can recollect. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Do you know anything about his time in 
the unit? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, not the details.  I mean, we 
have 15 000 people in SARS at that point in time involving 
various types of activity, as I have pointed out to the Chair 
previously and to Judge Nugent as well so the detailed 
operational activities of each of the individuals I would not 
be aware. 
ADV LE ROUX:   To make sure the record is clear, do you 
10 
know why Mr Moyane appointed KPMG? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I believe there was a recommendation in 
the Sikhakhane report that some matters required further 
investigation and that as a consequence KPMG was 
appointed and of course Mr Sikhakhane, as I recollected, 
did not entertain any submissions from the people who 
actually were part of the investigating unit.  
ADV LE ROUX:   Then you referred but were not able to 
explain a reference to Mr Moyane telling Mr Lombard 
something like you are not well and that he must stay 
20 
home.  What precisely was it that you were testifying 
about? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I have been told, Chair, that this 
event took place when Mr Lombard was called.  I cannot 
remember which document I read it in now but he was 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 330 of 362 
 
called.  Mr Lombard then on the morning that he should 
have made his appearance before the KPMG investigators, 
one of whom I think was a Mr van der Walt, and was that 
told that he should say he is sick and go home and I 
believe there is a recording somewhere that amplifies on 
this or illustrates this particular thing. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Mr Gordhan, were you ever interviewed 
by KPMG? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Were you ever interviewed by the IGI? 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Were you ever interviewed by the 
Sikhakhane panel? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Were you ever interviewed by Judge 
Kroon’s panel? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Were you ever interviewed by the joint 
standing committee on intelligence? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No. 
20 
ADV LE ROUX:   Were you ever interviewed by the 
standing committee on Finance? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   On this matter, no. 
ADV LE ROUX:   On the issue of the unit? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 331 of 362 
 
ADV LE ROUX:   So, Chair, to wrap up this theme.  Mr 
Gordhan, in light of the fact of what you have testified to 
with respect Mr Moyane’s conduct with respect to KPMG 
that you have – you are unaware of him ever further 
exploring the Sunday Times articles, you were denied audi 
by all of these bodies that made findings about the unit, 
would you like to make a final comment about Mr Moyane’s 
contention that he acted reasonably when he laid a 
complaint against, when he laid a complaint with law 
enforcement? 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, the only point I wanted to 
make, Chair, is that you should take note that all of the 
reports that Mr Mpofu refers to earlier on where all reports 
that appeared to have a bias did not entertain any 
counterviews, if you like or audi alteram partem being 
implemented and in the KPMG instance I remember on the 
14 December when I had just taken over of 2015 when I 
was reappointed by President Zuma as Minister of Finance 
saying in a press conference that KPMG’s remarks in some 
document over here that I should have known about 
20 
whatever it is that they were referring to in relation to the 
investigative unit was unacceptable and I challenged them 
and today apparently KPMG is sitting across the table and 
looking at settlements with the people that have been 
impacted a result of their shoddy work in this particular 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 332 of 362 
 
regard. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Thank you, Chair, if I can then move on 
to the third topic which is your conception of this concept 
state capture because there were several moments in the 
cross-examination where you were asked to limit your 
definition for purposes of the question to criminality and 
you answered things like you only partly agree that it is 
about that, it could have other aspects.  Could you just 
explain to the Chair what you understand state capture to 
include? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know if you really want him to 
do that.  Last time under cross-examination he provided 
quite some explanation which I understood. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   And, Chair, you could refer to my 
original submission to you in 2018 in which I referred to a 
report by academics in South Africa and of course since 
then I have learnt a lot about the impact of state capture 
on institutions including state owned enterprises on which 
you are hearing evidence as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  What I am saying, Ms le 
20 
Roux, it was quite clear what he said. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Then related to that, Minister Gordhan, 
why is SARS important in the state capture project? 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 333 of 362 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   As I explained that earlier to the 
Commission as well, I mean, SARS is what you would call 
a critical fiscal institution that in my experience the 
Minister of Finance when looking at a prospective budget 
will have some sense on the basis of macroeconomic data 
which includes GDP growth, household consumption, gross 
fixed 
investment 
in 
an 
economy, 
the 
likely 
inflation 
scenario that will be provided by Stats South Africa, the 
view of the South African Reserve Bank on that particular 
matter amongst other macro factors and make an estimate 
10 
of what it anticipates on the basis of previous years’ 
experience, the kind of revenue it can anticipate in the 
future, firstly. 
 
Secondly, is the cost side or the expenditure side 
which will be tailored to in some senses manage the gap, if 
you like, between revenue and cost or expenditure. 
 
Thirdly, the Minister of Finance and his team will 
have to look at the issue of borrowing requirement in a 
particular year and the current Minister of Finance has 
made a number of comments in that particular regard in a 
20 
particular 
framework 
then 
applies 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
borrowing requirements and the interest to be paid in 
respect of the debt that is actually owed.    
So revenue constitutes a critical part of the budget 
process firstly, and secondly the tax to GDP ratio, as I 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 334 of 362 
 
explained to you in 2018 Chairperson is a very important 
part 
of 
establishing 
whether 
and 
what 
kind 
of 
tax 
compliance you have in a country and there is evidence 
which show that during Mr Moyane’s term of office, and 
this information comes from the Treasury, there was a 
decline in revenue, there was a decline in the tax GDP 
ratio and some would say there was decline in relation to 
the tax buoyancy issue. 
 
So SARS plays a critical role in ensuring tax 
compliance, in ensuring that all of us declare our taxable 
10 
income and that way Government knows what it can 
actually spend on. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Now one element of the cross-
examination was that Mr Moyane says you were jealous 
because he was the first Commissioner to collect a 
R1trillion.  Mr Moyane is appointed in October, could you 
clarify for the Chair and explain how much credit Mr 
Moyane can get for that R1trillion in the first year? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I mean, a R1trillion is obviously an 
important milestone in the kind of context that we have in 
20 
South Africa.   I think, when democracy came to South 
Africa in 1994 Chair, having the collection was around a 
few 100 billion rand to reach a trillion mark is a huge 
achievement. But as Mr Cecil Morden, who was the chief 
director for taxation, at the National Treasury said to the 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 335 of 362 
 
Nugent Commission, and this is where he describes the tax 
revenue buoyancy, declining from 1.26 in 15/16 to one 
16/17.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hold on Mr Gordhan, Mr Mpofu? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Chair, how is a witness now allowed to 
rely on a secondary resource about a matter which was not 
dealt with in cross examination, at the very least, to the 
extent that it was dealt with, he conceded that Mr Moyane 
was not only the first one to collect a trillion but he 
achieved that feat again, and again. 
10 
ADV LE ROUX:   Yes, Chair I am asking…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let Mr Mpofu finish Ms Le Roux. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Can I finish, thanks and that is the first 
part of the objection, Chair.  The second part is the 
reliance on Mr, whatever his name is, but we do not know 
where that sauce is in – what the credibility of that person. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, you want to…[intervene] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   But Chair, can I complete my 
answer? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you do so let me hear what your 
20 
counsel has to say to say to what Mr Mpofu has just said. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Yes, Chair in cross examination says one 
of the reasons why you cannot say Mr Moyane was part of 
State capture.  One of the reasons you say that is because 
you are jealous, he collected a trillion rand.  So I am 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 336 of 362 
 
clarifying and trying to understand whether a trillion rand 
can be to Mr Moyane’s credit and that is what the witness 
is explaining.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think the question is legitimate, but 
just that your answer from the beginning, Mr Gordhan and 
if you come to the point where I interrupted you, we will 
take it from there we will take it from that stage. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Chair, I am sorry I do not understand 
that ruling Chair how can the question be legitimate when 
it is based on a false premise?   There was never, not me 
10 
at least, nobody said in this Commission, that one of the 
reasons Mr Moyane was motivated by State Capture was 
because he was jealous. 
That - the five issues that are raised in this 
Commission arrogance, petty jealousy, racism, deflection, 
and victimisation of a whistle-blower were explained as the 
reason for the hostility between the two gentlemen and that 
– so I do not know how…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the jealousy, what was the context 
of the jealousy? 
20 
ADV MPOFU SC:   It was one of those five things which 
came from the hostility.  So I do not know how you can 
uphold the ruling, I mean the argument which is based on a 
false premise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As I understood the position, certainly it 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 337 of 362 
 
had been said, that is how I understood, it had been said 
or suggested that Mr Gordhan was jealous because Mr 
Moyane had achieved the collection of a trillion rand 
something that had not happened before.  Okay, that part 
you agree with? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I agree Mr Chair, yes this is something 
that Mr Gordhan had never achieved. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that part you agree? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, I agree with that but I am saying 
that was not as my learned friend summarised when you 
10 
agreed 
with 
her 
that 
was 
therefore 
the 
reason 
for 
the…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say in the way she had put it was 
different? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   It was wrong, not different but you 
upheld it Chair.  I am saying that was a matter of the 
hostilities, I had faced the hostilities between them through 
among other things.  So at least let us uphold the correct 
thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it is late it has been a long day for 
20 
all of us. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Yes, Chair and Minister Gordhan’s 
evidence has been there was to the extent there was 
hostility, it was because he believed Mr Moyane was 
following out SARS to advance the State Capture project, 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 338 of 362 
 
that is how they connected. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but go back to your question about 
the achievement. 
ADV LE ROUX:   So the question is this – I am clarifying 
this issue that Mr Moyane says you were jealous because I 
got the trillion rand.  And I am clarifying in saying, did Mr 
Moyane, in fact, get the trillion rand, can he take credit for 
the trillion rand and the Minister is explaining that it is 
inevitable because of inflation because of the tax base 
because of the economy, that someone who would have got 
10 
to a trillion rand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV LE ROUX:   So it would not be…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, can Mr Moyane take credit for 
achieving the trillion-rand collection. Mr Gordhan? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I have answered that already 
Chair with respect, and I said that the number is a good 
number to reach, and if I may, with your consent just give 
an illustration, if someone runs the 100 meters, three 
seconds ahead of the world record, you say that is a 
20 
fantastic achievement.  
The point we are making here is a simple one.  We 
are going to reach 1 trillion at some stage, we are going to 
reach 1.5 trillion at some stage and we are going to reach 
2 trillion at some stage.  That is the logic of economic 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 339 of 362 
 
growth, that is the logic of inflation and the level of tax 
compliance and economic activity you have within an 
economy.  So it is a matter of jealousy and so on, I believe 
is not a matter that we should even be looking at here 
because there is nothing of that sort.  What do I have to be 
jealous about?  
The logical development towards a trillion rand is a 
logical development that will happen, whether Mr X is there 
or My Y is there at the end of the day.  You should ask, did 
you actually see an increase in the performance of SARS?  
10 
Could there have been more than a trillion rand’s 
collected if the tax gap widened during that period?  And 
the answer to all of that is very simple, those things did 
not happen from the evidence I have seen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is your answer that Mr Moyane 
cannot take credit at all for that achievement, or is your 
answer that he can take some credit, but not all the 
credits, what is the? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   We will give him some credit in 
the moment of generosity. 
20 
ADV LE ROUX:   Thank you, Chair that was the fourth 
topic if I can move on to the fifth.  Mr Mpofu alleged, 
Minister 
that 
you 
changed 
your 
statement 
to 
the 
Commission about meeting the Gupta’s.  Chair, this was in 
the context of my learned friend’s cross examination that 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 340 of 362 
 
meeting the Gupta’s is a sign that you are involved in State 
Capture.  
And he made the statement that you changed your 
statement to the Commission.  The public record will 
record that at the time that you testified in November 2018, 
the EFF made this claim that you changed your statement.  
To be clear on the record Minister Gordhan how many 
statements did you file with the Commission before you 
testified in November 2018? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   One as far as I know. 
10 
ADV LE ROUX:   And how did it come about that your 
statement addressed the famous Ambani meeting where a 
member of the Gupta family may have been present? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I think I have said it here and I 
have said it elsewhere as well, that I have no recollection 
that a Gupta person was in that discussion, accompanying 
Ambani and for the umpteenth time let me say that the 
meeting that I went to was a meeting between me and Mr 
Ambani who might have been interested in investing in 
South Africa.  
20 
He was accompanied by people even today, I 
cannot remember who was there but the person who 
reminded me was my former chief of staff, currently the 
Director General of the Treasury Mr Mogojane and he said 
no, you forgetting this person was there.   
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 341 of 362 
 
Well, I said, if you say I will included and so I put it 
into my statement and then informed Parliament that this is 
how - what I said to Parliament has to be changed, 
because there is new information that my former chief of 
staff has made available to me. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Do you know how the EFF obtained your 
draft statement, that that did not include the Ambani issue? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No idea. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Chair, if I can then move on to the sixth 
topic, which is the unit, and it is important to just go 
10 
through…[intervene] 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Chair, again, this is not allowed in re-
examination it is not the time to mislead the tribunal or to 
put a question in a skewed fashion.  This is what I said to 
Mr Gordhan on this topic at page 367 of the record: 
“Okay well, I am putting to you then that you are 
asking because what you are avoiding to answer 
which I do not understand, but one of the signs of 
meeting the Gupta’s but let us move on.  So you 
had changed your statement to the Commission to 
20 
reflect that you did meet with the Gupta’s, correct?” 
And the Mr Gordhan: 
“Yes, the reminder that I received from my then 
chief of staff who is currently the DG of Treasury 
Mogojane.” 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 342 of 362 
 
So he accepted that he changed his statement to the 
Commission.  So I do not know what it is that my learned 
friend wants the witness to now say. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Yes, I am clarifying that there was one 
statement that included that, to the extent that there is 
ambiguity, that changing your statement means you had a 
statement and then you changed it.  He had a statement 
and there was one statement filed.  
CHAIRPERSON:   If I understand, I understood that what 
must have happened is that at some stage, whether in the 
10 
Commission 
or 
in 
Parliament 
or 
elsewhere, 
Minister 
Gordhan had written or spoken on the basis of a certain 
number of occasions when he had met with the Gupta’s or 
had been in a meeting where there was somebody from the 
Gupta family. 
But that later on, after such a statement may have 
been made, whether in the Commission or in Parliament, 
his then chief of staff or DG of National Treasury alerted 
him of another occasion, when he said involved somebody 
from the Gupta family or associated with the Gupta family, 
20 
that was my understanding of what had happened, of what 
the position is or was, is that correct? 
ADV LE ROUX:   Yes. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Can I clarify Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 343 of 362 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   May I do that?  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   So I think you are right, let us 
separate what happened in Parliament, and what happened 
in preparation for the Commission, during which I met 
some of your legal representatives as well.  
So in preparing the statement, various drafts were 
prepared, 
and 
various 
people 
that 
were 
relevant 
to 
particular 
sections 
might 
have 
looked 
at 
it, 
or 
that 
particular draft of that section of the draft to verify my 
10 
memory.  And it was in the course of that that Mr Mogojane 
reminded me that this Gupta individual whoever he might 
be, was present in a meeting.  That meeting was the 
meeting with Mr Ambani, so it was no meeting with Mr 
Gupta.  
It was a meeting with Mr Ambani where this 
individual was present in the statement presented to you 
as the Commission and the Chair of the Commission.  That 
is the version that is there, there was no change in the 
statement 
and 
that 
is 
the 
point 
what 
my 
legal 
20 
representative is making. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So there was no final statements, signed 
statement that you may have lodged somewhere whether in 
Parliament, which had given a different number of context 
or? 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 344 of 362 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No Chair, in parliament there is no 
such thing.  That is why I am separating Parliament and 
the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and so, you say there was a 
draft…[intervene] 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes, a draft that was meant for 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, a draft in preparation, which had 
been prepared for submission to the Commission, but that 
draft, and that draft included a different number of 
10 
occasions.  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   That is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And subsequently, before that draft 
could be final you were reminded by your chief of staff or 
DG about another incident.  So the final statement that you 
signed, was different from what had appeared in the draft, 
is that the position? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   That is right, so there was no 
change in a formal statement to the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
20 
ADV LE ROUX:   Thank you. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   And any assertion Chairperson, or 
attempt to mask this of escape of the reality.  I have never 
engaged with the Gupta’s as the criminals in the State 
Capture process have done, I have never been to their 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 345 of 362 
 
household, I have never met them on a one to one basis 
except for when I was forced to. 
And I think even in my submission to you, I 
indicated one occasion when I visited President Zuma to 
discuss some other matter, and one of the Gupta brothers 
happened to be there, and we exchanged a few words 
about small business, that was the end of the story.  But 
any assertion that I had anything to do with the Gupta’s is 
rejected in a complete and emphatic way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright Mt Mpofu do you still have 
10 
a problem? 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Chair, you know, this is not such a 
critical point, except that the Commission should not be 
misled, deliberately or otherwise.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   I said at page 70, I said: 
“I am sorry, Mr Gordhan if I interrupted you the 
question I was asking you is that you denied meeting the 
Gupta’s I agree you cannot remember the exact formulation 
but when you answered the DA you denied, correct?’ 
20 
Minister Gordhan: 
“Yes, Advocate Mpofu.” 
Thank you. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Yes, Chair that was in Parliament, were 
clarifying that there was only ever one statement to this 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 346 of 362 
 
Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but that is why I explained earlier 
on I said do you remember I said that my understanding 
had been that Mr Gordhan had made a certain statement 
may be in Parliament may be in this Commission, where he 
had given a certain picture or number of interactions.  But 
then there was another statement where there was a 
different number of interactions.  
ADV LE ROUX:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now if what Mr Mpofu is saying is 
10 
correct, then it is in line with what my understanding had 
been.  So leave out the drafts that Mr Gordhan talking 
about if what Mr Mpofu is saying is correct.   
A statement was made maybe it was a verbal 
statement and not a written statement in Parliament, which 
after his chief of staff reminded him of some interaction 
necessitated a correction as it were.  So, let Mr Gordhan 
qualify was there a statement in Parliament? 
ADV LE ROUX:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did that statement give a picture 
20 
different 
from 
the 
statement 
that 
was 
filed 
in 
the 
Commission on the issue of…[intervene] 
ADV LE ROUX:   On Ambani and that Chair, and all I am 
doing is clarifying that when Mr Mpofu said, did you 
change your statement to the Commission?  That we are 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 347 of 362 
 
clear did he mean the statement he made once in 
Parliament not you had more than one statement to this 
Commission.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV LE ROUX:   That you had changed your evidence in 
this Commission.  His always been consistent in this 
Commission when his chief of staff reminded him of the 
Ambani meeting he included it in his one and only 
statement to this Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Mpofu it looks like…[intervene] 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Yes, Chairperson as I said, I do not 
want to belabour this point.  I think at least my learned 
friend now agrees that there was a difference, at least as 
between the Parliament statement and the one given to the 
Commission.  
 
I am saying and I accept that, but I am saying the 
problem goes further than that, in that Mr Gordhan in the 
previous answer that I read out to you Chair had conceded 
to changing the statement of the Commission, that is a 
different matter.  So if there were two changes, that makes 
20 
it even worse, the statement in Parliament was made in 11 
April 2016.  
The one change that I was talking about had 
happened two years later, 2018.  So it cannot be the same 
mistake every time the DG is reminding him about the 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 348 of 362 
 
same thing. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Chair, that is with respect that is 
inaccurate, there is one statement Minister Gordhan has 
explained 
that 
when 
he 
was 
preparing 
it 
for 
the 
Commission, his chief of staff reminded him of Ambani he 
included it in the statement.  
So that is, in fact, the position that is what his 
consistent evidence has been we just clarifying it, I can 
move on to the next topic. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can move on ja. 
10 
ADV LE ROUX:   Chair and Minister Gordhan the next topic 
is various aspects of the so called Rogue Unit narrative.  
Mr Gordhan you testified again this evening, that there 
were two different units, there was the idea of one in the 
NIA that needed money approved by Minister Manual and 
then there was the actual unit.  
It was established, it just had various names, its 
last name was the High Risk Investigations Unit.  Did you 
ever have anything to do with that unit’s recruitment for 
staff?  
20 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Do you know what its operations were? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Not the details that I can 
remember now, no.  
ADV LE ROUX:   Do you know what all of the…[intervene] 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 349 of 362 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   But I know the general, sorry, 
sorry, my apologies, go ahead. 
ADV LE ROUX:   No, no finish? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, I was just going to simply say 
that this was - as I explained to the Commission earlier, 
and I have repeated many times that customs and tax 
agencies around the world have these sorts of units.   
I think in my original appearance before you Chair 
in 2018, I think I said, to go to the website of the World 
Customs Organisation, which I Chaired for five years and 
10 
you will see some of the references for similar types of 
units. So if one wants to put this accurately, this was an 
Investigative Unit, it was not a Rogue Unit.  It was an 
Investigative Unit that was going to catch the rouges, who 
were not paying their taxes and evading customs laws. 
ADV LE ROUX:   You testified this evening about 
something that is…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to mention it is 15 minutes 
before the expiry of an hour.  I know you that you said you 
could be a little more than that, but I am just alerting you. 
20 
ADV LE ROUX:   Thank you, Chair.  Minister Gordhan you 
testified tonight about something called Project Sunday 
Evenings, this was the so called bagging of the NPA.  You 
were cross examined about confessions that Mr Moyane 
received from members of the unit.  Do you know anything 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 350 of 362 
 
about a Project Sunday Evenings? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Not at that time, I have heard 
about it subsequently.  I believe this was some work that 
Mr Nell of the NPA asked certain people to do, but I have 
no knowledge of the details. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Have you ever instructed anybody to bug 
the NPA? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Have you ever instructed anybody to bug 
President, former President Zuma’s home? 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No.  
ADV LE ROUX:   Have you ever instructed anybody to bug 
anybody?  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No.  
ADV LE ROUX:   Have you ever instructed anybody to use 
a fake ID? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Have you ever instructed anybody to 
undertake undercover operations? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I am not sure what that means but 
20 
as I said, I did not deal with operational matters. 
ADV LE ROUX:   When I say undercover operations, I 
mean operations where someone assumes another identity 
a cover, and they infiltrate, for example, a smuggling ring. 
Have you ever instructed anybody to do something like 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 351 of 362 
 
that? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, it is not my job to do that. 
ADV LE ROUX:   If I can then move on to the Sikhakhane 
Panel Report, you were asked repeatedly denied and 
confirmed that as far as you know, that has never been 
reviewed in a court.  Do you know…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Le Roux. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Has he not explained the position very 
clearly on the Sikhakhane Reports.  I think he has said to 
10 
his knowledge, it may not have been a set aside or it has 
not been set aside, but he said, there are certain 
judgments, which, as I referred to it as, as discredit. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Yes Chair and I want to clarify why he 
says it is discredited. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, he did not say it is discredited 
himself well, maybe but I know, I think he was emphasising 
that judgment and said it is discredited. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   And again, I do not know where the 
Chair got that formulation of judgments, which judgments? 
CHAIRPERSON:   He referred to judgments when you were 
cross examining him? 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 352 of 362 
 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, he referred to one judgment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, well, maybe it was one. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   No, it is not maybe it was definitely 
one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am saying maybe because - Mr 
Gordhan was at one judgment? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   I was quoting from paragraph 290 
of the 7 t h of December judgment, Chair. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Oh thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The others were opinions of advocates. 
10 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But only one judgment, okay.  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Yes, it is a matter of legality. 
ADV MPOFU SC:   Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He says one judgment.  
ADV MPOFU SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Le Roux. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Yes, Chair.  Minister Gordhan you 
testified before the Nugent Commission.  Do you recall 
what the Nugent Commission said about the Sikhakhane 
20 
Report? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Not the detail, I am afraid. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Do you know, Mr Moyane ever reviewing 
the Nugent Report? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   No, there have been various 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 353 of 362 
 
claims to that effect but as far as I know, no review has 
been set in motion. 
ADV LE ROUX:   If I can then move on to the KPMG 
Report, you described that as having been disavowed and 
that KPMG are now settling with people at SARS, could you 
just explain what process you are referring to?  
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well, Chair there has been a 
number of engagements with KPMG as you know, the 
previous 
CEO 
resigned, 
the 
new 
Chairperson 
was 
appointed.  I met the Chairperson on one or two occasions, 
10 
and then he seems to have disappeared.  However, I 
believe there are certain staff who have suffered in terms 
of their jobs being lost, and so on quite severe damage to 
their financial well-being and to the general well-being.  
Today, engaging in one way or another, with KPMG, and 
SARS to have some kind of reparation paid to them as a 
result of the suffering that they have been through.   
So that that is what I am aware of and then I was 
referring again, to paragraph three of the 7 t h of December 
judgment, which makes reference to the discredited KPMG 
20 
Report. 
ADV 
LE 
ROUX: 
 
 
You 
also 
testified 
under 
cross 
examination that you received an apology from Judge 
Kroon could you explain to the Chair what that apology 
entailed, what was he apologising for? 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 354 of 362 
 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Well, in the first instance, for not 
applying his mind, as I recall it, to the Sikhakhane opinion, 
independently, and secondly for issuing some statements, I 
think, at the time, on the basis of that and he was rushed 
into it, it would appear by certain people who are now at 
the bar and elsewhere in South Africa.  
And thirdly, that he had wrongly said, whatever it 
was that Sikhakhane had said, in relation to the unit, and 
that more importantly he as a Judge did not put into 
practice 
how 
the 
alteram 
principle, 
meaning 
as 
you 
10 
indicated earlier or rather, my response indicated earlier, 
he did not come and ask me what is my view on the various 
matters that were being considered by the Kroon panel. 
ADV LE ROUX:   Thank you, if I can then move on to the 
seventh topic.  Minister Gordhan the Snowman Dossier was 
referred to in your cross examination.  It was in the context 
of it being the basis for the IGI Report, into the unit.  This 
Snowman Dossier, it is not the first dossier that has made 
allegations against you, is that correct? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:   Oh there has been various 
20 
dossiers over time, I do not even remember their names.  
There was another which mentions Minister Nene for 
example at the time.  What was it called Spider Web or 
something like that.  So that is part of the fake news industry 
as we now know it today. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 355 of 362 
 
ADV LE ROUX:  And when you say the fake news industry 
with respect to yourself what allegations have been made 
against that you consider to be fake news? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Oh I am supposed to have a very 
nice account in Canada for example with millions of dollars 
which is non-existent of course and various such allegations 
all designed to engage in counter smearing so to speak or 
smearing my integrity and good standing if you like in an 
attempt more importantly to actually mask the nefarious 
activities of various individuals and I referred to this Chair if 
10 
you will remember in 2018 as well. 
ADV LE ROUX:  Do you know who the authors of these 
various dossiers are? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No. 
ADV LE ROUX:  Could you explain… 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Some of them came to originate in – 
I beg your pardon – some of them seemed to claim to be 
originating in the intelligence services so you will recall that 
prior to my dismissal or rather recall from London when I 
was on an investment road show was this alleged report I 
20 
forget what it is called now that was shown to officials of the 
ANC at the time and which had no foundation whatsoever or 
was it the SACP I am not sure.  But once that was 
discredited that was it – set aside and some other reason 
was found to cover up what the real reasons were for the 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 356 of 362 
 
dismissal of various ministers at the time. 
ADV LE ROUX:  Can you explain to the Chair why you think 
you feature in all these dossiers?  Why are you the target of 
all these different dossiers? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  No idea.  I seem to be popular for 
some reason.  But clearly exposing corruption – setting into 
motion controls that will limit the possibilities of corrupt 
activity in various institutions and such like activity is getting 
in the way of certainly the people who are extracting cash 
but more recently there was a claim made by Carl Niehaus in 
10 
I think some press statement or the other who had said that I 
went out of my way as the Treasury officials prior to Ms 
Mandonsella now Professor Mandonsella completing her 
state – I think it was called the State of Capture Report and 
making funds available which is a complete distortion of the 
truth.  The truth of the matter was she did request more 
money from the Treasury that money was not available and 
what the Treasury often does with such requests and 
demands if you like is to actually help the people concerned 
as a Director General or a Minister interrogate their own 
20 
finances and see how they could make savings on the one 
hand so that they could actually find the money to do 
whatever it is that they wanted to do.  And that is the 
systems that officials of the Treasury not me gave to the 
justice department and the Public Protector at the time to do 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 357 of 362 
 
whatever she wanted to do at the time.  So this claim that I 
went out of my way especially to make money available so 
that – for example this commission would be set up to 
investigate state capture is absolute nonsense to say the 
least. 
ADV LE ROUX:  And then finally Minister Gordhan there was 
a 
lot 
of 
time 
spent 
in 
cross-examination 
making 
the 
accusation that you are a racist.  Could I ask you to explain 
to the Chair given your history in the struggle, given the fact 
that you were detained and brutally tortured, giving the 
10 
impact on your family… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Le Roux did he not explain that 
sufficiently not only today but last time under cross-
examination.  I thought he explained that quite well.  I do not 
think there is anything unclear about what he was saying. 
ADV LE ROUX:  Yes Chair but I would like him to place on 
the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No he has it is clear he has – he – he 
referred to his struggle – his role in the struggle, he referred 
to his membership of the ANC if I recall correctly.  He said 
20 
quite a number of things I am not sure that there is anything 
unclear about where he stands or what he said about them. 
ADV LE ROUX:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LE ROUX:  He testified that he is not racist.  I am 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 358 of 362 
 
asking him how it feels to be called racist on behalf of Mr 
Tom Moyane? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but what does that clarify? 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  May I make a brief comment Chair 
so we can conclude this matter? 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No Chair can I object before he makes 
any comment brief or otherwise? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV LE ROUX:  Chair also – no can I just explain the 
question?   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LE ROUX:  Mr Moyane makes allegations… 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chair I am on the floor really I cannot 
stand this – 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Okay. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  This cannot be happening for the third 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mpofu. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Ms Le Roux must shut up when I am 
speaking. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mpofu let me just hear please. 
ADV LE ROUX:  Hey. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Must you must just hear. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  You too Mr Gordhan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mpofu just sit down let me hear her 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 359 of 362 
 
first. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Oh I am still on the floor.  He must also 
shut up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no Mr Mpofu I am in charge here 
please sit down.  Let me hear first what she has to say. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  But I am still talking Chair she butted in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but she had not explained … 
ADV MPOFU SC:  So why must I sit down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I want to hear an explanation then hear 
you then I will … 
10 
ADV MPOFU SC:  But Chair I am still speaking why must I 
(inaudible). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but Mr Mpofu I am in charge here I am 
saying sit down. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Well Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please.  I will hear her and then I will hear 
you. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Le Roux. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  Maybe then we should leave because if 
20 
we are not allowed to speak … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am warning you. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  You allow interruptions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are going to be allowed to speak. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 360 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Le Roux explain? 
ADV LE ROUX:  Thank you Chair.  Chair a lot of time was 
taken up in the cross-examination contending that my client 
was racist so that was when he first appeared in the cross 
and this evening they tried to extrapolate from the Public 
Protector judgments he tried to make an accusation that he 
had treated the Public Protector in a racist fashion.  It is true 
that Minister Gordhan testified previously that he rejected 
the statements that he was a racist.  I am now asking that 
you give him the opportunity to explain to you and to the 
10 
country quite frankly how he feels as a person when he is 
accused of being a racist by Mr Moyane? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that does not clarify anything Ms Le 
Roux the purpose of re-examination under the regulations of 
the commission is to clarify. There is – I do not think it is – it 
clarifies anything. 
ADV LE ROUX:  Chair it is also to assist you when you 
valuating the testimony that comes out in cross-examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I have heard Mr Gordhan he has 
explained himself and I think sufficiently. 
20 
ADV LE ROUX:  Then Chair that completes my re-
examination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright.  Thank you.  I think we 
are going to adjourn because I think now that I have not 
allowed the question then there is no – there would be no 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 361 of 362 
 
objection. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  There is – 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MPOFU SC:  I want to say Chair place on the record 
that 
it 
cannot 
be 
that 
Mr 
Moyane 
and 
his 
legal 
representatives are treated like this in this commission.  I 
was speaking I have – I did not interrupt when Ms Le Roux 
was making objections and I am in the process of making an 
10 
objection and I do not know on what basis I should be told to 
sit down when I am still speaking and she has interrupted 
me.  I cannot be interrupted by junior counsel when I am still 
speaking and I need to finish my point.  So I think it is 
completely unfair I think it is uneven the way parties are get 
– get treated here and I just wanted to place that on the 
record.  It is completely wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am just going to say this.  Yes I did ask 
to hear what you have to say but she wanted to explain and I 
considered that it would be more convenient to have her 
20 
explanation before I hear what you have to say.  But we are 
going to adjourn the proceedings, tomorrow we will continue 
with the SARS related evidence.   
Thank you to everybody for staying till late. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Thank you Chairperson. 
23 MARCH 2021 – DAY 366 
 
Page 362 of 362 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
MINISTER GORDHAN:  Thank you.   
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 24 MARCH 2021
