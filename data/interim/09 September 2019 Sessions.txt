DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  I presume any professional training

ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Yes. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 12 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Is it also correct that the 
matters that you deal with here in your statement are matters that 
relate to the period when you were the Chairperson of the SABC board? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No this is just my CV. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, no I mean in your statement Doctor 
Nbugane.  In your statement you deal with matters that relate to your 
chairmanship of the SABC board? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes absolutely.  Absolutely. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  When you were appointed 
10 
to the Chairperson of the SABC board? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  January 2010. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And you served until when? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  March 2013. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Who appointed you to the board? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Parliament through the President. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And the – who was the responsible 
Minister for Communications at that time? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  It was retired General Honourable 
Siphiwe Nyanda. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And who was the Minister of Finance? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Honourable Pravin Gordhan. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Then during your time then to the 
board of – as the Chairperson of the board of the SABC you deal with 
that and you say the first thing that you deal with you deal with the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 13 of 179 
 
financial position of the SABC at the time when you were appointed as 
Chairperson of the board. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes probably one can expand a bit 
on that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could you please just tell the 
Chairperson then as to what was the situation when you were 
appointed? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes.  But I need to start a little back. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  The SABC seized to be profitable or 
10 
to make a profit in 2006.  From 2007, 2008, 2009 they were making 
huge losses.  For instance in the 2008/2009 annual report and audited 
statements they made a loss of more than R800 million.  They could not 
flight new content for television.  They could not pay the independent 
producers for television content.  In fact the independent producers lost 
about 17 000 jobs during that time. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry Doctor Ngubane the one thing I 
forgot to mention to you was that please look at the Chairperson when 
you answer. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Oh. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry and – yes – sorry. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Okay.  I will do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   I will do that indeed. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 14 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not the only one. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A lot like looking at the evidence leaders ja. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Ja.  The situation became so critical 
that the interim board chaired by Ms Irene Charnley had to ask for a 
government guarantee of about R1.64 billion in order to meet the 
solvency requirements of the SABC.  This was granted and we then – 
when we came in in 2010 we then had this money R1 billion – R1 billion 
10 
term load from Nedbank to settle the huge debts that were outstanding.  
So we came in into an organisation that was technically insolvent.  In 
our first year 2009/2010 we had reduced the deficit of more than 800 to 
R465 million.  We had improved the content in our television by paying 
the independent producers of content material by making the programs 
more attractive, raising our audience ratings so we could again go back 
to charge the relevant and properly priced amounts for television 
advertisements.  A broadcaster makes money through advertisements.  
However when the audience ratings are low no-one wants to pay money 
when they cannot reach a sufficient number of viewers.  So it was very 
20 
important to go back to produce content that was appealing to the 
public and therefore would attract investment revenue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So how did you then do that? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  We did that by restricting content to 
only those movies or news item that would attract and retain viewers.  
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 15 of 179 
 
So we started to correct the financial situation.  We progressively did 
so to a point where in 2013 we paid R800 million back to Nedbank.  In 
other words saving about R45 million in interest which was being 
charged at the time.  And this was in line with the requirements of the 
conditions set up in the government guarantee.  So we found a 
dysfunctional organisation. The cause of the loss of profitability was 
widespread malpractice at the management level.  For instance sales 
would be made for advertising time but the people who managed putting 
that into content and television viewing did not follow the schedules.  
So the advertisers refused to pay. Secondly there was widespread 
10 
corruption in the buying and procurement of international film material.  
People would go out to Hollywood, buy a bulk of material which was 
part of the bulk associated with crime content.  Let me just give an 
example.  If we bought the… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The Bold and the Beautiful. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Ja the Bold and Beautiful thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  They would say here are other films 
you must buy them as a bundle.  You get the good one but you get a 
whole lot of useless ones.  There was an expression you buy the dog 
20 
with its ticks – with his fleas.  That was – became a popular 
expression.  Now the problem these fleas you could not flight them 
because no-one want to see them.  For instance if one took old cowboy 
films like Roy Rodgers or something no-one would be interested in 
viewing that.  So these products or films would stay at SABC unused 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 16 of 179 
 
until the licence expired.  However money had been paid of them.  No 
income from advertisements which are associated with the film material 
would be coming in so it was written off as impairment.  There were 
other ways in which management over-rode the credit controls in the 
sales division.  Ultimately almost all of them were expelled or charged.  
So I am trying to show you that the SABC we came to was under 
serious financial stress but we also had the conditions of the 
government guarantee which were very onerous.  We had to produce a 
turnaround strategy and plan.  We had to reduce head count by almost 
1000 people.  We had to put in what should I say – measures that 
10 
reduced costs right across the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Cost cutting measures. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And those are the conditions you got from 
the Minister of Finance? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  The money? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No the conditions that you are mentioning. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Oh yes.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Ja that was to reduce costs across 
20 
the board. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Reduce headcount.  Reduce the 
benefits 
that 
were 
going 
to 
senior 
management 
and 
middle 
management.  And these costs us about R200 million just the issue of 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 17 of 179 
 
retention, bonuses, the issue of post-retirement benefits were hugely 
expensive but they applied to the senior and middle management.  
When we said to the Minister that it was difficult to retrench people he 
pointed out that the cost element is in senior and middle management.  
So deal with those.  Forget about unionised labour because they are 
not as expensive and that is when the policy of not renewing contracts 
that were ending.  The senior management and some middle 
management had five year contracts.  So the decision by the board was 
we will not renew contracts that are coming to an end.  So this way we 
managed to re-shape the finances of the SABC.  When I left in 2013 it 
10 
was on an even keel and there was money on top of whatever we had 
paid to the term loan.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  The disclaimers that had been there 
in 2009 we had dealt with them.  The Auditor General had found lack of 
governance at SABC. We dealt with this in the report to SCOPA where 
SCOPA wanted to know – SCOPA the Standing Committee On Public 
Accounts – wanted to know what we were doing to implement action to 
correct – corrective action in response to the findings of the Auditor 
General.  We presented to SCOPA our plans, they were satisfied.  So 
20 
we had started to shift the situation to a profitable SABC, the return of 
advertisers.   You know advertising time on TV costs a lot because that 
is the best form of advertising – of advertising.  It reaches a huge 
number of people across the country.  All categories.  For instance if 
you advertise on say for an example Metro FM the lowest cost for half a 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 18 of 179 
 
minute is R540.00 for half a minute.  But it can go on up to R1200.00 
depending on the quality of your audience ratings.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Which make you very costly to the 
advertised. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  So  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh sorry yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry let me – if you could just finish that 
10 
part? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Okay, no, no that is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Are you finished? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  I think I have said … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. Alright.  Thank you.  Can we just deal 
with the one aspect that you have already mentioned that there was a 
plan that then the board decided to deal with the senior management? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    In cutting costs. 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you just tell the Chairperson other 
than not renewing contracts that had come to an end. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  What other measures related to those cost 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 19 of 179 
 
cutting measures insofar as the employment of those persons were 
concerned? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well we wanted to change from 
defined benefits to defined contributions because if a person leaves 
SABC retires and he is on defined benefits it means he will get that 
money throughout his life post retirement.  But if it is defined 
contribution then it goes along with a time span he spent at SABC.  So 
we were trying to change those practices. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  But we were also merging some of 
10 
the positions and consolidating them.  For instance there used to be 
Human Resources then there used to be a Chief People’s Officer.  The 
board looked at this, had a bit of research on it and discovered that it 
was actually two people doing the same job.  So that was merged. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  And there were managers who were 
reporting to other managers at the same level in the organisation.  We 
eliminated that surplus expenditure.  And of course there was austerity 
in terms of travelling.  We decided to close the international news 
bureaus that were opened in London, New York etcetera where we paid 
20 
people in terms of foreign currency.  You know Euros and Dollars that 
was eliminated. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  We forced news section for instance 
to cut its budget of R900 million to R600 as part of the austerity 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 20 of 179 
 
measures. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  The allowances on petrol cards were 
changed because petrol cards were absolutely abused.  People would 
go there, change their car engines, change their tyres, using petrol 
cards.  We eliminated that.  So there were a number of measures that 
fitted the austerity requirement that was in the government guarantee. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  I would like to just deal with the 
matter that relates to these measures insofar as one of the employees 
of the SABC’s concern.  I would like to hear your comments on it.  I see 
10 
you make reference – there is a document that you have attached BSN 
002 and it has his name.  It was prepared – it is a presentation to 
SCOPA and it has the name of Mr Tiaan Olivier.  And the Chief 
Financial Officer.  Do you – you knew Mr Olivier? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  At the time when you were the 
Chairperson of the board? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes when Mr Robin Nicholson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Became acting CEO Tiaan Olivier 
20 
became acting Financial… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Financial Officer. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Officer. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  He was excellent.  In fact he was one 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 21 of 179 
 
of the members of the task team that the board asked Mr Motsoeneng 
to set up to deal with the findings of the Auditor General.  They worked 
through December into the following year and produced a report that 
became acceptable to the SCOPA. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.   
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  He was a very good worker.  I left 
the – at SABC so I do not know what happened afterwards. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  But what I would like us to talk 
about.  Looking at the plan to make sure that contracts that have come 
to an end do not get renewed.  In that plan that the board had did you 
10 
envisage a situation where a person would still have 5 years to go in 
the contract but it would be terminated? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No, no.  That was not the policy.  It 
was not the decision.  It was contracts that were coming to a close. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  We would talk to the person who 
occupied the position, assess the performance in that position and 
explain to them that because of the policy your term is ending in two 
months or three months we will not renew it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And you would not push the person 
20 
to leave before that expiry of that period of two months? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  It might have happened once or so 
but that was not the policy as far as I remember. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Ja. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 22 of 179 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And what would you say because – I know 
you deal with the purging.  You say during your time there was never 
any purging of officials.  But I would like you to look at this scenario 
that I am going to put to you.  According to the evidence of Ms Thekiso 
who is the Chief Executive Officer dealing with Human Resources.  He 
has mentioned Mr Tiaan Olivier’s case and we had tendered that 
evidence before the Chairperson showing that he had to leave and still 
had five years to go in terms of his contract and had to be paid huge 
sums of monies in order to make it possible for him to leave. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well I think that was wrong because 
10 
that was not what we had decided. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So that would - if - if one looks at it 
and says that was purging you would agree with that situation.  Am I 
correct? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well it - I did not participate in that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  So there might have been other 
reasons.  I do not know but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  As far as I am concerned if there 
were no other compelling reasons that was wrong because this should 
amount to fruit - fruitless and wasteful expenditure. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and from what you have told the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 23 of 179 
 
Chairperson if he was an excellent person even if he had to leave I am 
sure there would have had to be a person replacing him because that 
position of a Chief Financial Officer cannot be left vacant.  Would you 
agree? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Oh no.  In terms of the Chief 
Financial Officer certainly … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  But in terms of other positions as I 
said we - we tried to match positions in order to save money. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do - do you know whether he left at the time when 
Dr Ngubane was still Chairperson? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, no.  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it was after? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No it was after.  After he left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  When you - could you just confirm that 
Dr Ngubane? 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  When Mr Olivier left you - you had already 
left the SABC? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  Now - then as the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 24 of 179 
 
Chairperson of the Board you have just told the Chairperson that you 
were asked to - to put up these austerity measures as the board to 
make sure that the SABC stops bleeding and you deal with those 
aspects in paragraphs 9, 10 and 11. 
You have already mentioned to the Chairperson how you dealt 
with international buy - buying of films. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and you have dealt with the reduction 
of staff.  Now could you just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  May - may - maybe - maybe Ms Norman … 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you proceed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Dr Ngubane do you have a recollection of more or 
less how many managers had their contracts not renewed pursuant to 
that policy that you decided upon.  Namely if a manager is on a fixed 
term contract and that contract comes to an end we will not renew it as 
part of cost cutting measures. 
Do you have a recollection of about how many you - might 
have gone based on that decision? 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Probably - probably 10. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Probably 10? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I guess that what you would do is not just to say 
well if and when a contract ends we will not renew it what you would 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 25 of 179 
 
have done is look at the - at the work that that person does … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the position.  Obviously if the position - if the work 
- the responsibilities that are attached to that position are quite 
important or essential … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then - then you would not have a situation where 
there is nobody performing those duties and it would be a question 
whether you renew or extend the contract of the existing person or you 
do not renew that contract but you get somebody else.  Of course if you 
10 
get somebody else then it is not cost cutting measures. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in each case you would have looked at … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How important the function is? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  And the performance Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the performance? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair and all those 10 cases 
would have been brought to the board for the board to approve the exit 
- exit agreements with those persons? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Absolutely. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 26 of 179 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now - then in paragraph 11 you deal 
with the Sports and Film Rights.  I am not sure whether you had 
listened to the evidence that has been tendered where the GCEO and 
the - the Chairperson of the current Board had - had mentioned this 
issue of cost rights being quite costly for the SA - SABC. 
During your time as the Chairperson of the Board and as you 
deal with it in paragraph 11 what was happening insofar as Sports 
Rights are concerned? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  SABC had lost its Sports Rights 
when we came.  They had even lost the PSL Sports Rights.  What was 
10 
being shown of - on - of rugby and PSL games was being bought from 
SuperSport and of course it was very costly.  Hlaudi went to see 
Mr Irvin Khoza to say please the way PSL was handled by the people 
before us was wrong. 
Can you please now start negotiating with us and give us 
back the Sports Rights.  So SABC resumed broadcasting PSL games 
through that process but otherwise it did not have Sports Rights. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you …? 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  The Sports Rights that we had for 
the Africa Cup of Nations was hugely expensive.  In fact we stopped 
that process.  Our lawyers went to Paris where SportsFive was 
headquartered.  They were going to charge us a penalty more than 
probably R2 million but our lawyers argued the case. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 27 of 179 
 
It was even in court in Paris and we ended up paying about 
R27 million penalty for cancelling the Africa Cup of Nations sports but 
we subsequently got the right to record and broadcast Bafana games 
and that went on and I think it is still going on. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And the agreement then with the PSL that 
you say Mr Hlaudi reached with PSL - sorry.  Was that agreement in 
writing? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well that was a board - a board 
matter - a board decision that we try and re - regain the PSL Sports 
Rights because it is one of the most popular shows on SABC 1. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So there would have been a gentleman’s 
agreement to deal with that aspect? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No, no.  It was formalised. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  I do not have the records but I know 
it was formalised. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Formalised, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there was a written agreement? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes there should be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  You know I do not have it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 28 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you get to know how SABC had lost these Sports 
Rights before your time?  How it had come about that they lost those 
rights or is that something you never got to under - you know? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE: 
 
Well 
from 
what 
- 
from 
the 
discussions with Mr Khoza the officials at SABC were absolutely rude 
towards them.  So any relationship broke down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  In - insofar as the reduction of 
staff you - you alluded to the fact that the Minister of Communications 
then had indicated that he also wanted a head count strategy and - and 
10 
then you deal with that in paragraphs 12 and 13 but in paragraph 13 
what I would like us to talk about is that the - the head count strategy 
had not been finalised but do I get a sense that even though it had not 
been finalised you started embarking on the decision to let go of those 
managers whose contracts were not going to be renewed? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct.  That is correct 
because I should - I should say that is the highest cost came from the 
retention bonuses from - and from the benefits for senior management 
and middle management. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The retention bonuses.  Just explain to me what that - 
20 
that is so that I - I understand.  What is the - I know a bonus even 
though Judges do not get a bonus but is that money that an executive 
gets paid to giving an incentive to stay in the institution and not leave? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Absolutely Chairperson.  It is paid I 
think on a three yearly basis. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 29 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  On top of the normal bonuses … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  But the - the cost becomes very high. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It - it has got nothing to do with performance? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE: 
 
Well 
it 
should 
be 
based 
on 
performance … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  But in practice everyone in a senior 
position (intervenes) getting that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just gets it; and - and would there be a separate 
bonus for performance or there would only be the retention bonus which 
is supposed to take into account performance? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That will be separate because the 
annual bonus … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Based on performance … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Depended on them achieving about 
60 percent … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the targets? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Ja, of the target. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  So that would be yearly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 30 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  The - this one was to - just to retain 
talent … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  But in an organisation of course that 
is bloated … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  With figures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  I mean with - with people.  You know.  
The usefulness was not very clear. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well it is - it is kind of surprises me. You know.  
I do not know you know.  From what you say I do not think it would 
have been limited to what might call people with rare skills.  That you 
would not want to - you would not want to leave your organisation 
because getting people with those skills would be quite difficult and 
might take you long and in the process the institution might be 
suffering. 
It was not based on that - this retainer.  It was paid to a lot of 
other - a lot of people whose skills might not be said to be rare. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct Chairperson.  It 
20 
became a sort of established practice that certain people got retention 
bonuses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you have a recollection of more or less maybe 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 31 of 179 
 
what percentage of a - a person’s remuneration it would be in terms of 
how it would be calculated?  Would it be like 10 percent of your annual 
salary or some - anything like that or is this - is that a detail that you 
cannot remember? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No I cannot remember the actual 
details … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  But … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was there? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  It was there. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  So then you - 
you say that was then some - one of the primary focus that you had to 
try and meet the 1 000 target that the Minister had set insofar in 
reduction of staff is concerned? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Chairperson it was a feeble effort to 
meet the reduction in head count. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Huh-uh. 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  It did not go far at all but it was 
something that we had to do to try and meet the - the conditions. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let me just make sure I have not missed 
anything.  I know that at a certain stage I asked you how many 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 32 of 179 
 
managers you were able to - not to renew their contracts and you said 
maybe around 10. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course 10 out of 1 000 that may have been desired 
is quite a long way but are there other categories that you were able to 
- I do not want to say get rid of - but that you were able to allow or 
retrench or - or terminate at managerial level because I think the 
Minister said leave the unionised staff alone. 
Look at the management.  Are there others that you were able 
to allow to go? 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE: 
 
Well 
through 
natural 
attrition 
Chairperson, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and would that have ended up being quite a 
significant - significant number in terms of the targets … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of 1 000 … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or not really? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No, no.  We - we just did not even 
come near … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  To reaching the target. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And your own assessment as - as you sit here and I 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 33 of 179 
 
know that you might not recall a lot of details - as you sit here would 
you estimate that maybe you went up to - you reached 100 or 200 or 
500? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well through natural attrition where 
we did not employ people … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  In the positions that were being 
vacated I would say yes Chairperson but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Some of the - of the people left 
10 
because of the findings … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Of the Auditor-General. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  A lot of people - I mean the Auditor-
General had found that 1 465 people … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Were actually doing business with 
the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Most of those people left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So - so in the end I - I guess that the - the 
number of people left either because of natural attrition or because of 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 34 of 179 
 
the findings of the Auditor-General exceeded 500? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No, not exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Probably 300 or so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair; and - and then - so 
in other words the - the board would - would - was responsible in the 
sense that it would ensure that whoever left in terms of the plan that 
10 
you had which you were carrying out left under proper and legitimate 
circumstances? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course if somebody leaves whether it is retirement 
or they leave because of findings if you do not replace them logic 
dictates that maybe you did not need somebody doing what they were 
doing. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well precisely Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  When managers’ report to managers 
and they are at the same level that is fruitless expenditure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you get to know how this had come about to 
have maybe a - a significant number of people that really were not 
really needed in the organisation?  Did you get to know how this had 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 35 of 179 
 
come about? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well from 2007 the head count had 
just shot through the roof.  People were being employed you know and 
the - I think I read somewhere that the wage bill because of these new 
people being employed exceeded something like 300 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so people were being employed whose services 
the institution did not really require? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Hm.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Is - is that the - thank you 
10 
Chair - is that the figure that you deal with in paragraph 13 where you 
deal with the growth and staff numbers?  If you go back to your 
statement doctor - Dr Ngubane page 4 of your statement. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Sorry.  Which figure is that? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The figure that you have just mentioned to 
the Chairperson in response to his question.  Is that …? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Oh, ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is that the one that you have mentioned? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In paragraph 13? 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct.  Oh, no.  I said 480 
million here.  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and no, no, no I think you did not 
follow my question.  When you answered about the staff numbers and 
people being employed and you deal with that aspect in paragraph 13 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 36 of 179 
 
and in the sentence that beings: 
“The growth …” 
Is that the correct figure? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  “The grown and staff …” 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  I am - I am recalling it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright, thank you.  Then in paragraph 15 
you mention that whilst you were working on these plans trying to turn 
10 
around the SABC you had meetings with the Minister and you deal with 
the frequency of those meetings.  Could you just testify to what you 
have got in that paragraph and the …? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you just testify to what you saying 
about the Minister - having meetings with the Minister on the progress?  
Sorry are you on the statement Dr Ngubane? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Where to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think just tell him. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  200. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I am sorry.  Just to direct.  Page 4 on top. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then paragraph 15 - 1.5. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes, 15 yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 37 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could you just testify to that 
paragraph because you make an important statement and I would like 
to ask why you make that statement that there was no political pressure 
applied to you and I would like you to talk to that? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well I was lucky in a way because I 
had been in Government before and I knew most - knew most of the 
players in Government.  So it was easy to discuss on a sort of level 
playing ground.  So I cannot say the Minister when we have discussed 
the issue then forced me to do something. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  I just want to understand the 
relevance of that part in your statement.  That there was no political 
pressure applied on you.  I just want to know how - how did it come 
about that you felt that when you dealing with the meetings that you 
were having with the Minister … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To deal with the progress … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You felt that it was necessary for you to 
put in that sentence. 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Because I mention that the Minister 
had said let us look at senior and middle management. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 38 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Some people could interpret that as 
political pressure.  I was just trying to clarify that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright.  Okay.  Thank you.  Then you say 
you managed to pay off the Government guarantee - you have already 
testified - in one and a half years. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is that correct?  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was the term of the Government guarantee? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  The … 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long were you supposed to …? 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Five years Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you paid it off within one and a half years. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One and a half years? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And you deal with your support and in 
paragraph 17 you also make another statement that: 
“My view is also that the private sector did not 
20 
interfere with our work” 
And I would ask the same question that I asked about the 
other statement about no political pressure as to why you felt there was 
a need to make that statement. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Again because you know there was a 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 39 of 179 
 
lot of talk about outside influences on SABC decision making.  So I am 
just bringing that in to say it was market forces that guided our 
decisions not because someone put pressure for a decision. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You - you also make in that sentence that: 
“The only influence they had over us was the fact 
that our audience ratings had to be high for us to 
get advertising money.” 
Could you just deal with that sort of influence?  How does that come 
about from business? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Because the people who buy airtime 
10 
there are organisations that buy airtime for different companies.  Say 
Lever Brothers, Kellogg’s you know and many other consumer materials 
whether it is house cleaning, liquid.  They give it to a centralised buyer 
but the buyer is only interested in audience ratings because they want 
to have value for the money they are spending paying for the advert. 
So that is the pressure that any broadcaster faces.  That you 
must push up the audience ratings in order to get advertising revenue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words you are not attractive to them if you 
have low ratings? 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Audience ratings?  Ja. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The - the higher your rate - ratings are the more 
attractive you are to them? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 40 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Absolutely.  Particularly in an 
organisation where income - 85 percent of income comes from 
advertising.  It becomes a great pressure to raise your audience 
ratings. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair and then you moved 
- you have another sub paragraph of page 5 of your statement: 
“Relationship with the Members of the Gupta 
Family.” 
Could you just tell the Chairperson about your relationship if any with 
the members of the Gupta family as you deal with it in these 
10 
paragraphs?  Paragraphs 16 to 19. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE: 
 
Well 
there 
was 
this 
business 
partnership for morning breakfasts.  I attended those breakfasts.  Not 
all of them but quite a lot of them and I would sit with the people in the 
New Age editors, members of the Gupta family and on a few occasions I 
went to social events at their home and that is really the exposure I 
had to that family. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Were - were you just as the start of 
the New Age Newspaper were you involved at all?  Did you assist with 
the negotiations of the New Age deal and TNA Breakfast? 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No.  This was an initiative through 
our news desk - our news editorial board and the officials of the news.  
We only got involved where I had to go and probably make a speech at 
a - to introduce the Minister at a breakfast meeting and that sort of 
thing but we were not involved as a board in the actual negotiations. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 41 of 179 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Ms Mokhobo who was the GCEO had 
testified that when she was appointed to that position she was taken to 
be introduced to the Gupta family.  Did that happen to you? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No because I did not have any power 
in terms of appointing companies or people who supply services at 
SABC.  As Chairperson I did not have that power.  So I presume I was 
irrelevant as far as that was concerned. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you - you could - you could be irrelevant if 
somebody was looking doing business lawfully but you could be 
10 
relevant if they wanted to do it unlawfully.  You say to them I do not 
have power to do that.  They say no come on you are the Chairperson 
of the Board. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are very powerful in SABC.  Talk to so and so.  
Did nobody ever say anything along those lines?  We want - we want to 
increase this.  We want to get that. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No Chairperson.  They did not need 
to actually because the news people dealt with them on those business 
issues you know. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but I am now talking more beyond just - just the 
breakfast shows.  I am talking just in general. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know that they were - while - while you were 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 42 of 179 
 
Chairperson.  There were no business people or any people who made 
any attempts to get you to influence people to give them business at 
SABC? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No.  That did not happen Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That did not happen? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair and you say you had also 
visited their home socially.  You did visit them socially? 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Who exactly invited you to these 
social gatherings? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well invitations used to come 
through my PA.  So I would get a list of invites and I say okay you can 
take this one, not take this one and so on. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and I mean among the Gupta family 
members who exactly invited you to attend these social gatherings?  
There would be a person who would be in charge of that particular 
event. 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well Nazeem Howa was in charge of 
TNA and I think it was him who did the invites. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you at any stage become close to the Gupta 
family or anybody in the Gupta family and when I say close I appreciate 
that it might be difficult to say when - when is close, close but you - 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 43 of 179 
 
you might be able on your own understanding to say well the following 
over time we did become close or we never became close.  I went to 
one or two social events and that was it. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well the editor of New Age we - we 
got to be friends … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  But not the rest of family. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the - the editor at that stage was it 
10 
Mr (indistinct)? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Moegsien Williams. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Williams? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  No I was thinking of the witness. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh.  You - you thinking about TNA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  TNA - that is the New Age? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is the New Age. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  The editor of the New Age … 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the one you are talking about? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair - ANN7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  I was thinking of the witness 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 44 of 179 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  About … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who came to give evidence … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Mr Sundaram. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he was for the television. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  ANN7.  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  Is that ANN7? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is alright.  So that is the person that you 
10 
consider yourself to have been close at some stage? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you; and then in the next paragraph 
you tell the Chairperson about the - the breakfast shows and what 
brought this about and how did this relationship between the SABC and 
the - the - and TNA develop insofar as these breakfast shows were 
concerned? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE: 
 
Well 
the 
- 
our 
news 
people 
developed that relationship that there would be these breakfast shows.  
20 
We would record them and broadcast them live.  There was even an 
agreement that was signed by members of the newsroom with the New 
Age/TNA which spelt out the modalities on how these shows will be 
arranged. 
The New Age would hire the hall, provide the breakfast, pay 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 45 of 179 
 
for flat screens, pay for projectors, pay for roving mics.  The SABC 
would send out its outside broadcast vans with the technicians and the 
presenters and that is how the roles were divided. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And were you in terms of that agreement 
expected to bill TIA for sending out your broadcast vans? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   No, no, no, I mean our news section 
was always looking for new ways of attacking audiences of building up 
the audience ratings by new offerings so their approach to these 
breakfast was a new offering on the Morning Live slot.  Now Morning 
Live was a very popular, and I think still a very popular channel 
10 
because people wake up, it’s like morning coffee, I say to myself, they 
wake up to Morning Live.  Morning Live deals with politics, with science 
and technology, with prominent personalities, with sport, with weather 
reports, with market related material.  So it sort of prepares people in 
the morning as to what the agenda for the day is going to be.  So it’s 
got that value in it, it’s the first kick-off as it were to the broadcast of 
the day so putting the breakfast in there was an addition in terms of the 
political side of Morning Live where Ministers are put before people, 
audiences, the audiences can question the Minister or the President on 
anything and the people outside can join in through telephonic 
20 
telephones, social media and so on SMS’s to ask the Ministers, to hold 
the Ministers accountable.  So this was seen as an innovation that 
could only benefit the audience ratings of the news section, particularly 
morning live, so that’s how we perceived it as a content creating new 
content to the pubic and new opportunities. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 46 of 179 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes how did that then assist with the 
ailing financial situation of the SABC? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Well as I said Chairperson let me 
take the cheapest which is a Metro FM R540 per half a second repeated 
many times between say seven and nine, that’s a lot of money.  So if 
Morning Live pushed up it’s audience ratings they could charge even 
R1000 per half a second. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the price which the SABC would charge for airtime 
or advertising would be influenced by, one, the level of the ratings, 
audience ratings at the particular time of the advert and I think you 
10 
said the type of people who would be watching around that time, I think 
you mentioned something like that.  So that if the SABC knows that 
business A wants one minute at that time but there are many others 
who would like that one minute at that time, they could say we want 
more for this one minute because if you don’t take it then somebody 
else will take it and therefore the businesses would be prepared to pay 
more as well because there is prime, I don’t know if that is the term 
used, it’s the best time, one of the best times to advertise? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:    You’re absolutely right Chairperson 
it depends on the time of day, it depends on the day in the week, for 
20 
instance weekends Sunday and Saturday the prices are quite low but 
during the week, peak hour, morning, evening, sports you know all 
those get good pricing for airtime. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well it’s just interesting to me to say weekends the 
prices are low because I would have thought that weekends is when a 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 47 of 179 
 
lot of people would be watching television because a lot of people 
would not be working, unlike during the weekdays and therefore the 
audience would be higher, is that just ignorance on my part? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Well weekends people go to church 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And most of them go to church only in the mornings. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   And of course weekends is sports, 
sports is the winning number for weekends. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you, thank you Chair, so you say in 
10 
paragraph 23 you found that these were value adding, these breakfast 
shows? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes Chairperson because our sales 
kept on improving so these programmes were therefore adding value 
because we could make money and we improved year by year in terms 
of improving the finances of the SABC.  So the value add there was 
that we could sell our airtime at higher prices and get better revenue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And weren’t you at some point at all, 
concerned that now the SABC had established this relationship with 
this particular company which was going to – according to the 
20 
agreement to last for three years and did you at all,  get concerns that 
maybe it might be seen that you had – the SABC had preferred a 
particular company over others or that the relationship itself was so 
close that it might have a way of interfering  with what is expected 
within the editorial policy, that you shouldn’t  have – SABC shouldn’t 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 48 of 179 
 
have partners so as to keep it’s objectivity and independence? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Well you know, Chairperson, in 
broadcasting it’s probably different, you know if the SABC was creating 
a programme of it’s own running it, probably then it would need to go 
the – follow the supply chain requirement, advertising, calling for 
interviews but when someone comes with a programme and says, we 
think this can make you money then there’s no process of advertising 
that and this is what happened with the SABC New Age partnership.  
The people in news thought this was a novel idea, it would work for us 
and then they signed an agreement on it.  So it wasn’t really preferring 
10 
– if you say Business Day or Independent Newspapers came with such 
a proposal and it was appealing to people in news, I’m sure they’ll take 
it.  So it wasn’t really a case of preferring group of people. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Then, I’m not sure how familiar you were 
with the agreement, I’m sure it would have been brought to the Board 
because these shows were going to be twice a month, if I may just 
check, just make reference to it, it’s in the same bundle – yes it’s in the 
same bundle with your leave Chair can I just ask that the witness be 
assisted to page through to Ms Mokhobo’s statement that said – that is 
where the TNA agreement is. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   I’ll give you now Chair, that’s from page 
10 – it’s folder, the divider 21 and the agreement starts from page 10. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you able to see folder or divider 21 the green 
one? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 49 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Oh ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair, if I may just – that is 
the agreement that was identified by Ms Mokhobo as having signed that 
agreement with TNA but I’d like to take you – yes if you could please 
turn to page 15 of that very document and I would like to direct your 
attention to [indistinct] paragraph 5.6.  It reads, 
 
“It is specifically recorded that the SABC shall broadcast two 
 
events per month and the SABC shall at all times have final 
 
editorial control”. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes were you also aware that this was the 
arrangement, this was the agreement that these breakfast shows would 
be two per month? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   No this was a management issue, so 
the Board didn’t really get involved in the terms, we were told, of 
course of how the expenditure is going to be but we were not 
participants. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Alright so even when these numbers 
escalated you would have known as the Board? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   As long as they didn’t exceed the 
20 
delegated authority of the people in news, as long as they were acting 
within that delegated authority, it was their matter. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you, then you say in paragraph 
26 because 24 and 25 you refer to one thing, that you never asked for a 
further bail outs from Treasury, can you just tell he Chairperson about 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 50 of 179 
 
that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes paragraph 26. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Oh you back, I beg your pardon, you go 
back to your statement now, yes thank you, paragraph 26 is at page 7. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 7 at the top right hand corner and paragraph 26 
at the bottom of the page. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Sorry can you just repeat the page 
again? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 7 in your statement, have you found your 
statement, we are back to your statement. 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   So paragraph 23 is it? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   26. 
CHAIRPERSON:   26 at the bottom of page 7. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   We never asked Treasury for bail 
out yes we didn’t. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes and would you say then the finances 
at this point had improved? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Well yes the SABC was self 
sustaining. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that was the position until you left? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That was the position, it was 
actually – we were improving all the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you and then the [indistinct] aspect  
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 51 of 179 
 
you’ve already mentioned, we started with it, you remember this is 
where you told the Chairperson about the plan not to renew contracts 
that had come to an end, so that’s what you deal with there in 
paragraphs 28 to 31. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Right. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Then the next topic we are going to deal 
with Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng – Chair I see the time is now quarter past 
eleven. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes let’s take the tea adjournment it’s quarter 
past eleven, we’ll take the tea adjournment and we’ll resume at half 
10 
past eleven, we adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.    
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes let us proceed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  We are now at page 
9 of your statement Doctor Ngubane.  And you deal there from 
paragraph 32 and following with your dealings with Mr Hlaudi 
Motsoeneng could you then tell the Chairperson how did you get to 
know Mr Motsoeneng and under what circumstances?  Oh sorry your 
20 
microphone is off.  I beg your – sorry.  And also switch it… 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you can just press – there is a button there ja. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Okay thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you.  Yes.l 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well Hlaudi came from Bloemfontein 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 52 of 179 
 
to the SABC transferred there by the CEO SABC Mr Mokwetle.  All 
regional radio stations were losing money but the Bloemfontein station 
through Lesedi news was making a profit and Hlaudi was in charge of 
news if I remember correctly at Lesedi.  So the CEO Mokwetle said he 
wants to bring this young man into SABC – Hlaudi was employed at 
SABC 1995. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1995? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  And somehow we had got to know the 
10 
SABC very well.  So we said we will bring him here so that he can use 
him to deal with the other problematic regional radio stations.  So I 
agreed with him.  I thought it was a good idea.  Because we had to fix 
this problem.  Our austerity measures were such that all these 
institutions had to be self-sustaining and self-funding.  So Hlaudi came 
into the CEO’s office as stakeholder relations regarding the regions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that – would the position have been called 
Stakeholder Relations Manager or something like that? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right.  And he started working 
on the regional stations.  He even took me to some others which were 
problematic like Mpumalanga and others. I cannot remember them in 
their order where we – I was giving pep talk to staff.  I mean he had 
prepared them of course of these reasons.  And we started getting 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 53 of 179 
 
people cooperating.  They used to complain that head office does not 
care for them even if they want to buy tea and milk and sugar they must 
apply to head office.  They are not given the authority.  So we sort of 
managed to polish through those issues.  And the morale was high and 
the stations started doing very well.  So when the people responsible 
for turnaround in the CEO’s office left because of money disputes – pay 
disputes the CEO appointed him on the turnaround position in the 
CEO’s office.  And of course from there then things started happening 
because Hlaudi was seen as a trouble-shooter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Motsoeneng I am… 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Mr Motsoeneng oh sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Sorry Chairperson.  Was seen as a 
trouble-shooter.  And he was very pro-active.  I mean with the labour 
unions you know with all issues that came up he would there hands on 
and so when ultimately he got to be elevated to Group to EXCO let us 
put it that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  And that is when really he came to 
prominence.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  EXCO would be GCEO, CFO and COO? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  COO and of course the senior 
managers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Some senior managers as well? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 54 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  So – sorry this progression then from being a 
stakeholder liaison to being an acting COO how did that – how did that 
happen? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well the board then decided – 
because you know when we came SABC management and labour unions 
were at real loggerheads mainly around salaries.  There was so much 
differential in salaries and so on.  So the unions were a problem for us 
particularly trying to deal with the turnaround and head count reduction 
and so on.  So Hlaudi was assigned to the board’s communication 
10 
person.  He would deal with – and stakeholder manager on behalf of 
the board not just the GCEO.  And that is how he got to ultimately 
become an acting CEO.  Because now a lot of assignments were being 
given him to deal with. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes.  And then ordinarily who is responsible 
for make – for appointing people to these executive positions in an 
acting capacity? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well the CEO. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Appointed him in his office but we 
needing active service in terms of communication in terms of dealing 
20 
with issues like the Auditor General’s findings and many other aspects 
that were very thorny at the time he was then appointed acting COO. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes.  Could you just tell the Chairperson what 
– what skill did he bring?  I mean if you talking about a Chief 
Operations Officer you talking about the Auditor General’s findings 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 55 of 179 
 
those are largely matters that would deal with the financial aspects of 
the organisation. So what is the skill that he was bringing on board to 
deal with those matters? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well the skill was people’s skill.  You 
know Mr Alwyn who appointed him in 1995 said that initially he had 
been a stringer for sports.  But the way he wrote sports reports were 
very attractive to the listeners and so he brought him into other aspects 
of SABC like news because he had this ability to create a story.  So I 
would say in short the skills he had were people skills and that is what 
we needed at that time.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  When he was appointed Stakeholders Relations 
Manager I think that is the position you mentioned. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess as the first position that he held at SABC 
head office after being brought in from the Free State, is that right? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Who – had there been someone else who had 
held that position before namely Stakeholder Relations Manager? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  There was in the SABC however 
there was none for the board. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was none for the board? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  But because of the pressure we were 
under to convince the unions to do all the types things of turnaround 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 56 of 179 
 
which impacted on people we felt that he would be able to handle that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So does that mean that there were therefore two 
Stakeholder Relations Managers one who had always been there who 
was doing this job on behalf of – or for the management and then now 
another one doing it for the board? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  He combined it all Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He combined the two? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay what happened to the person who had done it – 
had been doing it before him? 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or the management? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  For the CEO? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well I presume the CEO had 
dismissed whoever had been there because he brought him from the 
Free State. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So when he brought Mr Motsoeneng the other 
person did not continue doing this job? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  He might have – he or she might have gone – been 
given other responsibilities or whatever? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Ja we did not discuss that 
Chairperson but I assume. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 57 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That should have been the situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but when Mr Motsoeneng was doing this job was 
your understanding that he was at that stage doing it for the board but 
there was nobody else to talk to outsiders about the same issues? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Absolutely Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now I am wondering why the board needed 
somebody to do that for them simply because my understanding would 
have been that the – that would relate to operational matters that one 
would expect to go under the management and that it would not be 
something that the board would be involved in relations with unions and 
10 
so on and so on.  Am I mistaken in that regard? 
DR 
BALDWIN 
SIPHO 
NGUBANE: 
 
Chairperson 
under 
normal 
circumstances it would be exactly as you are saying it but this situation 
we were in and the board was becoming very activist at SABC because 
the relationship with management was in many ways very weak. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is between the board and the management? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  And the management. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  So there was a lot of communications 
that the board wanted to get across to general staff, labour unions and 
20 
so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So – so there was an appreciation that 
normally this is not what the board would be involved in but the board 
considered that the circumstances in which the SABC was were such 
that the board had to get involved in these issues? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 58 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  And then in – 
when he acted in that position of the COO position when he acted there 
do you know who – what happened to the person who initially occupied 
– who was occupying that – who left having occupied that position as to 
what happened to that person? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well there was an acting COO not – 
well probably I need to explain this a bit. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  There had been an advertisement for 
the position of COO. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Mr Mbebe passed the interview was 
recommended to the Minister but the Minister did not take forward that 
recommendation to cabinet.  So he was not appointed to that position.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  And who was the Minister at the time? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Ms Casaburri.  Ms Casaburri. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Or Doctor Casaburri. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I remember ja Doctor Casaburri ja. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  So Mr Mbebe went to court to want to 
force the Minister to recognise his appointment.  Well that did not 
happen.  The court decided no-one could fill that position until the 
Minister and cabinet had approved the appointment of a COO.  So it 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 59 of 179 
 
necessitated having people to act in that position for quite some time.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Ms Mabane had acted for quite some 
time in that position.  Later on she was moved to editorial policy and 
other duties at SABC and then Hlaudi was appointed as acting COO. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes.  And during this time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The interviews for filling in the position of COO would 
they normally be conducted by the board or would they be conducted by 
10 
the GCEO or a panel appointed by the board or a panel appointed by 
the GCEO?  Who would conduct those interviews? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  The Group Chief Executive Officer, 
the Chief Financial Officer and the COO are positions that can only be 
confirmed by the Minister through cabinet.  So there would be an 
interview team which would be appointed – the board would have to 
approve that interview team.  They would sit through as a panel and 
then make a recommendation to the board and the board would 
recommend to the Minister.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so – so the panel would be a panel that is 
20 
approved by the board? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then that panel would make recommendations to 
the board? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 60 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the board would then – the board would not 
have appointing powers but it would have recommending powers?  It 
would recommend to the Minister or what would be the position? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No at that stage later on it became 
what you are describing Sir.  At that stage the board would appoint. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  And then refer to the Minister for 
concurrence? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  And the Minister would refer to 
10 
cabinet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  For final agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  So the appointment was to be made by the 
board but the board for the appointment to be effective. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They needed the concurrence of the Minister? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the Minister would take the name to the cabinet. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then come back. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  And now in regard to I think you said Mr 
Mbembe is that right? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Mr Mbembe yes. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 61 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was interviewed by a panel that had been 
approved by the board? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and the panel recommended that he be 
appointed? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the board approved that he be appointed? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the board communicated with the Minister to 
say here is the candidate that has been recommended by the 
10 
interviewing panel we are happy with him.  We are appointing him but 
we are asking you to concur? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then the Minister took long to come back? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe never came back? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Actually [indistinct] you come back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember?  You cannot remember.  But 
for a long time she was not coming back to the board. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  She did not take it to the cabinet so 
20 
there was no come back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And as Chairperson I would have expected that you 
would at some stage have approached her and say is there a problem 
and if you did what did she say? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No that was before our time.   
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 62 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that was before you time? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I am sorry I thought it was… 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  During your time.  So this is – this had happened 
before you came in? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  So when you came in there was simply – there 
were acting people? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes in this position? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember how long the position had 
remained vacant more or less? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  I would say probably three years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is quite a long time. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Quite a long time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in terms of the – in terms of the records of the 
board you do not remember that you found anything or correspondence 
that had come from the Minister to tell the previous board what the 
20 
problem was? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No we could not find any such. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  It was just assumed that the Minister 
had not wanted to appoint him. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 63 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But when you – when your board came in was 
Doctor Matsepe-Casaburri who was – to whom you referred earlier was 
she still the Minister or was it General Nyanda who was Minister when 
your board came in? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  It was General Nyanda. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  But there had already been a court 
decision 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That the position cannot be filled. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Until cabinet had approved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess somewhere we have got those papers. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of that in order. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes, yes we will make them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes.  Then in paragraph 39 then you deal with 
20 
the elevation of Mr Motsoeneng now to a permanent COO position.   
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No hew was always acting while I 
was there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Oh I am sorry can I just – that is my 
understanding of what you say in paragraph 39 I could be wrong.  
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 64 of 179 
 
Could you just read what is – what you say there in paragraph 39 
[indistinct] 1? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  What number is that? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  39 at page 10. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes.  Oh ja elevation to the Group 
Management position? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That was in the office of the CEO 
that he got elevated. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Oh not – still not in the – not the COO 
10 
position? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No, no, no. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Alright oh sorry that is my mistake. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When he was put in the office of the Group Chief 
Executive Officer do you remember exactly what his tile or position was 
at the time in that office? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  He was just a manager for 
Stakeholder Relations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh this position of Stakeholder Relations manager 
which he held – which was the first position he held when he came to 
20 
head office? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was located in the office of the Group Chief 
Executive Officer? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 65 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you Chair.  Then you deal in paragraph 
40 about the Mr Motsoeneng attending board meetings and could you 
just tell the Chair how did that come about? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well this happened when we had 
difficulty with communications.  So the board decided that we needed a 
person who will do board communications.  Because board decisions 
were not being reported correctly to the staff, to generally to people in 
the SABC.  So we needed someone who will carry out exactly what we 
have said and go and convince people about it. That is how we created 
10 
this position of Communications Person for the board. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes.  Whose responsibility was it to 
communicate to the staff from whatever it is that the board wanted to 
communicated before you embarked on in deciding that Mr Motsoeneng 
must fill in that – that space? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  It would have been the Group Chief 
Executives office to do that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes.  Now when your say then that was not 
being done properly what exactly do you mean? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well we did not have – the board felt 
20 
that whatever it decided was not being communicated properly to 
people at SABC and therefore you had this conflictual relationship 
particularly with the unions and the general staff.  That the board felt 
they needed direct access to the people. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes.  And then did you raise that matter with 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 66 of 179 
 
the GCEO, the Group Chief Executive Officer that look we are not 
happy with the manner in which you communicate the board’s matters 
to the staff and we believe that we need to have somebody else to do 
that.   
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well Hlaudi Motsoeneng – Mr 
Motsoeneng was already in the CEO office dealing with Stakeholder 
Relations.  So it was a simple matter that he must also deal with 
Stakeholder matters for the board. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes.  So then he got invited then according to 
what you say – he attended to the board meetings at your request? 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  What would be his role? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Wait I am sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before that on the face of it it does look 
strange that the board on which the GCEO, the Group Chief Executive 
Officer would be serving – would not be happy with how their decisions 
are communicated to the staff.  Maybe let us leave aside the unions for 
the time being.  Because the Group Chief Executive Officer is the Chief 
Officer.  He or she is in charge of the whole staff and one expects that 
20 
he is best positioned to communicate to the whole staff whatever 
decisions the board has taken.  I do not know if you want to say 
anything about that – to make any comment?  It does sound strange.  It 
sounds like a vote in no confidence in the GCEO. 
DR BALDWIN 
SIPHO 
NGUBANE: 
 
We 
are absolutely correct 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 67 of 179 
 
Chairperson.  You know there was such a lack of trust that the board 
suspended the Group Chief Executive that is how he left SABC/ 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Was that still Mr Mokwetle or was it somebody 
else? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  It was Mr Mokwetle  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mokwetle ja. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that was the one who – with whom the board had 
lack of trust and he ended up leaving? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes the CEO unfortunately fell out of 
10 
favour with the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  And the board got rid of him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it would be fair to say and probably this is what 
you have said but I just want to make sure I have got it right.  Probably 
it would be fair to say that the board’s decision to shift the 
20 
responsibility of communication to Mr Motsoeneng even to the staff. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was a result at least in part of the board no longer 
having full trust in the CGEO.  Would it be correct to put it that way? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Absolutely.   
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 68 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would be correct okay.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes.  Thank you. Thank you Mr Chairman.  
And then you say – you say in paragraph 40 Doctor Ngubane that his 
role at the board meetings would – that he would not participate. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  He… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Because he was not a board member. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  He was – when I mean participation I 
mean being part of the decision making. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  But he could give an input to board 
10 
meeting – to the board meeting but he could not be part of the decision 
making like voting. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes.  And many a times… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I think Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Interrupted your earlier on I think you were wanting to 
get into how he came to be asked to attend board meetings. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he might or might not have – Doctore Ngubane 
might or might not have answered that. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Answered that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I did not understand that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Oh yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then maybe that is because I asked some 
question. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 69 of 179 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes.  Thank you.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can you get back to that?  How did he come to be 
invited to attend board meetings Mr Motsoeneng? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Because well in my view and I – this 
is the view I conveyed to the board.  That whoever is going to be 
communicating for us must know precisely what we are talking about.  
That is how he came to be invited to be at board meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so – so it was: 
1. To make sure that when he communicates to stakeholders 
whatever the decisions of the board – whatever decisions the 
10 
board may have taken he would have a full understanding of the 
context of those decisions.  In order to have that he must be 
present when the board is meeting. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Precisely Sir because you know in a 
situation like that you get a lot of false information floating around the 
organisation and exacerbating whatever problems.  So that was the 
motivation. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also you did not want him to be an observer as 
such you wanted him to be able to participate in discussions but not in 
20 
decision making? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes.  Thank you.  And then just following up 
on the Chair’s question – would the Company Secretary not do that?  
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 70 of 179 
 
Because if I am a member of staff and I hear that the board has taken a 
particular decision the first person to make the enquiries to – would be 
the company secretary and you say – could you just confirm with me at 
the meeting that the board held on such and such a day did this take 
place, what was the decision?  Would that not have been the easiest 
way of controlling the situation? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well I do not think the Company 
Secretary we had could have made any impression on the general 
workers on the unions at SABC. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  But at least the Company Secretary would 
10 
have communicated the decisions of the board effectively because he 
or she is the one that records those decisions. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well probably but under the 
circumstances we needed a dedicated person. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes.  Then could you just explain in paragraph 
– the last paragraph of paragraph 40 the last sentence.  You say: 
“He would however not participate in board meetings 
because he was not a board member.  I considered 
his attendance necessary because I was of the view 
it would enable him to communicate and implement 
20 
the turnaround strategy effectively.” 
So in other words it was not just about communication you also 
expected him to implement that plan? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well let us put it this way. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Yes. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 71 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  In order to implement the turnaround 
it was important for the board to know where the leakages of money 
were.  Who was doing what in terms of syphoning money from the 
SABC?  It is a long story Chairperson.  It is to do with how the 
computers were manipulated between the sales – they used to call – 
have a landmark computer system which recorded the sales and put 
programs on TV and then the SAP which was the paying – paying 
component of SABC.  There was a lot of manipulation and overriding 
the controls in those – in those two sectors of administration. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  REGISTRAR:  Yes. 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  So he knew who was doing what let 
us put it that way. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe just to confirm I think the answer you 
have - you gave me about the role - Mr Motsoeneng’s role at the board 
effectively qualifies the third sentence in paragraph 40 where you say: 
“He would not - he would have not participated in 
board proceedings because he was not a board 
member.” 
I think the answer you gave me qualifies that because you 
20 
say he would take part in the deliberation, the discussions … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But not vote. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so that would be take - participating.  So there 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 72 of 179 
 
was some participation allowed to him except voting? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair; and then if you move on 
to paragraph 41 at page 11 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  But let me - let me go back to that Dr Ngubane.  
Under what circumstances would he be allowed to take part in the 
10 
discussions?  Would it be if there was something that the board wanted 
to be explained by him or clarified by him or was the situation such that 
he took part in all discussions normally like everybody who was there 
but just did not vote? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well it is a thin dividing line 
Chairperson because - well let us put it this way.  He could never 
introduce a resolution or a motion to the board but he could say that 
tender that is going on the so and so, so and so interfering or involved.  
It was that sort of participation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  The reason why I was thinking about it is to 
20 
what extent it may have been acceptable in terms of good governance 
to have somebody taking part in discussions all discussions even if he 
does not vote who is not a board member.  That - that is why I was 
asking that question. 
Is that - is that an issue that you may have applied your mind 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 73 of 179 
 
to in one way or another? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Certainly Chairperson but it said that 
the need may not justify the means. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  However … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  We were dealing with very critical 
issues … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Involving people’s lives. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Some people needing to be charged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  You know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  So it - it - we - we needed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  As much information as possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm; and he was - you considered that he was the 
person who could give that - that … 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That information? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Then in - at page 11 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 74 of 179 
 
Dr Ngubane … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN 
SC:  
Paragraph 
41 
you deal with 
the 
interactions between the unions and Mr Motsoeneng. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you just testify to that? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes.  I am just describing one aspect 
of the work that he was doing. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could you just testify to it?  So that 
it is on record.  Yes.  Meaning just talking to what you say there … 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Where? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In paragraph 41, yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes.  There was huge resistance to 
the turnaround because people felt threatened by the turnaround.  They 
did not know whether they were going to lose their jobs.  You know.  In 
any environment where there is restructuring it becomes a threat to the 
workers. 
So the workers had to be persuaded to see that all that we 
were trying to do was to secure the SABC and in fact secure their jobs 
because as long as the SABC improved its finances continued to work 
20 
some of the terms contained in the Government guarantee like drastic 
reduction in head count would not necessarily happen. 
In fact we used to tell them if we get it right and pay off the 
loan to Nedbank then we are free from those conditions.  So people had 
to cooperate.  So this is one of the sessions where these things were 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 75 of 179 
 
being discussed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you and - and you say that he 
was taking instructions directing from the board and as well as from the 
GCEO at that time? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  At the time the GCEO was still 
functioning.  Oh, no, no.  That time it was Mr Nicholson who was acting 
CEO. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes; and then at paragraph 43 you deal 
with the Auditor-General’s findings.  You did mention slightly as to what 
the Auditor-General had found.  That the SABC employees were 
10 
actually doing business … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  With the SABC and then this was a matter 
that was before SCOPA.  Could you just briefly tell the Chairperson as 
to what - what were the difficulties that at that point you had with 
SCOPA because Parliament - Auditor-General says there is 1 400 
employees that are doing business with the SABC and then what action 
did you as a board take in order to make sure that when Parliament 
asked you to account as the board you were able to deal with that? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  We had to segregate the categories 
20 
that the Auditor-General had discovered and of course allocate actions 
according to the gravity of the situation.  Some people needed to be 
disciplined.  Some people needed to be reported to the police.  Some 
people needed to be fired outright. 
Some people were already on leave - I mean - suspension but 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 76 of 179 
 
continued to earn a lot of money.  So there were many aspects to the 
Auditor-General’s finding.  We had failed for quite some time to deal 
with this issue until we appointed the task team that contained - 
comprised of people like Sully Motsweni, Tiaan Olivier and many others 
who were experts in different areas. 
That is how we ultimately managed to deal and categorise the 
people and the actions that needed to be taken. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you say you had not dealt with the issue for 
some time are you talking about not dealing with it for some time 
10 
despite knowing of its existence or are you talking about a situation 
where you did not know that it existed as a problem and that is why you 
did not deal with it? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  We - there was a problem because 
there would be a disciplinary hearing but there would be no witnesses.  
So when we go to SCOPA and SCOPA says what have been done we 
would not be able to give definite answers.  So we took - it was the 
reason why we now had to have a special team within SABC. 
People who knew each unit - each business unit to come and 
deal with the issues relating to that unit.  Probably Chairperson I could 
20 
simply put it and say there was no real will among the managers to deal 
with the issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that - that was the problem? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I am - I am just wondering why there would 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 77 of 179 
 
be any problems of witnesses in terms of people who were said to be 
doing business with the SABC because I mean the paper trail should be 
there and if they are linked to certain companies if they were members 
of close corporations or directors of companies that information is 
obtainable - is easily obtainable. 
So - so - but you say there was a problem of the lack of will 
on the part of senior manager - managers to deal with the situation? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That would have been an - an 
internal audit function … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  But the internal audit just did not do 
its work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That was the problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair; and then that report 
according to you what state at page - paragraph 44 page 11.  It would 
mean that if this report the - the one that the - that Mr Olivier had 
prepared as it appears at page 17.  It is dated 20 November 2012.  At 
page 17. 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes.  That is correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  That is correct? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So it - it would mean that the board had 
not - had not satisfied SCOPA’s requests for at least for a period of 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 78 of 179 
 
about two years.  Am I correct? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Then you dealt with the fact that 
Mr Motsoeneng and the task team then they worked to - to produce the 
report that you - you find at page 17.  So that report deals with wide 
ranging matters.  Am I correct? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  (No audible reply). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  From staff matters to procurement issues.  
For instance if I may just direct your attention to page - page 32 
because: 
10 
“The SABC to comply with requirements of Treasury 
Regulations and audit - Audit Committee Terms.” 
And these are financial matters and also if you go to page 34.  
That is where you deal with the specific item number five: 
“Procurement 
and 
contract 
management; 
compliance with procurement policy and content 
commissioning and acquisition of policy; instances 
of premature procurement ordering taking place 
without appropriate legal contracts with suppliers.” 
And then the other column has the: 
20 
“The Procurement of content is being migrated to 
be in line 
with standard 
Procurement 
Policy 
Guidelines as defined by the PFMA; Practice Note - 
Treasury Practice Note Regulations 13 of Supply 
Chain Management and the Institution of Bid 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 79 of 179 
 
Adjudication and Bid Evaluation Committee.” 
Did you find a lot of these matters where there was total 
disregard of procurement processes? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Most of those Chairperson had come 
from the period of 2007 to 2009.  Most of those that is what the 
Auditor-General had discovered … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  And we were attempting to deal with 
that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then an aspect that you have 
10 
already testified to about employees doing business with the SABC that 
we will find at page 35 Chair and as item number six. 
“Numerous employees were found to have interests 
in companies that could not be supported by a 
signed declaration of interest forms.  No centralised 
register 
to 
check 
and 
monitor 
whether 
all 
employees have declared their interests.  For 
employees new and comprehensive declaration 
forms were created; extensive communications.” 
That deals with failure to declare their interests but most 
20 
importantly is what we find at page 36 item seven. 
“Expenditure management:  fruitless and waste less 
expenditure.” 
And what is that amount? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 80 of 179 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  What amount is that? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  22 120 - 22 120 000. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and you say that period to - predates 
your appointment? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No, no, no it was before.  It was a 
historical … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It - it predates, yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  Thank you.  So then this report 
then was compiled I take it with all the matters that you have - that it 
10 
deals with.  Then it was submitted to SCOPA.  What was SCOPA’s 
attitude after the submission of this report? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  They were not completely satisfied 
but they thought it was a good effort. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and by the time you left the SABC had 
there been proper compliance with the Auditor-General’s queries? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Some might as well still outstanding 
but in terms of losing money that had stopped. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now in - in regard to the years when you were 
20 
Chairperson of the Board do you have a recollection of how the 
Auditor-General’s reports looked like in terms of SABC.  Where they 
quite okay?  Where there still serious challenges that the AG was 
pointing out or is that something you might not be able to remember? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well Chairperson the challenges 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 81 of 179 
 
remained because there was not real full cooperation between 
management and the board.  Although the SAU had come in.  There 
was an Auditor-General report.  People were aware that some action is 
being taken. 
Some people were identified with their schemes of siphoning 
money.  They were referred to the police.  So there was an awareness 
that some control is coming back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but still not - not satisfactory.  There is still 
serious challenges? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No definitely not. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and - and then we deal with the 
matter from - from paragraph 47 which you refer to as: 
“Of an accelerated salary adjustment division 
wanting to or deciding to review Mr Motsoeneng’s 
salary.” 
Could you just tell the Chairperson what happened there? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE: 
 
Well 
there 
were 
many 
salary 
20 
adjustments happening at a senior level and Human Resources 
identified Mr Motsoeneng’s position in that context of adjusting salaries 
of adjusting salaries to create parity. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And - and by so doing then they would 
have - was this at the time when he was already appointed as COO or 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 82 of 179 
 
the parity happened when he was still Acting as COO? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well already in the Group Chief 
Executive’s Office there was some adjustment because he had come in 
on a provincial salary which was well below the manager’s salary in 
that position … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  But then when he became Group 
Executive then there was another adjustment and then when he became 
Acting COO there was then another adjustment. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the position that he occupied as stake - 
stakeholders - Stakeholder Relations Manager you have said it was a 
position that did exist before although the person occupying that 
position would not have been representing the board would have been 
representing the management as I understand the position. 
Now one would have expected that if Mr Motsoeneng came 
from wherever he came to occupy that position or was appointed to that 
position he would earn what is the rate for somebody occupying that 
position.  When you talk about an adjustment the way you talk it 
creates the impression in my mind and I just want to give you a chance 
20 
to clear that if that is not correct. 
It creates the impression that it was something special that 
was done.  Whereas I expect that there would be nothing special done.  
Somebody comes from a certain position, goes to (interference with 
mic) responsibilities that are attached to a certain position.  That 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 83 of 179 
 
position exists.  They get paid what anybody occupying that position 
would be paid. 
Of course you did say that before Mr Motsoeneng whoever 
was occupying this position of Stakeholder Relations Manager was 
speaking only for the management not for the board but I am not sure 
whether just adding that part of speaking for the board would 
necessarily have required the addition of any money. 
So when he came to this position or was appointed did he not 
immediately and whatever was supposed to be the rate for this 
position? 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Chairperson probably it is a matter of 
language … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  But it describes exactly how you 
translate … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  From a provincial salary scale level 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  To one at Head Office. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Okay.  So - so you see that - that language 
might create the impression that it was something special for him. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No.  Definitely … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whereas from what you are saying if the position was 
simply that at the Free State he was occupying a position that was for 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 84 of 179 
 
argument’s sake at Grade 5 but as Stakeholder Relations Manager that 
position is at Grade 7 - Grade 7. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Obviously he must earn the rate that is applicable at 
Grade 7 … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it has got nothing to do with him as a person.  It 
is simply that anybody occupying that position must earn that salary.  
You - you understand? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  I agree. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  I agree very much Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That the use of the language could … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes it is not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Give a wrong impression. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  I agree Chairperson.  Unfortunately 
this term - terminology crept into the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Into this whole thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but whatever - what you call adjustment was 
20 
nothing more than that he was from a certain time to be paid at - at a 
rate that was for somebody occupying the position he was occupying? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Absolutely Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but before that was done did he for some time 
when he was already at the Head Office - did he for some time continue 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 85 of 179 
 
to - to be paid at the rate of the position he occupied in the Free State? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you recall. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well I - I would think so because 
Human Resources would not have done any translation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE: 
 
They 
did 
it 
because 
of 
this 
discrepancy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Mr Chairman and then 
10 
there is something that you mentioned in paragraph 47: 
“I am mindful of the fact there were salaries.  It was 
not just him.  There were other people I would 
imagine.” 
But then you say: 
“Since these were adjustments outside the normal 
time periods the board was required to sign off on 
these adjustments.” 
What does that mean? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well this was purely in response to 
20 
the CEO saying Mr Motsoeneng has just come in.  He is going through 
different levels very quickly.  He - she needs support from the board.  
That was the only reason why the board got involved. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN 
SC: 
 
So 
would 
this 
relate 
only 
to 
Mr Motsoeneng or were - were there other people that the board had to 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 86 of 179 
 
sign off on? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well I think Mr Tsietsi - I am not too 
sure but now I am not too sure about that.  Let me … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Not comment. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might not recall but to you know how far apart the 
two positions were?  The one that Mr Motsoeneng held in the Free 
State and the one that he held at the Head Office as Stakeholder 
Relations Manager.  Do - do you know how many grades higher the - 
10 
the last one was? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or is it something that you might not recall because I 
am trying to think … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That maybe some of the confusion and maybe some 
of the things that may have been said might relate to the fact that even 
though he might be earning a salary that is appropriate for somebody 
occupying the position of Stakeholder Relations Manager maybe he has 
jumped quite a number of ranks and therefore that is what may attract 
20 
attention.  Is that something you do not remember? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well certainly the fact that he had 
come in and jumped a number of levels.  Obviously I think that is why 
even the CEO was worried. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 87 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  However I think the information 
would be there in documentation from HR … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  As to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Exactly … 
CHAIRPERSON:  To explain everything? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  I will take the witness 
10 
through that documentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Unfortunately there was just some 
problems with the numbering. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So I probably do so … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Once I am finished with the parliamentary 
records.  Thank you.  (Clearing throat) sorry - excuse me.  Then you 
say according to you he had jumped about three steps in salary 
20 
categories having come from a provincial scale to Group Executive 
scale. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes.  I mean the differences become 
quite significant … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 88 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  If you move … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  (Intervenes). 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Someone in different positions … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Into the next. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  From what you have said it seems that this was how 
he got to occupy this position of Stakeholder Relations Manager.  It 
seems that he was just - he was just identified by the Group Chief 
Executive Officer as the right person to come and occupy this position 
10 
at Head Office without any advertisements being made even internally 
to look for people who would apply for this position and be interviewed. 
Am I correct in understanding that - that there was no 
advertisement internally of the position and other people were not 
allowed to apply?  He was just identified by the Group Chief Executive 
Officer and he checked with either the Chairperson of the Board or the 
board that it would be fine if he brought that person and he brought the 
person. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is my understanding correct? 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  It is sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  It is what one - one would call ad 
hominem.  You know.  Where it is something that is just done because 
the person is needed. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 89 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  As you understood the position this was quite 
allowed by the policies of the SABC for - for somebody to be identified 
like that and then to be taken to a particular position without any 
competition even from internally. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes.  Of course we have Governance 
Committee, Remuneration Committee.  Although I do not have the 
documents but I am quite sure that went through all those stages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes because it does strike me - I mean while on 
10 
the one hand I - I can understand that sometimes there is somebody 
that appears to have certain skills and maybe qualifications and maybe 
special talents that you identify for a certain position and it might look 
like really you know everybody else within the organisation. 
You do not think there is anybody who matches the skills or 
qualifications or experience of that particular person while on the one 
hand one can understand that that can happen but what I am thinking is 
if that person is so good.  If that person has such skills what will you 
lose by advertising internally? 
Let him be one of the candidates because if he is so good he 
20 
is going to beat all of them and still be the one who gets appointed. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  I agree Chairperson.  However 
unfortunately that did not happen that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  I think it was the pressure of the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 90 of 179 
 
situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That made this type of selection - 
you know … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Appropriate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, because it - it does or it can leave room for 
abuse of power.  Not that it always will be abused.  It could be genuine 
and so on and so on … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Sure. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it does leave room that if I am in charge and I 
know there is a certain position and I would like to do you a favour.  I 
could say no, no, no.  Dr Ngubane has - is good for this position.  I will 
say he must just come - come here and yet if I did not do things that 
way - I said look he has got good skills but let us - let us allow other 
people to apply and I think he will emerge victorious anyway. 
Then it eliminates room for - for abuse.  Of course it may well 
be that there may have been good grounds of urgency to - to appoint 
and not to follow certain procedures.  I am not sure but I am just 
sharing with you what is going on in my mind as - as you give the 
20 
evidence. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No I - I concede that point 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Hm. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 91 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Thank you and 
then you - Dr Ngubane then you deal with in paragraph 49 with an 
announcement that you made announcing that Mr Motsoeneng was 
going to be Acting COO as from 15 November 2011. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you and that process happened 
in the manner in which the Deputy Chief Justice has explained to you 
without any advertisement nothing same applies to that position? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Well so an acting position does not 
10 
require an advertisement but it’s got to be announced to the staff when 
it happens. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    And then in paragraph 15 filling of the 
post of Chief Operating Officer so then Mr Hlaudi had been actin in that 
position and then there was an advert published on 15 February 2011.  
Could you just – I know that parliament asked you a lot about this 
advert and I’ll take you in due course to those relevant transcripts of 
parliament where you were asked at length about the appointment and 
the advert that related to the – ultimately to the appointment of Mr 
Motsoeneng, do you recall that evidence that you gave before the ad 
20 
hoc committee of parliament? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Well Motsoeneng was only 
appointed after I had gone from SABC. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   No I’m talking about the advert, the 
advert that – there’s the issue…[intervenes]. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 92 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   The question would be whether, at the time that the 
advertisement for the position was made or published, whether you 
were still Chairperson for the position of COO? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes I was still Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were still Chairperson ja okay thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair.  Do you recall Dr 
Ngubane what were the requirements on that advert for a person who 
would qualify for the position of COO? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Well I don’t have the advert in front 
of me but I do know that…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes I’m sorry let’s see if we can find it, if it 
in…[intervenes]. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   The only challenge is that the pages, if 
you are going to be able to follow. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There’s a problem with page numbers? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   The pagination it’s affects my notes 
because now I’ve asked…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well if you - there might be a problem like that, if  
you are able to  read what the contents of the advert or the relevant 
parts and show the advert to Dr Ngubane even if there’s a problem with 
20 
the page just so that he sees it, that would be fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you if you could just bear with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe before you do that, let me ask this question, 
as I understand it, when it came to the Group Chief Executive Officer, 
the CFO and the COO I think you said that those appointments would 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 93 of 179 
 
come to the Board.  So you did say that in regard to the COO you would 
need – the Board would need the concurrence of the Minister and the 
Minister would take the name to the Board.  I take it that, that would be 
the same process for all the three positions? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So since those three positions would be filled by the 
Board, I take it that it would be the Board that would decide on what 
the requirements would be for any one of those positions whenever 
they were vacant.  In other words, they would say, okay if we are going 
to advertise for the position of Group Chief Executive Officer, what are 
10 
we going to look for, what are the essential requirements, what are the 
recommended – I’m not sure if it’s correct to say recommended 
requirements but what skills or qualifications would we regard as ones 
that would be good but are not essential for the person that we’ll 
appoint to have, am I correct that, that – it would be the Board that 
would look at that? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s true. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that when the advert goes out it must have been 
approved by the Board to say it reflects what we are looking for? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s correct, okay thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr Chairman 
may I beg leave to hand up the reference bundle which is marked 
Exhibit CC32, I’ve already opened the place where the advert 
is…[intervenes].

CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you and I’ve asked that the 
witness be given a copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you. Dr Ngubane is that the advert 
that was issued in relation of the position of the COO? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s correct Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, could you just put on record what the 
requirements were for that position, or maybe we start with the key 
accountabilities because that becomes…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes he may as well maybe read all the key 
accountabilities because I think those are the key responsibilities and 
then the requirements. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you Mr Chair. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   “The Chief Operations Officer, key

ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you, so at the time when this 
advert was published or even crafted by the SABC, they were aware of 
what is it that they wanted and as the Chairperson has asked you, they 
knew of particular skills that they required but most importantly they 
were aware that they needed someone who would qualify professionally 
and have a degree and diploma or an equivalent of those? 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s correct Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   So having looked then, I’m sure at this 
advert you would have said it’s not going to be possible for Hlaudi to 
meet these requirements…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Motsoeneng. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Sorry Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng, sorry.  Mr 
Hlaudi Motsoeneng to meet those requirements because he didn’t have 
a degree, he didn’t have a diploma and at the time I think he did not 
have a matric as well. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s correct Chairperson. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, so you would not have expected the 
SABC then, to appoint him permanently in that position? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s correct Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you and maybe just dealing with 
that issue, maybe I could just deal with what – you also dealt with that 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 97 of 179 
 
issue before parliament and may I just find out – because there is a 
point where parliament asked in relation to an advert and Chair I had 
placed next to the witness another bundle if I may beg your leave to 
look at Exhibit CC29. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Exhibit 29? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes that’s correct.  Thank you Chair, I’ve 
asked the registrar to place it – it’s also there, it is here Chair I placed 
it on his desk I beg your pardon.  No, no it’s the one marked 
parliamentary transcripts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Look at the evidenced leader and listen to her, 
10 
you’re busy showing him but he’s looking elsewhere. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair, may I refer Chair to 
page 162 in red, it’s page 162 right hand corner in red. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well shouldn’t you first tell us the divider, what 
divider number? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Oh I beg your pardon, oh yes you’re quite 
right Chair, it’s divider number five. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Divider number five? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay that’s a pink one. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes and then if you could just turn to 
page 162. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Page? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   162 or maybe before just to identify just 
to put it in context, is it correct that, Dr Ngubane I think you’ve already 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 98 of 179 
 
mentioned…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let him find it first, I don’t know if he has found it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Alright, 162, it’s in red. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   163? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   162 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it part of the report of the portfolio committee- ad 
hoc committee? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the SABC Board, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you, is it correct that you 
10 
testified before the committee on the 13 t h of January 2017, Dr 
Ngubane? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:    Where are you reading? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   I’m reading – if you look at the very first 
page of that, after the divider immediately the page following the 
divider five, that page will be marked 141. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Okay – oh yes. 
ADV 
THANDI 
NORMAN 
SC: 
 
 
That 
page 
is 
– 
there’s 
parliament…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s the cover page for the report of the ad hoc 
20 
committee on the SABC Board of inquiry can you find that page on 141? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes that’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay and she would like you to go to page 162, 
yes on the red numbers at the right-hand corner at the top. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you, you are asked a question 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 99 of 179 
 
there Dr Ngubane at page 162 along – Mr Wagener asked you, 
 
“No I’m not disputing that you do not have sight but I want to 
 
put it to you, I’m telling you that the reason why you did not 
 
care about that report, you didn’t bother to read the report is 
 
because you didn’t care about the damage you caused the 
 
SABC, what is your response to that”? 
 
And then your response – I’m so sorry I apologise Chair 
because the part about the advert is actually on the next page but 
maybe this is worth dealing with because it is in any event something 
that we are going to deal with and then Dr Ngubane, 
10 
 
“I did not cause damage at SABC, I saved the SABC, it was 
 
bankrupt when we came, the regulations were not observed, 
 
even the financial statements of the public service broadcaster 
 
and public commercial broadcaster were not finalised, it was in 
 
a mess.  We sat around trying to stop the haemorrhaging of 
 
money out of the SABC there was a huge theft going on the AG 
 
found that, if you read the AG’s report, so don’t accuse me 
 
falsely of destroying the SABC”. 
 
And then he referred you then to the Public Protector’s report 
and he says, it speaks specifically to yourself it says, 
20 
 
“The former Chairperson [indistinct] acted irregularly when he 
 
ordered that the qualification requirement for the appointment 
 
to the position of COO would be altered to remove academic 
 
qualifications as previously advertised which was purely aimed 
 
at 
tailor 
making 
the 
advert 
to 
suit 
Mr 
Motsoeneng’s 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 100 of 179 
 
 
circumstances. 
 
This 
constitutes 
improper 
conduct, 
 
maladministration and abuse of unjustifiable exercise of power, 
 
that is what she is saying”. 
 
And then your response was, 
 
“Could you produce that advert because there was no such 
 
advert that I altered, please produce it for me”, 
 
Could you tell the Chairperson whether you first of all you 
were ever asked about this advert and whether you had altered an 
advert prior to you being confronted with the question by Mr Wagener? 
DR BALDING SIPHO NGUBANE:   No it is not true. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes but when, for the first time, did you 
get to know that there were allegations that you had actually altered an 
advert to suit Mr Motsoeneng’s qualifications? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   I never handled any advert 
Chairperson, I don’t know where – who said this to the Public Protector 
because there’s no advert where I wrote with my hand and say, change 
this and change that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did the Public Protector, before issuing her report 
ever ask you or afford you an opportunity to say something about 
whatever allegation she might have been told that you were responsible 
20 
for the alteration of an advert? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes she invited me to a meeting and 
I went…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did she raise this with you? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   She did raise this issue. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 101 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   This was never put to you that there was an 
allegation that you altered the advert – the requirements for the 
position in the advert? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Chairperson I would have asked 
exactly about what I asked, show me, show me the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So she never raised that with you? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And…[intervenes]. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Well as far as I remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As far as you can remember? 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Ja but if that was the case I would 
have actually, as I said to Advocate Wagener, let me see the 
report…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The altered advert ja, and you never instructed 
anybody to alter the requirements in the advert or anything like that? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   No Chairperson, when we were 
talking about hiring a [indistinct] company, just general discussion, I 
think it was in the governance committee.  My view was, the SABC had 
already appointed a COO who was then frustrated by the cabinet or the 
Minister. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Mbembe? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes sir, why don’t you just take that 
report, I mean that advert it and use it, that was my only comment 
about this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes that was in the discussion? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 102 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Just in the discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At a Board meeting or outside of the Board meeting? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   I think it was governance committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes governance committee. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes I think so but I said my view 
was we are going to now search for a search company pay money but 
someone had been appointed at SABC as COO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe just so that one can understand that 
suggestion, was that discussion, did that take place before the advert 
that we talked about earlier, the one that we have seen as far as you 
10 
recall or was it after, that discussion that you are talking about, do you 
know whether it happened before this advert was issued, the one that 
we have? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   It happened before this advert. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It happened before the advert? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes I think this advert was drawn up  
by a search company, I’m not too sure who did it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes but in regard to the advert to which Mr 
Mbembe had responded by applying for the job do you know whether 
the requirements that were in that advert and the key responsibilities 
20 
were basically the same as the ones in the advert that we do have? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   No sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t know. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   I have not seen that advert. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but what you had said before this advert was 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 103 of 179 
 
issued was that in order to advertise this position they must simply use 
the one that had been used before to which Mr Mbembe had responded. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Whether they did that or not, you don’t know? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   I don’t know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You just know that this is the advert that went out 
and you didn’t have a problem with it? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   I mean the previous Board had 
never had a problem with the advert [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes thank you. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Chair I’m going to have to – so that you 
don’t lose this point that we’re making about the advert and just direct 
the witness to what the Public Protector, in her report, says, with your 
leave may I just put it to the witness? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja that’s fine yes do that ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Dr Ngubane there is another bundle there 
maybe without looking at it we can…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry Miss Norman I’m sorry I’m interrupting you, 
before we move away from the exchange between Dr Ngubane and Mr 
Wagener, yes I’m also particular about not pronouncing people’s names 
20 
correctly, before we move away from that discussion between the two of 
them, are we done with it, was the issue left where it is? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   No Chair it’s just because the advert 
issued then, becomes more prominent in the other bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 104 of 179 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   The other bundle yes which the findings 
of the Public Protector. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay that’s fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you, that would be also Exhibit 27 
Chair at page 290. You may close that one Dr Ngubane and open the 
one next to you, that one, sorry about that. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Sorry what cover? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Folder number 10. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It’s a green folder. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   This is the Public Protector’s report 
10 
entitled when governance and ethics fail. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Has he found – have you found it Dr Ngubane? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Divider number 10. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the Public Protector’s report at page 244, the 
next page you have found it after the divider? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Sorry what page? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Public Protector’s report after the divider. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   I’ve got the Public Protector’s 
report. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Could you turn to page 290? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Sorry? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   290. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Oh okay, sorry I looked down here 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 105 of 179 
 
alright, 294? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   290. 
CHAIRPERSON:   290. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you found page 290 at the top? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay she will ask a question on that page. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Mr Chairman, this is the Public 
Protector’s report and this is what she says,  
 
“First of all maybe you should start with appointment as Group 
10 
 
Executive stakeholder relations and regions of the SABC. 
 
6.1.2.1, 
Mr 
Motsoeneng 
was 
appointed 
as 
Executive 
 
stakeholder relations and regions SABC scale 115 and a total 
 
package CTC of R1 461 539.  This fixed term contract was for 
 
a period of five years commencing on 1 April 2011 and was 
 
signed by both Mr Nicholson and Mr Motsoeneng on 1 April 
 
2011.  Mr Nicholson again, inexplicably omitted to insert the 
 
year on the date while the handwriting is similar on the 
 
contract 
where 
both 
signatures 
were 
appended, 
again, 
 
although this raises questions of authenticity the matter was 
20 
 
not pursued during the investigation. 6.1.3 appointment as 
 
acting COO SABC, advertisement of COO’s position. 6.1.3.1 
 
according to a copy of the advertisement received from 
 
Spencer Stuart the SABC’s recruitment agency, the agency 
 
placed an advertisement on behalf of the SABC in the Sunday 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 106 of 179 
 
 
Times and City Press on 9 July 2006 for the filling of the 
 
vacant position of COO which became vacant in 2005/2006.  
 
The advertisement indicated under the heading, qualifications 
 
that the applicant should have and appropriate academic 
 
background preferably post graduate qualification.  In 2008 an 
 
internal 
advertisement 
was 
once 
again 
placed for 
the 
 
appointment of COO, the requirement for appropriate academic 
 
requirement, preferable post graduate qualification as per the 
 
advertisement in 2006 was removed and replaced by the 
 
following. Commercially astute Executive with broad ranging 
10 
 
operational track record of success in broadcasting. 6.1.3.3, 
 
the same internal advertisement is mentioned in the paragraph 
 
above was circulated on Thursday 28 January 2012 with the 
 
closing date being 31 January 2012.  6.1.3.4, in reply to my 
 
questions, Miss Mokhobo, on 12 June 2012 stated that the 
 
SABC committed an act of fraudery and uttering in changing 
 
the advertisement for the position of the COO issued in April 
 
2008 by removing the requirement for academic qualifications 
 
so as to suit Mr Motsoeneng who is without qualification to 
 
meet the criteria of the advertised position.  The advertisement 
20 
 
was an exact replica of previous advertisements dating as far 
 
back as 2006.  During my meeting with Miss Mokhobo on 11 
 
March 2013, Miss Mokhobo indicated that the Chairperson of 
 
the Board indicated to her that she was not allowed to change 
 
the requirements of the advertisement and that it had to go 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 107 of 179 
 
 
exactly as the one in 2008.  Miss Mokhobo indicated that the 
 
Chairperson was adamant that he did not want to see any 
 
qualifications reflected in the advertisement.  This sentiment 
 
was echoed by Advocate [indistinct] Maglate, former member 
 
of the SABC Board. 6.1.3.6, this was disputed by Dr Ngubane 
 
who indicated to me on 15 March 2013 that the advertisement 
 
had not come before the Board for approval and it was 
 
something that was done by management”. 
 
I think then – I had to read that because the Chairperson had 
asked you about whether the Public Protector had asked you about this 
10 
issue of an advert. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Well Chairperson, I mean this itself 
states the issue, the advert was changed by someone in 2008 that 
advert never came before me, it was a management issue.  So I’m 
absolutely surprised that so much emphasis is placed here by Miss 
Mokhobo on something that never served, I didn’t know that this advert 
had been changed, all I said was, why waste money going to search 
companies because someone is appointed on an advert for a COO 
position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And do you have – now at the time that Mr Mbembe 
20 
was interviewed your Board was not in place yet, is that correct? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you didn’t interview or it wasn’t your panel that 
interviewed him but do you know what – you don’t know what 
qualifications may have been required for candidates who applied for 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 108 of 179 
 
that position at the same time as he did, you don’t know that or do you? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Well probably I was naïve 
chairperson, I assumed that if someone had been appointed by the 
Board surely it would have met all requirements, you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, so you might not have known what 
requirements were there but you assumed that those would have been 
the requirements that would have been approved by the Board and 
therefore they should be fine. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay now this part where, in the report of the Public 
10 
Protector she says you indicated to her that she was not allowed to 
change the requirements of the advertisement and that it had to go out 
exactly as the one in 2008, if I stop there, it might be close to what you 
said earlier on but you must just tell me if it’s not close.  You had said 
that you said in the discussions that took place at the governance 
committee meeting in a governance committee meeting you said but an 
appointment – there is a candidate who had already been approved by 
the Board and you were referring to Mr Mbembe.  There was an advert 
that would have gone out for – to which he responded, that is the 
advert that should be used but I understood it, you are putting that as a 
20 
suggestion, as an idea in the discussion is that right? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s correct chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now what she says here to the extent that, that’s the 
advert that was used in 2008, to that extent she might be close to 
saying something that reflected your attitude, just that part that I read, 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 109 of 179 
 
do you want me to read that part so you can just see whether it 
correctly reflects what your attitude was. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She says, the Public Protector says the following 
about what Miss Mokhobo said to her at paragraph 6.1.3.5 page 291 
and its paginated bundle and it’s at page 48 of the report of the Public 
Protector, she says, 
 
“During my meeting with Miss Mokhobo on 11 March 2013, 
 
Miss Mokhobo indicated that the Chairperson of the Board 
 
indicated to her that she was not allowed to change the 
10 
 
requirements for the advertisement and that it had to go out 
 
exactly as the one in 2008”, 
 
Now the Public Protector says Miss Mokhobo said you said to 
her you’re not allowed to change it, that’s the part where I say, maybe 
what she says is close to what you may have said but you can indicate 
whether that was your attitude, that it should not be allowed or whether 
you simply said, why not use the same advert that was used in 2008, 
without saying you are not allowed? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Well Chairperson I couldn’t have 
said she mustn’t change because we did not have that advert in front of 
20 
us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes so you might have – you might have said she 
mustn’t change the advert because you wanted the same advert that 
had been used previously should be used again? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s right, Chair that’s correct 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 110 of 179 
 
that’s as opposed to going to someone to go to write a new advert. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes so that part might be correct.  Miss 
Mokhobo indicated that the Chairperson was adamant that he did not 
want to see any qualifications reflected in the advertisement, what do 
you say about that part? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Well I don’t know where she got this 
because there was no basis for going into this detail at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you never said that? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, Miss Norman. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Chair it’s now five past one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let’s take the lunch adjournment then we will 
resume at five past two, we adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us proceed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  
Could you go back Chair to the Exhibit 29?  The parliament transcript.  
Doctor Ngubane may I just refer you to page 165 of that exhibit.  The 
20 
last sentence from page 164 says: 
“Mr Wanage[?] further this is what the Public 
Protector says in view of your salary increases 
between yourself, Ms Mokhobo and whatever the HR 
Report 
was 
saying. 
 
The 
allegation 
that 
Mr 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 111 of 179 
 
Motsoeneng’s salary progression was irregular is 
also substantiated in that Mr Motsoeneng received 
salary appraisals three times in one year as hiking 
his 
salary 
as 
Executive 
Manager 
Stakeholder 
Relations from 1.5 million to 2.4 million.  His salary 
progression on acting Chief Operations Officer 
concomitantly rose irregularly from R122 961.00 to 
R211 172.00 which was a 63% increase in twelve 
months and in violation of part 4 of the SABC 
personnel Regulations and SABC policy.  Acting in 
10 
higher scale and this constitutes improper conduct 
and maladministration.” 
And then your response was that this was not correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you put a question to… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I am sorry – I am so sorry Doctor.  Doctor 
Ngubane this is what the Public Protector stated it is read – it was read 
out to you by Mr Wanaage [?] what is your response to that? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well you know I think she thought I 
engineered this.  I did not.  This was coming through HR – through the 
CEO, I would not have had a mechanism to create this as Chairman of 
20 
the board.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us – let us go back and you can indicate what you 
know and what you do not know.   
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  You are right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you did tell me already that the idea of bring Mr 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 112 of 179 
 
Motsoeneng into the head office of SABC was that of the then Group 
Chief Executive Officer Mr Mokwetle I think that is the person who 
came with this idea to you. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and you said okay that is fine as I understand the 
position after he gave some motivation which was that the station – 
radio station where he was in the Free State was making money while a 
lot of other SABC radio stations were losing money.  Is that right? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the power to appoint somebody to that position 
10 
did it lie with the Group Chief Executive Officer and not with the board 
or Stakeholder Relations Manager or did it lie with the board? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That lies with him.  It is only when it 
comes to Group Executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That the board – that the board gets 
consulted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And that is – that if for the three positions that 
we mentioned earlier or is it four?  Chief – Group Chief Executive, 
CFO, COO was there a fourth one? 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  CEO, CFO and COO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was three? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Ys. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 113 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  And those three the board has the power 
to appoint subject to the Minister concurring and so on? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  But for the Stakeholder Relations Manager that 
was the – within the power of the Group Chief Executive Officer? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now I asked earlier on whether you knew what the 
gap was between the position that Mr Motsoeneng held at the radio 
station in the Free State and the position of Stakeholder Relations 
Manager and I think you did say he jumped quite a few ranks.  But I do 
10 
not know if you said three or you are not sure whether it was three or 
not but you know he jumped quite a few ranks. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well if I remember well it was three.  
Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And in terms of what the difference in salary 
between the two positions namely the one in the Free State and the one 
of Stakeholder Relations Manager do you have any recollection of how 
much difference there was between the two? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  More or less. 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  I do not have the actual… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Figures. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Mental picture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  But I know that it is very significant 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 114 of 179 
 
differences. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was a significant difference? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   Yes.  Did you know at that time when Mr 
Motsoeneng was – when the Group CEO at the time wanted to appoint 
him to this position did you know what the requirements were for 
somebody to occupy that position of Stakeholder Relations Manager or 
is that something you did not know? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well what I knew was that that 
person would be dealing with Provincial Stations. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  And the motivation by the CEO was 
that he had been good in the Free State. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  And that is why he wanted him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  That is all you knew? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About the position. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in terms of what his qualifications were at what 
20 
stage did you get to know that – was that before he came to the head 
office or was that after? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  When he came to head office no-one 
paid much attention to his qualifications. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 115 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Because he was already within the 
SABC.  This arose later on and then we sought information on the 
people who employed him.  In fact Mr Alwyn produced an affidavit as to 
why he had employed him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is now people who employed him in the Free 
Stare? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  In the Free State yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  So he was there, they found him fit 
we were not going to revisit that you know. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So at that time when you sought an understanding 
from those who had employed him was he still Stakeholder Relations 
Manager as you recall or had he become acting COO? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  He had become acting COO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And at the time he was appointed acting COO I 
would have imagined that okay let me just start by this.  The 
appointment of an acting COO I would imagine that is – that falls within 
the power of the board, is that correct or …? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So he would have been appointed by the board? 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As acting COO. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I would have expected that the board before 
appointing him as acting COO it would have sought to satisfy itself that 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 116 of 179 
 
whatever qualifications or requirements there may have been for that 
position that he complied them is satisfied then, is that right? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well unfortunately qualifications do 
not come in in that type of decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  It is a question of track record 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  And the level in the organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is how acting people are 
10 
appointed.  They must be at a certain level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  In other words Group level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Then they get appointed to act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay when he was appointed as acting COO the 
position he still held was that of Stakeholder Relations Manager? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  He was already Group Executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but holding what position? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  In Stakeholder. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Stakeholder Relations Manager? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what was still manager and nothing else. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Exactly.  He was no longer a 
manager. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 117 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  He was Group Executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  So he had moved from being Stakeholder 
Relations Manager and had gone higher up. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the ranking of the position of Stakeholder 
Relations Manager and that of Group Stakeholder – Stakeholder 
Executive was the Group Stakeholder Executive immediately above the 
10 
position of Stakeholder Relations manager? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Very sig… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or there was any jumping there? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Very significant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was a significant difference? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and the one for Stakeholder Relations Executive 
had it always been there before? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  It was a function that was within the 
CEO’s office. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  So – but not a position as such?  In 
other words when you say it was a function I get the impression that 
what you mean is somebody did that function but that person might not 
necessarily have been given this title but it might have been one of his 
or her responsibilities together with other responsibilities? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 118 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  I – it is a – my regional manager. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Regional Manager? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  It is a category. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what it was. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The category? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is what it was before – before Mr 
10 
Motsoeneng occupied the position. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:    That is right 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So – so but you say there is a significant 
difference between that level and the level of Stakeholder Relations 
Manager? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No probably let us go back a bit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  He comes in as … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Stakeholder? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Manager Stakeholder. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  In the Group  
CHAIRPERSON:  CEO’s office. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Chief Executives Office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 119 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  He then gets promoted to Group 
Executive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is a big jump. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  From that one of being manager. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  After that he gets appointed acting 
COO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is also another big jump. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes, yes.  Okay what I want to understand is 
before he gets appointed as Group Executive for Stakeholder Relations. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said that before that the function he did – he 
performed in that position used to be done within the office of the 
Group Chief Executive Office. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then I said that gives me the impression that it 
might not have been a position on its own but it might have been a task 
20 
or a responsibility that was done by somebody who may have held a 
different position so that is where we were.  Is my understanding 
correct? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 120 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  It would be impossible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  For the manager. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  For Stakeholder Relations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  To do other jobs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but the Stakeholder Manager that one I 
10 
understand. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I think you explained earlier on that before 
Mr Motsoeneng was appointed to that position of manager there was 
somebody else but that person who was performing that function in 
relation to the management not the board but that after Mr Motsoeneng 
came in I do not know if you said you do not know what happened to 
the other person but there was only one person and that was 
Motsoeneng? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now at that level I understand what happened.  
Now I am now going to the level of Group Executive Stakeholder. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now Mr Motsoeneng was promoted from Stakeholder 
Relations Manager to Group Executive for Stakeholder Relations. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 121 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you have said that that was a big jump.  So the 
question I was asking was whether before his appointment – before he 
was appointed Groups Executive for Stakeholder was there such a 
position?  Your answer was some – well your answer was that function 
was being performed within the office of the Group Chief Executive 
Oficer. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And my question is whether as far as you know and 
you might not know – as far as you know whether there was somebody 
10 
who held a position that had a certain title or was it somebody who had 
another title that had nothing to do with Stakeholder Relations but 
whose responsibilities included performing what Motsoeneng later 
performed as Group Executive Stakeholder.  I hope – I hope I am 
clarifying myself? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  But my understanding was that 
whoever could have been doing that job had failed hence the CEO 
wanting somebody else. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh but you – are you able to say whether when Mr 
Motsoeneng got appointed as Group Chief – Group Executive for 
Stakeholder Relations this was a new position that was created it did 
not exist before but the job he was going to do under this new position 
had been done by somebody else under a different position, is that 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 122 of 179 
 
something you are able to say or not really? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  I am not too sure whether GE 
Stakeholder Relations never existed.  I am not sure about that.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The jump from Stakeholder Relations Manager to 
Group Executive Stakeholder Relations are you also able to indicate 
whether it was a jump of two, three, four rankings as you are able to 
indicate earlier on or is that something – the detail that you are not 
able to remember? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  I think … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You just remember it was significant. 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  I think it is a jump from a level of say 
1.5 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  To over 2 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay.  Thank you.  Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  So 
in other words what is stated then in that paragraph that I had read 
Doctor Ngubane that would correct at page 165? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Those figures are then correct? 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Then the Public Protector 
raises another issue in her report about your response to the 
application form. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you moving to another aspect? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 123 of 179 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To another aspect yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Aspect ja.  Okay no let me then finish maybe on this 
one. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh alright okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the appointment of Mr Motsoeneng as Manager 
Stakeholder Relations that was done by the Group Chief Executive 
Officer.  Now his appointment as Group Executive for Stakeholder 
Relations was that done by the board or the Chief – Group Chief 
Executive? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  I think the Chief Executive 
10 
recommends that to the board.  I am not sure of the details. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  But it would not have happened 
unless he recommended it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  To the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And at that time it was still Mr Mokwetle as 
you recall?  The Group Chief Executive Officer. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Mr Mokwetle? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  As I remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I wonder whether the board – obviously the board 
would not be I would imagine rubber stamping what the Group Chief 
Executives are – Chief Executive Officer recommends. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Right. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 124 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would apply its mind. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the question, would this be a proper appointment. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now on the understanding that the board would do 
that one is bound to then ask the question how did your board justify 
this significant jump in the promotion of Mr Motsoeneng from 
Stakeholder Manager to – to Group Executive for Stakeholder Relations 
at the salary difference that you have indicated.  What was the 
justification? 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well that have been on previous 
performance.  He succeeded as a Stakeholder Manager.  There was a 
new challenge and he was sought to be able to do it.  Just like going 
from that to becoming acting COO it was not a matter of qualifications 
it was a matter of being able to do the job.   
CHAIRPERSON:  That is quite important.  I would think that if I am 
running my own private company and here I have in mind a small 
company because the moment it is a big company and there are unions 
and so on sometimes you cannot run it the way you want.  If I am 
running a small company of mine – a private company you know if I 
20 
identify that hey this person is doing a very good job.  I need somebody 
to do this at a higher level.  I do not need to advertise outside I can 
see somebody inside I can say okay this person I will put at the higher 
position.  But now here one is dealing with a massive organisation and 
it is a state owned entity. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 125 of 179 
 
1. Why would that position not be open to – why would the board 
not see it as necessary to let there be competition for filling this 
position of Group Executive Stakeholder Relations even if it 
thought it is likely that Mr Motsoeneng is going to be – to emerge 
victorious as it were.  Why would it have thought it is not the 
right thing to say let us advertise?  You have this position let 
people be interviewed and then let us take it from there? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well I presume the background to 
that is that prior experience is accepted as adequate if a person 
demonstrates special knowledge or special capability.  I think that is 
10 
the reasoning that we went on.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course the difficulty there is that you are 
looking – you get satisfied that the person has prior experience that 
you consider adequate because you are looking at a particular person. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not going to think about that if you are about 
people that you are not looking at.  But if you opened the competition 
how do you know that you would not actually find somebody who 
surprises you and you might think Motsoeneng is so exceptional and 
then somebody says look at my track record, look where I was before I 
20 
came here?  It is just that here at SABC I have been – I was appointed 
for this position I have never been given a chance in this area actually 
in the companies where I have been I have been exposed to this.  Look 
at the wonders that I have done there.  I can do this much better than 
anybody.  How do you know that you will not get somebody who says 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 126 of 179 
 
that if you open it up to competition? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well Chairperson I fully understand 
what you are saying however when the house is burning anyone can 
pass a bucket of water as long as he can carry the water.  That was a 
situation.  SABC was burning with a lot of degreed people.  It was 
being reduced to ashes.  So anyone who could carry a bucket of water 
to put down – to put out the fire would be allowed to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – in principle that I understand. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In principle that I understand but I would think that to 
10 
the extent that you may have been dealing with a burning SABC 
appointing somebody even if it was Mr Motsoeneng as an act – in an 
acting capacity for that position of Group Executive for Stakeholder 
Relations would take care of making sure that somebody would be 
doing this job while the fires are burning but when you look at 
appointing permanently you would have time to advertise and he would 
be one of the candidates and then whatever decision you make would 
be a decision that could not easily be challenged because you would be 
seen to have been fair.  What do you say to that? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well I agree Chairperson.  This is 
20 
why for the permanent position there was an advert. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  But for this we did not do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You mean for the position – permanent position 
of Group Executive Stakeholders Relations? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 127 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  There was an advert for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes yes.  Okay.  So it is the acting appointment that 
was not advertised but the permanent appointment for that position was 
advertised? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Thank you.  
Doctor Ngubane the Public Protector raised another issue. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  At page 299. 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Sorry? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Of Exhibit 27 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  29, 29. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  299 yes.   
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    I think this would relate to the question 
that the Chairperson had asked you about.  At what point did you 
realise that Mr Motsoeneng did not hold a matric certificate. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You recall that question that the 
20 
Chairperson asked you? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  So if you could go Doctor 
Ngubane to paragraph 6.1.3.36. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Probably I am on the wrong page.  
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 128 of 179 
 
Sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 299. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  299. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well my… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes are you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  My 299 does not have those paragraph numbers. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Are you on the Public Protector’s Report 
Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes –  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  On top. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on maybe I am not. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no I think I am at a wrong bundle. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Sorry.  It is Exhibit 27.  On top it will 
say – it will have Report of the Public Protector.  Do you have it 
Doctor? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Doctor Ngubane I suspect you and I were on a wrong 
page. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you on the right page now? 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well it is 299. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  And the top of it says And the issue 
of Public Protector. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 129 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Meeting the deadline. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh no you are on the transcript.  I beg 
your pardon.  No I would like you to go to the Public Protectors Report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The bundle that has got the Public Protectors Report 
ja. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Oh okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was also on the same. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  On the transcript.  Ja it will not be in that 
file Doctor Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it will be a different bundle. 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Oh alright sure.  Thank you.  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  At paragraph 6.1.3.36 
the Public Protector stated: 
“On 
5 
April 
2012 
Doctor 
Ben 
Ngubane 
the 
Chairperson of the board responded in writing to 
questions I raised in respect of Mr Motsoeneng’s 
alleged misrepresentation to the SABC.  In his 
written response Doctor Ngubane stated that the 
SABC perused Mr Motsoeneng’s file and could find 
no 
evidence 
that 
he 
misrepresented 
his 
20 
qualifications.” 
6.1.3.37. 
“Doctor Ngubane made this remark despite the 
findings of the 11 September 2003 Group Internal 
Audit Report which indicated that the content of Mr 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 130 of 179 
 
Motsoeneng’s application for employment was false.” 
If I may just to conclude that point before you respond Doctor Ngubane 
if you could turn over the page, page 300.  Paragraph 6.1.3.39: 
“Advocate Mahlate indicated that when she tried to 
ascertain during the board meetings whether Mr 
Motsoeneng had initially lied about his qualifications 
when he applied to the SABC she was suppressed by 
the Chairperson with the support of the majority of 
the board members and that it was not necessary for 
the board to establish the true fact.  Advocate 
10 
Mahlate further drew my attention to the findings and 
verdict of the appeals panel of the Ombudsman to – 
for the press council who inter alia found that the 
Sunday Independent was justified in saying that Mr 
Motsoeneng 
had 
lied 
about 
having 
a 
matric 
certificate.  Advocate Mahlate also indicated that she 
had information about how the Chairperson of the 
board hounded and threatened the previous acting 
Company Secretary of the SABC Ms Jane Mbathea 
[?] and indicated to her that she was not allowed to 
20 
hand over any information to outsiders.” 
So if you may just go back to the first part of that finding if I may put it 
that – by the Public Protector.  What was your understanding when the 
Public Protector approached you and asked you about whether Mr 
Motsoeneng had misrepresented his qualifications?  What was your 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 131 of 179 
 
understanding of that question when you answered that there was no 
such evidence? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well the HR Report told us that there 
was no claim by Mr Motsoeneng that he had Matric.  Ms Pippa Green 
who was a Board Member also said she knew that Mr Motsoeneng did 
not have Matric.  That the people who employed him had merely 
employed him knowing this fact … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  And this was the position that we 
had. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you ever seen the application for employment to 
which they refer that Mr Motsoeneng apparently submitted to the SABC 
I guess when he was applying for employment for the first time because 
they seem to - to suggest that in that application for employment he 
misrepresented the position. 
I - as I understand it he must have said - if they are correct - 
he must have said he has Matric.  If they are correct in saying he 
misrepresented.  Have you ever seen that - that application for 
employment? 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  I saw the application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  It said he was doing Matric.  It did 
not say he had passed Matric. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It - it said he was doing Matric? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 132 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At a certain time? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it did not list Matric as … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  As a … 
CHAIRPERSON:  As a - as an educational level he had … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Passed? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got it here? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Not - not on this batch - on - on this file 
Mr Chairman, but - but I - I could just refer you to where the Public 
Protector quotes what is stated in that application form.  That would be 
at page 302.  Sorry Chair.  Yes, two … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  3-0-2 at paragraph 6.1.3.48. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  “According to the panel when 
20 
Mr Lesala wrote this on 27 June 2017 he was fully 
aware as he had been told by Mr Lopaka (?) in 
writing just five days earlier that the application for 
employment form did indeed exit and that it had 
been removed in 2003 because it gave the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 133 of 179 
 
impression that Mr Motsoeneng passed Standard 
10.  What makes Mr Lesala’s denial even more 
puzzling is that he even refer to having received 
Mr Lopaka inquiry.” 
But there is - the Public Protector actually records the 
symbols.  If I may just take you to that page Chair.  Can you just get 
that page?  Sorry.  They record the symbols as reflected on that form.  
Sorry.  I will - just ahead just now.  If you will just bear with me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well paragraph 6.1.3.45 which is at page 3-0-1 
reflects … 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The following: 
“The panel …” 
That is I think the Appeal Panel. 
“…noted that Mr Motsoeneng said that after he had 
again been refused appointment by the Regional 
Editor in Bloemfontein who told him and I quote:  “I 
am not going to appoint you because you do not 
have Matric.”  He was asked by other people to fill 
in the application form which he did.  He was then 
20 
appointed.  Mr Motsoeneng did not dispute that he 
had written 10 in the space for highest standard 
passed or that he had written the subjects and the 
symbols or the date when he claimed to have 
passed Standard 10.” 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 134 of 179 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might have been looking for that one. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, no.  Thank you Chair.  Thank you for 
that but the one I am looking for … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is at page 296. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2-0-9? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Two - 2-9-6 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  2-9-6. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Sorry.  What page? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Two - 2-9-6 Dr Ngubane.  I beg your 
pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2-9-0. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  296. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  2-9 …? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  2-9-6.  The same - same bundle.  Have 
you found it - 2-9-6?   
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  (No audible reply). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Have you found it Dr Ngubane? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Ja, I have found it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You found it? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  I think I have found it. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 135 of 179 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh, thank you.  Yes.  It is - it is paragraph 
6.1.3.20: 
“Attached to the complaint from Ms Mbani (?) was 
an 
application 
for 
employment 
completed 
by 
Mr Motsoeneng.” 
6.1 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you not say we must go to page … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Sorry. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  2-9-0? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Just come … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  2-9-6 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2-9-6? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  2-9 - sorry.  Thank you.  Then 6.1.3.21: 
“On 
the 
completed 
application 
Mr Motsoeneng 
indicated that he passed Standard 10 in 1991 at the 
age of 23 years with the following subjects:  
20 
English, E; South Sotho, E; Afrikaans, E; Bibs, E; 
History, F.” 
And then the Public Protector says: 
“On 
the 
application 
form 
that 
Mr Motsoeneng 
completed he only noted five subjects completed 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 136 of 179 
 
and not the usual six.  During the interview 
Mr Motsoeneng 
admitted 
falsifying 
his 
Matric 
qualification and blamed an Ms Swanepoel whom he 
said gave him the application form to fill - to fill in 
anything.  In other words to make up the symbols 
from the top of his head which he did.  With regard 
to the Matric Certificate the form says outstanding 
giving the impression that the certificate exists and 
would be submitted in due course.  A copy of a 
transcript of the interview held with Mr Motsoeneng 
10 
on 19 July 2013 with me is annexed to the report.  
Below is an extract from the transcript.” 
Now with this information now being placed before you by the 
Public Protector Dr Ngubane would you still say that there was no 
evidence then of misrepresentation?  Supposing that you were aware of 
this information at the time when you were asked to comment and now 
it is placed before you now.  What would your comment be? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well I will go with the - Mr Alwyn’s 
affidavit.  That they knew he did not have a Matric Certificate but they 
appointed him all the same … 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Because of the service that he was 
rendering. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That to me sums up the attitude of 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 137 of 179 
 
the board in advancing Mr Motsoeneng to the Acting position. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  If for example Mr Motsoeneng as he 
has admitted to the Public Protector had actually put in symbols - let us 
say everybody knew that he did not have Matric. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So if he did not have Matric all that he 
needed to do on his application form was to say my qualifications 
Standard 8 but then when he - if he goes beyond and puts - and puts in 
symbols and subjects on an application form would you regard that as 
misrepresentation or would you feel that because he does not have the 
10 
Matric it really does not matter that he had put in those symbols? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No the issue of symbols did not 
arise.  As I say I am trying to look for what Mr Alwyn said because that 
is what I have - sort of influenced us … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  In our view.  I cannot find him here 
but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This might help while you are looking. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This might help.  What you are looking for is it where 
you say somebody put up an affidavit? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 138 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the affidavit was to the effect that they knew that 
he did not have Matric and they appointed him for whatever reason. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  He had no - he had no Matric 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He had no Matric, yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They appointed him … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Despite knowing that? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is write. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That - that is what you were looking for? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you are looking for now? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  No I - I understand 
that Dr Ngubane but my question is if he did not have Matric he would 
have said I do not have Matric when he is applying for the - for the 
position but if knowing that he does not have Matric but he puts up 
symbols and subjects would you regard that as misrepresentation? 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well he - yes of course.  However … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  He told us that he did not have 
Matric. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 139 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  So we knew that.  I mean we did not 
search for all sorts of things. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  We knew he did not have Matric but 
he could do the job. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So in other words as far as you are 
concerned then or now it really did not matter that he had put in those 
symbols on … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  On the application form. 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No, no that did not arise.  I am sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That issue did not arise.  We went 
with the knowledge that he does not have Matric … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  But senior people in SABC saw fit to 
appoint him. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  When you say the issue did not arise do 
you mean it did arise before the Public Protector or that issue did not 
arise at all at the SABC prior to his appointment? 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well at the SABC it did not arise.  
We knew that he did not have Matric … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  But we knew that we wanted certain 
services from him. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 140 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  I think the - maybe one should look … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At it from this angle because I think the public or part 
of the public might also be looking at it in this way.  Namely was 
possession of Matric not required - was it not a requirement for the 
position of Stakeholder Relations Manager that - that might be one 
position but the board did not make that decision but once the board 
had to make a decision it - one would have expected that it would start 
by saying what are the requirements for this position. 
Does he meet those requirements?  So I think that one must 
10 
say - ask the question for the position of Group Executive for 
Stakeholder Relations was possession of Matric not a requirement and 
was possession of Matric not a requirement for appointment as Acting 
CEO - COO.  So I think that - that is where you might wish to focus. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  We knew he did not have Matric … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  But we knew that he could deliver 
what we wanted … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  And that is what guided us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Would - would your answer therefore be that you 
knew that he did not have Matric but you knew that possession of 
Matric - Matric Certificate was a requirement for both of these positions 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 141 of 179 
 
but for certain reasons you decided that it was fine or - or is the 
position that the board did not know whether Matric was a requirement 
for these positions? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Chairperson we know that or we 
knew that a Matric Certificate and higher qualifications are always 
required but like the people in the Free State they were dealing with a 
crisis where the people who were there were supposed to be able to 
deliver a successful broadcasting service were failing and hence they 
took this boy who did not have a Matric and he made a difference. 
So it was the same approach here.  We know normally you 
10 
would want to have those qualifications but when people with those 
qualifications fail you then try anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you then be in a position to say whether 
appointing somebody to a position where he or she did not meet one of 
the requirements … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was a breach of whether it was policy or whatever 
governance rules and regulations.  You - you - that you knew that it 
was a breach but you considered that having regard to everything else 
you considered - the board considered itself justified or what - what 
20 
would you say? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  I would say exactly you said … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 142 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  But the board knew … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That the people we had … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Had not delivered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  So we were trying to improve the 
situation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay, alright. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  And - and … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  There are people at SABC who do 
not have Matric. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  This was not the precedent … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Or the first time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  People in quite senior positions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  I am sure if HR could provide us… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  With a list of all the qualifications … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Of people in sales of people … 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 143 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  In different department you would 
find that there are some who do not have Matric. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Some of them come from the old 
dispensation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Before 1994. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Who did not have Matric but they 
10 
were given these jobs and they were doing it very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the - well I do not know about the facts you - you 
might know much more because you were Chairperson of the Board 
there.  I can - but I can understand a situation where there is a new 
dispensation that comes and comes in and it comes in when there was 
another dispensation before.  That other dispensation may have done 
things in a certain way … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the new dispensation wants to do things 
differently … 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is considered that maybe it would be unfair to 
then say people who had been appointed to a certain position under the 
previous dispensation should now be dismissed because the new 
dispensation has different requirements for those positions.  I - I can 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 144 of 179 
 
understand a situation where a decision is taken look when they came 
in they met the requirements that were required then. 
We want different requirements because maybe we have a 
different level to which we want to take this institution but then what 
might happen is as I see it you say well if those people stay where they 
are you leave them alone but if they want to go up … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then you will - you will want them to meet the 
requirements that are required at the time when they want to go up. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That - that I can understand.  Is - is it that kind of 
situation that you - you are talking about in terms of the HR or could it 
be a situation similar to Motsoeneng because as I understand - I may 
be wrong - as I understand the position Mr Motsoeneng seems to have 
come into the SABC at the Free State after 1994 which I would consider 
to be a new dispensation. 
The other people - the other situations where there were 
people who did not have Matric do you know whether they would have 
been from the old - the dispensation or not really or is it something you 
would not know?  You just know that there were other people who did 
20 
not have Matric. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE: 
 
Well 
I 
would 
not 
have 
the 
documentation but HR would have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would have, yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  But then Chairperson if you will allow 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 145 of 179 
 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  The same dispensation - the new 
dispensation recognised prior learning and this had a major effect on 
the thinking - you know - on the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  No I - I think that - I think that is important.  
I mean there - there are many people who might not have Matric.  Who 
might not even have lower educational standards or grades than Matric 
who nevertheless are very good at what they are doing and who do a 
very good job and one must never create the impression that if you do 
10 
not have Matric you are nothing. 
You know.  If you do not have a Degree you are nothing.  
There are many people who make very important contributions in 
society without those formal qualifications but nevertheless I think what 
is important and you might wish to comment here is that it is important 
that the policies of an organisation that are put in place be followed … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  You are right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if the policies or regulations say for this position 
Matric is required … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  You right. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you stick to that.  Of course if you think that at a 
particular stage this policy does not serve the institution properly or 
these regulations do not serve the institution properly.  It maybe be that 
there is a reason to put - there is a case to put forward to say let us 
change it … 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 146 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it prevents us for example from giving - from 
appointing somebody who might not have a piece of paper written 
Matric … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But has a lot of experience that would be good for the 
organisation but then you say to do it the proper way you say well if 
there are generally more situations like that probably not to do it for an 
individual. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Right. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then you change it and then when you - when you 
invite applications if that is the kind of situation you are dealing with 
everybody knows what the rules are. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They know that if you do not have Matric but you 
have this prior experience and it is relevant you could be allowed.  You 
- you can apply … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you appoint somebody who does not have 
Matric in that situation you can justify it because you are not in breach 
20 
of your policy or regulations.  That - that I think that - that is where the 
difference might be.  I do not know if you want to say anything. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well I accept that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Chairperson … 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 147 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  But when appointing as Acting CEO 
we have to inform the Minister and get the concurrence.  So that 
happened.  It was approved by the Minister.  So we thought … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  We were doing something alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So - so there was concurrence from the Minister 
and … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The board thought then … 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Exact … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It should be fine? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Exactly or … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Otherwise he would never have been 
an Acting CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Of course the - the responsibility might be 
that before the board sends anything to the Minister - before it makes 
its decision it must satisfy itself. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That if we do - if we make this decision.  These 
decisions will - this decision will be in line with the regulations and the 
policies … 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if it will not be they must not even send it to the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 148 of 179 
 
Minister.  They must satisfy themselves.  Is it in accordance with the 
policies?  Is it in accordance with the regulations and the law? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That kind of thing because maybe when the Minister - 
when it comes to the Minister the Minister might also say oh the board 
has no problem.  I will defer to the board.  I think it must be fine.  So 
then everybody is - is not checking.  Everybody thinks the other one 
has checked.  It should - must be fine. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You understand where I - I am coming from? 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  I do very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Just to deal with 
that point that Dr Ngubane has made in response to your question 
Chair.  May I ask the witness to turn to SABC EXHIBIT CC32?  That is 
… 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  So U? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, it is - it is another bundle, yes.  You 
can close that one Dr Ngubane. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Okay. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  This is - I beg your pardon Chair.  Oh, I 
am told that this is your bundle.  I am sorry.  Could you just find 
whether there is a CC32 there?  Maybe … 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 149 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well there is one that has got his statement.  There is 
one that has got the Public Protector’s … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Report.  No Chair CC … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Report and there is one that has got the transcript of 
the Parliamentary Committee … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the best way to tell us what is - what is written on 
the spine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is - it is written SABC Reference Bundle 
Chair.  It is the - the referenced bundle. 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are - there are too many of these bundles now. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair.  32 - I think it is underneath 
that one.  Oh, yes.  That one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  SABC Reference Bundle. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Got it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you please turn to page 2-1-8 the 
red - there are two numbers there Chair?  Please ignore the one in ink 
and have a look at the one in red - 2-1-8.  Thank you.  This is a letter 
20 
confirming that Mr Hlaudi holds the title of Acting Chief Operations 
Officer and it is from Mr Thabiso Lesala dated 28 November 2011 but 
before that there is a page - page 2-1-9 precedes 2-1-8 but it follows in 
terms of the bundle.  The one dated 18 November 2011 is that your 
signature Dr Ngubane? 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 150 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  This is the - 2-1-9? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes 2-1-9. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is a sub delegation of authority. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Sorry.  Appointing of the Acting … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In 2-1-9? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  The - the letter is from … 
CHAIRPERSON:  On page 2-1-9 … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In red. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  The letter is from the Minister. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The red number. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, no, no.  In red.  2-1-9 in red is a 
(indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not the - not the … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Not the black one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not the handwritten one. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one typed to the right. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Oh, right. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So that - that is sub delegation of 
authority.  You - you were delegating that authority - am I right to 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 151 of 179 
 
Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is that correct? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then if you turnover to 
page 220.  You will find a letter written 15 November 2011 to 
Minister Dina Pule where you were advising her of the resolution of the 
board and the letter reads: 
“Appointment of the Acting Chief Operations Officer:  
pursuant to the authority given by Article 18 of the 
10 
SABC Articles of Association the resolution taken 
by the special board on 14 November 2011 in 
respect of the Acting Chief Operating Officer be 
implemented. 
 
One, 
the 
appointment 
of 
Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng as Acting Chief Operating 
Officer with effect from 18 November 2011 until 
such time that the Chief Operating Officer is 
appointed.  Two, the recruitment process for all 
vacancies at executive level particularly Group 
Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and 
20 
Chief Operations Officer be urgently commenced 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
Minister 
of 
Communications.  I hope you find the above in 
order and we await your further instructions on this 
matter.” 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 152 of 179 
 
Signed by you Dr Ngubane.  Is that correct? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is that correct?  Then the next page at 
page 221 is this the letter that you are referring to when you were 
answering the Chairperson?  It - it is written to you from the Ministry 
Communications - Dr Ben Ngubane and it says: 
“Dear Dr Ngubane, appointment of the Acting Chief 
Operations Officer:  the above mentioned matter 
refers.  I have noted the resolution taken by the 
Board 
of 
the 
SABC 
to 
appoint 
10 
Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng 
as 
the 
Acting 
Chief 
Operations Officer of the SABC.  I would like to 
advice that in terms of Article 19.2 of the Articles of 
Association of the SABC I hereby approve the 
appointment of Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng as the Chief 
Operations Officer of the corporation.  As a result 
of my approval I would like to advise you - to advise 
that you should proceed to implement the resolution 
of 
the 
special 
board 
meeting 
taken 
on 
14 November 2011.  I trust that you will find the 
20 
above in order.  Dated 28 November 2011.” 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is this the - the approval that you were 
referring to? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No.  There is a mistake. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 153 of 179 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  She says as the Chief Operations 
Officer of the corporation.  We were talking about an Acting COO. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh yes because the heading does say: 
“Appointment of Acting Chief Operations …” 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  “…Officer.” 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes but it is … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But you are quite correct then in - in the 
body of the letter … 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  She makes reference to Chief Operations 
Officer. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I think she made a mistake only in regard to 
that last line of the first of that paragraph.  Earlier on in the paragraph 
she does refer to Acting Chief … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Acting Chief. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Operations Officer. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair.  Thank you.  So - so that was 
the letter that you referred to.  Then before we move from that bundle I 
would like to just deal with some of the minutes - the board minutes 
that (intervenes). 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 154 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Sorry.  Are the minutes here? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  They are in there yes.  Thank you.  I will - 
I will just like to take you to some of the minutes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe while you are looking for … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The minutes I just ask another question.  Acting 
appointments at Group Executive level were they throughout your time 
always made on the basis of simply identifying the individual and 
appointing that individual to act or was there a different process that 
10 
was followed at - at some stage or in regard to other positions other 
than those of COO or Group Executive Stakeholder Relations? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Well apart from the three positions 
the Chief Executive Officer can appoint Acting Group Executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but what I’m asking is whether the process, 
whether there was a particular process that was followed which was 
different from simply the appointing authority identifying who the 
person is that will be appointed to act, in other words whether 
sometimes what would be done is to say let’s look at different names or 
invite some people who are prepared to be considered and then one 
20 
would be appointed or whether for acting appointments it was always 
the position that there was no particular process, the Board just 
appointed somebody to act in a particular position that it considered 
was suitable. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Chairperson the people who is 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 155 of 179 
 
appointed acting should be in the same position as the person who 
occupied, in other words ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  The vacant position. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Grade 5 or Grade 7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   They must be in the same position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Then the CEO will appoint and 
inform us that so and so is now acting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, so insofar as acting is concerned it was the 
10 
Group CEO who made the appointment. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then he would just inform the Board also. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes sir, apart from the three 
positions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh apart from the three positions. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For acting appointments in regard to the three 
positions it will be the Board that would make the decision. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   And reports to the Minister. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but in that case too there was no particular 
process, would the Board simply look at whoever they decide should 
they thought would be right then they would appoint the person, without 
circulating any notice or invitation internally to say we will be 
appointing an acting person, those who think they want to be 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 156 of 179 
 
considered should send their names or CV’s, there would be nothing 
like that for acting appointments. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   No Chairperson absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair.  I just want us to deal 
with the role that Mr Hlaudi was playing in one of the Board meetings, 
just to link up with your evidence earlier and I would like to direct your 
attention please to page 39 of that same exhibit, CC32, that same 
bundle that is in front of you. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Sorry, page? 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Page 39. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   39? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we on the same bundle? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   The same bundle Chair yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 39. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Three nine, yes that’s correct Chair. Sorry 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Sorry Chair, that – those are the minutes 
20 
of a special meeting, a Board meeting that was held on the 7 t h of 
February 2012 an that you were chairing Dr Ngubane, is that correct, 
according to that document? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   It is correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, and we Mr Motsoeneng was one of 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 157 of 179 
 
the persons that were in attendance, but I would just like to just raise 
something which is mentioned at page 11, I beg your pardon, at page 
49, 49, I was looking at the document itself, page 49. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Page? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Page 49, same document but on page 49. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Okay, right. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, then Mr – this is Acting COO and I 
believe that’s Mr Hlaudi according to the minutes, the third paragraph: 
“Agreed with Advocate Mhlase but stated that keeping the 
employee ....” 
10 
Or sorry, maybe I should read the earlier paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You must start earlier otherwise we don’t know what 
the was agreeing with ...(intervention)  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Then the context, it becomes context 
correct Chair.  Could you start from the second paragraph, the first one 
actually because I think it’s the same person. 
“She said that there was a need for an innovative solution 
taking into consideration her rights.  Advocate Mhlase  
informed the Board that the maximum payable under the 
CCMA’s twelve months.  She was of the view that it was easier 
20 
to pursue that route and the proposal by Mr Mutsepe other 
than make a payment of R4million plus which was excessive.  
Acting COO agreed with Advocate Mahlase but stated that 
keeping the employee would need to be budgeted for and that 
in turn around the interest of the company was paramount and 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 158 of 179 
 
the employees to be productive.  He stated that there was a 
need for radical and unpopular decisions to take the 
corporation forward.  He requested the Board to assist in 
placing Ms Mampane in government.” 
If one reads there without reading the full minute but the suggestion 
was that Ms Mampane could be placed on early retirement or 
transferred or redeployed to another government institution.   
 
But what I wanted to raise with you Dr Ngubane I know that 
you had said Mr Hlaudi could participate but didn’t have voting rights, 
but would you say that he was doing more than just being of help, he is 
10 
now making suggestions about people being placed in government. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   No Chairperson let me clarify, that 
non-participation in terms of voting was when he was ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Stakeholder manager. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   ...communications. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Now he is Acting COO, he is now 
part of the three Group Executive members of the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who were entitled to ...(intervention)  
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   He was entitled ...(intervention)  
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   He was a member ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  He was for all intents and purposes an acting member 
of the Board. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 159 of 179 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay and therefore he could participate fully? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Okay thank you, then my question then 
falls away, because I was under the impression that we are moving 
under the same part, but then these minutes as you will see Dr 
Ngubane that have been placed here they are the minutes of the Board, 
but they deal with various issues, and I would not take you through 
them, save that I would like you to comment on one aspect which you 
10 
deal with in your statement, the issue of encryption. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And just advise the Chair what was the 
attitude of the Board insofar as that encryption issue was concerned. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Ja, Chairperson the issue of 
encryption had been a ball that has been kicked around a lot at SABC.  
It has gone to the Supreme Court, I think even Constitutional Court.  
When I wrote this remark in my statement it applied to a discussion 
after the – I think the High Court or Constitutional Court had ruled that 
this matter should be settled by broadcasters, and not involve 
20 
politicians.  So that opened a whole lot of discussion around the issue 
of encryption.   
 
There was a strong view that encryption makes access to 
broadcasting material for the people conditionally, that the SABC Act 
stipulates that there must be universal access to any broadcast, but 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 160 of 179 
 
done by the Public Broadcaster. 
 
Now the encryption will mean that some people could switch 
off members of the public and not have – therefore contravene the full 
access requirement, that was the type of discussion that was 
happening, it was not decisive, but the majority view tended to be to a 
large extent that let’s not create any obstacle for people who don’t 
have subscription DSTV or whatever other subscription channel can be 
switched off and not have access. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, and if you – to go back to your 
statement now, if you could just close the file in front of you and we go 
10 
back to EXHIBIT 24, we left off in the morning where at page 13 
...(intervention)  
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Sorry that is the other file? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, where you have your statement 
document on. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Sorry what is the number? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Page 13. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Sorry you will have to go back to divider 
number 22, if that is the ...(intervention)  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you reached your statement, are you at your 
statement? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay ...(intervention)  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Oh, oh. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 161 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then page 13. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Page 13, thank you.  You dealt there, you 
are dealing there MultiChoice agreement on 24 hour channel, could you 
just summarise your evidence in those paragraphs and what is it that 
you wanted to convey to the Chairperson there? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Chairperson NCA – I’m sorry, eNCA 
was becoming a very powerful competitor for the SABC, so there was a 
lot of discussion as to how the SABC can host or provide a 24 hour 
news channel.  You know ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words to compete with them? 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   To compete with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   The news people through the head 
of news examined this issue, even suggested that we would take SABC 
3 and make it into a 24 hour news channel, but they needed partners, 
so Mr Olivier and Hlaudi Motsoeneng even went to India to try and and 
find a partner who could help them turn SABC3 into a 24 hour news 
channel.  They even went to London, I think they spoke to ITV on this 
issue.   
 
When they came back and reference was made to ICASA, 
20 
ICASA said there is no way SABC3 could be turned into a 24 hour news 
channel because the license conditions are that it is a commercial 
channel, it is even accounted for separately from the public 
broadcaster, which is SABC1 and 2, so that brought an end to that 
discussion. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 162 of 179 
 
 
But then the Minister of Communications, because the 
Portfolio Committee was very keen that we move on with the 24 hour 
news channel called me and Ms Mkobo to a meeting and said 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  And that was still General Nyanda, the Minister 
...(intervention)  
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   No, no Minister Bule. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Bule, okay. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes.  We went to a meeting, we 
were told that it is important that we talk to MultiChoice because that is 
10 
the only remaining alternative.  So we started discussions with 
MultiChoice, we progressed the discussions very significantly, until we 
wrote, I am not sure whether it was a contract or an MOU, but we did 
sign a document that MultiChoice will host the SABC on DSTV as 24 
hour news. 
 
That seemed to fulfil the requirement that we have a 24 hour 
news channel.   However the problem came when it came to how 
MultiChoice will pay for the SABC on their DSTV bouquet.  They said 
they will pay R50million the first year, R40million the second year, 
R30million the third year, R2million the fourth year, R1million etcetera, 
20 
it was – and then there will be nothing payable to SABC after that.  
That broke the discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was still MultiChoice? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That was still MultiChoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that after the signing of some document that you 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 163 of 179 
 
talked about before? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes I am not sure it was a contract 
or an MOU. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   But we had signed the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had already signed. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   But then the issue of money, of 
payment, came in.  There was another grouse on the side of the SABC, 
10 
that they must carry regulations which are included in the Broadcasting 
Act, stipulate that any subscription provider who has thirty bequests or 
so must carry SABC1 and SABC2 but they do this free of charge 
without paying any money to the SABC.  This was a sore point for 
SABC in that they benefit from audience ratings, they get advertisement 
out of the content produced by SABC, they just cream off the work of 
SABC.   
 
Now to add now to this fact that MultiChoice only would pay 
R50million initially and end up paying nothing for the 24 hour news 
channel broke the conversation, that is how I left it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when you left there was an MOU or contract that 
had been signed but there were discussions that had not been 
finalised. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 164 of 179 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, thank you.  Dr Ngubane just to – you 
would have noticed that the bundle the reference bundle contained 
several media clippings. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes that relates to you and I am sure you 
have read the criticism about Mr Motsoeneng’s acting position, just to 
conclude that point, you are aware of the media clippings at the time? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Well I am aware of many things that 
the media says. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. So I don’t – you don’t, or unless you 
10 
wish me to take you through all or to some of them but generally the 
criticism generally is about the appointment of Mr Motsoeneng largely. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Well as I have stated everything was 
done in good faith on the assumption that it helps the SABC.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you, and then lastly – or not lastly, 
sorry before we get to your general comments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe because you said you were rounding off a 
point maybe let me say this and then Dr Ngubane you can just indicate 
if you – my understanding is correct.  My understanding now is that 
your – my understanding is that you are saying the appointment of Mr 
20 
Motsoeneng to the position of Acting COO, maybe starting with Acting 
Corporate Executive for Stakeholder Relations and his appointment as 
Acting COO may have been or was in breach of the requirements 
because he did not have matric, that we accept, but we acted in good 
faith, we thought that the circumstances which prevailed justified that 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159

we appointment him nevertheless, is my understanding correct of what 
...(intervention)  
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   It is correct sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chairman.  I am just going to 
read to you Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng has submitted a statement to the 
Commission, but I would like to read a paragraph that relates to you 
and ask for your comment, because when, by the time it comes to 
testify you will probably not be here, but it is paragraph – he says at 
paragraph 57, if I may just read: 
10 
“All SABC Board Chairpersons, Dr Ngubane, Prof Maguve, and 
Ms L M Tshabalala were given a mandate to get rid of me as I 
was a stumbling block for the Board members who wanted to 
“eat”.” 
Do you have any comment to that? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   No.  Well this is now taking me by 
surprise, there was no mandate given to me to get rid of Mr 
Motsoeneng.  Mr Motsoeneng raised some issues as Acting COO about 
some Board members who were wanting to get into a Siemens contract, 
he raised it sharply with the Board, and that process was stopped.  
20 
That is the only -  but that did not lead to any of us being given a 
mandate to fire him.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, and who would have given – if there 
was a mandate who would have given a mandate to you, do you know? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Well it must be someone higher than 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 166 of 179 
 
us, because I wouldn’t have ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  You can’t get your mandate from somebody below 
you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Certainly not. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you.  And then in paragraph, if you 
go back to your statement now, in paragraph 62 of your statement you 
make general comments, could you just make those comments, tell the 
Chairperson what you are saying in that paragraph? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Sorry, this 56? 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   That is 62, at page 14 of your statement. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   62? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Well because of the turnaround 
project the Board tended to be probably too involved in terms of the 
conditions of the government guarantee the Board had to ensure that 
all predetermined objectives such as austerity measures were timeously 
attended, this meant close monitoring and supervision of management 
in implementing the turnaround measures. 
 
What I did not say here was that Board members felt 
20 
compelled to be very closely involved with the turnaround, because 
there was this lack of trust between the Board and senior management.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you.  And then lastly Dr 
Ngubane at the time when you were the Chairperson of the SABC Board 
did you have any business interests, or companies that did business 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 167 of 179 
 
with the SABC and if so which companies and at what level? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   No we did not have a company in 
the broadcasting sector at all. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And none of your family members did any 
business with SABC? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   No, not a single one of them, I mean 
unless they act in Generations or something like that, which I may not 
know about, but there was no one doing business with SABC. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, thank you very much Chair, that is 
the evidence. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  I think I would like us to go back to Mr 
Motsoeneng.  You did say that the SABC had had certain people do 
certain jobs and they had failed and that is people who may have had 
matric and above, and Mr Motsoeneng seemed to be able to be 
effective you know without those qualifications.  Now in this regard I 
take it that you were talking about the position the job he had to do as 
stakeholder relations manager, and as Group Executive for Stakeholder 
Relations, is that right? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, now you did say that the jump from stakeholder 
20 
relations manager to Group Executive Stakeholder Relations was quite 
a significant jump, and your – for the acting appointment no other 
people were asked to make themselves available because that’s how 
acting appointments were made. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes sir. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 168 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but you did say for the permanent appointment to 
that position the position was advertised, is that right, for the position 
of Group Executive for stakeholder relations, that position was 
advertised for permanent appointment. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and do you remember what requirements were 
put for the advert for that position, do you require – do you remember 
in terms of requirements for educational qualifications or is that 
something you can’t remember. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Well that is the adverts that I was 
10 
given to read. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that one was for COO, I may be mistaken, I 
thought it was for Acting COO. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   It was for COO position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   For a permanent position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But I am now talking about not permanent for 
COO, I’m talking for permanent Group Executive for Stakeholder 
Relations, because I understood you earlier on, and you can just tell 
me me if I misunderstood, I understood you to say the Board appointed 
20 
Mr Motsoeneng as Acting Group Executive for Stakeholder Relations, 
but that later on there was an advert for a permanent position into – for 
that – a permanent appointment for that position, did I misunderstand? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   No, when he was stakeholder 
manager in the office of the CEO. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 169 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   He was then asked to be also 
communication person for the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   When he became Acting COO he did 
not do those jobs anymore. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   He was an Executive Member of the 
Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   So there was no connection between 
him being stakeholder manager in the CEO’s office and being Acting 
COO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Those two were still before the COO 
Acting stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I thought that he went through four stages, or 
three stages while you were there, I think the fourth stage namely a 
permanent appointment as COO happened when you were no longer 
there. 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought that you said while you were there, there 
were three positions to which he was appointed. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One was where he was appointed by the Group Chief 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 170 of 179 
 
Executive Officer as Manager for Stakeholder Relations. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the second was where he was appointed as 
initially Group Executive for Stakeholder Relations. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that later he was appointed as Acting COO. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I thought those were the three positions, but now I 
am talking about the middle one, and when I say middle it doesn’t 
necessarily it’s below another one, I am talking about the Group 
10 
Executive for Stakeholder Relations. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought that your evidence was that initially he was 
appointed in an acting capacity to that position. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that later on that position was advertised for 
permanent appointment. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Am I right in that – understanding that? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   We were not involved in that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were not involved in that? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, for Group Executive? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but it – there was an advertisement for that 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 171 of 179 
 
post for permanent appointment as far as you know. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Well there should have  been 
because it was now a vacated position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, okay but you were not involved in that. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   I was not involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Board was not involved? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I thought that all Group Executive appointments 
were made by the Board. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   No the three, CEO, CFO, COO. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   But the others are made by the CEO 
but reports to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, okay, so to the extent that he may have 
been appointed as permanently as Group Executive for Stakeholder 
Relations. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That appointment would not have been made by the 
Board. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   No. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would have been made by the Group CEO. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That’s right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, alright.  It’s only at the level of Acting COO 
that the Board got involved with regard to him? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Absolutely, and informed the 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 172 of 179 
 
Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And informed the Minister, just for Acting. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when it came to the permanent appointment his 
permanent appointment to that position you had left? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Okay so – so  
1. In terms of the board appointing him as an acting COO insofar as 
you did not consider other people you – your position was that 
for acting appointment as a practice to any of those positions 
10 
advertisements were not made for acting appointments? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Even internally? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the board would just have a look at people and 
identify a person that it thought was suitable and as long as that 
person was already employed at the same level. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then is could appoint? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  So – so the one for Group Executive was 
it at the same level as COO? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  No that is higher. 
CHAIRPERSON:  COO is higher? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 173 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So – so – so where you seek an acting 
appointment for COO does this require – did this requirement that the 
person must be on the same level apply or did it not apply?  You 
indicated earlier on that when you are going to appoint somebody as an 
act – in an acting capacity. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Although you do not advertise. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the person you appoint must be on the same 
level? 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Must be at the Group level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Must be at the Group level. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But Group level is not everybody on the same level?  
There are different levels to the Group level. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right.  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he was at Group level even though not at COO 
level? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you were then entitled to – he was one of the 
20 
people you were entitled to look at? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Okay.  And then of course you – you 
accept that for that position that position required qualifications that he 
did not have but you say that you took the view as the board that 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 174 of 179 
 
having regard to what had happened before and having regard to what 
– to his performance in the previous positions you thought that you 
should appoint him? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and the difference I think you did say I am just 
refreshing my memory.  The difference between the level at Group 
Executive for Stakeholder Relations and COO was also significant? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  And again coming back to his skills.  You 
said earlier on what he had was people’s skills or people skills, 
10 
people’s skills which I have – I understand to be he was good with 
dealing with people, is that right?  Is there anything else? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  In my time Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  During your time? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But was there anything else that you thought he was 
he stood out – was outstanding about him in terms of the performance 
of the job other than being good with people? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  He knew the SABC backwards.  He 
knew exactly who was doing what.  What system was being overridden? 
20 
How false commissions were being generated.  He knew a lot.  So he 
was very valuable to us to stop money flowing from the SABC illegally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and of course as far as the permanent 
appointment is concerned you were not there so therefore you cannot 
say anything – you cannot answer for when he was appointed 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 175 of 179 
 
permanently? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know who else was available and so on? 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Anything arising? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is all Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Except that Chair maybe just to – the 
10 
questions that you asked the witness now they are – about his 
progression and the career history. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Appears at page 217. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Of Exhibit CC32. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you very much Doctor Ngubane.  It may be 
that we might ask you to come back. 
20 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I have no doubt you will come back if we ask you 
to come back.  But thank you very much for coming to give evidence 
and to share your knowledge of what happened at SABC with the 
commission. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 176 of 179 
 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Can my legal representative have a 
record of this? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes he can have it – he can have it.  There 
should be no problem at all.  He will talk to the legal team.  There 
should be no problem. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much you are excused.   
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  Thank you very much. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair may I have just a five 
minute adjournment just for change.  We are having another witness 
and also he has slides. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And some things to demonstrate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Such as – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Five minutes or ten? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No ten will also be good Chair.  The only 
20 
challenge I have Chair today is that we – I was – I am not going to ask 
Chair to proceed beyond four o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The reason being that there is a witness 
that we have to meet with now we said he must come at four o’clock. 
09 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 159 
 
Page 177 of 179 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is the challenge I have Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But we are in your hands Chair.  If you 
feel that maybe we should adjourn for the day because it is already 
twenty to four and resume tomorrow morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you say you – the next witness should take how 
long in terms of the evidence? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  He is long Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  He is long. 
10 
DR BALDWIN SIPHO NGUBANE:  He deals with the DTT and he is 
going to demonstrate how it works and he is going to be along witness 
and I would not want to rush him Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe we should then – but you say he is not 
available after four or you are… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I am – the team is not available Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The team is not available. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We have a witness that we have arranged 
20 
to meet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you have a witness to… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay maybe we should adjourn now.

CHAIRPERSON:  And then do it for ten minutes and then break. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and if we start tomorrow is how long do you 
think he might – the whole day or… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, no Chair he will not take the whole 
day.  Maybe two and half hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe two and half hours. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am trying to see whether there is a need to start 
early tomorrow or not. We do not need to start early if we will be fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I think we will be fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We should be fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes because I have only – there was only 
witness for tomorrow.
