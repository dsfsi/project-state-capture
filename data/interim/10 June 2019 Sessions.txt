PROCEEDINGS ON 10 JUNE 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Mokoena, good morning everybody. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Good morning Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Are you ready to proceed? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We are ready to proceed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Mr Mazibuko the oath you took last week 
continues until you have finished your evidence. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Noted Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Mazibuko before we proceed where 
10 
we left off on Friday I would like you to please recap for us some of the 
crucial aspects of your evidence that you conveyed to the Chair but in 
a summary form?  Let us do that with reference to page 16 and please 
capture for us the essence of paragraph 36 and 37 of your witness 
statement?  Page 36 – page 16 Chair paragraph 36 and 37. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  16. 
CHAIRPERSON:  16. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You may proceed simply to you know 
give us the essence. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Of what you are conveying to the Chair. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Ja. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 3 of 223 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  In those paragraphs. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Thanks Chair.  Just to recap.  During 
the period of 21 to 28 May 2015 Homix had effected 13 cross border 
foreign exchange transactions via Mercantile with an aggregate value 
of some 51.8 million at the relevant time and details of these cross 
border exchange transaction records are set out in the spreadsheet 
annexed marked as SEM7.  We went thought this.  I do not know 
whether the Chairperson would like me to go back. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  No, no you have already done that I just 
want you to… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Just give us the summary high level. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Ja.  So I must say that these for the 
21 to 28 were able to go through unfortunately with Mercantile Bank 
because as I alluded to that the banks are the first line of defence.  
You know when you talk about money laundering sometimes you know 
that is why there needs to be vigilant because they talk about the first 
part if placement and its layering and then we talk about integration.  
Once you have placed so when somebody tries to place a fraudulent 
transaction of some sort and it is not picked up right at the beginning 
20 
then the next step it will be layering.  You will see when we are looking 
at other accounts of Homix in – at Standard Bank at a later stage so…   
And then they tried because I think they were successful and then they 
tried on the 29 t h to push another three transactions over the 13 that 
they have already done.  It is only then when Mercantile referred the 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 4 of 223 
 
transaction to the South African Reserve Bank and the South African 
Reserve Bank blocked those transactions which three of them came to 
an amount of 4.4 million approximately and they were prevented from 
doing that. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  And then from there the process of 
investigation started as to what was going on. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes, yes.  And I think you also capture 
that essence if you refer to page 17 Chair I am referring the witness to 
page 17 and also capture for us you know at high level what you are 
10 
stating on paragraph 42? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  So in paragraph 42 is the movement’s 
reference number where I just explain that it is the number that is 
generated by SARS.  You know it is a SARS custom declaration so 
when a customer declares the goods and wants to claim the goods 
there has to be what is called a movement’s reference number.  So this 
number can also be generated by agents you know for importers and 
exporters you know in terms of their electronic data interchange 
information system that they use amongst themselves.  And amongst us 
and the banks being the Reserve Bank we use what is called the import 
20 
verification system where we can track.  So this is like an ID number of 
a transaction. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Where you have done the import that 
to track it you know you have to have – so that is why we talk about the 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 5 of 223 
 
validation that in addition to the three movement reference numbers 
who were supplied by Homix to justify the 16 transactions while they 
were seen to be valid but the goods that were cleared at the ports at 
that particular time for a payment of 51.8 million they did not match 
what was paid out of the country which was 51.8.  So the goods that 
were cleared were only R50 000.00. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And then lastly in a way of simply 
reminding ourselves of your evidence on Friday may I refer you to page 
19 paragraph 53. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. So paragraph 53 there we show 
10 
two documents which on the face of it they look very different. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think when you say 53 it is like it is 5.3. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Okay 53. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph 53. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  53 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Page 19 paragraph 53. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  53 yes.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Apologies Chairman it is 53.  So it 
20 
was SEM14 and SEM12 where the SEM12 was the mirror image of 
SEM14.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  They did not look the same on the 
face value especially when it goes to the top but in the middle there 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 6 of 223 
 
were some information that looks very similar however we discovered 
that some information when it came to the mass of the goods to be 
imported the value and the total amount differed quite drastically.  So – 
and the SEM14 was the authentic document that was supplied by 
Thuthuka Sizwe just to prove that how it will look like if they have done 
the transaction. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  In an authentic manner and the one 
that led to the leakage in terms of the money that went illegally outside 
was SEM12 with some particulars that are similar to the one with 
10 
SEM14 but with some vast differences here and there. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And after interrogating SEM12 and 
SEM14 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And taking the Chair through the various 
discrepancies you then conclude on paragraph 53 the last line you say 
that: 
“It follows that on a balance of probabilities the ETI releases provided 
by Mercantile – to Mercantile by Homix were falsified.” 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So – and those are the conclusions that 
you arrived at? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  After that analysis? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 7 of 223 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  They were falsified.  As I say that 
normally falsification of document goes with the trade base money 
laundering that there is an intention here to use a transaction that was 
– that will look legitimate on the face of it but knowing that the 
underlying actions underneath is to hide some nefarious activities that 
are taking place. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Alright.  Now let us proceed with your 
evidence today and deal with those aspects which you never dealt with 
on Friday.  May I do so with reference to page 21 of your statement 
10 
whereby you are linking two other entities to Homix transactions, can 
you please tell us more about those entities and how they were linked 
to Homix transactions? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes thanks Chair.  If I may start at 
paragraph 59 where we refer to entities that were under investigation 
by the Financial Surveillance Department being Viper Wholesales and 
FGC Commodities and in this regard it – Morningstar – Morningstar was 
one of the companies that was registered in Hong Kong that I alluded 
on Friday that got most of the money.  Remember that the money that 
flew the 51.8 million 16 transactions the intention was 14 was supposed 
20 
to go to Morningstar and 2 were supposed to go to YKA. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  And what is you know significant here 
is that Morningstar, Viper and FGC Commodities share the same sole 
director being Mr Mahashveran Govender.  So we just want to highlight 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 8 of 223 
 
that because I think on Friday the Chair raised some you know 
eyebrows when I talk about that.  Most of these companies they have 
sole directors of which there is nothing wrong with that but it is a 
common thread as to why – I do not know why because we did then 
when you look at paragraph 60 and ICRIS CSC Hong Kong companies 
registration search which revealed that Mr Govender was the sole 
director of Morningstar. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Hm. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  And one of the beneficiaries to whom 
Homix had transferred funds abroad and then we have a copy of the 
10 
search results in terms of Annexure SEM16 in that regard. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Did they conduct any genuine business 
these companies?  Do you know why these monies were paid to them 
from Homix? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  There is – as we alluded to on Friday 
that there is no – there is not much online presence for these 
companies so even the ones that you know you will see when we start 
to look at the Standard Bank account.  There is little or no online 
presence for somebody to get so much money so quickly and when you 
go there because even now you can try and do the search but there is 
20 
so much little presence for this company.  So it seems like they were 
registered you know at that particular time and then taken off maybe 
after the money has gone through. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now before you move on to – I 
want to take you to paragraph 63.  Are there any aspects of your 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 9 of 223 
 
evidence Mr Mazibuko which you might seek to clarify what you 
conveyed to the Chair.  Is there anything that you want to clarify? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Ja so what I need to clarify is that 
with the issue of forfeiture of transactions.  So when like Homix we 
started the investigation at that particular time for each and every 
alleged perpetrator you know you will be given three years that you 
know the investigation after the blockage of money the investigations 
starts and then what follows then will be the Audi Alteram Principle in 
terms of you actually being requested certain information to make sure 
that we hear your side in terms of actually how the transaction took 
10 
place so that you know you are not disadvantaged that we just take a 
decision without – so then you are supposed to come back to us with a 
full frank and verifiable disclosure.  It you do not do that obviously the 
matter will proceed.  But the matter they do not just follow in a 
sequence in the department that once we start because there is a – 
there are hundreds of these investigations that are taking place so you 
find that you know we got so much few investigators they are working 
on this, working on that but what they should just be guarding against 
is that three years since the blockage should not lapse because if it 
lapses we should actually unblock the money and send it back to the – 
20 
but it does not happen because we keep some reminder cards that 
actually.  But then after the forfeiture you know we used to have a 90 
day review that you can actually take us on review for that but then 
when the promotion of Administrative Justice Act came into being we 
aligned that and we made it 180 days. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 10 of 223 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Oh yes now it is clarified yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And in paragraph 63 you refer to further 
4 transactions. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Which were effected by to Morningstar 
please you know can you elaborate to the Chair about those 
transactions. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes then on paragraph 63 during 2016 
after we intervened in the Homix matter a further four transactions were 
10 
effected to Morningstar by four private individuals investing in 
Morningstar and then we like instituted an investigation into these 
transactions that revealed false documentation was presented to the 
relevant bank in support of these transactions and that Mr Sheldon 
Jack 
Breedt 
had 
played 
a 
pivotal 
role 
in 
supplying 
those 
documentations.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now were these transactions in addition 
to the 16 that you have already…? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes these were… 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Told the Chair about. 
20 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Even after the 16 transaction. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  There were further ones that they 
wanted to effect? 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 11 of 223 
 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  There were further ones.  So here the 
difference is that this is not a company but it is individuals that are 
saying they are investing. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  As I said that you can invest one 
individual you can invest abroad and all that but they had falsified 
documentation at their disposal in terms of – so it was discovered and 
we did – the department actually took the matter to investigate and 
then we tried and blocked their accounts. But we found that 
unfortunately some of the people that were involved here were involved 
10 
in other criminal activities of murder where Mr Mathew Breedt and his 
brother actually were arrested.  So that actually delayed the process to 
finalise the matter because as I said that then the process of actually 
hearing the other side these guys are in jail and all that.  But the 
matter we will have to make sure that we monitor both the criminal 
process but our time as well as I alluded to that the three years does 
not lapse so that the money that has been blocked does not go back to 
the perpetrators. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  You conclude on this topic Mr 
Mazibuko on paragraph 65 to 66 could you please tell the Chair then 
20 
what happened to – whether the Department took any other steps 
pertaining to these transactions and entities or individuals? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes Chair.  So there we just 
highlighting that the transaction involving Mr Govender – remember he 
is the sole director of Viper, FGC Commodities, Morningstar so – and 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 12 of 223 
 
we just highlight that FGC Commodities and Viper also formed the 
subject of a previous report to the directorate for priority crime 
investigation – the Hawks of South African Police Service during 
November.  So you can see that the shenanigans that are involved here 
that these are not clean companies that besides the matters that are 
involved in the Homix case there have been other cases where these 
companies under the directorship of Mr Govender we have reported 
them to the police. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. But I mean the date here and I am 
posing this question in the light of the concerns of the Chair. 
10 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Pertaining to whether or not there is any 
activities being done in relation to this reported cases you know to the 
respective law enforcement?  I mean here you are saying it was 
reported around November 2015? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Do you know as to what transpired from 
2015 up until now in relation to those reported cases? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  So we have a challenge with the 
police in this regard in terms of pursuing these cases.  I think I do not 
20 
know whether it is because of the resources at their disposal and when 
we go to Parliament because from time to time we go to Parliament to 
actually account as various agencies in terms of illicit financial flows. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  We do report these cases.  I think the 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 13 of 223 
 
last number of cases that we had reported to the police were 64. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  64? 
MR 
SHIWA 
ELIJAH 
MAZIBUKO: 
 
Involving 
exchange 
control, 
contraventions but nothing at that particular time had taken place.  But 
I must say then after one of the sessions in Parliament – you know 
because I think the issue of collaboration and working together was a 
little bit far apart because – for it – and we were working in silos I think 
and we were very much encouraged to work together so that – because 
these type of work is like really that you find a number of people are 
carrying a stick to the finish line and then if somebody drops the stick 
10 
you not going to reach the finish line.  So if we deal with the case as 
financial surveillance and somebody does not take it to the end and we 
give it to you and then we say take it further and you do not it is not 
going to – so that is a disadvantage it is just one of the cases that – 
and we have raised this concern with the previous directorate and we 
hope in future because now we are always reporting back to Parliament 
on a bi-monthly – on an annual basis that we will try and encourage the 
police to work on these cases.  As I said that I do not know why 
whether because I am not on their side I am on the side of the bank 
this side we just do our job to report to them.  But I must also say that 
20 
there is an inter-urgency working group that has been established 
between ourselves, FIC, the NPA and we have taken about 8 cases we 
are trying to drive those cases.  So we have picked out of these cases 
that were not moving. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Hm. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 14 of 223 
 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  I am not so sure whether this one is 
one of them but we are trying to actually take action on them and push 
them through so that they can go to court and be finalised.  So there is 
some action amongst ourselves that after you know some dilly dallying 
the past and working in silos we are now trying to collaborate in 
working together so that we can push these cases.  Because you 
cannot work alone as I said that we finish with certain cases especially 
where there is some justification to report them to the police, we report 
it to them but you need to make sure that they also push the cases 
through. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you talk about 64 cases that you have referred 
to the police. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are those cases cases that were referred to the 
Hawks as such or referred to SAPS or referred to different units or 
branches of the police? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  They are reported to the NPA Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the NPA? 
20 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh not the police? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  No I might not be sure in terms of the 
structure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or both yes. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 15 of 223 
 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the NPA prosecutes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The police investigate. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when they have finished investigating they submit 
the docket to the NPA.  The NPA looks at the statements and the 
evidence collected and they decide whether there is a case to take to 
court or not.  Do you know which ones you would have taken? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  So it will be the police because you 
10 
have got police case numbers here that we have that is reported that 
you know you will see that in some of the [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it would be the police? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  It will be the police.  But at some 
stage then it should be escalated for prosecution to the NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja after they have investigated. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when you – I would – Ja you must be reporting 
them to the police. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because they need to be investigated before they go 
to the NPA and – but once you have reported them to the police with or 
without a task team which involves all of these agencies the police 
must keep you informed of what they are doing.  They should – if you 
have reported the case and they investigate they must be able to come 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 16 of 223 
 
back and say this is what is happening about that case.  Have they not 
been doing that? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  As I alluded to Chairperson that in the 
past we worked with - you know within our silos you know because 
people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but that is what I am dealing with I am saying it 
does not matter whether you work in silos or not if you have referred a 
case to the police. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One they have a duty to inform you about the 
10 
progress. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know because you have a special task which you 
are performing and you want to see to it that people who have 
contravened exchange control regulations are dealt with where those 
their conduct seems to you to constitute crimes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So my question is whether they have been reporting 
back to you or not on their progress? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  As of late as I have alluded to that we 
20 
– after going to Parliament because I think it is where we were highly 
criticised by [indistinct] that we work in silos and then we formed what 
is called an inter-urgency working group and then we started to take 8 
cases you know amongst ourselves that we think that we can start to 
drive now – so the process… 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 17 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That I understand Mr Mazibuko you have told me that. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  My question is, have they not been reporting back to 
you?  Has the police not been reporting back to you? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  No they have not been reporting back 
to us Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then – this has been for how long as far as you 
know? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  It goes back to the number of years.  I 
am not sure as to… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whenever you have reported them. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Because the 64 cases were not 
reported in one year so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  So [indistinct].. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Over a certain period. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Ja so… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you would say you might not be exact but you will 
say the earliest of those 64 cases would have been reported around 
about which year? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Let us take – let us say maybe five 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 18 of 223 
 
years ago let me use that as an example. 
CHAIRPERSON:  More or less five years ago? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes more or less five years ago. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see I am concerned about that and I should be 
concerned about that because one of the – one of the concerns or 
allegations that are made in relation to state capture is that law 
enforcement agencies have also been captured.   
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Hm.  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And cases that they should have investigated were 
not investigated because of corruption.  And so that is part of the 
reason why I am interested in why so many cases you reported so many 
cases to the police and they have never come back to you to say what 
is happening.. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  I just need to add that we did write to 
the head of the – previous head of the NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Just to ask as to what is happening to 
64 cases. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  But we never got any response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  In that regard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I – am I right that you are – you are not sure of 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 19 of 223 
 
the role of the NPA and the police. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:    You … 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You saying NPA sometimes you saying the police. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  But we wrote to them there I am sure 
that we wrote to the head of the NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To then NPA? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  About the 64 cases that is why I can –  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Because I think in most cases when 
we are in Parliament on – alongside us we are with the NPA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. Not with the [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not with the police. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  So that is why maybe my  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Confusion gets you know mixed up 
there because in most cases we deal with the NPA people {indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Maybe you could go back when you go back and 
20 
just check properly and because it may be important to establish why 
there has been no action if he position is that there has been no action 
and so on.  But from your side I was still going to say from your side it 
might not be enough also to just report and leave it to them to do that.  
Because this is your area you know exchange control regulations and 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 20 of 223 
 
you should follow up to say what is happening because you do not want 
people who have contravened exchange control regulations who you 
think should be prosecuted to just go scot free and nothing happens. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because that weakens your own area where you have 
an obligation to enforce exchange control regulations.  And people do 
contravene these and you refer them to either the police or the NPA 
and nothing happens it undermines the control exchange control 
regulations and it undermines the South African Reserve Banks fight 
against among other corruption. 
10 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Noted Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Because we used most because I do 
not think – as I – I do not want to go back because as I said we work in 
silos but when we were – when we were in Parliament where we are 
facing you know the committees. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  It is where we tell the truth.  As I said 
we go there almost bi-annually to committees. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  When we deal with illicit financial 
frauds. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  And then we will make a presentation 
every six months to say these are the – and they will be there. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 21 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  And the Chairperson will ask them to 
say what it is not open – but as you alluded to state capture because 
this has been asked to say why there is  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  And inaction they could not come up 
with an answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A explanation. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Some of them in Parliament if you can 
even go back. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  They were – they just alluded to be 
scared you know.  They cannot do this for whatever reasons 
whatsoever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They said they were scared some of them? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  From their superiors.  You know there 
were some times when somebody could not answer to say he needs to 
first to phone the superiors in Pretoria that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that so? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Ja that – before he could answer that 
20 
question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  So that is the difficulty that you find 
that at that particular time. Maybe things are going to change now 
whatsoever but if they could not answer in front of the committee 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 22 of 223 
 
chairpersons 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Where we thought that you know it is 
like taking your sibling to the parent to say now you are going to tell 
the truth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Because you have been – I have been 
trying to get it out of you.  So we are here now tell the truth but it still 
does not come out.  You hear these promises so there have been these 
promises but as I said that I think the 8 cases that are there will be the 
10 
test cases and I think it is a drop in an ocean after 64 cases that have 
been there over the years that you are starting with 8 cases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  That it is a drop in the ocean.  But 
was a push from Parliament that says we need to do something and 
work together. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Well now that is useful information.   One of the 
things that I am going to do is establish a special task team to look at 
issues of how Parliament exercised oversight over the years in regard 
to issues of state capture and corruption.  So part of what you are 
20 
saying would fall under that because it may well be that as I have said 
a few times over – since last date it may well be that if Parliament had 
played its oversight role some of the challenges may have been dealt 
with early.  So it is important to have a look and to see where there 
may have been failures on the part of Parliament, on the part of 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 23 of 223 
 
Portfolio Committees and see what would need to be done for the 
future.  What measure would need to be done – taken to make sure that 
if similar things come up in the future Parliament would play its role 
and maybe stop some things from progressing too far.  So the 
information you tell – you are telling me is quite important that you 
know your division has been going to Parliament and raising these 
issues and sometimes the people from – whether the NPA or other law 
enforcement agency could not or so – you know give explanations 
because one of the things is when a Portfolio Committee is exercising 
its oversight and people cannot give explanations there must be 
10 
something to do about it.  It cannot just be left like that.   
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  So it is true Chairperson.  I just want 
to say that we have been going - the Parliament in terms of its 
programs as I say that for the past four years we have been going there 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  By (indistinct) but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  It is in terms of your alluding to in 
terms of the action because I think they will come hard on any agencies 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  That - and they have come hard on us 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 24 of 223 
 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Working in silos (?) … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  That you know they need to see some 
progress … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  And I said one day when we were in 
Parliament that we are all in - in Pretoria most of us are here in 
Pretoria … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  But we have to go to Parliament to be 
told not to work in silos and all that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  And nothing much was happening in 
terms of the push to make sure that maybe with the previous 
submission … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  You know to the Portfolio Committee 
there is much progress.  We will go and find that some of the issues 
20 
like … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  The cases we are having are still 
static at 64.  Nothing has gone through but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 25 of 223 
 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Nothing will happen to the police or 
any … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Any change whatsoever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes … 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it may well be that some of the bodies or 
agencies over whom various Portfolio Committees of Parliament are 
supposed to exercise oversight maybe they do know that in the end 
nothing will happen.  They will ask you questions and you can just give 
10 
them whatever answer and nothing will happen in the end and … 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  That is why … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is why they do not care.  You know they do not 
fear.  They do not think there will be consequences if they are – if they 
have no explanation for not doing their job.  Maybe that is part of the 
problem and one would need to look at whether or not there is a 
capacity problem with Portfolio Committees or whether there were 
elements of state capture within Portfolio Committees themselves.  I 
mean I already have heard evidence of some witnesses who were in 
Parliament at some stages who said when I was raising this I was told 
20 
to take it easy or something like that.  So – so we need – we need to – 
to look at those things.  So what you have told me is quite important, 
thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Mazibuko maybe what might be of 
assistance to the Commission is if you may even – even if you can do it 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 26 of 223 
 
through your legal team just give us a sense of the list of all the 
matters that you have reported, when were they reported and to whom 
were they reported.  That might be quite helpful to deal with it in other 
streams and to take it further. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO: 
 
We 
do 
have 
that 
– 
that 
list 
(intervenes). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And to the extent that you can where 
there is correspondence that might also be helpful.  So that you can at 
least appreciate – you know – the entire reporting structure and what 
could have been done and was not done.  We can now move on to deal 
10 
with your topic that you are introducing from page 23. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Where you are talking about the 
transactions of interest utilising the bank accounts of Homix. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  If you can explain to us what you are 
trying to convey to the Chair and also deal with the relevant facts under 
that topic. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes.  So here Chair is part of Section 
2 of the summons because the request was about dealing with any 
20 
other accounts of Homix besides the matter that we dealt with … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  On Friday.  The only difference 
between these matters here that I am going to be dealing with to the 
one on Friday - so this is mostly domestic accounts because when you 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 27 of 223 
 
look at money laundering you look at feeder accounts as to where the 
money comes from because our mandate in terms of exchange control 
is mainly cross border the monies that are leaving the country but 
monies that are – are flowing within the country whether there are some 
suspicions or some nefarious activities there that is for the FIC to – to 
deal with … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  You know – and – and there will be 
some collaboration if for instance they found that – that these monies 
could have – so these are accounts that I am coming to now are 
10 
domestic issues that – that would have fed into the local accountant of 
Homix to be able to affect the transaction abroad. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  I just want to highlight that from the 
beginning. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  That is important, ja. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes and – and so here – so as I 
alluded to earlier Chairperson is that the issue of Homix in terms of the 
presentation to this committee I was talking to my colleagues just 
during tea time this morning that having gone through this I have read 
20 
about it in a number of newspaper articles and why I read about it in a 
number of newspaper articles is because of the representations that 
have been made to this Commission.  So some of the things here are 
not new per se – you know – it is just that from our side we are just 
going to present what we know. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 28 of 223 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Ja.  So – so I just want to start in 
terms of paragraph 68 where it says: 
“The bulk of the funds received by Homix originated 
from SOEs or persons who were providing services 
to the SOEs.” 
I think one of the big deals here and one of the presentations that was 
made was about the Neotel case … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Which comes on - on paragraph 69 
10 
that where media reports reported that: 
“In 2015 Homix was involved in irregular payments 
received from Neotel relating to a deal worth 2 
billion between Neotel and Transnet and that 
Mr Ashok Narayan claimed to be the Homix Chief 
Executive at that particular time in question.” 
And I will then move to – so what we will do here we might have to park 
this and we will look at the accounts in terms of what the role of Neotel 
was in terms of maybe putting some funds into the Homix account. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Chair you – you would recall that 
20 
overwhelming evidence was adduced before you that there was no 
justification that could be found as to why Homix was paid any monies 
at all in the light of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes a number of services – I mean the 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 29 of 223 
 
services that were rendered by a number of service providers to 
Transnet. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  And then paragraph – I am coming 
now to the accounts of Homix - local accounts – of Homix at Standard 
Bank.  This is now – so this is a difference – ja this is a – a – this is 
not a trade account that was operated with Mercantile because one you 
operate in a trade space you open a trade account with the bank.  Now 
here it is a – it is a normal current account of a business.  So we are 
starting a different account here.  Money could flow from a current 
account to the trade account so that it can facilitate imports.  So under 
10 
70 so Homix operated a business check and a call account at Standard 
Bank of South Africa and then it had the following authorised 
signatories: 
 
Mr Taufique Shaukat Hasware, 
Mr Yakub Ahmed Suleiman Bhikhu, 
Mr Mugamat Shafik Adams.  
Remember that Mr Bhikhu was the – seemed like a Sole Director of – of 
Homix.  This is the person who we wrote to there audi alteram partem 
letter before the funds were forfeited.  So – so he was also a signatory 
to the account at Standard Bank and then at paragraph 71: 
“The Standard Bank accounts remains largely 
inactive.” 
20 
So from our investigation we are – we are told that these accounts were 
dormant.  I do not know why it was kept open.  How long the banks can 
keep dormant accounts.  So up to 28 March 2014 it was just an inactive 
account and from thereafter there was a flurry of activity in terms of 
dramatic increase in account activity.  During this period the cheque 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 30 of 223 
 
account received several large deposits and the call account was used 
only to receive and pay because when you run a cheque account and a 
call account you might move funds if you find that the interest rate in 
the call account will give you some – some good return and then when 
you need money back into the current account it will be transferred 
back.  So it seems the two accounts had some activity for – started in – 
on 28 March 2014 and – but 30 June – so this is approximately 20 
months or 21 months from 28 March 2014 to 30 June 2015.  There was 
almost no transaction activity in the accounts save for the bank fees.  
So for that period there was a huge activity and this is a red flag for – 
10 
for somebody as I said the banks in terms of their role they - they are 
at the call phase and - and when you look at money – money laundering 
it is as I said that it is three stages.  It is a placement because that is 
where the placement – once you have hit – that is the crucial stage that 
if I have stolen money or I have got a bag of money if I can be able to 
place it into the bank account the process is started.  I know that the 
banks have to reported suspicious account – but if it has just been 
accepted without questioning whatsoever and then from there it is 
layering.  You will see that now there will be layering in terms of people 
who are being paid here whatsoever and eventually it is integration in 
20 
the end where I am clean.  Now that money has been washed through 
and then I am clean.  No money - because it has gone through various 
accounts and all that.  So it becomes problematic that I do not know 
what the role of Standard Bank was for a – for an account that was 
inactive for so many months.  All of a sudden huge amounts not small 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 31 of 223 
 
amounts you will see when you go to the amounts that were put in there 
as to what action was taken to and then that was a red flag in terms of 
no normal activity for some time.  All of a sudden there were some 
feeder accounts and then you seem to be receiving monies from 
unrelated parties because banks monitor accounts and they know in 
terms of payments and debits that go through your account whatsoever. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Ja. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  That is part and parcel of know your 
customer.  So they know who you pay, your insurance company who you 
pay, who pays your salary whatsoever.  They monitor that.  It is part 
10 
and parcel of that but all of a sudden if there is a flurry of activity that 
you are trading in textile but payments are coming from the motor 
companies and all that into your account.  That should raise some 
eyebrows. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  In fact you are providing the cash flow 
analysis? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  If one has regard to paragraph 72. 
20 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You do that from paragraph 72 and one 
must – am I right that one must read paragraphs 72.1 and 72.2 in order 
to get a far much clearer picture as to the analysis that was conducted 
by SARB … 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 32 of 223 
 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes.  So … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  In this respect. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Here Chairperson there is SEM20 
here.  It is quite a high involved spreadsheet here if you can get it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I – I am still just thinking about what you said 
about Standard Bank why they might not have picked up that there were 
- may have been somethings changed about a particular account that 
was dormant for what may be considered a long time and then suddenly 
there are very large amounts that come in.  Well of course we do not 
know what the position is but it is important to have a look because I 
10 
think to the extent that this may have been people who were involved in 
corruption and people who may have been trying to launder money and 
to the extent that there may have been a connection with state capture.  
It is not inconceivable that they could identify certain people within 
banks to say we must talk to them and reward them appropriately and 
ask them to turn a – a blind eye and so on.  So that is conceivable.  It 
is not to say that is what happened … 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At Standard Bank but – you know – people involved in 
these things as I understand will identify people who could be 
20 
stumbling blocks in their activities and would want to make sure that 
those people are not stumbling blocks in their activities.  Of course 
some people will not cooperate with them but others will. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 33 of 223 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair Mr Mazibuko was just about to 
refer you to SEM20 … 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Which is on page 354. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We have a – a far much better copy.  
You will never be able to read the one on that page … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And this has been enlarged so that you 
can be able to follow the evidence.  I am told that despite all attempts 
10 
it might still be hard to read or difficult. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We will try our best and follow 
Mr Mazibuko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  So here Chairperson it is a tally of 
what we got from SEM20.  As you can see it is in small print.  There is 
quite a number of transactions.  So we just pulled them together and 
added the debts as you see on seven – paragraph 72.1. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Can I – can I ask you this question?  
20 
This spreadsheet that you are referring the Chair to you have 
nonetheless repeated the same contents from paragraphs 72.1 and 
72.2.  Am I correct? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes.  So we have – we have tallied … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 34 of 223 
 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  As you see that there is quite a 
number of (intervenes). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  So we have tallied them to put these 
amounts like if you look now under 72.1 – paragraph 72.1 the debits … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  On page 24 … 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Of your witness statement? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  So these are the debits into the Homix 
account. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  So – which means it is a payment to 
Bapu Trading of R327 million … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Okay. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  And you will get that if you go to the 
spreadsheet and start adding those small amounts.  It is quite involved 
… 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Chairperson.  I am just highlighting 
that – that – you know – it will take time but it is … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Every cent. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  All the small amounts that we have 
actually added up. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 35 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  And then the – the next is the 
inter-account transfers … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Before – before you go the – we need to 
capture the Bapu Trading Close Corporation how much … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Are we talking about so that at least 
10 
when you refer to the name let us also refer to the amounts. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Relevant amounts, ja. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO: 
 
So 
they 
were 
paid 
by 
Homix 
R327 806 895.79. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Do you know for what? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  I do not know because I – I tried to 
even go to the – yesterday – before I was preparing and just find out 
about Bapu Trading to say the company that gets 300 – you go there 
20 
you do not get much.  There is nothing and then you say to yourself 
then where has the company disappeared to with so much money and 
most of these companies here Chair – I mean – they have got little or 
no online presence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 36 of 223 
 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  So I do not know whether they have 
just after they have raked in these sums of money … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  They have just disappeared … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  And – and I do not know how it words 
- you know – in terms of when you run a company that you register with 
the CIPC … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Sometimes those and then all of a 
10 
sudden it disappears. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  So – so that is the modus operandi 
that is happening in most of these companies. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Can I check …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That amount of – paid to Bapu Trading Close 
Corporation namely 327 million – 327 8-roughly million – that was paid 
in smaller amounts over a certain period of time? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes.  So as I said that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  As you see there the pages here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  So – so this is now not taking the date 
into account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 37 of 223 
 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  So where not taking – here we are not 
taking the date … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  But we are saying how much was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Paid by Homix to (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you talking about … 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Durign the period … 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That you have mentioned … 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  During the period that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  2014 to 2015. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes.  That we have mentioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  So – and that period is – is about a year 
from – 28 March 2014 – oh it is just over a year to 30 June 2015? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just about maybe 14 months/15 months. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  So when you go to the spreadsheet 
here because it involves other things Chairperson.  So it is quite 
20 
involved.  Let me just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Just to make sure because it starts on 
2014 with a balance brought forward on 28 March and then it goes all 
the way to end … 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 38 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  On 2015/12/03.  So from there – so it 
is – it is a more than a year.  Maybe 20 months or 21 months. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes but that is what they … 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes.  This … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were paid by Homix yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  This is what they paid … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  To Bapu Trading Close Corporation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes and you say when you look for them now you 
cannot really see much of them? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  As I said yesterday when I was 
preparing for the session today – as I said – let me just take some time 
and be curious and just check as to who are these guys and how are 
they doing – you know.  Can I just a normal website like any other but 
you find nothing.  It becomes like a forex trading company unrelated to 
this and all that.  So – so there is something underhand that was 
happening here that the company that was there – I know that you know 
2015 is some nearly five years ago but – you know – still – I mean - I 
20 
do not know as to what they were trading that at that short period of 
time because 327 million if you are really trading and you get 327 you 
are doing very well in 20 months that you are getting this amount of 
money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you – do you know whether subsequent to that 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 39 of 223 
 
period there was any activity for some time?  Subsequent to the period 
you are talking about or that is the only period for which there is 
activity in that account – there was activity in that account. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  So in that regard Chair I am guided by 
the statement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Because I do not have anything 
beyond this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  No that is fine. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  So I cannot vouch … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, well … 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  As to whether there was anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would be interesting to establish whether there was 
any further activity in the same account beyond that period and when 
activities in the account stopped if they did stop. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would be important … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To establish that.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Can I understand this modus operandi 
20 
and I am – I am picking up from your statement where you say that 
there were huge monies which were paid to Homix which are derived 
from – you know – transactions with the SOEs … 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And thereafter once that money lands 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 40 of 223 
 
into Homix account it gets now paid to further other entities which 
might not have been in a relationship at all with the SOE. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes.  That is where I am going to 
show you on paragraph – we have not arrived there – paragraph 74. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  So I do not know whether you might 
me to go there just … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  No, no. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Just – if you can just clarify that 
10 
essence. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You know – the modus operandi is that 
how …? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  The modus operandi? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  And I will – when I come to paragraph 
74 I will just show you an example what was happening. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  There is quite a number of such 
20 
transactions that comes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  That comes? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now you have dealt with Bapu.  We have 
seen how much it has now been paid and we are about to go to 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 41 of 223 
 
inter-account. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes.  So inter-account transfers will 
be your account transfers between your call account and your – and 
your current account. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes.  So as I said there were – you 
can see the amounts.  They even seem very close to each other. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes and then to Mercantile 66 that is 
what actually facilitated the – the – so they paid Mercantile.  I think 
10 
this was going to the trade account to facilitate the 51.8 million.  So 
that when to Mercantile and we had a company by the name of 
Ballatore.  They got 24 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry – I am sorry.  Inter-account transfers were they 
– were those transfers going one way? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  They could be going either way Chair.  
So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  So you could be having a bulk of 
money in your current account that you feel that is earning much 
20 
interest and you request the bank to do a transfer to the call account 
but when there are due payments coming into your current account … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  You ask the bank to transfer the 
money. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 42 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  So that is why there was movement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  And then we had Ballatore 24 300 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mercantile Bank you did not finish.  I interrupted you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You need to mention the amount. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Ja, the Mercantile – they got 
10 
66 999 001 
and 
then 
Ballatore 
Brands (Pty) 
Limited 
they got 
R24 311 950 and there is unidentified 50 840.  SARS … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  When you say unidentified it means that 
there was no – you could not be able to establish … 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  So … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  As to who was paid this money or which 
entity received this … 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Which entity received this money? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  I am not au fait in terms of – because 
20 
when you pay somebody that – for – through maybe your internet 
banking account the bank will say – put the reference as to where the 
money comes from … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Whatsoever.  So I do not know what 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 43 of 223 
 
happened here.  Whether it was hidden by purpose that – you know – 
they did not want to be – and also whether I think also it questions 
whether the banks allow this that – you know – you could actually then 
drive accounts with unidentified.  It is a – it will be a concern if maybe 
it – it could happen because I – I know that if I am using my account 
where you are paying a recipient the bank will want to know … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Who the recipient … 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  The reference number.  So that when 
they receive the money they could know from whom the money was 
coming from and if you do not feel that it will not go through but I am 
10 
just surprised.  As I said I am not in a commercial bank as to why it 
was an unidentified 50 840 and the next one is SARS.  I think it is 
either they owed SARS - so you can see that – you know – maybe 
Homix here was as I said maybe they just owed SARS.  We do not 
know.  There they ae paying 496 689.70 and –and then Mr T Hasware – 
these are the signatories that I alluded to earlier.  Mr Hasware was 
paid 180 415.48 and Mr Adams was paid 60 402.82 and then you have 
got Peritus.  Peritus is that Treasury Outsourcing Company … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  That was a middleman between 
20 
Mercantile and Homix.  They got 37 805.11 and they were paying fees.  
I think it is bank fees there and it is Vodacom.  It could be charges just 
here.  Edge Media, debit card purchases, First Property.  So those are 
just small miscellaneous accounts.  I do not know if you want me to 
mention them Chair those small miscellaneous accounts. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 44 of 223 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  No, no we have them. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It is fine. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes.  Then I can go to 72.2 credits. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes 72.2? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  On page 25? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  On page 25.  Now these are the 
monies that were coming into the accounts of Homix.  So on top it is 
inter-account payment of 241 260 000 and Regiments Capital and that 
10 
raised – because I think amongst all of this we will allude later to 
Regiments Capital – paid Homix 179 506 583.48 and then Neotel – I 
have already alluded to earlier in terms of the contract between it and 
Transnet.  They paid Homix 75 573 509.88.  Technology Procurement 
Holdings they paid Homix 68 400 000.  Central High Trading 275 (Pty) 
Limited they paid Homix 51 300 000.  Combined Private Investigations 
Close Corporations they paid Homix 17 510 400.  Innova Management 
Services R6 384 000 and – and then.  Ja, it is 6 384 … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I think it is millions this money. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Ja.  Apologies – Innova Management 
20 
has got 6 384 000.  Cutting Edge Commerce has got 6 269 153.16.  
Bapu Trading they got – they paid – so – that is why we are surprised.  
They get 4.327 million but they also pay Homix 4.7 million. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Albatime – so they paid 3.99 million to 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 45 of 223 
 
Homix.  Sechaba Computer Services (Pty) Limited 2 725 937.01.  
Burlington Strategy Advisors (Pty) Limited 1.8 million.  There is another 
one an unidentified 1 341 128.17.  SARS – OI do not know whether it 
was a refund 78 018.75 and then you have got a miscellaneous of 
R42.41. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And the total amount which … 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Was credited … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Went into the account of Homix? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  Ja, 660 838 782.86. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Were you able to establish what 
10 
business was Homix doing in order for it to receive these huge 
amounts? 
MR SHIWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:  There is no rationale because that – 
we found that what type of business they were doing and because the – 
these companies – you know - it is - it is vendors that – you know – 
because I asked – you know – when we did the investigation to say 
actually if somebody could ask me and say what was Homix importing if 
we go back to the transaction of Friday.  I was told that they were 
importing textiles.  Now you look at companies here that are here 
whether they are related to a textile type of business.  They are not 
20 
related to that type of business. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  More so if you have regard to Regiments 
and Neotel which we know … 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    Yes Regiments and Neotel these are 
the companies that have been mentioned in several other matters, you 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 46 of 223 
 
now, involving the state capture as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there some significance in the fact that the 
amounts on both the – your column at page 24 and your column at 25 
that the totals are more or less the same, they’re both 660million rand, 
the one at page 24 the total is 660 792 940.79 they one at page 25, the 
total of this payments 660 838 782.86.  So the one 660 700 000.00 to 
round it off and the other one is 660 800 000.00. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   I posed the same question 
Chair…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
 
Of 
660 800 000.00 
and 
the 
other 
one 
10 
660 700 000.00 is there some significance in that regard? 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    There Chair – our assumption is that 
when you look at the money that was paid out, it’s the money that came 
in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So almost all of it was paid out? 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    Yes and you will see when I show – I 
still want to show the next paragraph in terms of how the smaller 
amounts, when they are paid, how quickly they get depleted out of the 
account, so somebody might have been monitoring the credit into 
Homix and say, okay who do we need to pass the money on to. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    So that maybe we don’t go above, 
maybe the limit at the bank if they had a overdraft to say how much – 
and then more or less it’s quite surprising that 660million is equivalent 
debits and credits. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 47 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    Yes and over the same period as 
well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   But it shows that as and when that 
money came in it already had some beneficiaries…(intervention). 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    Yes. How Homix operated, that when 
the money came in, so there – that is why we say there was a flurry of 
activity during that period and then from there what was left was just 
for banking fees, the money was depleted. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    Yes and  having analysed, you know, 
that cash flow on page 25 paragraph 73 you make some observations, 
can you take us through those observations in paragraph 73. 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    Yes I’ve already alluded to the fact 
that the bank account statement of Homix reflect regular large transfers 
to the accounts of two local entities being Belatop Brands (Pty) Ltd and 
registration 
number 
2011/103023/07 
and 
Bapu 
Trading 
Close 
Corporation registration number 2008/0008434/23 respectively.  So we 
were alluding there to that big amount of 327million rand, because 
since Bapu got the bulk of the monies here, that’s why I was very much 
20 
interested to say, what is the business of Bapu Trading. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes now let’s deal with the paragraph 
that you’ve been dying to take the Chair to, paragraph 74 and onwards. 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    Yes so paragraph 74 we’re just 
saying notably during April 2014 an amount of R34 533 598.00 appears 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 48 of 223 
 
to be transferred from Neotel to Homix cheque account   held with 
Standard Bank after which the entire amount was depleted by means of 
electronic transfer to Belatop Brands.  So I want to take you to the 
spreadsheet that I just want to highlight where the 34million came in.  
It came into the account of Homix there it says 2014…(intervention). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   You must tell us where you’re taking us 
through this…(intervention). 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    So it’s (indistinct) flow analysis it’s 
the first page on page 354, so I’m now on the SCM20. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes. 
10 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    I’m now on the SCM20, the first 
page, page 354. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes. 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    Yes and then I’m going to the ate 
there 2014-04-03 and the dates will be on the left side- consolidate are 
on the left hand and then it said here in terms of the type of 
transaction…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the date? 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    2014-04-03. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I see interbank credit transfer there, is that 
20 
the one? 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:   And then the next block is Neotel VD, 
I can’t see, it’s like a 740 something there but it’s Neotel?  
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 49 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Like Walt? 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:   Ja van der Walt Street 740.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Neotel van der Walt Street, 740. 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    And then you’ll see on the debit 
there’s a zero, on the credit there’s a 34 533 519.88 and then if you go 
down immediately on the 2014-04-08 electronic banking, that 34million 
is being depleted going to Bapu Trading.  So you’ll see that there’s a 
4 900 024.00 that goes through on the 8 t h and then there’s another 
3 924 300.00 that goes on the 9 t h.  So if you go further you’ll find that 
these transactions they go up to 2014-04-10 where it’s electronic 
10 
banking payments to Bapu Trading with the last payment of 
1 240 000.00, that is paying.  So it’s a depletion but I’m just alluding to 
what the counsel alluded to, to say, when these monies come in to – 
they don’t stay immediately they need to be shifted elsewhere.  So with 
the two statements that’s what normally happens, if you are laundering 
money you don’t want it to say because the more it stays some eyes 
might start to pick on activity or whatever the bank might block it or 
whatsoever. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes and then relation to paragraph 75? 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    So paragraph 75 it is pertinent to 
20 
mention that at the time in question the sole director of Balatop Brands 
was Mr Mohammed Akrim Khan and that this department had previously 
reported the matter to the South African Police Central case number 
97/05 in 2015 involving another company of which Mr Khan was he sole 
director, being Singent Distribution (Pty) Ltd registration number 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 50 of 223 
 
2011/103022/07. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   This will fall into those cases which you 
said they were reported but you were not furnished with any progress 
pertaining to those cases. 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    Yes that is part of those cases but it 
also shows that these companies are shenanigans Chairperson, that 
these sole directors, companies that in most cases that they are 
involved, we have found some, sort of contraventions that – from the 
department that we either we need to deal with them or we need to 
report them to the police. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    Yes and paragraph 76 and onwards. 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    And so – then paragraph 76 it would 
appear from the statements of Bapu Trading bank account, held with 
Standard Bank that funds received from Homix were mainly transferred 
to Singent’s bank account. Now we don’t have this, here they are 
referring to Bapu Trading receipt of funds from Standard Bank that – 
from then Bapu – from Homix, Bapu Trading, Bapu Trading, Singent 
bank account, that’s where the money were transferred. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes and that’s the point you are making 
also from – in paragraph 77 of your statement am I correct? 
20 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    So in paragraph 77 as well the 
account of Bapu Trading it also appears that regular transfers were in 
turn made from the account of Bapu Trading to FGC Commodities as 
well as Comodo Wholesalers (Pty) Ltd.  Comodo has also been the 
subject of investigation by the financial surveillance department which 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 51 of 223 
 
investigation related to the purchase of large quantities of foreign 
currency in cash under suspicious circumstances.  So I allude that most 
of these companies, sole directors, but they seem not to be very clean 
companies that there are some activities that are taking place. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   And you also confirm to the Chair that 
one would not be able to verify any type of business that they might be 
involved in? 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    No. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   (Indistinct) receiving those monies. 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    Just repeat that Chair. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   I’m talking about this FGC and Comodo, 
one cannot really verify as to what business are they involved in? 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    It’s very difficult even Balatop, you 
know when we mentioned that the two big recipients of monies from 
Homix account was Bapu – I still don’t know what Bapu does, I still 
don’t know what Balatop does and that’s why I’m saying that they’ve 
disappeared now we can’t, you know, the first online search that you 
do, you can’t find anything because a normal business and a ongoing 
concern that is there to actually make business and make money will 
always be there, I can’t find anything in that regard. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes in paragraph 78 you’re referring to 
a company, one company called Chavita Trading which the Chair has 
already heard evidence about it. 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Can you tell us. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 52 of 223 
 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    So on paragraph 78 regular transfers 
were made from the account of Bapu to another entity styled Chavita 
Trading, registration number 2010/001905907 and in this regard it 
would appear that the opening documentation in respect of account 
held at First Rand Bank Limited in the name of Mr Bheko, the sole 
director of Homix who instructed Peritas as explained previously that 
he was employed by Chevita Trading at some point.  So we’re just 
trying to link here the sole director of Homix at some stage and this 
company that – Mr Bheko at one stage was employed, it doesn’t 
mention – I don’t have the details as what but he was employed by 
10 
Chavita, you’ll see as we progress in terms of the role that Chavita 
played at some stage here. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   You referred to the account of Standard 
Bank which also was utilised by Homix in receiving certain funds. 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    Yes, in paragraph 79 Homix also 
received funds into it’s Standard Bank account from account held at 
Absa Bank in the name of Albertyn registration number 2009 – I don’t 
know Chairperson that you are picking a thread here, that these 
companies registration 2011, 2009, 2010, there’s more or less during 
that period there was a flurry of activity of registering these sole 
20 
directorship companies.  So even the timing you know, how it correlates 
to one another and then they involved in the same business, it’s just 
actually surprising.  So here in paragraph 79 we just now introduce the 
company that also paid into Homix.  We have already seen in the 
spreadsheet, Albertyn and at all the relevant time the sole director of 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 53 of 223 
 
Albertyn was Mr (indistinct) Moodley and then on paragraph 80 we talk 
about several large transfers that were made into account of Homix 
from accounts held with Standard Bank in the name of Regiments 
Capital.  Now this is the company where we wrote to after – because of 
the number of transactions that – and the number of matters in the 
media and we just asked them as to what type of business were they 
involved with, with Homix and I remember we wrote a letter which 
actually took long for them to respond to that letter until we threatened 
them with some legal action and they responded. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   What was their response? 
10 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    So the respond – so if I may go to 
their response SEM21 just the first paragraph to say – just to 
read…(intervention). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Page 359 Chair. 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    Yes page 359 I’ll just allude because 
once you start to go further, it now goes to the Transnet SOE pension 
fund which was dealt with here, I think last week.  I’m going to focus 
here, so page 359 is the letter that we – so they were responding so 
you can see that they responded 12 October 2018 having – where it 
says Dear sirs, request for information number one says your request 
20 
for information dated 10 May 2017 refers.  So it was more than nearly 
18 months that they responded to us and then where number two where 
they say – these are the lawyers of Regiments and they say, 
 
 “As mentioned in earlier email correspondence there appears 
 
to have been misunderstanding between our client  and 
BDK 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 54 of 223 
 
 
Attorneys regarding the responsibility to deal with your 
 
request.  BDK was under the impression that our client 
 
had briefed us to attend to your request which was not the 
 
case.  Our client on the other hand was under the impression 
 
that BDK had attended thereto”,  
 
And then they say on paragraph four, 
 
“This has caused a considerable delay in responding to you for 
 
which we apologise on behalf of our client since having been 
 
entrusted with the matter we have worked diligently together 
 
with our client to gather the information sought.  We trust that 
10 
 
the information will assist you with your investigations”. 
 
So eventually – but I must say that it was after we have 
actually said to them, you know, we will take legal action if they don’t 
provide, as I said that when we request information in terms of 
Regulation 19 anybody to whom the request is directed has to provide 
that information.  So the information then came and then in a nutshell it 
is actually in paragraph 82 and then they provided an explanation as to 
the relationship with Homix and others in a letter date 12 October 2018 
a copy of which is annexed hereto that I’ve just alluded to. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes. 
20 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    Then 82.1 where it says, McKinsey 
and Company Africa (Pty) Ltd appointed Regiments as a development 
partner and Regiments introduction to McKinsey was facilitated by Mr 
Moodley, remember Mr Moodley is the sole director of Albertyn  and Mr 
Salim Essa who has been mentioned several times and 82.2, in terms 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 55 of 223 
 
of the agreement with Mr Moodley and Essa they or their nominees 
would be entitled to a business development fee for all revenue 
received by Regiments as a result of its relationship with McKinsey.  So 
the fee agreed at the time was 35% broken down into 5% to Mr Moodley 
and 30% to Mr Essa and this initial part of 35% was going to go to 
Chavita Trading, the company that was just introduced earlier it was 
alluded to in paragraph 82.3 where it says, 
 
“The initial entity nominated by Mr Moodley and Essa jointly”, 
 
So they jointly nominated Chevita Trading to receive the entire 
35% which is a development fee for McKinsey to do business with 
10 
Regiments. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   What is this development fee, did you 
understand what it meant? 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    So the way it is described they say 
because of the introduction, remember McKinsey was introduced to 
Regiments and they worked together and then Regiments doing some 
work for McKinsey and some revenue and out of the revenue that 
Regiments was earning 35% of that…(intervention). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   From Transnet? 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    No it was from McKinsey. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   From McKinsey? 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    Yes so the revenue that was being 
earned by Regiments 35% of that – so they call it, I’ve never heard 
about that development fee, it’s what I’m reading for a first time.  So 
they were receiving 35% of which, jointly they agreed being that it 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 56 of 223 
 
should be paid first to Chevita being Mr Moodley and Salim Essa and – 
but actually things changed a bit you’ll see as I go down. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes proceed. 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    Yes and at all relevant times the 
directors or Regiments was Mr Nyhonyha…(intervention). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   You’re now reading paragraph 82.4 on 
page 28 Chair. 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    Yes and Mr Nivan Pillay and Dr Eric 
Wood.  Dr Wood later that is paragraph 82.5, Dr Wood later informed 
his co-directors that Mr Pillay and Mr Nyhonyha that the above 
10 
mentioned business development fee has now been increased to 50% 
and then Mr Nyhonyha…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   From 35% to 50%? 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would be an increase of about how much, I’m 
not good with but it certainly would seem to be above 30% increase. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   More or less. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Actually it might be much more than that, those that 
are good with arithmetic…(intervention). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   40% Mr Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Sorry? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   40%. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ok at least 30% wasn’t so bad I thought over 50% 
yes. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 57 of 223 
 
MR SHIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:   It seems where that increase or 
during the negotiations where the increase took place it was only Dr 
Wood that was there the two other directors of Regiments, Mr Nyhonya 
and Mr Pillay were not there so it seems they were not unhappy and as 
you asked me as to what is the development fee, so they found it to be  
unsustainable – because now which means whatever business that 
Regiments does for McKinsey and  the revenue comes, 50% of it – all 
of it comes to Mr Essa and Mr Moodley. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So – and Mr Pillay and Mr Nyhonya found this 
objectionable? 
10 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    Yes that’s why if I may just read 
paragraph 82.5 it says, Dr Wood later informed his co-directors being 
Mr Nyhonya and Mr Pillay that the above mentioned business 
development fee has been increased from 35 to 50% and then Mr 
Nyhonya and Mr Pillay were not party to these negotiations and 
considered the revised fee to be unacceptable and unsustainable, so it 
was just too much.  So – but it seems in the initial fee of 35% they had 
agreed and then paragraph 82.6, during March 2016 Dr Wood left 
Regiments and joined Trillian Capital Partners and was removed as a 
director of Regiments during October 2018. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Now what do you make of this 
explanation, you know, having in mind the evidence that you have 
(indistinct) before this Commission about the flow of funds and how the 
funds would simply leave the accounts of Homix and others to other 
beneficiaries, does this make any sense to you? 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 58 of 223 
 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    It doesn’t make sense, I’ve never 
heard in the past about a development fee but it also shows that I don’t 
know what actually percentage of profit that Regiments was making to 
give away 50% of – if you’re going to give away 50% of your profit or 
your revenue it’s not profit here it’s revenue you still need to pay for, 
maybe salaries and other things and rental and all that, so I don’t know 
how they would have survived, you know by 50% hence I think even 
they themselves, I don’t  think they were happy to enter into this 
transaction, hence when it was increased to 50% that’s why two of the 
directors felt that, now it is too high.  So one will take that even at the 
10 
initial beginning there were some sort of arrangement that they were 
not happy with but they entered into that just for the benefit because 
the whole benefit here is because of the introduction of Regiments to 
McKinsey and then somebody had to pay for that to say, you know, to 
pay some – whether it’s a kick-back of some sort for some time, I’m not 
so sure but somebody for that introduction like it is alluded to, I think in 
the – ja on paragraph 82.2 it says, in terms of the agreement, Mr 
Moodley and Essa, they or their nominees will be entitled to a business 
development fee for all revenue received by Regiments as a result of 
it’s relationship – just that relationship, facilitation of a relationship you 
20 
get 35% that gets paid out of the company and then before you could 
do – pay other things as well.  So it’s quite surprising I’m not au fait 
with this (indistinct) in respect of business relationship I’ve never heard 
about it, you know in our department we deal with a number of 
transactions, international, measures and acquisitions and all that I’ve 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 59 of 223 
 
never seen a fee of this nature coming out.  There are fees when you 
actually doing some of these transactions that are there but it’s – there 
are known fees in the market that are – but this one, as I said 
Chairperson I’ve never heard about and that – as you say then it gets 
increased after some, I don’t know what period from 35% to 50% and 
then two of the directors they are not happy and they pull out and 
eventually one of the directors is – goes out of the company, leaves 
Regiments and he goes and joins at Trillian because also Trillian has 
been the subject matter of a number of representation at this 
Commission. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   And all this monies we know they 
originate from the SOE’s. 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    SOE’s yes, they originate from the 
SOE’s. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Now on paragraph 83 on page 28 you 
provide some of the transactions and some of the examples pertinent to 
your 
evidence 
Mr 
Mazibuko, 
can 
you 
please 
tell 
the 
Chair…(intervention). 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    So there’s something that’s very 
interesting here, the movement of money between the account of Homix 
20 
and other parties.  So  paragraph 83 alludes to – it appears there, 
transaction utilising Homix Standard Bank cheque account that on 
several occasions specific amounts were credited to it which we have 
seen on page 24 and then thereafter the exact amount less 1% would 
be transferred elsewehere for example, so we are just providing  an 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 60 of 223 
 
example here,  paragraph 83.1 on  27 June 2014, an amount of 
1 824 000.00 was credited to Homix account and on 30 t h June just three 
days after an amount of 1 805 940.58 was transferred to Bapu Trading.  
So the difference between 1 824million and 1 805million it’s about 
18 386 which is about 1% so you’ll be surprised even then why 1%, you 
know is being transferred elsewhere.  So that’s why I said with money 
laundering the layering, you know, plays a vital role to hiding the 
proceeds of crime because when you layer it you put it into various 
accounts the whole purpose there is to hide the origin of money and 
make it difficult for the officials or the authorities to  trace.  So all this 
10 
small money somebody gets a share of 30 and 5%, 1% you’ll see in the 
next page somebody also gets a share of 10%.  So it seems when 
allegations of kick-backs from monies received from SOE’s quite a 
number of people were benefiting out of this. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   You proceed to give the example on 
paragraph…(intervention). 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    On paragraph (indistinct) on 1 July 
2014 and amount of 1 459 000.00 was credited to Homix account and 
on 7 July an amount of 1 444 752.48 was transferred from this account 
to Bapu, so there’s something that is left for Homix and you saw that 
20 
Bapu also pays to others whatsoever but this one on 1 July 2014 the 
amount of 1 444 the difference there was about 14 592.00 that was left 
in the account of Homix after it was transferred to Bapu Trading. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 61 of 223 
 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:    Page 84 – page 29 paragraph 84 
there’s another amount of money, Regiments is involved in several 
instances when Regiments transferred funds to Homix it also 
transferred an amount equal to 10% of such transfers to Albertyn, for 
example on 14 November 2014 – remember that Albertyn is already, 
Chairperson gaining out of the 35% which was increased to 50% I’m not 
so sure now here there’s another amount going to Albertyn to say in 
several instances when Regiments transferred funds to Homix it also 
transferred an amount equal to 10% because now it’s no more two 
people involved, remember the director of Albertyn is Mr Kubathran 
10 
Moodley and here his company is getting 10% having on the other side 
benefitting from the 50% that was raised from 25%, so paragraph 84.1 
on 14 November 2014 an amount of R13 786 874.94 was transferred 
from Regiments from Homix after which on 18 November 10% which is 
R1 378 687,50 was transferred from Regiments to Albertyn.  Paragraph 
84.2 on 5 February 2015 an amount of R5 966 588,43 was transferred 
from Regiments to Homix and on the same day R596 658,84 which is 
10% was transferred from Regiments to Albertyn. 
 
Paragraph 84.3 on 12 February 2015 an amount of R2 667 
301,56 was transferred from Regiments to Homix after which on 18 
20 
February 10%, R276 730,16 was transferred from Regiments to 
Albertyn. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Do we have any sense as to what 
happens to those amounts once they land into the account of Albertyn,. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 62 of 223 
 
Do they remain in that account or do you know whether are they being 
transferred further. 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:   So we didn’t assess that but you will 
recall that in one of the paragraphs the money that flew from Albertyn 
to Homix it was alluded to that it came from ABSA Bank, so one might 
have to go into that ABSA Bank to say, to check from that ABSA Bank 
where the funds were coming in to say did those funds stay in this 10% 
stay in there or they were transferred further. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now you conclude your evidence 
with paragraph 85. 
10 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:   Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  On page 30 which may I request you that 
please read it, it is quite important and you can then after explain 
whatever you want to explain arising from that paragraph. 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:   Yes so in my conclusion paragraph 
85 in light of the above, all the evidence I have provided it is clear that 
there’s ongoing need to ensure that the South African Reserve Bank 
specifically the financial surveillance department in this context and its 
related agencies, the SARS and FIC, other law enforcement agencies 
there we are referring to the NPA, the Police, and the primary network 
20 
of authorised dealers, as I said that they are the first line of defence 
because in any money laundering transactions where you start by 
actually placing the money, that is the start, that is very crucial 
because if you can’t place it it becomes a problem for you because you 
will be carrying that bag of cash around, so that we work together and 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 63 of 223 
 
our relationship, are (indistinct) strengthened, like the Chairperson was 
alluding to the fact that it seems that we are not working together and 
there is no action being taken, so – and I appreciate what you said 
Chairperson that for the Parliamentary Committees that you are going 
to help us, to me it is some help that some work needs to happen in 
terms of us, for these cases to go forward, because it does not help 
that we have 64 cases reported and nothing has happened up to this 
stage, but I think in a number of cases that I think people are looking 
for some action.  You know even sitting ourselves here regurgitating all 
these issues you know that people might have broken the law, at the 
10 
end of the day people are looking for some action, so we hope that you 
know by working with other agencies as I said that when we work, 
where we work we work as a team of law enforcement agencies where 
we pass the stick, it’s like in a relay where people are running that 
somebody has to take that stick to the finish, you drop it, we’re not 
going to be able to finish the race. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:   Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair that concludes our questioning to 
20 
Mr Mazibuko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  If we may adjourn for five minute in 
order to allow a new witness to take the stand and to proceed with Ms 
Mosidi’s evidence. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 64 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you very much for coming to give your 
evidence Mr Mazibuko you will continue liaising with the legal team with 
regard to the other homework that needs to be done, so that we can get 
to the bottom of these things.  Thank you very much, you are excused. 
MR SIHWA ELIJAH MAZIBUKO:   Thanks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  We will adjourn for five minutes 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms September are you ready? 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes I am Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Good morning.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes good morning. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair the witness whose evidence I 
will lead today is a former employee of Transnet.  She in fact resigned 
from Transnet on the 30 September 2018 and during her stay at 
Transnet she held the position of Group Chief Information Officer.  
Chair I need to alert you that the evidence – her evidence today is not 
all original evidence.  In fact there are previous witnesses… 
CHAIRPERSON:  By which you mean it is not all new evidence? 
20 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  There are in fact witnesses who have 
testified before this commission who have given evidence in relation to 
the transaction that this witness will testify to.  The nature of her 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 65 of 223 
 
evidence 
is 
thus 
supporting, 
corroborative, 
perhaps 
even 
complimentary but it is certainly necessary to fill the gaps and to 
present the context of the previous evidence that has been given.  In 
so doing it therefore builds on the evidence of Mr Peter Volmink and 
the high level overview that was presented by Mr Popo Molefe.  It also 
somewhat touches on evidence that was given by Mr Van Der 
Westhuizen in context of the history of this transaction.  So the 
evidence is certainly necessary to piece together the other pieces of 
evidence to contextualise within the bigger scheme of things and 
enable you Chair to consider the totality of evidence.  To just highlight 
10 
what is really new to her evidence as a summary.  It is evidence that 
specifically falls within her personal knowledge and experience at 
Transnet.  Specifically her experience of specific individuals within 
Transnet who were involved in the award of the IT data services tender 
to T-Systems during February of 2017.  Another aspect of her evidence 
to highlight which is somewhat new is her involvement as the incumbent 
of the position of Group Chief Information Officer which was the 
business owner of this particular transaction.  In this regard her 
evidence then certainly does talk to the theme that has been presented 
by Mr Popo Molefe and even Mr Mohammed Mohamedy and that is 
20 
about the possible existence of a parallel system within the 
organisation which enabled individuals to benefit through certain 
transactions.  So just as much as we are aware that the T-Systems 
transaction was set aside on the 12 t h December last year by the 
Johannesburg high court the process is just as important as the 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 66 of 223 
 
outcome and with your leave may I request then that this witness be 
sworn in? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you.   
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  My name is Makno Muriel Anna 
Mosidi. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed 
oath? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  None at all. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
10 
conscience? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that all the evidence you will give 
will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth if so please 
raise your right hand and say, so help me God. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So help me God. 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair before you are two bundles.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  The first bundle is marked Exhibit 
BB11 and that is the bundle that is specific to the statement of this 
witness and her annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is the – that is the lever arch file that 
contains Ms Mosidi’s statement and it will be marked Exhibit BB11. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 67 of 223 
 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  In addition Chair we will be referring 
to an excerpt out of the bundles of Peter Volmink so before you you 
may have the Exhibit BB2.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I do. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Annexure PV8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  Ms Mosidi can I ask you to turn 
to page 1 of the – of BB11 please?  Do you recognise this document? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes I do. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I ask you to turn to page 20 of 
10 
that same bundle?  Whose signature appears at the bottom of this 
page? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  The signature at the bottom is 
mine. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  So please identify what document this 
is? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  This is my statement with 
regards to the testimony that I am going to give today here. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Do you have any 
corrections to your statement? 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Ma’am I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Mosidi you might wish to just raise your voice a 
little bit more or bring the microphone closer. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 68 of 223 
 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I ask you to turn to page 4 
please?  Paragraph 9 and 10 refers to step 9, is there a correction to 
that number? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair yes I would like to make a 
correction to the number 9 to 7. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  In both instances. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry did you say page 4? 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Page 4 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What paragraph? 
10 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or in the column at the top or what? 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  So paragraph 9 and 10. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Refers to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Step 9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Step 9 okay. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Which ought to have been step 7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I then ask you to turn to page 6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry that should have been step? 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Step 7. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair instead of step 9 it should 
read step 7. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 69 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Step 7. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  In both instances. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I then ask you to turn to page 6 
please?  During our preparation you informed that you would like to add 
two additional points under the sub paragraph 13. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair I would like to add 
13.5 which will talk to relationship management and 13.6 which will be 
10 
security services.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that in the supplementary statement or affidavit? 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  I was just informed that – of that this 
morning so it will certainly be attended to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that can be arranged then. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  For submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When she gives evidence she can cover those points 
that she wants to put in but then a supplementary affidavit must be 
done which will say exactly what she says she would like to add to 
paragraph 13. 
20 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And obviously we will deal with the other corrections 
relating to step 9. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  There is one last correction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 70 of 223 
 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that is again on the same page 6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it correct Ms Mosidi that you wish to 
delete paragraph 14.3? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair I would like to delete 
14.3 it refers to an older tender not this one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so what you need to do is to also in the 
statement when you give evidence you can say what you want to say in 
regard to 14.3 and a supplementary statement or affidavit must be 
made which deals with that. 
10 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank You. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Apart from the corrections that you 
have indicated here today is the remaining part of your statement all 
true and correct? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair it is all true and correct to 
the best of my knowledge and recollection. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Ms Mosidi is it correct that you were 
permanently employed in the position of Group Chief Information 
Officer at Transnet SOC Limited from 1 June 2016 to 30 September 
20 
2018 when you resigned? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It is true Chair. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it also true that the evidence that 
you give today specifically deals with the information technology date 
services tender that Transnet awarded to T-Systems during February of 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 71 of 223 
 
2017? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Is it true Chair. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair in this regard there has already 
been evidence placed before this commission for the source of this 
particular tender and so this tender is specific to the arivia.com which 
provided ICT services to both Transnet and Eskom and which was then 
subsequently sold to T-Systems.  In this regard it is different though 
from the network services which Van Der Westhuizen had already given 
evidence to.  Paragraph 4 of your statement gives a road map to all the 
different aspects that you intend to address today and so based on the 
10 
evidence that has already been presented before this commission we 
will deal with those parts of your evidence which is specific to your 
personal experience and knowledge at Transnet. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Noted Chair. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we could then look at page 2 which 
talks to your qualifications and employment history.  Please provide 
details to the Chair of your academic qualifications? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Thanks Chair.  I am a qualified 
information and technology practitioner and specialist and I studied at 
the University of the North now referred to as University of Limpopo. I 
20 
graduated as a B.Com Data Processing person and a University 
Education Diploma back in 1987.  And Chair I have been working in this 
sector for at least 30 years right from the beginning as a computer 
operator and a programmer right through to where I started playing 
executive roles that I have been playing to date.  So Chair my career in 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 72 of 223 
 
IT started at IBM which by then was referred to as ISM because of the 
sanctions that were levied on the country and I spent four years of my 
life working at ISM in downtown Johannesburg starting as a business 
analyst, a system analyst and then going down to being a computer 
operator because I was very inquisitive and curious about the big 
computers that everyone was talking about.  And then I went ahead to 
be a developer and a data base administrator within IBM.  Four years 
later I then joined what is now called Acsentia by then it was called 
Anderson Consulting as a consultant who was implementing computer 
systems and doing what people refer to as change management 
10 
processes when implementing a system.  I joined Anderson Consulting 
in their Pretoria office and I was actually servicing the South African 
Police in implementing their provisioning administration system.  I then 
joined Ernest and Young as a management consultant service head 
where they were actually beginning to operate in the North West 
administration.  The North West Province back then.  And my 
responsibilities Chair were to actually manage and lead the technical 
outsource that Ernest and Young had for the North West Provincial 
Administration which was really looking at computerising the province 
and was also responsible for the upkeep of the technical installed base 
20 
of the province back then so that would have been in 1995.  It was 
when I in the North West Province that I was then recruited into the 
Provincial Administration itself to be their Chief Information Officer 
back in 1996.  So I had the fortune of playing that role and probably as 
a first after the new dispensation of our government and Chair I worked 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 73 of 223 
 
there as Chief Information Officer for a good number of years, it could 
be four years, yes it is four years and when I left North West I joined 
SITA as the first Chief Operating Officer of that entity when it was 
actually conceptualised and put into operation.  When I was three years 
into the SITA role as a COO there were some issues with the then Chief 
Executive of the organisation and I started acting for over a year as the 
CEO of SITA which is State Information Technology Agency.  Chair I 
played a number of roles in that – in that organisation from being an 
acting Chief Executive to being a COO, to being a head of what we 
used to call Defence Information Technology Systems until I left the 
10 
organisation after four years.  At which I joined an emerging company 
called New Dawn Technologies as a Head for Consulting and the 
consulting was also in IT.  So it was an upcoming company which was 
really promising especially for the time and Chair I then left and joined 
EDS because there was an opportunity to buy some IT company which 
was a SAP fit.  SAP is another software house, it is another software 
package that gets used in critical organisations and companies.  So 
Chair after EDS we then made a management buyout into what we call 
RDC and I was the managing partner and it was a pure technology 
driven company which was focussing on [indistinct] services right 
20 
through the technology stack from perhaps just administrating their 
data bases and making sure that you can actually provide services 
around that technical stack.  It was when I was in RDC that I joined 
Dimension Data as a CIO for Middle Eastern Africa but also as the 
Head of Public Sector.   
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 74 of 223 
 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I could just interrupt you there. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  When you were at Dimension Data did 
you have any engagement with Transnet? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So Chair yes because as a Head 
of Public Sector my primal role was to sell.  So when you sell you 
actually engage with a whole lot of organisations.  You go and meet 
and see how you can potentially sell your services to those 
organisations and Transnet was one of them because it fell under the 
ambit of public sector.  And as an executor for public sector I engaged 
10 
with the CIO or the Group CIO then of Transnet in my role as the Head 
of Public Section within Dimension Data.   
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And I stayed in Dimension Data 
for seven years and when I joined Transnet I joined Transnet coming 
from Dimension Data and I joined Transnet as a Group Chief 
Information Officer in June 2016.  And I stayed with Transnet until 
October 2018 – until September 2018 when I left the organisation.   
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Apart from your 
engagement when you were at Dimension Data when you joined 
20 
Transnet that – is it correct that that was then your very first 
employment with Transnet SOC Limited? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair so when I joined 
Transnet in June 2016 it was my very first employment journey with 
Transnet I had never worked either as a consultant or as a contractor 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 75 of 223 
 
for Transnet it was my first to actually join them as a CIO. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  The experience that you have then 
acquired over the somewhat 30 years specific to the IT sector exposed 
you to different procurement transactions as well? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair I had the fortune of 
playing a whole lot of executive roles in these organisations and most 
of the time I would engage with procurement processes for services 
whether I was inside an organisation or outside like I said my role for 
example when I was in Dimension Data was more to sell and when you 
sell of course you engage with procurement processes in any shape or 
10 
form whether I was still a small medium enterprise when I was running 
my own or whether as an in a role as a Group CIO for Dimension Data.   
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  And your evidence today is specific to 
the procurement of IT data services within Transnet? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair.  So today in terms of 
my statement it is for the data services contract that was actually under 
the service of T-Systems back then. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Where are you currently employed and 
in what position? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So I am currently the Group CIO 
20 
for Corporate and Investment Banking in Standard Bank based in 
Rosebank.  I joined them when I left Transnet in September last year. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  We are now on page 3 of 
your statement which then talks to the procurement process but more 
particularly the role of Group Chief Information Officer which you had 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 76 of 223 
 
held within Transnet at the time.  Chair I would like to just allude to the 
fact that Peter Volmink did provide evidence as a high level overview of 
the procurement process that was followed in this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Volmink? 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  So but we will deal specifically to – 
sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Volmink? 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Mr Volmink, Mr Peter Volmink. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes let us – let us treat all people the right way, 
Mr Volmink we are in formal proceedings.  Okay. 
10 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It did not register what you said? 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Apologies I thought I said Mr Peter 
Volmink okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  So Mr Peter Volmink had already 
provided evidence in relation to the procurement process that was 
followed but in this regard this witness will deal with specificity of her 
involvement.  If I could ask you to turn to page 4?  In fact sorry can I 
ask you to turn to page 3 one page before.  Who initiated the process 
20 
to go out on tender? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So Chair when I joined Transnet 
this tender was already initiated but in terms of how the process works 
the business owner will actually initiate a tender process based on the 
business requirements that the business owner would be seeing and 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 77 of 223 
 
would be responsible for.  So back then following that line will mean 
that the then Group CIO would have initiated this tender and back then 
it was Doctor Mantsika Matooane and he would have had then put 
service requirements together based on what she will be requiring in 
terms of a service provider to help her to actually execute on her 
responsibility as a Group CIO.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Was she your predecessor? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  She was my predecessor Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you.   
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we could then turn to page 4 and the 
10 
diagram at the top of the page in particular.  Is it correct that this 
diagram represents Transnet’s evaluation methodology? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair the diagram that you see 
represents the Transnet Evaluation Methodology as of 2015.   
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  And when you look particularly at the 
different parts of this diagram at the top you have a pre-qualification 
section then there is a stage 1 and a stage 2.  All three of which are 
sub-divided into different steps.  Would it be fair comment to say that 
the evaluations can actually be grouped in the following looking at this 
diagram?  Step 1 is the administrative responsiveness.  Step 2 would 
20 
be the substantive responsiveness.  Step 3 which straddles over step 3, 
4 and 5 deals with minimum thresholds for the technical evaluation 
specific to local content, supplier development and then functionality 
and technical?  The next point for evaluation would be the commercial 
valuation and that would be in step 6 where you have your weighted 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 78 of 223 
 
scoring and then you have a bit of a due diligence process under steps 
7, 8 and 9 which would deal also with post tender negotiations and it 
also includes the best and final offer requests to identify preferred 
bidders.  And the last step being the actual contract award.  Would that 
be a fair process of evaluation as consolidated in this table? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair it will be. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  When you joined… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  This diagram does appear to have a 
certain features which other diagrams that I have been shown have but 
it has others that I have not been shown.  My recollection of the 
10 
diagrams where it simply talks about stage 1, stage 2and stage 3 I 
think I do not – I cannot remember if there was anything beyond that 
and there was not any sub-division of each stage to say under this 
stage there is still sub-stages if you know what I mean.  So I am 
wondering how it compares with those other diagrams because I 
assume they all being under Transnet it must be one and the same 
thing.  Maybe Ms Mosidi’s decided to put in more compartments under 
each stage I am not sure.  I mean when we were dealing with I think 
Neotel I do not know which on an – ja I think Neotel there were stages 
1, 2 and 3 and to get to stage 2 you had to meet certain thresholds and 
20 
so on.  So I am just wondering it does not seem to be exactly the same 
as what I was shown.  That is the point I am making and I just want to 
understand whether that is simply because there are some stage – sub-
stages or compartments under once – each stage that I was not told 
because maybe it was not important in the evidence of particular 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 79 of 223 
 
witnesses but do exist in the structure? 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair if I may then – this particular 
diagram is actually the same diagram that appears in Mr Volmink’s 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  But there are certainly slight 
variations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is Mr Volmink’s one here in this lever arch file do you 
know? 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Not… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  I am not sure Chair but I am happy to 
extract the relevant section. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay maybe we can proceed and later when you have 
had more time to look we can come back to it maybe during the lunch 
break you could have a look at Mr Volmink’s one so that one can 
compare and see if one is dealing with exactly the same thing or not 
really. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  It is certainly exactly the same 
diagram but we will certainly source the proper reference page number 
20 
for you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  There is also variations though. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Of this particular diagram. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 80 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Which simplifies the actual stages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  So for example if I could take you 
Chair to page 31.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Page 31 is a six stage process but the 
actual process of evaluation is no different to the more detailed one on 
page 4 of this witness’ statement.  It is really just collapses certain 
steps and consolidates them. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Let us proceed maybe the differences are 
not material to the extent that there may be differences there might just 
be nuances.  Let us proceed. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  When you joined the organisation of 
Transnet Ms Modisi at which stage was this particular tender process? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So when I joined the 
organisation Chair I joined it in step 7 of that process that you see 
there.   
20 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay now if you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think – okay you – you have got in that diagram at 
page 4 stage 1 and stage 2 and then stage 1 is divided into two 
columns, is that right? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Stage 1 is three columns Chair. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 81 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the – sorry? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Stage 1 is three columns. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the 2 columns seem to – or maybe you – ja the 
first column you have got pre-qualification as a heading and then you 
have got step1 and step 2.  And then under ste – and then in the 
column you have got step 3, step 4, step 5.  So – so what I may have 
called sub-stages you have actually said it is steps so there would – all 
of those would be steps to be taken under each stage? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
10 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they are not stages on their own it is just what you 
do under that stage? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So but am I right to say step 1 up to step 5 fall under 
stage 1?  Am I right? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair I would not – ja I would 
not differ with that ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  And then when it comes to stage 2 you 
have got steps 6 up to step 10, is that right? 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  I think that goes – goes to – goes some 
way to helping me.  I think that goes some way to helping me. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair I have been reminded that the 
time is past … 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 82 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us go up to half past and then take the break 
– the tea break. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  No problem Chair.  When we look at 
this particular table you say then that you entered at step 7? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Now to understand what processes had 
already been followed by the time that you joined let us look then at the 
previous steps so that you can inform the Chair practically what 
actually it entailed? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Okay.  So Chair I mentioned 
10 
already that as a business owner you put together the tender 
requirements and the specifications that you would like the bidders to 
respond to.  So once the respondents have submitted their proposals 
we can now go into the pre-qualification stage in terms of that graphic 
that you see there.  So the first step Chair is just very, very 
administrative and in that step what you really look for you look at 
various administrative things like was the tender lodged in time 
because there is always a closing period and those who are late they 
get disqualified and are there some documents that were required by 
the tender and have been submitted which people will call returnable 
20 
documents because they will have to be given back to the bidders at 
the end.  And whether all the documents that have been submitted are 
they valid?  If you say this is my BEE certificate is it a valid certificate?  
If it is a tax certificate is still valid?  And so on so it is very 
administrative.  So that was done Chair already when I joined the step 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 83 of 223 
 
1.  The second step is really in terms of substantive responsiveness.  
And here you are still actually looking at the bidders and their 
responses and you are checking at whether have they provided pricing 
because how are you going to evaluate if they do not have price?  Have 
they responded to the technical requirements that you would like to 
have?  Have they responded to things like supplier development if that 
is what you require?  So you – it is actually some kind of a tick box that 
the team in procurement will actually do and that one was done also 
Chair.  Now you move to – now you are stage 2 which I would start with 
step 3 where it will look at for example the local content, the supplier 
10 
de… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not say stage 2 did you? 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes she did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She did?\ 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Stage 1.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So I said – 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are still in stage 1 as I understand it, is that 
right?  And it is important that we clarify. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Oh it is still part of that stage 1 
20 
ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is important because that was my clarification that 
you gave me which helped me to understand it. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we are still in stage 1. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 84 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes we are still in stage 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We going to step… 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And Chair I will take you through 
the steps. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Just so that I do not get 
confused. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  No but if you tell – if you say now we 
moved from stage 1 to stage 2 when we get to that  
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI: Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That makes sure that there is no confusion as to 
which steps under – fall under which stage? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So Chair still talking to stage 1 
now in step 3, step 4 and step 5.  So step 3 they will look at local 
content if it is applicable to a particular tender and then step 4 in terms 
of supplier development if there are any thresholds that have been 
requested.  Now the critical one will be step 5 where we are now 
evaluating appropriateness of the functionality that we requested and 
20 
the technical requirements that we actually asked the bidders to 
respond to.  And Chair because this is an IT tender I am saying that 
step is quite critical because that is why we are actually going out on 
tender to seek appropriate and purpose fit services providers who will 
be able to help us in executing this.  So that whole stage 1 then Chair 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 85 of 223 
 
you would also just for me to amplify that when you do technical 
evaluation when you score someone from 1 on a scale of 1 to 5 and you 
say can this person actually have an operational help desk?  And I say 
yes he can but perhaps he does not have the skill there is a risk of not 
being able to actually run it the way it should.  By the time I put a score 
I would have taken into consideration a whole lot of those aspects to 
say yes he has a helpdesk, yes it is operational but maybe no it is 
actually next to the sea so there is a danger of it being I am just being 
– giving an example there.  So by the time you actually evaluate and 
you score you are actually taking everything into consideration to make 
10 
sure that this service provider will be able to provide the service that 
they are saying they are capable of providing.  So then Chair that will 
then conclude your stage 1.   
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  On the conclusion of stage 1 did 
Transnet establish a team of people to deal with the evaluation process 
and what were they called? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Okay so Chair when you 
evaluate especially a tender as big as this one which you would have 
picked from Mr Volmink’s testimony that it is called a High Value Tender 
because it is more than R50 million.  There is a process of evaluation 
20 
that gets followed and there is a team that gets puts together.  So he 
business owner because the business owner understands operationally 
what the business owner will be looking for will put together a cross-
functional evaluation team that will include technical capability that 
should be able to engage with the bids as they come through.  So that 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 86 of 223 
 
team is called you will see it abbreviated a lot a CFET but it is a cross-
functional evaluation team which the business owner and in this case it 
would have been the Group Chief Information Officer they would have 
signed off to say this is the team that will actually go and evaluate the 
technical aspects of this tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes there was a witness or two who spoke extensively 
on the – one the groups or teams who plays certain different roles in 
the tender evaluation process or in the process from the time the RFP 
is formulated to the time that is the tender is awarded. So unless they 
are specific features that are peculiar to your evidence that that I 
10 
understand.  That kind of evidence who does what does not need to be 
explained.  Their names can just be mentioned.  This body did this and 
this body did that which is in accordance with its function and whether 
it did it the right way or the wrong way but we do not need to explain all 
of that.   
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  As it pleases Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  I am informed… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us take the tea break.   
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Before… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will resume at quarter to twelve. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 87 of 223 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  The particular 
page number as promised is in Mr Volmink’s bundle and it is page 689.  
It in fact forms part of the Transnet Procurement Procedures Manual. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are right.  It looks like – exactly the same or 
maybe not 100 percent but substantially it looks the same. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Coming for … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Ms Mosidi before the 
10 
short adjournment you spoke then about the stage 1 which dealt with 
the brief qualification of administrative responsiveness, substantive 
responsiveness and then minimum threshold across local content, 
supply development functionality and technical.  Is it correct that in 
order to advance from one step to the next one needs to satisfy then all 
of the requirements under a (background noise) in order to advance to 
substantive in order to advance to the next stage? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair thank you.  Yes the steps 
as we see them they are chronological and they are in sequence.  So if 
for example administratively I am not able to provide the right 
20 
documentation or my documentation is not valid Chair it will not make 
any sense for you to proceed to the next step because you would have 
failed the pre-qualification that is also mandatory – if I can use that 
word – so by the time you reach the five it means you have been 
qualifying and satisfying the requirements of Transnet until you get to a 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 88 of 223 
 
point where you are in step five and say we are now evaluating your 
technical requirements and functionality. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It was also your evidence if I 
understood correctly that under steps 3, four and five in particular to 
technical and functionality there were risks that were considered.  Is 
that correct? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes.  So when I was giving an 
example of the helpdesk Chair I was saying when you – when you 
evaluate any technical specification that you are doing you already 
inherently start thinking and looking at the responses and you score it 
10 
based on what the capability is and what you deem as a risk what will 
actually – so by the time you give someone a score you would have 
considered the risks as well.  For example if you are saying yes I have 
a mainframe but already this mainframe is 30 years old and therefore it 
will be so slow. The maps will be so expensive.  The million instructions 
that – that we actually price mainframes based on will be so expensive.  
Of course then I start – when I evaluate I will take that into cognisance 
and I will give you a score based on the overall evaluation and 
assessment of what I will be looking at.  Yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so when you advance from stage 
20 
1 into stage 2 now looking at step 6 weighted scoring is then applied to 
those who have qualified out of stage 1? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja.  So – so when we evaluate 
Chair – so there is that team which is looking at the technical side of 
things like we have been talking of the Cross Functional Evaluation 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 89 of 223 
 
Team and there is now an evaluation of the commercials in terms of 
that and then we do it a weighted score and you end up with the overall 
in terms of the bidders how they have fared when you were actually 
evaluating them. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  How many bidders qualified …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  The technical and the commercial 
evaluation does it happen under stage 1 or under stage 2 … 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I am talking stage now not step – stage. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It would have happened in stage 
10 
1 Chair.  When you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is where it is supposed to happen? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  When you do step 3 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Step 4 and step 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  How many bidders qualified following 
the weighted scoring applied to those who were qualified under stage 
20 
1? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So on record it – it was 
recorded that seven bidders actually qualified.  So they made it through 
to step 6. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So then by the time that you joined 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 90 of 223 
 
at step 7 there were seven bidders who had qualified … 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Who would have qualified. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At that particular point in time? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Paragraph – paragraph 11 of your 
statement on page 4 addresses the main concerns and objections that 
you had regarding this procurement process.  Please clarify to the 
Chair what those main concerns and objections were. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja.  So Chair on step 6 where 
we then take the aggregation of both price and functionality that you 
10 
would have seen in stage 1 we ended up with those seven who actually 
qualified.  So what it means is that on a flat line all those seven could 
do the work.  They were technically proficient and able and they 
actually were fit for purpose in terms of what we were looking for.  So 
when you start now going into step 7 Chair I will have to give as bit of 
a background of how that then happened which I think I could have 
included it in my statement as well.  So the – in step 7 then there was a 
shortlist of two bidders.  Now that is when I joined and I see this 
communication that there will be shortlisting two bidders out of the 
seven who are capable. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I think before we address that … 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It is important to just give the overall 
framework within which this particular process was in fact conducted.  
So we certainly will be coming to that … 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 91 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  A little later … 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  But in that regard we – we can then 
accept based on your evidence that all risk assessments had been done 
by the time that you had joined? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes.  Yes Chair.  So – so – oh I 
thought I made that point when I was explaining Chair that when you 
adjudicate you – you take into account the risks profile of each and 
every response.  So you – you actually score taking into account the 
10 
technical capability but also the risk and the – what you actually deem 
as being the profile of that particular response which will take into 
account the risks as well. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So by the time you score it you 
have taken into account those risks as well.  What is left of course is 
when people are now going to do the site just to test and see if in truth 
those things exist but now you are – you are home and dry.  You know 
that these people can actually do the work … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  (Intervenes). 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Risk included. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Specific to the risks what were your 
concerns in relation to the risks at this particular stage that you joined? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So – so at this stage I just had a 
big concern in terms of how the risks were then introduced into the 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 92 of 223 
 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you joined the shortlisting of the two entities 
had already taken place? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It – it actually happened as I 
was joining Chair and you will see later in the statement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  How I tried to give input in 
terms of increasing the net … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Because of this tender. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Not only limiting it to two … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  But perhaps because of the 
complexity and the size. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So you spoke about the introduction 
of risks which you document at paragraph 11 of your statement. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI: 
 
Yes. 
 
They 
were 
now 
20 
reintroduced into the BAFO which in my view there would have been – 
they would have formed part of the evaluation process before that 
stage – before that BAFO.  That is the first one Chair.  The second 
concern that I had … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  What you have just said is – is it 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 93 of 223 
 
captured in 11.11? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  11 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of your statement paragraph 11 … 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  11.1 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  11.1 – I am sorry.  Is that step 8 there correct in the 
light of your correction of step – step 9 to step 7? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is correct? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  No that is fine.  Okay.  No that is fine. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So your first concern is that there 
were risks which were an integral part of the evaluation process that 
were reintroduced? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  That were reintroduced into the 
evaluation process. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What other concerns did you have? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  The other concern was when I 
looked at this … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Reintroduced such as that they had been 
looked at some stage before and … 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Something had happened to them and now they are 
brought back.  Just explain that a little bit. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja.  So Chair when you evaluate 
you do a 360º degree evaluation of a response.  So if the risk – there is 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 94 of 223 
 
some risk in the response that you see your score will take that into 
cognisance.  You will say I have scored them two out of 10 because I 
see the risk of their capability – the risk – so you have – you have 
included it in your technical evaluation.  Now when you are at the end 
and you start talking about those risks already whilst you have actually 
applied the risks as you were evaluating I just (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you talk – you are talking about when 
you say they were introduced? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  They were reintroduced ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So … 
10 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  They were reapplied. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what you mean is if they were taken into account 
at an earlier stage … 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the entity was evaluated on a certain basis 
including them when you later on take them into account again … 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the reintroduction you are talking about? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And from what you say it seems you are suggesting 
20 
that should not normally happen? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It should not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Were these risks relevant or material 
in any respect in your experience? 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 95 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So the second concern that I 
had Chair was in terms of the materiality of the risks and I found them 
irrelevant and not material and I think later on Chair when I speak to 
the risks I will just explain why not.  Important though to mention that 
this tender just the way it was set up was set up in such a way that it is 
a green-field tender.  So I think it is important just to bear that in mind 
when I start talking to the risks later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Explain a green-field tender. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So green-field tender is that you 
10 
assume that there is nothing.  You are all taking off from point zero.  So 
with this tender there was the current incumbent who was within 
Transnet giving the same service and competing with the rest but for 
fairness and – and equity you then say we assume that you are all at 
zero.  No one is in the environment.  So let us not take that into 
cognisance … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  To ensure that there is equity in 
terms of adjudication – in terms of evaluation and adjudication. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So – so if there is somebody who is currently 
20 
providing the service that person may have performed purely – 
performed very well? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say – you say let us pretend as if there is 
nobody? 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 96 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes.  All of us who are new we 
are starting at point zero. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I hope that at some stage … 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It will (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  It will be taken into account because you – you 
obviously would not take somebody whose performance has been 
disastrous and - and give – and say you are starting new and you never 
taken into account the disastrous performance. 
10 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay, alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And the current incumbent to this 
particular operation was T-Systems? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It was T-Systems Chair South 
Africa. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And T-Systems was in fact competing 
for this particular tender as a bidder? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It was also – it was also 
competing as a bidder. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  11.3 documents another concern that 
you had in relation to this tender.  Can you please explain that to the 
Chair? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So – so Chair I joined in 
June 2016.  I start engaging with one of the biggest outsources of 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 97 of 223 
 
Transnet when it comes to IT and there is a whole process when you 
are evaluating high value tenders and one of them is that there must be 
a specific report that they will a high value tender report which would 
have been prepared to look at this high value tender and whether it was 
compliant and whether it is fully risk mitigated and whether everything 
is actually in place.  Just so that they give the confidence to those who 
are supposed to make the decision.  So when I joined the first report 
that I received and by then I knew it is not like I know exactly how it 
should look like but it was not actually signed and I – I did not realise 
that it carried a lot of weight until a little bit later.  So – and according 
10 
to practice it would have been – it would have actually formed part of 
the whole report in terms of the tender. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  11.4 documents your last concern or 
rather your last main concern.  Did you …? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  (Indistinct)? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  11.4 on page 5 talks about your last 
concern and that was the recommendation that was made in relation to 
the award. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Oh okay.  So – so Chair the 
evaluation had begun and there was some kind of a recommendation 
20 
that was done for the award of this tender and procurement in Transnet 
it reports into the Group – Group Chief Financial Officer and at the time 
it was Mr Garry Pita and in that recommendation my biggest concern 
really was that they included some of the risks against the competing 
bidder and in this instance it was Gijima to support the award of this 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 98 of 223 
 
tender to T-Systems.  So I think those were the three main (indistinct) 
in terms of the concerns that I had. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  To understand the importance of this 
particular tender to Transnet as an organisation it is common cause 
now that this tender related to data services.  Please explain what 
exactly is data services for purposes of Transnet’s operations? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So Chair let us – let us start by 
just talking to what a data service is.  So in any organisation there will 
be some transactional systems or some transactional applications into 
which people capture source data and just for simplification I will say 
10 
source data will be something like where you capture and order into or 
where you capture my name as an employee and my whole profile, my 
address or where you capture your customers.  Now all those records 
they make up data for this organisation and as you capture them into 
this a – a number of things come into play.  So you have the people 
who capture but you also have people who are responsible for the 
upkeep and the running of the systems that you are using but you also 
have people who must secure and make sure that that data that you 
have captured is secured.  It is correctly accessed.  The people who 
actually tap into the data are the right people to do that but then you 
20 
also make sure that this data can be used by everyone who is correctly 
authenticated.  So the combination of all these things they make up 
your data services but that data it will not be useful to you if you 
cannot actually transport it to the right people who need to use the data 
and for that purpose then you will have the communications layer which 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 99 of 223 
 
people will call networking.  To make sure that this data can move to 
where it needs to get to but that networking it means it must actually 
hinge into where you have posted your data and where you start 
actually transporting it to the other areas.  Now that data as you 
continue to work with it then you start deriving information and making 
sense out of it.  Then you start doing things like management 
information services or executive information services where you start 
drawing insights but as you do that you do it within the data services 
environment.  So you continue to do that.  So where do you actually 
host the data.  You can host it in what people will call servers or the 
10 
mainframe that is the one which is really the father of data centres and 
that is where you – so this whole tender it was a data service to make 
sure that data is correctly hosted.  It can be accessed.  It can be 
captured.  It is secured and it is actually correctly authenticated.  You 
do not want somebody who is not working for Transnet to come and 
access the data.  So that whole thing is data services but then to make 
it more useful you then start connecting and then you start having your 
network services so that you can actually communicate. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it then correct that data services 
are interdependent on network services? 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  I think they are interdependent 
because – yes if – if maybe – if maybe you are just working as an 
organisation in isolation which does not happen.  You can say well I will 
just capture my data here and this is where I will keep it but for you to 
be able then to communicate with whoever wherever you are going to 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 100 of 223 
 
need network capability to be able to communicate and that network 
Chair it starts where I am sitting as a user in an office and you will find 
a lot of wires running all over the place and they hinge into what they 
will call a network port just so that it can then start communicating.  So 
the whole burden will have what they call a Local Area Network which 
will then connect me and you in the same building to make sure that we 
can work.  Sometimes it is physical wires.  Sometimes it is Wi-Fi - what 
people call Wi-Fi – and that whole thing makes the whole service 
complete and yes useful to anyone who would like to consume the 
service. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  Not to oversimplify it but 
would you – the interdependency between a network service and a data 
service essentially would be almost like what is required to send a 
WhatsApp message.  You would have a hardware which is your 
cellphone.  You then have the network which is either Vodacom, Cell C, 
MTN, Telkom and then you would actually need data in order to transmit 
the message from one end user to another. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  In that context paragraph 13 
of your statement highlights that this particular tender then sought to 
20 
deal with the services outsourced in respect of the data centre and 
hosting services, help and service desk, collaboration, end user 
computing, desktop and support.  You informed at the start of your 
evidence that you wanted to add to that relationship management and 
security services.  Can you please expand specifically on relationship 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 101 of 223 
 
management and security services? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Thanks Chair.  So the services 
that this tender was intended for are as outlined by Ms September in 
terms of those categories of service.  Now if I were to add now the 
relationship management because it is a head party who is providing a 
service to us firstly.  So there must be that soft layer where there is 
somebody managing the relationship between Transnet and the service 
provider.  In this case it would be Transnet and T-Systems.  There must 
be that person who looks at that but it did not only end – end there.  It 
also then looks at for example contract management, vendor 
10 
management, vendor performance.  So monthly for example you will 
have standing meetings that will look at the previous month how we 
performed.  Was there anywhere where we actually maybe contravened 
or under achieved against a service level agreement that would have 
actually agreed to.  So that whole component it is very critical and – 
and that is what we would refer to as relationship management.  
Security services is where our – I was talking to authentication and 
making sure that data of Transnet is actually secured but also where 
you make sure comply with legislation that will actually talk to security 
like for example your – when people talk about POPI.  That – that 
20 
particular tower or that particular category will make sure that as you 
run the environment you actually secure people’s personal information 
as required.  So those are the security services but also just to protect 
and make sure that not every person will get access into the network of 
Transnet. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 102 of 223 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Within the stable of the different 
divisions of Transnet was there any part of Transnet that would not 
utilise data services? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  All – all divisions were allowed 
to actually utilise the – this particular tender but for example if you look 
at TNPA because it is so governed … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And TNPA stands for? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It stands for Transnet Port 
Authority.  You almost got me there.  So Transnet National Port 
Authority. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  National Port Authority. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja.  So because they – they are 
governed and you know they would not – they would still keep some of 
their asset not necessarily using this particular tender depending on 
what the requirement would be. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  But essentially it was fundamentally 
… 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  (Intervenes). 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Fundamental and critical to the 
operations of Transnet? 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It was for all the operating 
divisions of Transnet.  They could all use it. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What was the estimated cost of this 
tender for the period of five years? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Okay.  So when we were – when 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 103 of 223 
 
it was going out on tender the estimated costs were between 1.8 and 
1.9 billion in terms of the value of this tender. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay and how would you describe 
the base – the base costing of this tender? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So this tender Chair is really 
based on – on consumption.  So whilst you estimate it to be 1.9 billion 
depending on the growth trajectory that you achieve you might end up 
being somewhere else because you are really driven by the volumes.  
Chair you will – you will notice somewhere it will talk to the volumes 
that we actually used to run this tender and they were fixed because we 
10 
did not want a changing variable there.  However this – I think – in 
short was just to say it was more a volume based contract.  So the 
more we consumed the more we are going to start being charged for it 
and so on. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It was already your evidence that 
there were seven bidders who had qualified on technical standards and 
these seven bidders were eventually shortlisted to two.  Is that correct? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes.  So we – so two were 
chosen … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chosen, thank you. 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  To go, yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you for the correction. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I ask you to turn to page 27 
please?  In the middle of the page is an email which is dated 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 104 of 223 
 
26 June 2016 sent at 07:01 pm from yourself and the third paragraph of 
that particular email for record purposes reads – apologies the second 
paragraph reads: 
“I just had a call from Martin asking me whether he 
could go ahead and sign the recommendation to 
shortlist two service providers to go ahead to the 
due diligence state.  I advised against it.  I would 
rather have us shortlist four or five service 
providers for due diligence.  It is complex.  It is 
involved, SOAs need to be tightened up and made 
10 
fit for purpose.  Expected benefits to be well 
articulated etcetera.  It is not everyone who can see 
this through to the end.  The more the better.  We 
are late already.  We may as well do it right.  
Shortlisting only two now in the interest of time is 
likely to burn even more time instead.  Like I 
mentioned in the GLT this is critical and core to our 
operations.  I recommend that we shortlist four or 
five bidders to ensure a near perfect fit.” 
Do you confirm that this is in fact the email that you sent? 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes Chair it is the email I sent. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    And what was the trigger for you 
sending this email? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:  Martin was the executive manager in 
my office as a Group CEO and I was travelling when he actually sent, 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 105 of 223 
 
just to confirm that he can go ahead and approve that we shortlist two 
bidders. So I then penned down on email because this has been my 
biggest fear factor when I joined Transnet to get this right and I said to 
him, no not two can we just go to four because in any case we have 
seven who have qualified.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Okay if you can then turn one page 
forward which is page – sorry two pages forward which is page 25 at 
the bottom is – at the bottom is an email dated  the 30 t h of June 2016 
at 8h12am from Gary Pita who wrote, and it’s addressed, “Hi Siya 
/Makano” the first part of the email addresses reasons and in particular 
10 
– sorry reasons why the IT Data Services is recommending shortlisting 
and then specifically two rank bidders. If I can ask you to turn to page 
26, the last bullet for record purposes reads,  
 
 
“The recommendation for award for IT Data Services has to be 
 
tabled at the Transnet leadership team ADC and in July 2016 
 
and has to be approved by the Board and there’s a transition 
 
period of six months which is required after issuing the LOI”.   
 
The last sentence at that page reads, 
 
“Due to the time constraints it is also impractical to shortlist 
 
and negotiate with more than two bidders, the Board has time 
20 
 
and time again advised management that no extensions will be 
 
considered.  This is further supported due to the National 
 
Treasury instruction note where we would need NT, presumably 
 
National Treasury approval for any extension which may take 
 
some time”, 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 106 of 223 
 
 
We then go back to page 25, the email just above the one that 
was addressed now is an email from Mr Siyabonga Gama to Mr Gary 
Pita and you were in fact copied on it.  What was Mr Gama’s attitude to 
the shortlisting of the two bidders as compared to your proposal to 
shortlist more than two? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Chair when I suggested that we 
shortlist at least more than two, Mr Gama countered me and said, look, 
trust that is big, you know, you are new here you are not used to these 
big organisations who actually award a whole lot of tenders with huge 
amounts this is really nothing my girl, it’s a small tender let’s not waste 
10 
time let’s just move with it  shortlisting four people is going to waste 
our time and we just want to get done with this tender and of course 
Chair I was new and  perhaps I wasn’t used to the many zeros but it’s 
not like I was convinced but I had to go with it. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    And when you mentioned 
…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   This was in a meeting? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes we were talking, I think we were 
talking on the phone, he was trying to explain why he would go with the 
two bidders after I had responded to him. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    And in context was it said that the 
tender was then small at an approximate value of 1.85billion? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes so he was saying 1.85billion is a 
small tender in the instance of Transnet because Transnet is quite big. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 107 of 223 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    At this stage who were the two top 
bidders that were in the running? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:  So at this stage Chair it was T-
Systems and Ubuntu based on the sequential rating of the bidders who 
had qualified.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    What happened then on the 20 t h of 
July 2016? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   So Chair, Ubuntu then had to withdraw 
because when a tender has expired, before you can actually extend the 
validity period you have to get approval from those who were bidding to 
10 
say yes, we can extend and still keep the price fixed at what we bid 
with but Ubuntu, I think, it just came to light that their partner couldn’t 
actually accept that we should keep the pricing at that point where they 
had bid and they opted to rather leave the process because they 
couldn’t keep and fix the prices at that. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Following Ubuntu’s withdrawal did 
Mr Gama have any communications with you in regard to that? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Ja and Mr Gama Chair was big enough 
to say Makano I think you’ll say I told you so because you did advise 
me to have more than two shortlisted now the one has actually opted 
20 
out of the race and I responded and I said, look it’s all good intentions 
you were just trying to make sure that the process can be accelerated 
for the benefit of Transnet so it’s okay it’s a mistake that we all make 
sometimes but perhaps next time when (indistinct) will take me 
seriously because it’s my area of expertise, we laughed about it. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 108 of 223 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    What then happened after Ubuntu 
withdrew from the process.  
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:    So after…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Sorry where about in the statement are we now? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    We’re on page eight paragraph 19. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   So after – so after Ubuntu withdrew 
then I think Mr Gama gave approval to take the next bidder in the que 
and the next bidder was actually Gijima so they actually was then the 
next second bidder who was being evaluated. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    So three months after you started 
at Transnet which was about September 2016, you were presented with 
a file, can you please explain to the Chair what happened at that 
particular point in time? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Okay so Chair, the process of 
procurement and appointment of service providers is the core 
competency and core responsibility of procurement.  So Mr Edward 
Thomas who was then, when I was in Transnet, Group Chef Strategic 
Officer 
GCSCO 
brought 
the 
complete 
file 
which 
summarised…(intervention). 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Just to correct, GCSCO, is Group 
Chief Supply Chain Officer, please continue. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   So Chair, Mr Edward Thomas brought 
the file which was actually summarising everything that has happened 
in terms of identifying and appointing the successful bidder in terms of 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 109 of 223 
 
this tender and the recommendation in the file was to award to T-
Systems.  So I went through the file and you can imagine if you are new 
you really want to read each and every page and understand exactly 
how we end up to it because I was going to append my signature to it, 
it was actually in my business unit so I was the business owner so I 
had to do some due diligence and I went through the file and I think the 
procurement process and the steps that they followed I could see that 
they were actually done, however, what actually just stood out for me 
was how the recommendation was not then matching the flow of events 
as I was reading, where I would have expected that the number one 
10 
would actually be recommended then I saw the recommendation 
actually going to T-Systems. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    When you mean number one, 
number one was the outcome of what part of the process? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   So Chair once we have done the 
technical evaluation, the things that we all spoke about then there is a 
process that Transnet will call best and final offer which is the buffer, 
but when you do the buffer you would have cleared every technical 
requirement, you would have looked at it, you would have cleared the 
risks and then you say, I’m really happy to go with this two people, can 
20 
you just give me your best and final offer.  Go and sharpen your pencil, 
cross your T’s dot your I’s, give me your best price.  So at that time 
when they came back with that buffer Gajima, the was number one in 
terms of the scoring and Chair as I was reading I was expecting that 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 110 of 223 
 
the 
recommendation 
will 
actually 
talk 
to 
Gajima 
that 
the 
recommendation spoke to T-Systems instead. 
CHAIRPERSON:    In other words the report that you were going 
through to which you were supposed to append your signature, the 
reasons, the motivation or the evaluation that was evident on which it 
was based suggested that Gajima should be number one, is that what 
you are saying? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes, when I was reading it yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But when you came to the actual finding, Gajima was 
not actually number one? 
10 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:    No it was not recommended it was till 
number one but it was not recommended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh it was number one but not recommended? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes it wasn’t. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    To appreciate the difference in 
number one and number two, what were the final scores that Gajima 
scored as compared to T-Systems? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   So Chair, I think when I looked at the 
scoring, technical, let me start there if I can, when I looked at the 
20 
technical score the difference between T-Systems and Gajima, they had 
a difference of .33 percent.  So they were there and there about 
technically but…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    So they were, for all intents and purposes on the 
same level? 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 111 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   They were on the same level. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   But then when you start, of course, 
start putting in the buffers and so on I think they came and said – 
Gajima then provided now, we said to them give me your buffer and 
then Gajima came and provided a cheaper bid and the final score was 
99 percent and T-Systems then dropped to 85 percent – 85.07 percent. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    So it was not a negligible difference 
between the two in percentage scoring? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Overall? 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   No because of the price, the weighting 
on the price actually made the variance quite big but when you look at 
the technical capability they were quite close. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Okay were you made aware of any 
other reports that were to be considered in the context of this process? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   So it was during this process Chair 
when I started interrogating to say but let me understand then I was 
made aware of Gartner which is a company in Ireland, it’s best known 
for it’s analyst and research capabilities in the IT space.  So almost 
20 
every CIO will read a Gartner report if they want to actually understand 
or make a decision of some technical nature or just how to approach 
some technical work, so it was at this point then I was made aware of 
the report compiled by Gartner where they were outlining some risks in 
terms of this particular tender. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 112 of 223 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Can I then ask you to turn to 
Annexure 3 which is the Gartner report that starts on page 41 but in 
particular I ask you to go to page 49 of the bundle.  Is it 
correct…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry before you do that, just go back to 
explaining who Gartner were, how they came in to this how they came 
to play some role? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Thanks Chair, so Gartner is a 
research house there specialises mostly with information technology 
and communication services.  So they are largely seen to be 
10 
independent and they are used usually in an advisory role but when I 
joined Transnet there were two consultants who were Gartner 
consultants, they have been there before I joined and I realised they 
were then made a part of the tender evaluation process but I further 
started understanding that they actually put the tender specifications 
together as well for Transnet.  Whilst Transnet had put their own specs 
they came in and they wrote – because they were brought in just to 
quality assure the specifications but the report does say that they 
actually looked at it and they started developing new specs, 
appropriate specifications I would imagine.  So Gartner is really a 
20 
research house it’s made up of analysts and very educated and 
experience people who actually advise on IT work. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay so in this context, Transnet would ask them for 
advice, in effect, and then to look at the bids and advise? 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 113 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Ja so in this context actually Transnet 
used them for everything so it used them to develop the specifications, 
it used them to evaluate and then it used them to summarise the 
operational risks that they perceived. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    At page 49 of this bundle appears 
two diagrams, is it correct that this particular page is actually a 
synopsis of the findings of Gartner? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes because Chair, you’ll see that it’s 
actually written under – on their letterhead and this is the – it forms 
10 
part of the Gartner report. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Can we then look at the first 
diagram on the left hand side the one that is title, reference check, 
okay, can you please explain this diagram to the Chair? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   So Chair this is now – it’s marked 
table 3 and the CFET team is now looking at T-Systems and Gajima so 
if you look at that quadrant at the bottom you have the likelihood of 
that risk happening that is on you X axis, so it starts with rare, unlikely, 
moderate and then on the Y axis you see the risk impact of that 
particular risk, is it low, is it minor, is it moderate, is it major and then 
20 
we see the two bubbles, one is blue and one is green, the green one is 
for Gajima and the blue one is for T-Systems  so overall when they 
were doing reference checks T-Systems – both T-Systems and Gajima, 
they kind of came next to each other so they had some kind of a 
moderate to a major kind of that risk happening to say the references 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 114 of 223 
 
were at that point but also you will see that it was actually at the 
unlikely point for both of them, Gajima being on the right moving 
towards moderate but they’re both unlikely. So that is the risk profile of 
the reference checks that were done by the CFET team. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    What exactly is a reference check? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   A reference check is where you 
actually, physically, you go you phone the customers or the 
clients…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Where they’ve done work. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:  Where they’ve done work and 
10 
sometimes you go and speak to them or you actually call them or you 
actually check the work that they were doing so that is what was 
actually happening so they were almost neck on neck if you look at 
that.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    If you look at the next – or rather 
the diagram to the right of that which is tilted, site visit, can you clarify 
the analysis that has been done diagrammatically there too please? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   So Chair the same application can be 
levied against this diagram which is on the right for both T-Systems and 
Gajima in terms of doing the site visits. So when you do site visits, I 
20 
come and check, you said you have a helpdesk, yes can I tough it, 
touch wood, is it there, yes, do you have people who are working on the 
helpdesk, the helpdesk agents, yes I do  have them, do you have 
engineers, how many engineers do you have so I actually do  due 
diligence check of what you do so that is part of that site visit and 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 115 of 223 
 
Chair you will see that both of them are still on the left side of the 
quadrant which is, you know, moderate and moderate to rare and 
moderate to low. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    And then lastly, the – at the bottom 
of the second block below under Gajima, reference is made to 
transition and the time period in which to transition, do you have any 
comments in relation to the comments made there? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Can you read the statement you are 
talking to? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Okay just for clarity, the bottom 
10 
part reads, 
 
“The extensive transition scope to be completed in six months 
 
as put forward in the submitted transition document falls short 
 
of the requirement which is a major risk to getting to final 
 
mode of operation in an acceptable period such that Transnet 
 
gets the benefit of the services and associated service levels 
 
as defined in the technical service towers.  Experience with 
 
this is that this requires focused projects during business as 
 
usual that require resources from both parties and is costly.  
 
Moreover, Transnet will be paying for FMO services/scope and 
20 
 
SLA’s prior to reaching FMO”, 
 
Do you have any comment to that? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes I do Chair, earlier on I mentioned 
that this was a Green Fields contract so for equity and for fairness to 
introduce this transition period of six months and start thinking that if 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 116 of 223 
 
you don’t go to final mode of operation in six months is going to be 
risky to Transnet I found it irrelevant Chair and that is why I was saying 
some of the risks, I found them immaterial and irrelevant because at 
this point any new bidder will have to actually first take over and 
transition from the current bidder to current mode of operation before 
they can start optimising and making sure that they can now start 
working in a futuristic fashion.  So that particular comment, for me, was 
a little bit not positioned correctly or it was actually relevant because 
everyone was starting as a Green Field so we can’t be bringing it now 
at this point. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    So it was a factor that was inconsistent with the role 
that the adjudication would be based on the Green Field principle. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Because now you’re bringing that. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So one would want a justification for it to say, but 
that’s in breach of the Green Field principle as it were so why are you 
bringing it in? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And I take it it’s something you did raise and you 
20 
will deal with that? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   I think that is one of the things that 
was actually creating such a turmoil in my mind to say but this thing is 
not making logic. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Were any of these risks in relation 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 117 of 223 
 
– as identified in this report new? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   The risks as identified, in my view, 
were not new, all of them. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Can I then ask you to turn to the 
bundle, the little bundle next to you by Mr Volmink which is marked part 
of Exhibit BB2.1 can I ask you to turn to page 705, for the record Chair 
paragraph 
14.3 
deals 
with 
the 
quotation 
system, 
request 
for 
quotation/CIDB quotation procedure and that’s on page 702, in 
particular on page 705 paragraph 14.3.9 talks to process and more 
specifically paragraph D reads, 
10 
 
“As a general rule quotations are to be evaluated on the basis 
 
of price and BBBEE where there are opportunities to include 
 
SD either as an objective criterion a threshold or pre-
 
qualification criterion SD, supplier development should also be 
 
included in the bid.    In the event that technical evaluation is 
 
also necessary the technical evaluation criteria must be pre-
 
determined and included in the RFQ document.  Importantly, 
 
that’s my emphasis, the highest scoring bidder is to be 
 
selected as the successful bidder unless there is objective 
 
criteria justify presumably to justify the award to another 
20 
 
bidder”. 
 
If I can then ask you to turn to page 783 please of the same 
bundle. Chair for the record this falls – paragraph 18.7 deals 
with…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said 783 hey? 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 118 of 223 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Correct Chair, paragraph 18.7 deals 
with recommendations and in particular on page…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that 18.7.2 oh it’s all recommendations from 
earlier? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    So at paragraph – as Chair has 
pointed out paragraph 18.7.2 talks to the recommendation to the AC, 
and 
in 
particular 
paragraph 
18.7.3 
deals 
with 
reasons 
for 
recommendation more specifically sub-paragraph B reads that, 
10 
 
“The bid with the highest score must be selected unless there 
 
are subjective criteria other than the criteria used to evaluate 
 
the bid that justify the award to another bidder, this discretion 
 
must be exercised sparingly.  Examples which would justify the 
 
award to a bidder other than the highest ranked bidder 
 
includes the following, and just by way of an example 
 
reference is made to supplier development which is envisaged 
 
as an objective criterion, risk assessment which indicates that 
 
there’s material risk involved in awarding the business to the 
 
highest ranked bidder and so forth”, 
20 
 
Below the bullets on page 784 for the record it reads, 
 
“that if a bid other than the bid with the overall highest score 
 
is selected the recommending committee shall provide a full 
 
explanation for this decision and state which objective criteria 
 
are relied upon to justify the recommendation of such bid as a 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 119 of 223 
 
 
general rule where the overall highest scoring bidder is 
 
overlooked based on  objective criteria the second  ranked 
 
bidder 
must 
be 
considered 
for 
recommendation 
 
thereafter”, 
 
And for the sake of completion Chair, on page 788 of the same 
bundle which addresses bidder adjudication paragraph 20.2 which talks 
to the role of the AC during adjudication, below the first paragraph it 
reads, 
 
“Factors to be considered during adjudication include whether, 
 
and more specifically at paragraph 20.2.6, the recommended 
10 
 
bidder scored the highest points overall, if not whether the 
 
recommendation to award the contract to another bidder is 
 
based on other objective criteria”, 
 
Ms Mosidi the risk that were identified in the Gartner report did 
they constitute objective criteria in your understanding and experience? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   So Chair they did not constitute 
objective criteria in my understanding, the PPP which is the preferred 
procurement policy of Transnet.  it states clearly what an objective 
criteria should be and it’s those things that must actually remain 
objective because when you evaluate a tender right from the beginning, 
20 
you have pre-determined evaluation criteria that you are going to use, 
you cannot then use that pre-evaluation criteria again and apply it as 
an objective criteria.  So the technical risks that were raised they were 
actually talking to the pre-adjudication criteria but when you look at the 
PPP for example it gives us real examples of what an objective criteria 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 120 of 223 
 
will be, for example whilst at the end of the process a company is now 
going insolvent, that’s reason enough there’s nothing you can do about 
it or if maybe it applies for business rescue you are actually… 
It states clearly what an objective criteria should be and it is those 
things that must actually remain objective.  Because when you evaluate 
a tender right from the beginning you have pre-determined evaluation 
criteria that you are going to use.  You cannot then use that pre-
evaluation criteria again and apply it as an objective criteria.  So the 
technical risks that were raised they were actually talking to the pre-
adjudication criteria but when you look at the PPP for example it gives 
10 
us real examples of what an objective criteria will be.  For example 
whilst at the end of the process a company’s is now going insolvent 
that is reason enough there is nothing that we can do about it.  Or if 
maybe if it applies for business rescue you are actually – ja as a 
responsible person you will have to actually look at it and say we 
cannot actually give them this.  Or for example treasury it does list 
those companies that get listed as not qualifying to bid for government 
business.  If you suddenly appear on that list it is objective.  We will 
have to apply that but not in terms of the risks that have been 
articulated in this one. 
20 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Just for record purposes you refer to 
PPP do you perhaps mean PPM which is the Procurement Procedures 
Manual that is the document that we have just referred to? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair I think it is the PPM 
there are just too many acronyms.  Ja. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 121 of 223 
 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Were you then called we 
going back now to page 9 of your statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry before you do that you mentioned that I 
think you said the PPM. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes it is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Contains exactly what it is that would make a criterion 
objective or whatever but you did not deal with what those are to the 
extent that they are relevant to your answer that here these risks were 
not objective.  Do you want to just say because this was missing, this 
was missing, this was missing, that is therefore they fell outside of the 
10 
definition of objective that you are talking about. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Okay.  So Chair all the risks that 
were actually articulated and presented they all spoke to the technical 
capability, the ability to transition, the project scope and just what it 
will mean in terms of convene – cancellation of the contract for 
convenience.  For example where Transnet is saying if we cancel out of 
convenience how much will – for me that is not a risk it is not objective.  
Right.  So those were the risks that were actually articulated. But when 
you look at what PPM advises and counsels it gives us examples which 
I think as you start reading them you understand when they say 
20 
objective.  For example is one of these companies actually going 
insolvent, no there was nothing like that.  Is one of them actually 
mentioned in the treasury list of blacklisting?  No there was nothing 
like that.  Was there any of the companies actually applying for 
business rescue?  None of the companies was doing that.  Was it 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 122 of 223 
 
actually found at fault by the competition commission for example – so 
they give those examples that are not really pertaining to the 
operational aspect of the tender? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Those are objective criteria. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And all the risks that were 
mentioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  They were not actually talking to 
10 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  So Ms Mosidi you were presented with 
this file, you had raised – you had certain concerns about this file that 
was given to you by Mr Thomas in relation to this tender.  Were you 
then called to a meeting during September of 2016 in relation to the 
adjudi – to consideration of this tender?  We are now on page 9 of your 
statement. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes just so – here am I with a 
file.  I am not able to agree with this file and it need to progress to the 
20 
next stage.  Okay so the recommendation is not in line with what I was 
expecting it to be.  So then there was a meeting that was – actually I  
was called into a meeting into – there is a boardroom that I used to use 
as a group CIO and there was a meeting there.  A lot of people were in 
there.  Some of their names is – I have mentioned there Chair in terms 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 123 of 223 
 
of the individuals who were in the meeting and most of them – okay two 
of them were from procurement and then there was a guy who was 
coming from governance where they were actually trying to make sure 
that I get – I get to sign the recommendation.  So they were giving 
clarity.  Chair I will keep on saying because I was new and yes I was 
still new and still trying to actually know the individuals and their 
personalities yes so I was asking okay the recommendation is not in 
line with the outcome of the evaluation what is my role, why do I have 
to sign because I actually disagree with it?  And I remember quite 
clearly that Mr Maluleke was saying look you as a Group CIO you have 
10 
appointed the cross-functional evaluation team.  They represent you.  
They have recommended the way the recommendation is standing.  So I 
– I even asked – so my job is just to sign this thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who was Mr Maluleke let us understand that? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Mr Maluleke was one of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the scheme of things. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Was – ja he was the contract 
manager from procurement for this particular contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So he was really the overseer in 
20 
terms of all those who were evaluating. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  And if I could just interrupt you.  The 
full name for Mr Maluleke is? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Is MacDonald – It is MacDonald 
Maluleke.   
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 124 of 223 
 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  And who else was present at this 
meeting? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  There was Mr Pheladi Xaba who 
was also working with Mr MacDonald Maluleke. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay now I may have missed something.  There was a 
meeting – was it in a meeting with other people where Mr Maluleke was 
saying this to you? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and the people that were attending the meeting 
were all the people concerned with the recommendation and this 
10 
tender? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja.  So the people who were 
attending were all people who were actually involved in one way or the 
other. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  With this particular tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  For example you will have Mr 
Maluleke who was the contract manager. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  You will have Ms Xaba who was 
also a strategic sourcing person who was working with Mr Maluleke on 
this particular tender.  And then there would be Mr Thulajni Mtshwene 
who was from governance.  You remember I was talking about the high 
value tender and the report that must actually go with and then was – I 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 125 of 223 
 
think there was Martin who was actually in my office.  Mr Martin 
Sehlapelo who was actually – so it was a collection of people who were 
trying to conclude the – this particular tender by actually securing a 
signature from a Group CIO because I was the business owner of the 
tender. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did these people constitute a team?  A 
pro – or rather were they involved in any fashion as the – as members 
of the cross-functional evaluation team? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  In that meeting there was no 
member 
cross-functional 
evaluation 
team 
according 
to 
my 
10 
understanding.  Mr Xaba was the person who was putting the 
documents together and making sure that you know the writing of the 
recommendation is done properly and so on.  Mr Maluleke was the 
overseer in terms of the whole procurement process.  I am not sure 
Chair if I can say who was the chairman of that CFET but he was 
actually the one who was overseeing the whole process to make sure 
that it draws to a conclusion.   
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  It is understood that Mr MacDonald 
Maluleke was in fact the chair of the CFET. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Were the people who were attending that 
20 
meeting people from within your department?  In other words under 
your section, your unit or were they people from outside your 
department? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So Chair my recollection I just 
remembered that there was one person from my department who was 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 126 of 223 
 
Mr Martin Sehlapelo he was the executive manager in the office of the 
Group Chief Information Officer in my office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  He was in that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I – can I ask you then what 
exactly was required of you at this meeting? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So at this meeting Chair there 
was a memorandum which was prepared. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You called the meeting? 
10 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  You did not call the meeting? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  No I did not call the meeting 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who called the meeting if you can recall? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  If I can recall Chair Mr Maluleke 
called the meeting because now I am – I had the file.  I did not sign 
and they had to explain to me certain things so that I can comfortably 
sign if I have to sign. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you had communicated to some of the people 
20 
your uneasiness or reservations about signing? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  To be direct Chair yes I had a 
number of questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And as a result of that a meeting was called? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes the meeting was convened 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 127 of 223 
 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And now we are at the meeting. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Now we are at the meeting 
Chair.   
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I then ask you to turn to page 29 
please of the same bundle?  It appears to be a memorandum from Mr 
Garry Pita, yourself and Mr Edward Thomas to Mr Siyabonga Gama.  
And the purpose of the commission – of the submission sorry at 
paragraph 1 of this document is to request the Group Chief Executive 
to amongst other things approve the award of business to T-Systems 
10 
SA Pty Ltd.  Can I ask you to turn to page 39 of the same bundle?  It 
appears to be signed by many persons other than Mr Siyabonga Gama 
and Mr Garry Pita.  Do you recognise this document Ms Mosidi? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair I recognise the document. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is this in fact the memorandum that 
was presented to you at that meeting? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair it was the memorandum 
that was presented. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  So despite … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second.  What you had read before the 
20 
meeting that you were uneasy about signing was a report, it was not 
this?  It was not this memorandum? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  No so this memorandum was 
brought in in that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:    At that meeting? 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 128 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes for me to sign. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now what you had read before… 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it a report? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It was a whole file yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja – oh a whole file? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja, ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But with the document where if you agreed you would 
sign? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright but this memorandum was presented to 
you at that meeting? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So – yes.  So Chair because I 
had some questions and queries and that I wanted to clear I had not 
signed the memorandum.  So now we have – we are now in a 
boardroom now the memorandum is brought through and they wanted to 
understand what my concerns were.  So that is when I was asking 
about this recommendation, how misaligned it is to how this thing has 
evolved and just what my role is because if I cannot overrule cross-
functional evaluation team because it represents me then I have no role 
20 
to play on this thing and those are the few questions I was actually 
trying to get clarity on.  Ja… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You sought clarity because you were new? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja I was new and I was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is the reason that you did not understand ja. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 129 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And I was saying – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Some of the things. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Let me not delay operations of 
Transnet because of my being a new beanie and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So Chair I suppose this part is 
embarrassing because then after I understood and I knew that I was not 
actually in agreement with that memorandum that she has just 
confirmed that is the memorandum that I see.  Chair you will notice that 
I actually signed… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am sorry before you come to the memorandum I 
want to hear how the meeting was discussing issues, I want that.  
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how you – how the – at what stage the 
memorandum comes up whether it comes up at the beginning and so 
on.  I want to hear that. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Okay.  So Chair the trigger for 
this meeting was my having not being able to sign and agree with the 
recommendation based on the file that Mr Thomas brought to my office.  
And subsequent to my having read all the processes, the procurement 
20 
procedures that they followed the – how they applied the evaluation, 
how they applied the risk I still could not understand why then was 
Gijima not the recommended bidder.  But also I wanted to understand 
my role in this whole process because – so I say to Mr Maluleke okay 
so now the cross-function – so he says Makano it is not me who 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 130 of 223 
 
recommended this it is you.  So I said but me?  He says yes because 
the cross-functional evaluation team represent you.  You have 
appointed them as a Group CIO they do the work that the technical 
work that you must do.  I am not a technical person your team is and 
they have recommended this.  So you want to go against yourself?  In 
other words you know.  And it was not – it was one of the most 
unpleasant meetings because my whole being was saying the flow of 
logic was not making sense.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja because if they are making – if they are you why 
are they not making the decision. 
10 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why are they making a recommendation to you? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Exactly Chair.  So but he was 
actually saying that is you.  Now in my confusion I just feel like – I 
cannot just be here like a beautiful flowerpot on the table and sign.  So 
whilst I have noted the contents of this I still have to make my 
discomfort and my displeasure known in terms of this memorandum.  
Whilst people can agree that cross-functional evaluation team 
represents you and they have recommended this my views must be 
known.  And then of course Chair you will notice that I actually signed.  
20 
And I will sit here and say I signed under duress I still remember that 
to say, why am I signing I do not want to sign this.  But at the same 
time I do not want to delay the process.  You know there is work at 
hand to be done so can I – let me not be the impediment purely 
because I am new. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 131 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was it like everybody saw no problem and you 
are the only one who saw a problem in this meeting? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair my gut and my feeling of 
the meeting in the room people were not really coming out, people were 
quiet.  It was me and Mr Maluleke actually exchanging. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And I saw this silence a little bit 
to say but people were… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  People were you know – and I 
10 
was really hoping that Mr Mtshwene will come through because he was 
from governance as well but he was also very cautious in terms of what 
it is and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So it was more me and Mr 
Maluleke who were trying to clarify each other and make sure that we 
actually land at a common place to say let us do this thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  This way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So Chair you will see my 
signature on that memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there was – there was not much discussion other 
than the discussion between you and Mr Maluleke at that meeting? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  A lot of people did not come into 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 132 of 223 
 
the discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In – articulate any views?  Ja. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And I think Mr Maluleke’s cue 
was really strengthened by the Gartner Report that he was referring to 
about the risks which to me it was a moot point because those risks 
were actually not objective criteria to be applied.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to go back to where your signature is.  
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It is on… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is that? 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  The signature is on… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I found it 30? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  39 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see it is one o’clock maybe let us just finish this 
part if possible. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  No problem Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so you signed there and you said see my 
questions attached, is that right? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is where you wanted to record your 
concerns? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So I… 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 133 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  I made those two points. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can you – for the record can you just 
read those points into record please? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Okay. 
“The risk as captured can be easily mitigated by the 
Group Information and Communications Technology.” 
The second comment was: 
“Bidder 2 is cheaper can deliver against the 
requirements and has the right country profile.” 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And are you able to read the note made by Mr Thulani 
Mtshwene along his signature or are you not able to read?  I see 
something HVT Report is satisfactory. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that… 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Objective criteria. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I cannot read… 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  I could not read it well Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair I may be able to assist based on 
20 
a communication that we have received which is under process though. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that is that it informs that he 
support was conditional and the writing there was that the high value 
tender report supported the recommendation and that objective criteria 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 134 of 223 
 
was applied as I advised per Annexure T – as advise per Annexure 
TLM03. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So Mr Mtshwene’s signature was conditional.  His 
support was conditional is that what it amounts to? 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Which – which may suggest he had certain 
question marks as well? 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Certain reservation yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Certain reservations yes.  And how did the meeting 
end once – you signed at the meeting or subsequently? 
10 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair I signed at the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And they left with the 
memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And I stayed with my discomfort. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Just one last question then before we 
adjourn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just before that I think she wants to complete 
20 
something? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja I wanted to say so Chair it is 
very difficult to do what you think is actually wrong.  So yes I had 
appended this signature, yes I had made comments but I had a strong 
sense that I must now give the detail of why I am saying those risks are 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 135 of 223 
 
not risks at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So I went ahead. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Sat in my office and started 
actually putting apart each and every risk that mentioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And why in my view and my take 
and my experience those were not risks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja so I prepared that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And I was ready with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So I gave it – I printed it out and 
I gave it to the manager in Mr Gama’s office Mr Gama was my boss and 
unfortunately I cannot find a copy of this because I gave it to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  I had a copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  But I can still explain what the 
risks are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Because they were actually 
coming from my mind in terms of responding. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 136 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So I did try to support.  His 
advice was that you are going to have an opportunity to give the detail 
of the risks.  You may want to keep your document and when the time 
comes you will actually give that detail to say why do you think that the 
risks are not … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was Mr Gama’s advice? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja that was Mr Gama’s business 
manager. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the advice from Mr Gama’s business manager. 
10 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Mr Mboniso.  Mr Mobiniso 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But once you had recommended – once you had 
approved the recommendation if the recommendation was accepted 
where was there going to be a chance to talk about these reservations 
again?  I do not understand that with his advice to you. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja so Chair perhaps on 
hindsight I am saying perhaps because this process after I had signed 
it looked like it went into a dark hole because then you would see that 
20 
Mr Pita never signed and Mr Gama.  Perhaps they actually took my 
notes into cognisance to say there is some reservation can we clarify 
that first? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Perhaps he knew just how Mr 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 137 of 223 
 
Gama’s mind worked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Perhaps he knew that Mr Gama 
wanted watertight things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Before he can actually … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  But at that time of course I took 
his counsel and I kept my memorandum – I kept my details. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No thank you.  Let us take the lunch 
10 
adjournment.  We – it is about eight minutes past one we will resume at 
ten past two.  
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we adjourn. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Thanks Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Before 
the 
long 
adjournment 
Ms Mosidi you were talking specific to the recommendation that was 
20 
placed before you as addressed at a particular meeting calling for your 
signature of the document.  Just to close that off can I ask you to look 
at page 39 of the bundle and that is the signature page of that 
document?  The first signature on the left hand side on top is by an 
Ms Pheladi Xaba and the title of the title of this particular individual is 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 138 of 223 
 
Commodity Manager Group Strategic Sourcing.  Ms Xaba had signed 
the document.  Is that correct? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes ma’am. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  One question – the very position of 
Commodity Manager Group Strategic Sourcing is it an administrative 
role or who would you describe the role of that particular position to the 
process? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair I think my understanding 
of that role and having then read the PPM as well. That role is as sub 
process within the contract management role which entails a whole lot 
10 
of things including administrative but it also includes things like when 
the contract is actually getting to an end you actually prepare a 
memorandum to request for an extension which means that you will 
have to also understand the content of that particular tender.  So it 
goes a little bit beyond the administrative role of just writing minutes 
and putting things together but it is my understanding that it actually 
has the contract management angle to it and to be able to also just 
help with the processing of tenders and their validity at anyone point in 
time. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Can I then take you back 
20 
to page 11 of the bundle? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you do so you spoke before lunch about the 
memorandum that you took to Mr Gama where you – as I understand 
what you said – where you put your views rather comprehensively or 
more comprehensively than the comments you made on the last page of 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 139 of 223 
 
the memorandum ending at page 39 and you said that memorandum you 
cannot find a copy thereof anymore.  Is there anything I should know 
about the content of that memorandum other than the points you 
articulated at the bottom of page 39?  Is there anything you want to say 
as to that is important in terms of the contents thereof? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair yes.  The memorandum 
aims to give the detail of the risks and my understanding of the risks 
and my take that they are not as material but also some of them are 
actually irrelevant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Now some of the risks that were 
raised Chair and maybe for your noting as well … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  I think is one just overall … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  The risks were mostly pertaining 
to the project scope … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Or the technical … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The operational matters I think you also said as well. 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair and – but it also 
included some administrative things like … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 140 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  If Transnet out of preference 
and choice cancels this tender what do - will Transnet be liable for … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  In terms of this contract.  Now 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It is a question that you ask 
everyone I suppose in terms of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  For one reason or the other if 
10 
out of convenience we want to cancel this and what was highlighted as 
a risk and I was saying it cannot be a risk to be applied. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It is a scenario planning of some 
sort … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Where you are saying if this 
happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It is not Gijima saying oh we 
20 
want 400 and whatever million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So it is – it is such – the other 
risk I think it was pertaining to just how Gijima wanted to transition and 
how they found the data centre that Gijima was going to use.  They 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 141 of 223 
 
found the wrecks empty and they did not think that it is as operational 
and my point is that it is not out of practice. You cannot stock up your 
dealer centre and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And buy switches and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Routers and all the processing 
powers and storage devices if you do not have a client. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So what you do once the client 
10 
is secured you actually order … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And yes you will have a lit 
period … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Of that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And when we met with – with 
Gijima when I was given the opportunity to actually clarify the whole 
position in terms of the data centre they actually explained they came 
20 
with their partners.  They had already even pre ordered the equipment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So I think my memorandum - if I 
recall clearly – I was trying to give the detail of all that to say … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 142 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  We cannot therefore apply this 
as risks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Thanks Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you and just to give me maybe an even clearer 
picture of where – what your view was.  Out of 100 what would you 
more or less have given Gijima and what would have given T-Systems 
more or less in terms of your own assessment? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  I think Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  How far apart were there in your view taking into 
10 
account risks that were taken into account by other people who you 
thought should not have been taken into account? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes.  I – I think for me Chair if I 
look at how the evolution has happened the kind of things they looked 
at the different (indistinct) was going to be price because with 
outsource contracts you really have a big margin to play with because 
how they work.  If you employ me as a database administrator I can 
actually service 10 customers.  So the economics of scale benefit is 
quite massive.  So I was not surprised that they actually slashed off the 
price by 500 or whatever it is that they slashed it with. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  
So for me that was the 
difference to say who is coming in cost effectively for me … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Because technically they were 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 143 of 223 
 
neck on neck (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  So – so – but you say because of the 
reduction of their price … 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The difference between them and T-Systems became 
quite big? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It became quite big because of 
that BAFO stage … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Where they were actually given 
10 
an opportunity to give the Best … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And Final Offer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  At paragraph 27 on 
page 11 of your statement you inform that you were provided with an 
anonymous letter from your colleague – your then colleague – 
Ms Disebo Moephuli.  Can you please explain the circumstances under 
which this anonymous letter was shared with you? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Okay.  So Chair now the process 
20 
towards the end of this evaluation and adjudication of this tender is 
well under way.  There are memorandums that are presented.  I have 
my own misgivings in terms of this memorandum.  I can pick up 
discomfort from people inside the meeting that they are not actually 
speaking loud.  It is like – it is my only meeting here and in that whole 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 144 of 223 
 
time when these things happened then there is this anonymous letter 
that gets given to the Group CCRO – Chief Compliance Risk Offer. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Just to correct you it is the Chief 
Corporate and Regulatory Officer. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI: 
 
Oh, 
Chief 
Corporate 
and 
Regulatory Officer. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So who was sitting with me on 
the same EXCO table of Mr Gama. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This no Ms Disebo …? 
10 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Disebo Moephuli on page 11. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Moephuli, okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The statement says Chief Risk Officer but you say 
that is – that is not correct? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Apologies Chair.  It is actually in the 
letter which we will turn to shortly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  That was the description of the 
position. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but what I am saying is what is in the statement 
you say may not be correct – that description? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Let me rather just double check. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not sure.  What is your recollection 
Ms Mosidi? 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 145 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  I think it is CCRO.  So that 
CCRO Chair I am certain of it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes). 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  But I do not what it – I thought it 
says Chief Compliance … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Compliance … 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And Risk Officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Risk – okay.  No that is fine, okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And Ms Moephuli was not the 
one who is manning what we used to call a – a hotline – what did they 
call it?  Where people would register their complaints anonymously. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She – she was not that person? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  She was not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  She was just the Head of CC – 
of Compliance and Risk … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And I think she - she was known 
for acting quickly and dealing with things the right way and so on and I 
think that is why this faceless group actually wrote this letter to her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because they would have perceived her as a possible 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 146 of 223 
 
stumbling block in the sense that once – at a certain stage she might 
say no, no there is something wrong here? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes.  They had perceived her as 
someone who is frank and straight … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And who would actually deal 
with something that they raised.  So she received … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it was directed go her – at her? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It was – it was given to her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In that instance can I then ask you to 
turn to page 67 of the bundle? 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  Do you recognise 
this document as the anonymous letter Ms Mosidi? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair.  I – I do. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair due to the gravity of some of 
the allegations stated in this letter and in particular to the events that 
unfold there are certain aspects that I will read into the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Due to the seriousness of allegations 
contained in this anonymous letter … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And how it is to be considered in 
view of the events that unfold there are certain portions of this letter 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 147 of 223 
 
that I will read out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let – let the witness read them.  If she might 
wish to highlight certain aspects that she will not read - read out and 
then read out those that are important. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No problem Chair.  Ms Mosidi this 
letter is the letter that is dated 5 October 2016.  Can I ask you to read 
and unfortunately the paragraphs are not numbered but the fourth 
paragraph starting with: 
“We were happy …” 
Down to the third last paragraph: 
10 
“…with this letter from the Evaluation Team.” 
Can I ask you to read that into the record please? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Thanks Chair. 
“We were happy with the open and transparent 
manner in which the various stages of the tender 
evaluation process up to stage 5 which is a BAFO 
were undertaken and followed in line with the 
tender.  After the technical evaluation as per the 
defined process we conducted a due diligence on 
both T-Systems and Gijima where both companies 
20 
satisfied the tender requirements.  Thereafter both 
parties were requested to price BAFO as green-
fields in order to level the playing field as per the 
tender requirement.  However post BAFO we were 
surprised that the Evaluation Team Leaders raised 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 148 of 223 
 
technical issues about bidder Gijima and engaged 
in a new process not defined in the tender nor in 
our Transnet Processes.  This was a huge surprise 
as Gijima came in almost R230 million cheaper than 
T-Systems yet we were questioning how they could 
deliver at their tender price.  This new process 
included a mail or a letter being sent to Bidder 
Gijima to now respond to the so called identified 
risks and respond by mitigating these risks as well 
as to new terminologies not part of the tender 
10 
document namely current mode of operation and 
future mode of operation.  This letter from the 
Evaluation Team Leaders raised our concern that 
the process post BAFO was now a new one.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I then ask you to please read 
the last paragraph on this page? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  “These new conditions 
are not only new but do not make any sense.  How 
can a new bidder ever submit a bid price for an 
FMO - which is Final Mode of Operation - without 
20 
having had the opportunity to manage what is 
required by both the tender and draft MSA – Master 
Services Agreement?  This is not only bizarre but a 
deliberate ploy to bring T-Systems through a 
backdoor to win a contract they are losing on 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 149 of 223 
 
merit.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If you can then turn the page – the 
first four short paragraphs on top please read that into the record if you 
may? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  “To us a group of more 
than 12 persons the interactions and lobbying post 
BAFO by the Evaluation Team Leaders indicated 
that whilst on merit alone Bidder Gijima are the just 
winners.  The new process undertaken which 
included voting was a clear ploy to go against the 
10 
tender evaluation process and find ways to ensure 
that the current incumbent succeeds no matter that 
they are over R230 million more expensive.  The 
voting 
after 
BAFO 
in 
particular 
was 
found 
concerning by many of us and as we were spoken to 
before we were called to the urgent voting meeting 
and bulldozed to vote.  Out of fear of losing our 
jobs we voted in favour as per Lead McDonald who 
claimed the bosses wanted the current incumbent to 
succeed.  Many of us have silently the new process 
20 
pushed down our throats as unlawful and an attempt 
to rig the results.  If the intention was …” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In fact … 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Is it fine? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In fact – yes if you could then go 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 150 of 223 
 
down to the paragraph which is third from the bottom beginning with: 
“We are amazed …” 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  “We are amazed at the 
floating of the tender process where we prejudice a 
local company that scored high on technical, 
BBBEE and financial as the tender criteria.  This is 
what we know as the only criteria that Transnet 
uses in evaluating tenders on the 90/10 principle 
but for this tender every rule in the book is being 
ignored on changed in order to arrive at a different 
10 
decision.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I then ask you to turn the page 69 
and read the second paragraph into the record please. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  “We are also aware 
that legal was not happy with this new process to 
eliminate a deserving local company.  Legal was 
also concerned about the use of the so called future 
mode of operation as this fly in the face of 
fairness.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
If 
you 
could 
then 
go 
three 
20 
paragraphs down to: 
“We do not want to see …” 
And read that and the following two paragraphs into the record please. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  “We do not want to 
see negative news media articles about tender 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 151 of 223 
 
irregularities being printed about this tender.  When 
all we tried to do what is right and expected of us is 
not BAFO flouted within impunity in the name of the 
bosses.  This kind of behaviour will ensure that we 
have a case to answer to and we do not want to be 
a party to such disregard of the procurement rules.  
Transnet’s governance and PFMA as Bidder Gijima 
may approach the courts.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then if I could take you down to 
the paragraph which begins with: 
10 
“The question that is glaring then …” 
And kindly read the – the two paragraphs. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  “The question that is 
glaring then is who stands to benefit here.  
Transnet will definitely be the loser here from the 
media 
scrutiny 
and 
failing 
our 
transformation 
agenda where a local company is on top on merit.  
The issue of state capture is topical amongst State 
Owned Entities and we do not want to add fuel to 
the fire where a service provider who lost is 
20 
retained at all costs.  We are concerned our team 
leaders find nothing wrong in bringing Transnet into 
disrepute and want to divert from the tender award 
process knowingly.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And finally the last paragraph on this 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 152 of 223 
 
page please. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  “As we were told it is 
an instruction from the top who amongst are senior 
bosses are driving the manipulation of the tender 
evaluation process and why is the question.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Were you aware of this 
letter before it was provided to you by Ms Disebo Moephuli? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  No Chair.  The first time I came 
across this letter was when I was given it by Ms Moephuli as the CCRO. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What did you make of this letter 
10 
when you were provided a copy of it? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  I think the first thing Chair 
because of my discomfort right through the process it did actually start 
making me more alert to scrutinise and to understand and I started 
feeling like perhaps there are some points which are written in white 
ink because you cannot read them anywhere that I should be aware of 
but if anything it made me confident that my sense that the risks as 
applied were post and were not as material.  It started making a bit of 
sense and giving me a little bit of confidence because initially I was 
really in a – in a spin because I was not sure whether I was seeing 
20 
things or whether my newness was playing games with my mind. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Reference is made to the word 
“bosses” in this letter.  In your understanding who might “bosses” have 
been referring? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So Chair “bosses” in my own 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 153 of 223 
 
interpretation – I was also a boss and I think it was confusing because 
I did not want anything of anybody.  I just wanted to be objective.  
However even those who were members of the GLT which was called 
the Group Leadership Team and you can read into that as the Group 
EXCO of Transnet.  They would be bosses as well but the sub 
committees of the Board as well would be bosses because – and of 
course the Board of Transnet would be bosses as well.  So the whole 
Executive layer would be branded bosses - in my view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the – it would appear the end of that letter that it 
came from employees of Transnet if what they wrote is true. 
10 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It would appear Chair that it 
came from the employees of Transnet in particular it came from of the 
some Cross Functional Evaluation Team … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Who were actually kind of forced 
to vote … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And to recommend certain 
things … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Because the bosses told them 
to.  So the bosses would not have told them to someone who was 
external. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It had to be someone from 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 154 of 223 
 
Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm and when reading the letter and knowing the 
discussion at the meeting at which you were raising your reservations 
about the approving the recommendation do you think that some of the 
people who wrote the letter may have been in that meeting or not 
necessarily? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I hear they talk about meetings where they were 
forced to vote but it could be other meetings of course. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair I do not think they would 
10 
have been in my meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They would not have been in that meeting? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They - they must be talking about other meetings? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Other meetings as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  Around this time were 
you invited by Mr Siyabonga Gama to a meeting after hours at all? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair I was invited by 
Mr Gama to a meeting in Tintswalo Hotel. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  What hotel? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Tintswalo Hotel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It is in Sunninghill. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when in relation to your becoming aware of this 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 155 of 223 
 
letter was that? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  No Chair it is not even related 
to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not related? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please explain the circumstances 
under which you were invited to this meeting. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So Chair whilst the whole … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am – I am sorry.  If that question is taking you to a 
10 
meeting with a Mr Gama that is unrelated to this letter … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I would want first to know what happened, what did 
you do after becoming aware of this letter and do you know whether 
any steps were taken by anybody including yourself to act on its 
contents. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Okay.  So Chair in Transnet 
there is a – there is a hotline – I do not know why I have forgotten the 
name of the hotline – but a hotline where people can anonymously 
register … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Report issues. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI: 
 
Suspicious 
corruption 
or 
anything … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  That without risking to be 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 156 of 223 
 
victimised and this letter was not sent to that hotline. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  This letter was given to one of 
the Executives which is Ms Moephuli.  So Ms Moephuli looked at it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It is a tender that pertains to my 
business unit.  She gives it to me to share and I say to her so what is 
going to happen.  So she responded to the anonymous email to say I 
am available to discuss further but she also gave it to the Internal Audit 
Section of Transnet so that they can start the forensics.  As Executives 
10 
– as an Executive we are allowed to actually institute a forensic 
process as and when you deemed it was necessary.  Of course you 
would let the Group Chief Executive know that you are going to do that.  
So she actually undertook that process and made sure that internal 
audit together with the forensic auditors will actually investigate this 
letter further but nothing came out of it because as I learnt later that 
forensic process was stopped for one reason or the other and so she 
never knew the outcome of the letter and so I never knew the outcome 
of the letter too. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay thank you. 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am – I am hoping that somewhere somebody will tell 
me more about who stopped that investigation and why.  So … 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 157 of 223 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I will … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Either there is an existing witness who will deal with 
that or if not steps should be taken to try and get clarification. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Noted Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Going back to the invite to the 
meeting by Mr Siyabonga Gama at Tintswalo Hotel.  Please describe 
the circumstances, the time of day and the reasons why this particular 
meeting – why you were invited to this particular meeting. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So Chair around this time before 
10 
Mr Gama called me to a meeting we were out in Esselen Park which is 
a campus of Transnet and the tensions about the tender were playing 
out because he was aware that as Executives we were not agreeing.  
Remember Chair I am the business owner running IT.  Mr Garry Pita is 
the business head heading up procurement.  So – so we were coming 
with different recommendations for one reason or the other that I have 
explained earlier and I was quite convinced and I was quite resolute 
that my view is correct until someone shows me my blind spot which I 
was not having at the time and so we – we finished.  It was our EXCO.  
We finished and I think on or around half past seven before eight in the 
20 
evening Mr Gama called me and said Makano can we just have a 
meeting – meet in Tintswalo because I live in that area Chair and I 
went to the meeting.  It was - it was dark already and I went to 
Tintswalo and – and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is after work? 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 158 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  This is after work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Which is not uncommon Chair.  
Just, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Roundabout what time (intervenes)? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Roundabout before between half 
seven and eight. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja, in the evening.  So I – I also 
called Ms Moephuli just to make her aware that look I am going to 
10 
meeting with Mr Gama.  I think there are some issues that he would like 
to – to actually understand from me.  I do not know what.  So when we 
got – when I got to Tintswalo I got there and usually I see the drivers 
and I know that I’m at the right place and I couldn’t find anybody and I 
was looking and at the end I found Mr Gama sitting alone, you know 
and the Chairs there are quite long so you won’t actually be visible 
from the door so I thought the whole room was empty, so I’m looking 
and I’m not finding him but finally I see him and he’s sitting there and 
he’s waiting for me, but maybe because he’s a short man, his head was 
just up to here to the chair and  so I, good evening sir and  he then 
20 
said look Makano I just want to understand that one, you are convinced 
that your decision about T-Systems is the right one, two, remember 
procurement is dangerous, it’s a very dangerous process.  If, for 
example you scuttle a party which by now people would have shared, 
maybe five million, five million, five million and you come and you 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 159 of 223 
 
scuttle that party, you would have endangered your life so are you sure, 
are you certain have you done your due diligence in terms of 
interrogating this process, are you comfortable in terms of where you 
are going to land because I’d like to make you sensitive, as a new 
person to the dangers of procurement as well.  And I said to him yes, I 
can actually deliberate and talk to every point that I’ve raised so I’m 
quite comfortable and you can also be comfortable that I’ve done a due 
process. That meeting went on and on and Chair, when I looked back 
we spent about two and a half hours in that meeting but the main thing 
really was to see if I was quite certain about it but I felt like it went 
10 
round and round I wasn’t sure if I was missing a point but the main 
points were those, are you certain and are you comfortable, will this 
stand any test and I said yes it can. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was your immediate reaction when you made 
these – when he asked you these question? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Chair a lot of things came to my mind 
that one, is it acceptable for us to be objective because I think we have 
a role, we have a responsibility as a leadership to ensure equity, to 
apply our mind to read everything and to actually make the right 
decision because I think bad things happen when wrong decisions are 
20 
made.  So I began to start doubting to say, is he not confident in what 
I’m saying or are there other things that I have to be aware of that I’m 
not aware of.  So it did – it did rattle me to start saying, what is it that 
I’m missing because he is – he’s my boss so is he seeing things that 
I’m not seeing, it did challenge my confidence but also it challenged 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 160 of 223 
 
the environment that I’m working in because if he’s saying it’s 
dangerous, is it dangerous, you know.  Is it about, if you don’t award 
this – if you don’t award to Mr A and you award to Mr B, is there any 
danger that you have to – is it not just seen as, in the line of duty not 
to actually – so my mind went into a whirlwind but at the end of the day, 
I think my decision still stood and said, look, I can’t see it any other 
way. 
CHAIRPERSON:    By that time did you know whether he had received 
and read the memo that you had given to his business manager? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   No Chair I didn’t know actually I’ve 
10 
never…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    And from this discussion you didn’t pick it up? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   No but because I’ve always explained 
to him that this risks are misplaced and they are mostly immaterial I 
think he could have picked it up from those conversations but I wouldn’t 
know whether he actually saw the memo that I wrote. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Now were you rattled by the references to, 
procurement is dangerous and if you scuttle a tender that you – certain 
people may have already divided the proceeds among themselves that 
could be dangerous, is that the talk that rattled you or is there 
20 
something else? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   I think Chair, the talk overall rattled 
me.  One, if you say that people by now would have shared five million 
and five million and you would be, indeed crushing such a party, who 
would that be.  I was startled by would it be people that I work with 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 161 of 223 
 
would it be somebody from outside is it about – is it why we had to 
have drivers and bodyguards, you know you start thinking about, is this 
safe, is this the environment I want to be in because I’m not a 
procurement person I’m an IT operator and I want to see the impact by 
now I’m going to endanger my work and my life with this procurement 
process which is – which really is just a means to my end.  So I think I 
was rattled by those statement and what they could mean to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes well now you’ve just clarified something, you 
said you were rattled by those statements. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Earlier on you said by the whole talk and I was 
wondering if you meant the whole discussion but do you mean those 
particular statements, that’s what rattled you? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Those particular statements yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes now did he engage you on this occasion on the 
soundness or otherwise of the reasons you gave for not agreeing that 
these were genuine risks? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Chair on that particular evening we 
didn’t go into the detail of all the risks or any risks. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But did you go into some to look…(intervention). 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   We didn’t even go in to some he was 
just saying, are you sure, can I look you in the eye are you certain is 
this right, that’s what he was saying and are you aware of the danger of 
going against the tide, sort of. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Before this meeting had you had occasion to discuss 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 162 of 223 
 
with him your reasons for taking a different view had he had the benefit 
of hearing what you had to say even if he might not have read the 
memo that you sent to him? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes Chair so as a manager of mine I 
kept him appraised and abreast of developments and discussion and I 
would share and I would say, look this is looking very strange, it’s not 
making sense because of 1,2,3,4,5 this is where we are but 
procurement will actually do the submission I suppose.  So yes I did 
bring him into that discussion so that he knows exactly the 
developments that were happening. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Did he ever disagree with your reasoning on those 
occasions, did he ever say but no you are not right or I don’t see your 
point or anything like that? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   No not that I can recall Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He didn’t engage you in that way? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   In that fashion, no he just mostly 
tested my conviction of my stand. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Now that memo that you signed – you sent under 
duress, that memo, it was still – from you it was meant to go to him and 
Mr Pita is that right for them to also consider and if they agreed to 
20 
sign? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Did you – did they, ultimately sign it? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Not that particular one. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Not that particular one? 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 163 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay so at the time when you met with him at the 
hotel as far as you know, you knew they had not signed? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   I wasn’t even aware that they had not 
signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:    At that time. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   At that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh Okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   It was my understanding that they 
would have seen the memo and he would have heard my objection. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, yes. Were you still expecting some engagement 
from him on your reservations at that time or you can’t remember? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   I think Chair I always expected his 
engagement to actually decide on the right route if there were two 
routes, I expected him to look at the two route options and see which 
one is the right option. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Did you expect that since you were the – what do 
you call it, the business owner. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Since you were the business owner did you expect 
20 
that if he – since you expressed reservations before finally deciding 
which way to go he would engage you? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes I expected him to engage me 
Chair as the owner of the business.  I also expected procurement to 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 164 of 223 
 
engage me further because I was the client in that instance, they had 
to please me. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And neither engaged you? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Procurement we engaged and we 
never really agreed until we met with Gajima. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   And with him we continuously just 
engaged. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes I’m – I find the focus of discussion in your 
meeting with him a little strange, he was your boss, you reported to him 
10 
isn’t it? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
 
And 
approving 
or 
not 
approving 
that 
recommendation that was placed before you was part of your job. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And one would expect that as your boss he expected 
you to perform that function honestly and truly and not be influenced by 
any fear of anything, that’s what I would expect, did you expect the 
same? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   I expected the same Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    And – but that discussion – the questions he asked 
you or the question about, you know, dangerous, this being dangerous 
and so on, it could be dangerous if people have already divided among 
themselves who will get how many millions doesn’t appear to me to be 
the kind of question that should come from somebody who expects their 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 165 of 223 
 
subordinate to just do the right thing. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   I would agree with that Chair, that’s 
why I found it a little bit uncomfortable. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, yes and from what you have testified he didn’t 
engage you in that meeting on the basis of the merits or demerits of 
your points? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Or your point of view. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   No Chair he just engaged me overall 
in terms of the outcome of my assessment. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, yes and there had never been any serious 
engagement between the two of you on your reservations up to that 
point? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   No Chair, not really especially in that 
meeting it was just about the dangers of procurement. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So for two – for more or less two hours because I 
think you said that meeting took about two hours – more or less two 
hours he engaged you on literally the dangers of procurement. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes Chair and how people would 
behave and you know what it would mean if you do this and if you do 
20 
that and are you sure and yes, that’s why I say it was one of the 
weirdest meetings because it took so long when I checked now but all 
we discussed really was too things, are you sure and do you know the 
dangers of procurement if you scuttle a party.  So just in summary for 
those two hours that is what we did. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 166 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Did you subsequently have an opportunity to 
analyse this meeting and the discussion and try and see what you could 
make of it or not really? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Chair I tried to analyse it, I tried – I 
went over the meeting, over and over – over the discussions over and 
over again to see if maybe I was being a little bit blonde and I was not 
understanding certain things and I couldn’t – I couldn’t lay my hands on 
something. 
CHAIRPERSON:    What would you – what would be your answer if 
somebody asked you, on your analysis what was the purpose of that 
10 
meeting? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   If somebody asked me, I would give 
two views, one, either that he was actually testing as a new executive 
to Transnet whether I would do due process and whether I can stand 
even when its difficult to and stand up to any questioning or 
interrogation.  What was not actually comfortable for me was to have it 
in a hotel because as my boss we can have it anywhere, we can have it 
in the office but perhaps it was after hours right so and maybe he 
wanted to put it to be that day because I know we had an Exco meeting 
that day.  So I think for me that was the first part to say, I wish we 
20 
could discuss this more in the office perhaps even in Exco to say can 
you just share with us your conviction, this risks we’re all responsible 
for this risks can you just take us through and can we just engage with 
your views.  So I would have expected that so the call at the hotel was 
not something I was used to.  I enjoy family life and I enjoy going home 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 167 of 223 
 
so when you take me out of my family it’s not one of the most pleasant 
things that I enjoy and then the second thing, I think for me when I look 
at it, I’m thinking perhaps there’s too much mistrust right through 
Transnet, is it possible that I’m also getting some 5million and from 
someone.  Was he testing whether, are you in this party with someone 
else and if you are can we see if we can deal with you.  So those were 
the two things, is it something that he was testing or – so those were 
the two and I never got an answer and I never really asked him, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, thank you – thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Ms Mosidi, how did that meeting 
10 
end? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   That meeting – no it ended like that 
Chair where I think I had clarified to him and how he had also aired his 
views and I wasn’t sure whether I’d convinced him to the end but where 
I had given my views and he had given me his cautionary notes and I 
actually got into my car and went home. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I – part of what is exercising in my mind about the 
meeting and the questions he put to you and the fact that he was not 
engaging you on the merits of your views on the tender is, if he – if he 
was asking as I understand he was whether you were not scared that 
20 
you could be harmed because of the decision or the stand you took, 
that’s part of what I’m putting to the discussion but you can tell me 
whether you think it is a correct understanding. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    If that’s part of what he was saying to you, what was 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 168 of 223 
 
he going to say if you said actually I didn’t think of it, now that you say 
it I’m scared.  Now let’s start with whether you think what my 
understanding of part of what you’re saying is correct? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Perhaps Chair, he would have said, 
look – if I had said I didn’t really apply my mind I’m not quite confident 
and perhaps my conviction will not stand the test of interrogation, 
perhaps he would have advised me to say, I think the middle route for 
you, which is safe, is this, perhaps he would have been executive over 
me and perhaps he would have been a manager and said, look for your 
safety and for this process to conclude in a manner that it’s going to be 
10 
acceptable by all, this is the route we need to take, perhaps he was 
going to give that counsel for my safety. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But what – if you – your position was, I think it’s 
correct but I am scared, I’ve got kids or whatever the position, I’m 
scared, but there’s a certain element of speculation but it’s an 
endeavour to try and understand what the purpose of the meeting was. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Why were you asked those questions in 
circumstances where the – you had made your position quite clear even 
though you decide you had recorded your reservations but in addition 
20 
you had written something quite detailed to indicate your situation. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Chair I think it’s a situation we’ll 
never be able to answer 100% we’ll always speculate about what it 
could have been because quite frankly nothing ever scared me.  
Perhaps now looking back but then I was still excited I was still hot and 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 169 of 223 
 
wanting to do things correctly.  So perhaps at that time I had no fear at 
all but after he mentioned it I started looking around myself because I 
never – ja I never actually even thought I needed a bodyguard or 
something – I’m one of the executives who didn’t have a driver or a 
bodyguard, out of choice of course I never really wanted – but after 
that I started thinking, is this something that I need to consider.  So 
yes Chair we’ll never be able to answer it 100% fully. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Thank you Chair.  Ms Mosidi on 
paragraph 30 to 32 which is pages 11 and 12 you talk about the 
10 
process that was engaged upon to mitigate the risks with Gajima 
because the following the next – at that particular stage, it was during 
December of 2016 that you were then called to the office of Mr 
Siyabonga Gama, can you please just give details of the reasons for 
the invite and the process that subsequently followed? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   So in December 2016 Chair, Mr Gama 
called me and Mr Edward Thomas to his office where he was trying to 
get us to a resolution of this whole tender process and…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    And Mr Thomas position again is what its mentioned 
earlier. 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Mr is Group Supply Chain Officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Was he under Mr Pita? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   He was under Mr Pita. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay thank you. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 170 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   But he was the Group (indistinct) 
Chief Officer of Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   So Mr Gama called us to his office 
and advised that me as a business owner should be given an 
opportunity, Chair to interrogate Gajima and their risks and to 
understand in the audience of procurement as well how they planned to 
mitigate their risks and he actually made sure that, that whole process 
happens within the procurement process so that I just don’t stand up 
alone to go and discuss with Gajima.  So he asked Mr Edward to 
10 
compile the questions to write the communication to Gajima to invite 
them to that session with those questions.  So he actually asked Mr 
Edward Thomas to facilitate that process and the meeting Chair, was 
finally called for the 23 r d of January 2017. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    And who was all present at that 
meeting? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   So in that meeting, which we held in 
the Pretoria offices of Transnet Engineering, from Transnet’s side it 
was myself as the business owner, there was Mr Mtsweni who was in 
charge of governance, there was Mr Maluleka who was the category 
20 
manager, Group Strategic Sourcing and then there was Mr Edward 
Thomas himself, that was the Transnet team and from Gajima I think it 
was the whole executive team that came through, I just remember that, 
Mr Gumete the Chairman was there and his CEO and his COO was 
there and a whole lot of other executives were there and also there was 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 171 of 223 
 
IBM who was a partner to Gajima in this tender and yes maybe other 
people that I wasn’t aware of but it was quite a sizeable group of 
maybe 15 to 18 people from Gajima. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    And what was the outcome of this 
meeting? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   So this meeting – because we had 
sent questions upfront to Gajima they then took us right through the 
questions 
and 
they 
were 
addressing 
each 
and 
every 
question…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes let me hear the discussion at the meeting before 
10 
the resolution. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Okay so Chair there were questions 
that we had sent to Gajima, most of them were pertaining to those risk 
questions that were raised, like for example there was one on current 
mode of operation and final mode of operation, which, initially I did 
explain to Chair that when you are talking Green Fields, I wasn’t 
convinced that it must come into  play at that stage because you want 
to finalise this tender as Green Fields and their were issues about their 
capacity and their skill. There were issues about how they managed to 
actually shave off 500million without putting Transnet at risk and 
20 
Gajima took us through all the plans that they had for example they 
spoke about how, after understanding better the requirements of 
Transnet they were able to shave off from I think they said helpdesk in 
terms of the cost because helpdesk yes, it has it’s own costs but you 
can also automate it as best as you can, so I suppose they were able to 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 172 of 223 
 
do some optimisation in that area, but they also explained – because 
there was a big issue about how the data centre was not operational 
and how the lead time to order the equipment was going to pose as risk 
to Transnet and they also explained that they have now brought their 
partner IBM who must actually give assurance that they have now pre-
ordered the devices and the equipment that will be required to actually 
operationalise the Transnet environment and allow for the transition of 
Transnet – from  T-Systems into Gajima.  So they were very detailed in 
terms of how they were going to deal with each and every risk that we 
raised and every executive from Gajima who was there, they had 
10 
something that they were actually responding to and I think they had 
structured it according to the towers that I spoke about earlier like 
relationship management, how were they going to do it, how were they 
going to manage project and so on.  So the meeting form their side was 
quite detailed in terms of how they were responding to that and 
subsequent to the discussions as well Chair, they wrote that full 
response and I think it’s somewhere in this many files where they 
responded to each and every risk in writing as well. And in that meeting 
they also requested to record the meeting themselves and I remember 
Mr Gumede even before we answered he said, okay there it is that’s my 
20 
recording device, you know and he was (indistinct) something like I 
know that these things get lost or something like that, he actually made 
me laugh but he did actually record the meeting himself as well. 
 
So yes there were questions, yes we did ask a few questions 
to understand their position and their presentation but at the end of it 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 173 of 223 
 
all once we had excused them, once they had addressed all the 
questions, they were excused and we all agreed that, I think, all the 
questions and all the risks have been addressed, the taste of this 
pudding will be in the eating at the end. 
CHAIRPERSON:    That agreement was that all the risk issues of 
concern that had been satisfactorily addressed? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay and the people from Transnet who were with 
you, did they challenge any of the things being – any explanation being 
given by Gajima? 
10 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Very minimally I can’t even remember 
what it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Nothing serious. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Nothing serious really. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Thank you and so it is your 
evidence that, that meeting then concluded with all risks being 
mitigated? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes Chair that was my understanding 
and that’s how we concluded the meeting. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well is it mitigated or they were explained 
satisfactorily? 
MS 
MAKANO 
MURIEL 
MOSIDI: 
 
 
They 
were 
explained 
satisfactorily…(intervention). 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 174 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Because the two don’t mean the same. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   To the satisfaction of Transnet team. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On page 13 of your statement you 
now address the two conflicting recommendations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see that one of the persons who attended that 
meeting, if I understand correctly was Mr Maluleka. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes Chair the one with Gajima? 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja the meeting with Gajima. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Between Transnet and Gijima. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the same Mr Maluli who have said to you are 
you going to go against yourself? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes Chair that is the same Mr Maluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    It was around February 2017 that 
an issue arose in relation to two conflicting recommendations.  What 
recommendations are you specifically referring to? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   So Chair the issue of the 
20 
recommendation it always had this dual views, one recommending to 
systems, and one recommending Gijima, so after we had met with 
Gijima we then put together a recommendation for their award which I 
was comfortable with, and Chair if you look in one of the annexures 
there is a memo that has been written and the difference – there are 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 175 of 223 
 
two memos, the difference with the second memo is that I then included 
that process where we met Gijima, because for me it was an official 
process that actually contributed to us understanding the risks and how 
they will be mitigated but there was then another memo which Mr Pita 
had which was recommending T-Systems, so we were having these two 
memos, it was the due date for one memo to go to – to ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Gama. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   To go to Mr Gama for his approval so 
that he can submit to the BADC, and I remember we were in Esselyn 
Park, we were just about to start the Exco meeting, and Mr Gama said 
10 
you will give me one – you as executives will have to sort it out, and 
you will give me one memo that I must actually go with so you and Mr 
Pita go and sort yourselves out and I was explaining to Mr Pita to say 
this is where I am, this is the work that you’ve done, this is and I say 
we will actually go and recommend Gijima because of these reasons 
and I think at the end Chair he did agree although I always felt like 
because the memo’s were largely drafted by the procurement team the 
contents were leaning more towards elevating risks and actually 
creating that little – eroding the confidence of what he was saying, but 
at the end the recommendation was clear and we ended up agreeing on 
20 
the one memo, which was to recommend Gijima. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   So just to unpack that a little, there 
were then two conflicting recommendations, and conflicting to the 
extent of which company was being recommended as the preferred 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 176 of 223 
 
bidder, is that right? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    So the one memorandum was 
authored by who? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   So the one memorandum was 
authored by myself. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    And you recommended which 
company? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   I was recommending Gijima. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    And the other memorandum was 
10 
authored by whom? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   It was authored by Mr Gary Pita for 
his recommending T-Systems. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    And by the direction of Mr Gama 
after the deliberations between yourself and Mr Pita the one memo that 
was then sent on was recommending Gijima? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   The memo was recommending Gijima, 
the final memo. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Can I ask you to turn to page 76, 
and in particular page 86.  This memorandum is unsigned and at 
20 
paragraph 48 it talks to the recommendation to the GCE to approve the 
award of business to T-Systems, whose memo would this have been? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   This would have – this would have 
been my memo Chair.  No, this would have been Mr Gary Pita’s memo 
Chair. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 177 of 223 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Thank you, now if you turn to page 
76 the memo however is prepared from Gary Pita, yourself and Edward 
Thomas, and it’s addressed to Mr Siyabonga Gama.  Are we to 
understand that notwithstanding from whom this memo was sent this 
was in fact your memorandum? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Chair this memorandum where T-
Systems was recommend couldn’t have been my memo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, is it not that they prepared it or they included 
your name on the – in the hope that they would persuade you and that 
– and that maybe they were going to take your name out if you were not 
10 
persuaded?  Because you talk about two memos, so obviously there are 
two memos, either they will all go or there might still be a process of 
discussion.  You don’t know? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Ja, I don’t know because this memo 
probably came and I wouldn’t have agreed to sign this particular memo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   So but just the way it’s written, 
perhaps yes if I had signed it then it would be correct, that it’s from the 
three of us, but can I voice-over and say the way that memo is written 
one would have expected it then just to come from Mr Gary Pita, 
20 
because as the head of – as the person that procurement is reporting 
into would all have signed here and he would have just said given what 
I got from my Procurement Officer I am writing this to you.  It is 
inconsistent for my name to be appearing in that heading of “from”, I 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 178 of 223 
 
doubt if all the memos are written like that, I think they should actually 
come from Mr Pita himself. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Can I ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Bottom line is that you say you didn’t give approval 
for a name to be included in that memo. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes Chair I didn’t give approval and 
that’s why my signature is not on there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you were not party to it? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Thank you.  Can I ask you then to 
10 
turn to page 88, which appears to be the other memorandum from Mr 
Gary Pita to Mr Siyabonga Gama, and while holding that page if I could 
ask you to turn to page 108, and at paragraph 83 on page 108 it 
records 
the 
recommendation 
that 
the 
Group 
Chief 
Executive 
recommends the award of contract to Gijima Holdings to the 
Acquisitions and Disposals Committee for recommendation to the 
Transnet Board and an ancillary recommendation.  Whose memorandum 
would this have been? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   This would have been my 
memorandum Chair. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    And similarly at the start of the 
memorandum that has been prepared by Mr Gary Pita and your name 
not reflecting in this? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it says from, maybe a distinction between from 
him and prepared by. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 179 of 223 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Prepared by might be compiled by and then somebody 
else might then adopt it as his or her own, so it says it is from him, that 
is Mr Gary Pita, but the witness is saying that it was her memorandum, 
by which I take it you say you had compiled it. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes Chair that would go with the 
recommendation that I was going with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you simply needed to reflect that it was from 
him, Mr Pita, because it had to come from him. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   From that Procurement Head, yes 
10 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Thank you Chair, then can I ask you 
to turn to page 110 of the same bundle, at which a memo appears. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 102? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    110. 
CHAIRPERSON:  110. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    It’s the next annexure, Annexure 8.  
This memorandum is from Mr Gary Pita, to Mr Siyabonga Gama, and 
whilst holding your finger at that particular page, if you turn to page 
20 
129 at paragraph 83 there appears the recommendation that the Group 
Chief Executive (a) recommends the award of contract to the Gijima 
Holdings 
to 
the 
Acquisitions 
and 
Disposal 
Committee 
for 
recommendation to the Transnet Board of Directors for approval and (b) 
recommend that the Acquisitions and Disposals Committee recommends 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 180 of 223 
 
to the Board to grant authority to the GCE to sign the letters of intent, 
the letters of regret and all other relevant documentation in summary of 
the last part of that paragraph.  Is that your signature which in fact 
appears on the left – sorry on the right hand side in the middle? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes Chair it’s my signature. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    And is this in fact the joint 
memorandum that was prepared between you and Mr Pita? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes Chair it is. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    And the just for clarity if you turn 
one page before, at page 128 ...(intervention) 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before that I see that although you signed but 
you didn’t cross out not recommended, was that an oversight? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   It was an oversight Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You meant to recommend? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   I meant to recommend. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    And apologies for my oversight too.   
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Sorry Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    At page 128, just for clarity of 
record, is it correct that at paragraph 79 the final tendered pricing for 
20 
the recommended bidder, Gijima, over a period of five years, is R1 338 
114 324,04 (One Billion Three Hundred and Thirty Eight Million, One 
Hundred and Fourteen Thousand Three Hundred and Twenty Four Rand 
and four cents). 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes Chair. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 181 of 223 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    And that the estimated savings over 
a period of five years on the contract, based on the current five year 
contract spend of R2.5billion is R1 161 885 675,96 (One Billion One 
Hundred and Sixty One Million Eight Hundred and Eight Five Thousand 
Six Hundred and Seventy Five Rand ninety six cents) which is 
equivalent to a monthly saving of approximately R2million. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes Chair for the time that I have 
been there that is what it is, I don’t know if it changed subsequent to 
that. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    Now that the recommendation was 
10 
signed and there was one recommendation, this was then the 
recommendation that ought to have – that was to be tendered at the 
meeting of the Acquisitions and Disposal Committee, is that correct? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:   Yes, we are ...(intervention)  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:    We are now – sorry? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL MOSIDI:  No, I was going to say Chair then the 
next step was to actually now table it at the BADC, the Board’s 
Acquisition and Disposal Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Paragraph 14 ...(intervention)  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe this might be the time to take a comfort break.  
We don’t always have a break after lunch but we will have just five 
minutes, we will resume at half past. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn.

ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  What is it please? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  This is the copy of the Minutes

CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  At the … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this would be the – this would have been the 
meeting where that single recommendation that Mr Gama was asking 
for… 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Was presented. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would have – was tabled or would have been tabled? 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 183 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okauy. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  More accurately stated it is an excerpt 
of the relevant portions of the meeting Minutes of the Meeting specific 
to your agenda item. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair it is. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  On page 131 there appears to be three 
categories of attendance just to highlight some of the names in 
attendance those who were marked as present was Mr S D Shane being 
the chairperson.  Mr S I Gama a member Group Chief Executive, Ms 
10 
Elsie Mabaso a member.  Mr Z A Nagdee if I am pronouncing that 
correctly. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Nagdee. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  And also that – also marked as a 
member in attendance was Mr G J Pita Chief Financial Officer, Mr M 
Sigonyela The General Manager. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry was that no inaccurate?  That was not his 
position is it – Mr Pita?  He was not Chief Financial Officer was he?  
Was he not something Supply Chain Management or Procurement? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  No Chair he was the CFO but 
20 
procurement was reporting into him finally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The correct title was Chief Financial Officer? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes the Group Chief Financial 
Officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Singh or was it – or was this not Mr Singh’s time? 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 184 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  No it was not Mr Singh’s time 
when I was in Transnet Mr Singh was not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Mr M Sigonyela General Manager 
Office of the Group Chief Executive, Mr N Silinga Chief Legal Counsel, 
Mr E Thomas Chief Supply Chain Officer and others and then you are 
marked specifically in partial attendance the third one under paragraph 
1.3 as Ms M A Mosidi Group Chief Information Officer.  It is noted at 
paragraph 1.4.2 that the Chairperson noted that the GCE was delayed 
from a prior meeting and the Chairperson requested that the meeting be 
10 
adjourned on arrival of the GCE for a brief meeting between the Group 
Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and the Chairperson.  Can you 
please set the scene for this Chairperson as to how the agenda item 
had been introduced with your invite to attend the meeting on the day? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Thank you.  So Chair the ADC is 
attended by the official members who are marked as present on top and 
depending on what the agenda is looking like and the items that need 
to be discussed on the day you will have the list which is in 1.3.  So 
that list will say Partial Attendance.  So what basically happens then 
you attend for the part that you are actually responsible for so that you 
20 
can actually speak to the submission as presented.  And that is why 
Chair you will see my name there but it will not mean that we were all 
in that meeting at the same time.  After my item then I would leave and 
the next person will actually continue.  So on this particular day so 
what then happens you would be knowing that on that day your matter 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 185 of 223 
 
is going to serve in front of the ADC so either you wait outside mostly 
for you to be called into the meeting.  And so the meeting was in and 
we were waiting outside and then when my item came they – I think 
they had – they had adjourned they had a body break and they stopped 
and we were waiting for them to actually come – come and start the 
meeting again.   
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  And how long was that break? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  That break was quite long I 
think if I am correct it would have been about fifty to an hour – fifty 
minutes to an hour where they took that break and whilst before the 
10 
meeting started a lot of people came back and we sit down like Mr 
Nagdee was sitting down and waiting and I think the rest of the people 
were not there.  So as we were waiting for that length of time 
everything was settled but we were just waiting of course for the official 
members of the sub-committee and then in walked the remainder of the 
members which was Mr Shane, Mr Gama and Ms Mobaso after that long 
wait.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  The ones who – who went away was it those 
three? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes so when it break everybody 
20 
went out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the whole – the meeting was adjourned 
temporarily? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja it was adjourned temporarily 
and then everybody came back. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 186 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Within like fifty minutes? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Within five minutes, ten minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  We made ourselves comfortable 
in the boardroom and then we were waiting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja for… 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  The real members to come. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And continue with the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
10 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you say Mr Nagdee was waiting with you? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja but Mr Nagdee was waiting 
with us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was only the … 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  The top three names. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The top… 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  That were not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes, yes they were not there. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And then of course after an hour 
they came and they came in and Mr Shane who is he Chairperson of 
that committee then commenced with the proceedings of my agenda 
item.  And I just remembered Chair that when she opened – when he 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 187 of 223 
 
opened the meeting he actually explained that we are now getting into 
the most difficult discussion of this meeting for today meaning the 
agenda item that I was going to talk to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The tender? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  At some stage I thought you were saying 
something like while you were waiting?  I thought there was something I 
that I may have – might have interrupted you.  Maybe something 
happened while you were waiting? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  No Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or not really? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  I think I was just trying to make 
it clear that some of the names that are under partial attendance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  I would not have seen on the 
day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  They would not have seen me as 
well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So it might look incorrect but it 
is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay no that is fine.  So the Chairperson we are 
now going to the most difficult issue? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 188 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And he – that is when he was 
actually opening the discussions for the data services tender.   
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Were you then afforded an opportunity 
to make representations to the committee? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair yes I was, I was allowed 
to give some representation to that committee. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did anyone else give representations 
to the committee. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It was me. 
10 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  In relation to the recommendation? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair the main respondent to 
the submission and the voice over was myself and Mr Edward Thomas. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can then ask you to turn to page 
137 of the bundle.  This is a transcript of the particular meeting on that 
day and Chair the certificates of veracity are all included in the – in the 
annexure as well.  In particular can I ask you turn to page 154 please?  
And I would like you to read something into the record which was in 
response to a query that was raised to you by Ms Mobaso. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before, before that can we just deal with this.  I take 
20 
it that when you were given a chance to make a presentation or to talk 
at this meeting you talked in line – your presentation was in line with 
the memorandum that was recommending Gijima?  Is that right? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 189 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And largely what you said was what was contained in 
the memorandum or not really? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes largely. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Largely it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And did Mr Thomas when he got a chance also 
go along the same line? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Mr Thomas went along the same 
line punctuating the procurement processes a lot. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And just how we ended up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Just as a follow up to that did Mr Pita 
give any comments when making the recommendation? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  My recollection say he did not 
say – he did not give any comment in that meeting.  I could be wrong 
Chair let me… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is – I know that Ms September wants to take you 
to documents but in terms of your recollection was there anybody else 
20 
except yourself and Mr Thomas who you recall also spoke to – to this 
item or questioned you on your presentation or questioned Mr Thomas 
or spoke in support of what the two of you had said? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair.  In terms of 
recollection Mr Thomas spoke at length in terms of the procurement 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 190 of 223 
 
processes.  I spoke at length in terms of the operational requirements 
of the tender and I seem to recall that Mr Gama tried to explain a point 
I was making just briefly but I also remember that Mr Silinga who was 
the head of legal explained the risk portion a little bit in support of 
what we were saying – in support of what the memorandum was saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So those are the four people 
that I remember from… 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  I cannot remember Mr Pita 
10 
commenting on … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Any of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But on the whole as far as you recall everyone 
who spoke or rather every – no-one who spoke spoke against the 
recommendation as far as you can recall? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So as far as I can recall Chair is 
that everyone spoke in line with the recommendation but everyone 
amplified what they thought it should be amplified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes and I felt and now this is 
really becoming a little subject because at that time I was beginning to 
feel maybe the way we have written the memorandums we want to 
amplify and scare the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 191 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  That there were risks although 
at the end we still come back and say… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  We recommend Gijima. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  But I had a sense that the 
deliberations of procurement for example they were leaning more onto 
the risks which we kept on saying but they have been mitigated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Why do you have to then raise 
10 
them to the board? 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So there was that sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  In that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  But everyone spoke in line with 
the submission as made.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  When you mean everyone who exactly 
20 
do you mean? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So anyone who spoke be it Mr 
Thomas be it… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Everyone of the four or so that you mentioned? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja Mr Silinga, myself and Mr 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 192 of 223 
 
Gama. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm okay. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  So if I can then take you 
to page 154 and let me ask you was your position on advancing that the 
recommendation to Gijima was the right one tested at that meeting? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  I think it was tested in very 
simple terms.   
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I did not hear that question just repeat it 
pleases? 
10 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  The question is, whether or not the 
witness’ position to advance the recommendation of Gijima was tested 
at all at the hearing – at the committee meeting yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So – so Chair I just said that it 
was tested in a very simple way according to me.  Ms Mabaso asked me 
and tested me and said if it was your money would you put your life on 
this?  On the recommendation as it stands? 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was Mr Mabaso’s position again – legal 
counsel? 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  No Ms Mabaso.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Mabaso. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Was the Chairman of the main 
board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 193 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  She was the Chairman of 
Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh but was she present at that meeting? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  She is a member of this 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  So is she – she sought to get your answer 
on whether the positon – the recommendation was what you would – 
would go with even if it was your own money? 
10 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  That is how my views were 
tested. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and your answer was? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  I answered and I explained that 
I believe in the procurement processes of Transnet they are there for a 
reason, they take away subjectivity and therefore based on those 
processes and their recommendation I will actually bet my bottom 
dollar. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  And just to amplify the very answer 
that you have given at page 154 paragraph – line 7 you then assert 
what your position is.  Can I ask you to just read your section into the 
record? 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 194 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Where I start with Chair? 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes please. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:   
“Chair I would go you see I believe in our 
procurement 
processes 
and 
our 
procurement 
processes gave me the confidence that Gijima can 
actually do what they can because even if you look 
at the evaluation process the difference between the 
two has been just a fraction.  It has been 0.21 and 
0.25 so they were almost neck on neck. There is no 
10 
big variance between the two so I have got my 
comfort in that the procurement processes were 
actually dated enough.  And then if you look at the 
partners that are having Gijima.  If you look at IBM 
and you look at Vodacom you look at Vodacom on the 
internet Chair they lead in terms of UIT technologies, 
they lead in terms of their own main frames.  So you 
have the comfort that this particular consortium will 
actually reinforce the black company as in Gijima 
company so I will put my head on the block for 
20 
Gijima.” 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  With the progression of the meeting is 
it correct that Mr Stanley Shane then made an address to the meeting? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes, yes he did.  He made a 
long address if I … 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 195 of 223 
 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  it is at this point in time that I request 
permission to play the audio with us following in the transcript of the 
particular address that Mr Stanley Shane presents at the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes go ahead. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we could – if I could ask you to turn 
to page 158 should you wish to follow.  It begins at the bottom.  Aligned 
with Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Could you please… 
CHAIRPERSON:  From line? 
10 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:  From line? 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Line 18. 
CHAIRPERSON:  18? 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  18. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  At page 15? 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  At page 158. 
CHAIRPERSON:  8. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  The particular paragraph is titled 
Chairperson and it starts with can I comment? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Question mark. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I request that the audio recording 
be played please? 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 196 of 223 
 
[Playing of an audio recording]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry is that as clear as it can be?  Is that the 
clearest it can be? 
[Playing of an audio recording]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that a yes or what? 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can you just stop quickly.  Stop.   
CHAIRPERSON:  My question is whether that is the clearest that we 
can have?  Is the answer yes or is the answer no? 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  The answer is yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is the clearest. 
10 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Start afresh. 
[Playing of an audio recording]. 
[After the recording there is absolutely no sound for the rest of the 
audio]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just stop it.  How long more – how much more will he 
still take? 
ADV VERUSHKA SEPTEMBER:  One page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I have lost where they are but okay if it is one 
page that is fine.  You may continue. 
20 
[Playing of an audio recording]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  Do you have any 
comments to the address that was made by Mr Shane to the – to the 
meeting and in particular directed at you? 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 197 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair I think firstly in that 
meeting I just felt that the Executive input – the Executive due 
diligence process to ensure that we land the right service provider was 
just not taken into cognisance at all.  The whole screaming and 
shouting of Mr Shane just did not land well with me and I – I know with 
other Managers as well.  It came across as very derogatory and 
condescending.  I think it just sort of numbed everyone to say well 
perhaps it does not matter what we could have done.  I know that at 
some point when Mr Shane was talking about how they never meant to 
actually get rid of T-Systems and how they were just doing the exercise 
10 
to test the market and to keep them honest.  I remember I actually 
asked in that meeting to say I wish we had been told that.  Then it 
would have been an easier process to actually test and say to T-
Systems can you actually slash your prices.  We have tested the 
market.  Just slice it by R1 billion.  You are good to go instead of 
actually getting into this whole involved process that we did.  So Chair 
I think - and he spoke to me about ja you may be good new Manager 
but it is – it has all been done in terms of how the contract management 
was done and I think for me just overall I just felt the Board did not 
take into cognisance any work that we did - that is one.  Two - and I 
20 
just felt like they did not take us seriously in terms of how seriously we 
take our work.  So it did not matter and he spoke a lot about risk and I 
always say as an Executive I am also carrying risk.  It cannot be that it 
is only about Directors.  It is no longer like that.  If you are an 
Executive you have a fiduciary duty to satisfy all the time and you carry 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 198 of 223 
 
the same risk as well.  So for me I think after that long talk I just 
realised that I think we have said what we can say.  It is really up to 
the Board to make their decision. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did any of the reasons provided by 
Mr Shane constitute objective criteria as contemplated in the manual? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  I did not – Chair just for the 
record – I did not pick up any objective criteria or any predetermined 
criteria that – that perhaps we could have missed.  So it just – I did not 
find any place for his comment. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so what was the outcome on the 
10 
recommendation finally made by the Committee to the Board? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI: 
 
So 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
Committee at the end was to actual differ with the management 
recommendation to award Gijima but to rather award to T-Systems. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And can I then ask you to quickly 
turn to page 190 which is Annexure 11? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before that other members of the Committee did 
they speak after Mr Shane had spoken? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Not that I remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did they speak to engage with his reasoning and his 
20 
address vis-à-vis your address and the address of Mr Thomas and the 
memorandum that had been put in recommending Gijima? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair no, not to my recollection. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja.  You know the points that 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 199 of 223 
 
were thrown in by Mr Gama, by Mr Silinga … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It was you know – it was here 
and there … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  To try to punctuate but no 
reaction to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  To what Mr Shane was saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So after Mr Shane had spoken did they just make a 
10 
decision?  Did they have to vote or anything?  How – how was the 
decision arrived at or if you were still present at the meeting? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair I think once we were done 
yes they agreed that they will go with T-Systems … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  But how the resolution was put 
together I was not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But as I understand the position and I just want you 
to say something about this. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  There as noting before the Committee in terms of any 
documentation as far as you know that supported that the award be 
granted to T-Systems.  There was only a memorandum that supported 
that the tender be awarded to Gijima? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair yes there was only a 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 200 of 223 
 
memorandum that supported that the tender be awarded to Gijima. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in terms of until Thomas spoke nobody had 
spoken against the recommendation that the tender be awarded to 
Gijima.  There had been questions but like from Ms Mabaso but really 
nobody had spoken against the – the recommendation that management 
had made? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  At page 190 of the 
bundle … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Let me ask this – now you had from the 
first time you started dealing with this matter you had – had 
reservations about the tender being awarded to T-Systems.  Your 
reservations had – as time went on – been kind of vindicated and 
ultimately one recommendation was made.  Out of what Mr Shane said 
and I could not follow everything … 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The sound was not good.  I could not follow 
everything. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Out of what he said did he engage with the reasons 
that – in regard to risks that you had put forward in any meaningful 
way? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  No Chair.  I think you might not 
have picked it up quite clearly but he spoke to – for example – the 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 201 of 223 
 
newspapers and the headlines.  How we would be exposing Transnet 
because Gijima.  Can you image if people cannot send email?  Now all 
those things.  Email will be one of the predetermined criteria in terms 
of the technically capability of Gijima.  It is a – it is a critical service 
but it is a basic service.  So all those risks that he actually tried to 
elevate out of his motivation they were actually part of the evaluation 
that was done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So I could not find anything 
except for the newspapers … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Which I was not even aware of 
what was happening with the newspapers but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  You know Transnet is a huge 
organisation.  You will always find yourself in the newspaper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  For good or for bad you will find 
yourself in the newspapers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So I – I could not pick anything 
that he was particularly raising that I thought would qualify to be a legit 
criteria … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  That we – we could have had an 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 202 of 223 
 
oversight of. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So I – I just – that is why at the 
end I just felt he – he just spoke and spoke. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  I could not pick up anything that 
he was really saying except that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  He would want to – to actually 
just say we - we will not go with the management recommendation. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When they – when they came back into the meeting 
that is he, Mr Gama and there was a third member of the Committee – 
when they came back into the meeting after having taken quite long to 
come back during the break did they tell the meeting why they had 
taken so long and what was the issue.  They kept you waiting – you 
people waiting for a long time. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair they kept us waiting for a 
long time but when Mr Shane opened the meeting by saying we are now 
20 
getting to one of the most difficult discussions.  I had a sense that they 
could have grappled with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI: 
 
Maybe 
they 
were 
actually 
looking at it to say this is so complex and how do we actually deal with 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 203 of 223 
 
it but it was just my inference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, but there could not have been a Committee 
because you said one of the members was waiting for them with you. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Mr Nagdee was actually … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIELMOSIDI:  In the – in the Board Meeting with us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he was a member of the Committee? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  He was a member of the ADC 
Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So some members of the Committee – three members 
10 
went – were away for quite some time.  You do not exactly what they 
discussed but you are saying that the way - the manner in which 
Mr Shane started the meeting in regard to this issue suggested to you 
that maybe that is what they may have been discussing but … 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Because of the complexity that 
they were seeing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright thank you. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  I think they were chafing – if I 
20 
can mention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Mr Nagdee who remained behind 
was actually the overseer of IT because of his background. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 204 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So one would have expected 
him to – to be very vocal about … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  This particular tender … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And – and how we are going to 
mitigate … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  But I do recall that he did make 
a comment to say the biggest fear factor of this tender is the migration 
10 
of data. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Which is true.  It happens all the 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Just how you migrate the data 
and make sure that the completeness of that migration is actually … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  100 percent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So I did ja – he did make a 
small comment but I would have expected him to actually … 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes). 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Be the one who was very vocal 
… 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 205 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  About this tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At page 190 of the bundle appears a 
memorandum and its purpose is recorded in paragraph 1: 
“To request the Board of Directors to a, approve the 
award of a contract to T-Systems South Africa (Pty) 
Ltd for a period of five years with an option to 
extend for a further period of two years and b, grant 
authority to the GCE to sign the letter of intent to 
10 
the preferred bidder – T-Systems, Letters of Regret 
– LOR – to the unsuccessful bidders, the contract 
and 
all 
relevant 
documentation 
including 
any 
subsequent contract amendments.” 
If you turn to page 201 paragraph 51 aligns with the purpose and 
appears – it appears to be signed by Mr Garry Pita as the Group Chief 
Financial Officer on 14/02/2017 and recommended by Siyabonga Gama 
the Group Chief Executive on 15 February 2017.  Is that correct? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Well it is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay and so it was not signed by the 
20 
Chairperson of the Committee? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair it was not signed by the 
Chairperson of the ADC Committee.  One would have expected that at 
the stage because as management we actually make submissions to the 
ADC Sub Committee and the Chairman of the Sub Committee takes 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 206 of 223 
 
ownership now of the decisions of that – to the Board.  This one was 
actually done by Mr Garry Pita and Mr Gama but perhaps because they 
were both Directors of Transnet but to me it did not actually look right 
when I saw it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because what should have gone to … 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  To the main Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the main Board should come from the Committee? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  From the Committee itself and 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It should be signed off by the 
Chairman of that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the Chairperson, yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Sub Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At page 15 paragraph 38 you make … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before – before that this gives the impression 
that – I am going back to page 190.  This gives the impression that it is 
a – it is a memorandum coming from just the Executives and going 
straight to … 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  The main Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the Board.  Is that right? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair.  That is what it 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which is not correct? 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 207 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Which is not correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now Mr Gama was now signing a memorandum 
saying – recommending T-Systems whereas previously had signed a 
memorandum recommending … 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Recommending Gijima. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Gijima? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you have read this memorandum.  You have 
read this memorandum? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  How does it deal with the motivation that the other 
memorandum that he signed had put forward for recommending Gijima?  
Just briefly what are you able to highlight?  Does it engage with the 
reasons – in other words or does it seem to be just a standalone 
separate and do without the background of the other memorandum? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja.  So Chair if you look at that 
memorandum and you go to 199 it highlights a whole lot of reasons that 
were raised by the ADC and where it was one talking to the risk that the 
ADC was actually seeing with this particular recommendation and how 
Gijima was the (indistinct) bidder.  How Gijima could not have for 
20 
example they would say the pricing provided was after they had access 
to specific details.  So it – it explained all those things that some of 
them – I cannot remember hearing in the Board but I think the – the 
memorandum was just summarising the views that the Board was 
saying. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 208 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And those views were views that had been contained 
in Mr Shane’s address at the meeting? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Some of them Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But some of them … 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Some of them … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were new – were not there necessarily? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Not necessarily really. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay alright, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Ms Mosidi did Mr Gama send you any 
communication during that meeting? 
10 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Oh, in the – in the ADC? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes, but I did not see it when I 
was in the ADC.  I saw it after I left but I realised that he had sent me a 
WhatsApp to say stop fighting.  You can see what the Board would like 
to have but I only saw it after.  So I could not have reacted in time to it. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What did you make of that message coming from … 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  From my boss. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From your boss? 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  I felt disappointed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Because Chair I think after this 
particular engagement with the Board I should say my – my energy 
waned … 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 209 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And – and also I never actually 
asked him why he sent me the WhatsApp because I think he wanted me 
– I should have stopped earlier in the discussions in the Board … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  If I had seen his WhatsApp … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  But I am not in the habit of 
actually checking WhatsApp much when I am in a meeting that is that 
difficult.  So I did not see it … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  But I was – I was feeling 
disappointed because I thought we were all actually – we have bought 
into what we needed to do as management and we were going to help 
each other to explain to the Board … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  The whole process that we have 
undertaken.  How we are going to mitigate the risks and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And how we will continuously 
20 
keep the Board abreast and they should actually trust us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  I was expecting that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So when I saw the WhatsApp 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 210 of 223 
 
after … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  I felt a little bit discouraged in 
terms of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  What we needed to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There may be two or more ways of understanding that 
message. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One of them might be that he was saying look no 
10 
matter what you say it is quite clear which way this Board is going.  
You are wasting your time just save your … 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Breath. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your breath ja without necessarily saying the Board 
was right. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is one way of looking at it.  It may be – maybe 
another way might be that he wanted – he did not want you at that 
stage to oppose the Board when the Board wanted things in a certain 
way and therefore the Board is right.  Maybe that might be another way.  
20 
There might be another interpretation.  Which interpretation did you 
attach to it? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair actually took the latter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja, as my first reaction. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 211 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – that he – he did not want to – you to oppose 
the Board? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and not necessarily that he was saying look I do 
not … 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Agree with – with them but stop fighting? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  That was – the latter is the one 
10 
that came first to mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it correct that following this 
meeting everything went - as you state in paragraph 41 – a dark hole? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes.  You know Chair I think – 
what - what paragraph is that? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Paragraph 41 on page 16. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja.  Ja, because once the ADC 
had recommended to the main Board and the main Board had taken the 
resolution to award to T-Systems I never knew what – what to do next.  
20 
I kept on requesting procurement to guide us in the process.  How far 
away, when do we start the negotiations?  It was all quiet.  I was not 
even aware that there was an objection that was registered by Gijima. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Mosidi.  Are you on here statement? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 212 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where about? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It is page 16 paragraph 41. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you.  You may proceed. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja.  So Chair yes I just – 
Ms September was asking me a dark hole and I was saying it was a 
dark hole because I just never knew where the process was.  As a 
business owner I did expect to be copied - for example – when the 
Letter of Award was sent out.  I owned the requirement.  I had to know 
what we were communicating to T-Systems.  I did not know and even 
when there was an objection I did not know.  I kept on inquiring when 
10 
do we start.  In fact the former Chief Executive of T-Systems even 
called me to say Makano when do we start negotiations.  I said no, I am 
waiting for my procurement people to tell me now they are done with 
their process.  They will actually give me the go ahead to start 
engaging with you but Chair that never actually happened.  So I – I 
started hearing post the events that Gijima objected and so and so on.  
So I was not quite close to that process at all. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair I cannot help but notice the 
time and I am just guided by you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How much more time do you think we need to finish? 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Probably 20 minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Probably 15/20 minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, let us try and finish. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay, thank you. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 213 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that still fine with you Ms Mosidi? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair yes because I think the 
remainder of my story really is very, very short. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it correct then Ms Mosidi that you 
were subsequently involved and requested to engage in settlement 
negotiations? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair.  So in an attempt to – 
to buffer Transnet because when the legal wrangle started between 
T-Systems and Gijima Transnet is the one that actually suffered. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why do you leave out Transnet?  They were just as 
much of … 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja, I just thought they were – 
they were the beneficiary of the consequences, ja so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, right yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So then they were actually 
fighting and – and having a tug of war it was Transnet that was actually 
suffering because we could not do anything.  At the same time Chair 
Treasury was saying we will not give you another extension and we 
needed the extension because even if we are going transition we still 
20 
needed T-Systems to be part of that process. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can interrupt you there. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Having mentioned National Treasury 
is also correct that at paragraph 44.4 of your statement National 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 214 of 223 
 
Treasury gave particular direction to Transnet in relation to the award 
to T-Systems? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes.  So for me even that 
information I got second-hand but yes I was told that National Treasury 
has given us directive to actually rescind the award to Gijima – to 
T-Systems and to award to Gijima. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And was the decision in fact 
rescinded? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  I understand that on the – in 
September sometime the Board took a decision to rescind the award. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And if one … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that still the same Board? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It was still the previous Board 
yes not the current Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And if one then turns to page 203 
there appears minutes of the Special Board of Directors Meeting held 
on 27 September 2017 and if you then turn to page 207 the Resolution 
of the Board to rescind the award is documented under paragraph 
4.1.13. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought you said page 203. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  207. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  203 is in fact the first page to the 
Minute of the Special Board Meeting that was held and the actual 
Resolution of the Board to rescind reflects on page 207 and at 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 215 of 223 
 
paragraph 4.1.13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I then take you back to just give 
an overview of …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before taking her back I – I asked earlier on 
Ms Mosidi whether it was the same Board and you said yes but I – I do 
not see Mr Shane in – in the list of members on page 203.  Am I 
missing something or he might not have not been there? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair whilst I will not have the 
exact days I remember that Mr Shane subsequently resigned from the 
10 
Board of Transnet … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI: 
 
Before 
we 
concluded 
this 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before this meeting? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Possibly before this meeting … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And I think that will explain why 
he was not here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
20 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja because I see that he is not 
even mentioned under apologies.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well it is just seems strange before he spoke at 
the other meeting nobody seemed to be against your recommendation 
that Gijima should be given the – the tender.  After he spoke …. 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 216 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Everybody went. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Member – members of the Committee all agreed with 
him. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After he spoke against it and then when he is not 
there then they … 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  They go … 
CHAIRPERSON:  They change the decision. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  Can I then take 
you back and just ask you explain the engagement in the settlement 
negotiations and you have – as you have earlier alluded to in specific 
regard to the quantum or the value of settlement negotiations that were 
being discussed. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So Chair in an attempt to broker 
this impasse because we could not do anything and we spent our time 
and resources trying to resolve the legal wrangles Mr Gama directed 
me to negotiate a settlement to see if a settlement out of court will 
actually accelerate the process of clearing the impasse and going on 
20 
with our business and in that meeting he did call me together with 
Mr Silinga but I am the one who actually carried out the discussions 
and the negotiations.  I met with both T-Systems and Gijima.  Yes it 
was not an easy discussion moving from one to the other.  It was like 
we were going to make a – a breakthrough and then T-Systems will say 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 217 of 223 
 
no we cannot accept this or we cannot accept that but also I think what 
started being of a concern to me is how it was beginning to be 
construed to be somebody soliciting a bribe or something that is not 
correct and whilst T-Systems did indicate informally to say they will 
settle for about 75 million we were not actually prepared to go – to give 
them anything more than R20 million which was a far cry from where 
they were in terms for their aspirations.  So in the end when we have 
gone up and down I then wrote a final letter to say the offer is off the 
table formally and finally and we will go back to the process of trying to 
haggle this out in court.  So that process was actually concluded in that 
10 
fashion where everything was off the table.  No money was paid to 
anybody but the idea really was to say because we will also need 
T-Systems to transition let us give them an incentive to transition 
quickly because they can actually frustrate the process so much 
because they are the current incumbent.  They can actually stay there 
for the next two years trying to transition and I am not saying they are 
like that but that is what - that is what will happen because we are 
really in a mess.  So it makes sense when Mr Gama says it will be a 
performance bonus of R20 million for them to transition quickly to 
Gijima so that we get on with our business but that whole proposition 
20 
was then taken off the table formally. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Just in relation to your engagements 
- there was one particular engagement that you had with Gijima on 
page 18 paragraph 51 of your statement which talks to a private 
meeting that was had.  Can you just briefly explain the details of this 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 218 of 223 
 
meeting please? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So Chair in that process when 
we were negotiating and trying to clear the impasse but when Gijima 
was also trying to make sure that they get on-board because they were 
realising that they were the recommended party and they could not wait 
to take over.  There was a day that a meeting was scheduled and it just 
had an address in my calendar and so I just followed it in my car but I 
then ended up at Mr Gumede’s house which is somewhere in 
Saxonwold.  So I was there already.  I entered and yes we had our 
meeting there and in the meeting it was Mr Gumede.  It was Mr Samuel 
10 
who was the CEO of Gijima.  It was Mr Nxumalo who was the COO of 
Gijima and the meeting whilst it was really just talking about the 
readiness to actually transition and take over the work I think I was 
very uncomfortable that it was in somebody’s house.  I wish I had 
known. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In - in whose house was it? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It was in Mr Robert Gumede’s 
house. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Gumede’s house? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes how is the Chairman of 
20 
Gijima. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  So I felt very uncomfortable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and – and who had called the meeting? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  It was called by Mr Nxumalo 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 219 of 223 
 
who was the COO of Gijima. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why did you agree to go to Mr Gumede’s house? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  I did not – I actually thought it 
was one of their offices. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Until I followed the GPS … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  To … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And I started realising I am in a 
residential area … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  By then it was too late.  They 
were waiting for me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja.  So I – but I did express my 
displeasure to Mr Nxumalo and I sent him a WhatsApp and I said 
Maphum I do really prefer office meetings.  Any office yours or mine but 
20 
even for next time let us not do it this way.  I just wanted to clarify my 
position in terms of such. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The new Board – the new Board then 
comes on-board during May 2018.  Is that correct? 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 220 of 223 
 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What was then the engagement with 
the new Board in respect of this particular tender? 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Ja.  So we had – we had several 
meetings with the Board.  In fact when the new Board came I was 
almost the first Executive to start engaging with them in detail because 
of not only this tender but other IT tenders as well and I remember we – 
se just had several meetings where we were presenting because now 
we were in a corner Chair.  Treasury was saying they are not going to 
give us a further extension.  We did not have anyone to award to.  We 
10 
had to go to the court.  The court process was going to take forever.  
We were going to miss the deadline with National Treasury.  So we 
were actually going to start doing expanding unauthorised – so we had 
to play visibility for the Board.  So the new Board engaged and they 
really tried to understand where we were coming from.  We presented 
the two options – the options that we had and we even started playing 
with the option of transitioning to ourselves as Transnet and whilst it 
was a really brilliant idea to transition to Transnet – Transnet was far 
from ready.  It had never insourced these services.  When you look at 
the capability and the skills that were required there was no way in 
20 
which we were going to do this.  So it became – it became the one with 
the highest risk and so we – we then summarised and showed to the 
Board to say the only way out for us and we think that if we start 
transitioning to Gijima Treasury wil understand that we need the time to 
transition and we will not get into a space where we go unauthorised.  
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 221 of 223 
 
So we actually presented and showed them that Gijima was the least 
risk – the Gijima option was the least risk option in terms of where we 
were and I think they started understanding that except that for their 
own conviction and assurance they needed an independent person to 
actually look at this whole process in terms of how we were thinking 
about it and I think Chair at that time when you want an independent 
reviewer it must be another procurement process and Chair it was at 
that – at that point that I actually tendered my resignation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where you feeling that this thing was taking too long 
or what or it was just coincidental? 
10 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Chair there were a number of 
things which were at play. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  I think the first one I really had 
an opportunity I could not say no to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  In terms of the job I am sitting 
in.  Secondly I think I started realising long in 2017 when – when the 
Board changed the whole award and I could not understand … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Why I realised this was going to 
be an uphill … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Because I was not feeling like I 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 222 of 223 
 
was getting value from the Board … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  In terms of their input to us … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  But also I was feeling like they 
were frustrating the process.  It is very difficult to work when you are 
not convinced that this is the – when you know that this is wrong and 
you want to work at it.  Somehow it does not actually all go well even 
for the teams that you lead.  So I felt like something must change.  It is 
a pity the new Board came very late in the process but my mind was 
10 
actually unlocked … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was made up. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Dislodged.  I wanted … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  To look at something else and I 
wanted to give the new Board some space for them to do their own 
assessment … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  And interrogation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, okay. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair and then lastly it is common 
cause that the tender was in fact set aside on 12 December last year 
and it is attached to the statement from pages 214 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I have seen the judgment – even the judgment. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  To 234 … 
10 JUNE 2019 – DAY 109 
 
Page 223 of 223 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And in particular I just wanted to 
highlight paragraphs 37, 38 and 39 of the judgment.  Can I just be 
given a second of indulgence? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair I have no further questions for 
this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Ms Mosidi.  We appreciate that 
you came to give evidence, thank you very much.  You are excused. 
MS MAKANO MURIEL ANNA MOSIDI:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Who is leading evidence tomorrow?  Do 
you remember? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
I 
understand 
it 
to 
be 
Ms Refilwe Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We will – we will start at 10 then.  We will – 
we will adjourn the proceedings for the day and tomorrow we will start 
at 10.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 11 JUNE 2019
