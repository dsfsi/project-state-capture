PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 26 FEBRUARY 2021 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good morning Mr Seleka.  Good morning 
everybody.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, are you ready? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We are ready Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We have Mr Tsotsi again? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Tsotsi you must not start 
threatening us with sending us invoices for appearances 
10 
because I think one of the witnesses, I think Mr Popo 
Molefe, was saying, no, he is going to start sending 
invoices 
now 
because 
he 
has 
been 
coming 
to 
the 
Commission so many times.  [laughs]   
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]   
MR TSOTSI:   [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Yes, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Chairperson, 
Mr Tsotsi is represented by his attorney.  He may want to 
place himself on record. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Ngcebetsha? 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Ngcebetsha, indeed yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Thank you very much.  Thank you. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 4 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, Mr Tsotsi is coming back 
to deal with some of the allegations that have been made 
against him or about him by some of the board members 
who have appeared before the Commission, as of recent 
and he has filed two supplementary affidavits which I will 
refer the Chairperson to shortly.   
 
In the first affidavit he explains particularly the 
issues 
regarding 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
board 
sub-
committees in 2015 and the second supplementary affidavit 
that is where he responds to some of the allegations that 
10 
are made about him. 
 
The 
bundle 
in 
which 
those 
affidavits 
are 
contained Chairperson is Eskom Bundle 7(B).  Eskom 
Bundle 7(B) and the page reference is 1222. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
MR TSOTSI:   Before I say anything.  Chair, am I speaking 
under oath today or...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, before...  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, we will get to that.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, we will get that that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, we will get to that.  Thank you.  I 
just want to check some things.  Is that nine – did you say 
912? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   1222. 
CHAIRPERSON:   922? 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 5 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   1222. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1222? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay. 
 
That 
is 
where 
the 
first 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The first supplementary affidavit is 
contained. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  Now I see on the spine of this file 
that it got his name. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that may give the impression that 
one will get – that this file contains all his affidavit which 
might not be the case. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
If 
it 
just 
contains 
supplementary 
affidavits, I think the spine should reflect that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that a few months from now, if I pick 
up this file, I should not think that this is where I would 
find all his affidavits. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  It is – that is correct Chair 
because that is the continuation of his first... 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 6 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I found where they are.  Okay do 
you ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to explain for the benefit of 
the public what his evidence will deal with today? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And maybe also tell us which other 
witnesses you are going to call today. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes-no, indeed.  Thank you Chair.  
10 
Mr Tsotsi will deal with an issue that arose on his first 
appearance, 
I 
think 
both 
on 
his 
first 
and 
second 
appearances, which was in relation to the composition of 
the sub-committees.   
 
He had exchanged emails with the Minister, 
exchanging the list of how he sought to compose the sub-
committees and we showed him in his last appearance that 
there were certain spelling mistakes in the list that he 
conveyed to the Minister, whether he could explain that. 
 
The – he then took the time after to that 
20 
questioning to prepare the supplementary affidavit to 
address that issue and he will testify on that, about that 
list.  That is the first thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In that regard.  Has the investigators 
ever been able to subject to whatever computer he may 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 7 of 259 
 
have used at the time to some technical analysis to check 
whether there could be evidence of Mr Salim Essa having 
sent him a list of the composition of the committees of the 
board? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Remember, he gave evidence that he – 
Mr Salim Essa sent him an email? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where he was saying how the various 
committees of the board should be composed. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he was not in agreement with that.  
He prepared his own. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which he sent to the Minister. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he said that when the Minister sent 
him her list, it was exactly the same as the one he had 
received from Mr Salim Essa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Every time I had said, attempts should 
be made, if possible, to try and see whether this could be 
conclusively established. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or whether we could find some way in 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 8 of 259 
 
terms of technology to get that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
He 
did 
receive 
from 
somewhere 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ....from outside of Eskom.  And the 
proposed composition.  I do not know if it was a proposed 
or if it is ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Final. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
[laughs] 
 
It 
was 
– 
this 
is 
the 
10 
composition.  [laughs]   
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   You must implement it.  I think I was told 
that 
there 
could 
be 
difficulties 
because 
I 
think 
the 
computer that he may have used might no longer be there 
or whatever. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I have never got a report back to 
say:  We have tried.  We did not succeed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  What...  That is correct.  The 
20 
Chair has not got a report back.  The position, as I 
understand, it is not the difficulty with the computer as 
such but with the fact that Mr Tsotsi might have received 
that communication from Mr Salim Essa on his private 
email address which – and I think Mr Tsotsi will remind me 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 9 of 259 
 
of his explanation, that he closed that account, that email 
account some time back.  But he also did an exercise to 
see whether he could retrieve any emails from that 
account. 
 
And I think Mr Tsotsi you will tell us in due 
course that you said you could not find any of the emails.  
So that is the extent to which the investigation has gone 
that far, on that point Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, what we do know if his 
evidence is correct ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...is that, he is able to say he did 
receive an email from Mr Salim Essa.  He is able to say its 
contents where exactly or substantially the same as the 
context the Minister sent to him with regard to how various 
committees of the board should be composed.  It is just 
that I cannot remember whether he said, exactly saying or 
substantially the same. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I do recall that the spelling errors 
20 
appeared to the same. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am under the impression that Mr Tsotsi 
did – that we had the email which he said he got from 
Mr Salim Essa or do we not have it?  He just knew that he 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 10 of 259 
 
had received it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, that one we do not have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, we do not have. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do not have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he knew some of the spelling errors 
which were in it and he knew that what the Minister sent to 
him was exactly the same or substantially the same. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Exactly the same, according to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So.  Ja, that will be ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...something that is some evidence.  It 
might not be conclusive but it is evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That he knows what he received and 
who he received it from and he knows that when the 
Minister sent him the composition of the committees it was 
exactly the same thing. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  So he will give evidence 
about that part of his previous evidence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And also give evidence – respond to 
some of the evidence given by Mr Koko. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 11 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And by Ms Viroshini Naidoo. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Mr Pamensky. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Pamensky? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Mr Pamensky. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, that is fine.  Please administer the 
oath or affirmation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  And in the afternoon 
Chair, we are scheduled to proceed with the testimony of 
Ms Suzanne Daniels.  It will be again via video link 
because she is still overseas. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine. 
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please switch on the mic. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Zola Andile Tsotsi. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objection in taking the 
prescribed oath? 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 12 of 259 
 
WITNESS:   No. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you consider the oath binding on your 
conscience? 
WITNESS:   Yes. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you solemnly swear that the evidence 
you will give, will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing 
but the truth?  If so, please raise your right hand and say, 
so help me God. 
WITNESS:   So help me God. 
ZOLA ANDILE TSOTSI:  (d.s.s.) 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you Mr Tsotsi.  Maybe we can just 
get, you know, dispose of that part of the emails. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, emails.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
EXAMINATION BY ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right.  Chair, 
let 
me 
then 
have 
the 
affidavits, 
the 
supplementary 
affidavits submitted and confirmed by Mr Tsotsi.  Mr Tsotsi, 
please turn to Eskom Bundle 7(B) on page 1222.  We 
follow the black pagination.   
MR TSOTSI:   [No audible reply] [microphone not switched 
20 
on] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Keep your mic on Mr Tsotsi.  Somebody 
who has come to the Commission as many times as you 
have, should know that.  [laughs]  So maybe you have not 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 13 of 259 
 
come back enough.  [laughs]   
MR TSOTSI:   [laughs]   
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   1222. 
MR TSOTSI:   I am there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You are there.  Thank you.  The 
supplementary affidavit runs up to page 1228 with the 
signature above the deponent.  Do you see that?  Do you 
confirm that to be your signature? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The affidavit – I see there is a date 
stamp on the – police stamp is 11/12/2020.  You confirm 
the contents of the affidavit? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Chairperson, I will beg 
leave to have this supplementary affidavit be admitted as 
Exhibit U-17.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As exhibit...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   U-17.2. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see that it looks like the commissioner 
of oaths did not initial every page.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Tsotsi...  I think he... 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 14 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
MR TSOTSI:   I thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not the best scenario but he will give 
evidence and confirm that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is...  He will give under oath and 
confirm that that is true. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chari. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  This supplementary affidavit of 
Mr Andile Zola Tsotsi starting at page 1222 will be admitted 
10 
and marked as Exhibit U-17.2. 
SUPPLEMENTARY AFFIDAVIT OF ANDILE ZOLA TSOTSI 
FROM PAGE 1222 IS ADMITTED AND MARKED AS 
EXHIBIT U-17.2 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair.  Mr Tsotsi, the initials at 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
page, 
is 
that 
yours 
or 
the 
commissioner ’s? 
MR TSOTSI:   They are mine Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is it only you? 
MR TSOTSI:   I beg your pardon? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is it only your initials? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then the second supplementary 
affidavit is on page 1229.  You see that Mr Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 15 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mister...  Oh, okay.  I think I see what is 
happening here.  This was confusing me.  The minutes of 
the meeting of 8 February 2017, that appear on page 1220.  
But it is not the 1220 that belongs to his bundle.  I think 
that has been uplifted from another bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And put here.  They were confusing me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, 1220? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But I think let us do the second 
supplementary affidavit. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then...  I think – I do not know if 
there is an annexure to that supplementary.  Maybe there 
are not but they have to be put in here.  What attracted me 
was what appeared to be a wrong pagination but that may 
be because they have been taken from another bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think let us do the ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The second. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...the second supplementary affidavit 
20 
and then we can take it from there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Mr Tsotsi, that one is on page 
1229.   
MR TSOTSI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you there? 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 16 of 259 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It runs up to page 1239. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You confirm that to be your signature 
...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...above your name.  I see this 
affidavit, you also did not date it.  So we pick up the date 
from the stamp, 25 February 2021. 
MR TSOTSI:   [No audible reply]  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that the date? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And can you confirm the contents of 
the affidavit? 
MR TSOTSI:   I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To be correct? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  I beg leave to have 
this supplementary affidavit dated 25 February 2021 be 
admitted as Exhibit U-17.3. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think the police officers who acted 
as commissioners of oaths let Mr Tsotsi down.  They did 
not fill in where they are supposed to fill in the dates and 
the place of the – where the affidavit was opposed to and 
initial every page. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 17 of 259 
 
 
The supplementary affidavit of Mr Andile Zola 
Tsotsi is which starts at page 1229 will be admitted and 
marked as Exhibit U-17.3. 
SUPPLEMENTARY AFFIDAVIT OF ANDILE ZOLA TSOTSI 
FROM PAGE 1229 IS ADMITTED AND MARKED AS 
EXHIBIT U-17.3 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What I was talking about is the 
document that comes after that affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   After the first one? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   After the second one.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   The second one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. it is minutes of a meeting, Eskom.  
And then at the top is says Eskom, 18, 2020.  Do you not 
have such a document? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I do not have it in mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I have got it here and I am 
supposed to have the same thing that you have. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is minutes of the Eskom Board Tender 
20 
Committee Meeting, 12-2016-17 held at Hugo Board Room.  
It is 8 February 2017.  So it must be bundle – Eskom 
Bundle 18. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is in the wrong bundle Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 18 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   File, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Ja, he is apologising.  [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   I wonder who would have put it here 
because is not to belong. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes-no, that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It must go to the right bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   The apology has been tendered. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Tsotsi, let us go to your first 
supplementary affidavit. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now that is – you heard the 
conversation earlier between me and the Chairperson 
about these emails regarding the composition of the sub-
committees of the Eskom Board Committee, committees of 
the board. 
 
The exchange of emails is on – it starts on page 
20 
1213 of the same bundle.  1213.  So as we go there, 
Mr Tsotsi. 
 
Can 
you 
assist 
us 
in 
regard 
to 
your 
recollection?   
 
Because you do say in your first affidavit that - 
talking about your second occasion when you engaged with 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 19 of 259 
 
Mr Salim Essa but the other occasion was when the board 
came into being where:  
“I was required to place board members in 
sub-committees of the board. 
Salim Essa sent me his configuration and 
asked that I pass it on to the Minister as my 
submission ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Where are you reading 
from? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is in Mr Tsotsi’s first affidavit.  Sorry 
10 
Chair.  That will be Eskom Bundle 7(B). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  In another bundle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is...  Yes, it is in the... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   7(A) of... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no I might not need to look at... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you will read the relevant portions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So: 
“...Salim Essa sent me his configuration and 
asked that I pass it onto the Minister as my 
submission. 
I quietly ignored the submission and sent mine 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 20 of 259 
 
to 
the 
Minister 
where 
upon 
the 
Minister 
responded with the exact submission I had 
received from Mr Salim Essa...” 
 
Now if I pause there for a moment because we 
are going to go into your meeting, the Minister's call to a 
meeting.   The picture is exactly as the Chairperson and I 
were talking. 
 
You received a list from Mr Salim Essa and we 
have been trying to find out how did you receive that list.  
So he sent it to you.  Is it by email? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, by email. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And we have not been able to locate 
that.  You have taken steps to do the same to find it, that 
list or the email, at least, from him to you. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, Chair I tried to find it but that – the 
mail does not exist anymore.  So I was not able to find 
anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But then you do say that the Minister 
also – the Minister responded with the exact submission.  
20 
So...  He says the exact submission Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is important, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 21 of 259 
 
“The exact submission I have received from 
Salim Essa.” 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So how ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So it was not substantially the same, it 
was exact? 
MR TSOTSI:   Well, exactly the same Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Including spelling errors? 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If you are looking for the page 
reference.  It is page 31 of that Eskom Bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I would like to have a look again. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I think ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just to refresh my memory.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 31. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And this was on the same day Mr Tsotsi 
or on another day when you sent yours – when you 
received Mr Salim Essa’s composition, then you sent yours 
20 
to the Minister and then the Minister sent Salim Essa’s 
composition to you, effectively?  Did this happen on the 
same day or over a few days? 
MR TSOTSI:   I would suspect Chair that it would have 
been a few days. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 22 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   Because I recall that the Minister was on 
holiday in Mozambique at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   So she was not in her office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So that is paragraph 20.3, 20.4, 
20.5 on page 31.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So it is 20.4 where he says: 
“The 
Minister 
responded 
with 
the 
exact 
submission I have received from Salim Essa.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Prior to this occasion when 
Mr Salim Essa sent you his proposed composition of the 
committees of the board, had you had interactions with 
him? I probably asked you this question before.  But did 
you know each other, you and Mr Salim Essa? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, he knew me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you knew each other. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I knew him too.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  But he – you make the point that 
he said you must send to the Minister as your own? 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 23 of 259 
 
MR TSOTSI:   That was his idea, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Okay alright. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You may continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  And then Mr Tsotsi, 
you – did I ask you, how did the Minister respond? 
MR TSOTSI:   The Minister responded by email. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, email? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but that too we do not have. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   No, I did not... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In terms of the exact same list of 
submission. 
MR TSOTSI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You see, when you on page 1213...  
Sorry, Chair I am going back to the first bundle.  ON page 
12...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay... uhm ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will come back to this one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  I am just...  So you – so this was 
20 
soon after your – after the appointment of the new board, 
right? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   These email exchanges happened. 
MR TSOTSI:   [No audible reply]  
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 24 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I put this away? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  But not – maybe just next to you 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]   
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   We will come back to it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am going to come back to it because 
...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I just want to exhaust this one point 
with Mr Tsotsi.   Mr Tsotsi, on the one that we are looking 
at, the first bundle we have been looking at, 7(B), 1213.  
1213, page 1213. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that is an email from you to the 
Minister, 16 December 2014. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You see that? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And you say: 
“Dear Minister.  I trust you are well.  Please 
find below the preliminary deployment of non-
executive 
board 
members 
to 
board 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 25 of 259 
 
committees. 
The Audit Committee has always been chaired 
by a CA...” 
 
Then let us leave that.  Then you have what you 
call the preliminary deployment of non-executives.  You 
have the names under various sub-committees. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Have you gone far from it? 
MR TSOTSI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that is what you have sent to the 
10 
Minister. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
“I would be happy to discuss this deployment 
with you should you so wish...” 
 
That is 16 December and you do say: 
“I trust you are enjoying your, some rest...” 
 
You say the Minister was away? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now turn to the next page, page 1214. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Now 
that 
is 
further 
emails 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 26 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Will somebody talk to somebody to make 
sure, if possible, that that group that is – does not disturb 
us.  Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair.  So there is a trail of 
emails Mr Tsotsi, and I think it starts on page 1215.  On 
the 26 Jan there is an email from you to the minister, 
Minister Lynne Brown send from iPad.  But at the bottom of 
the page I think you are forwarding the one at the bottom 
of the page to the minister.  Can you see the one right at 
the bottom of the page?  It says Dear Minister. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   At 1214. yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, it says Dear Minister, 12.15, page 
1215. 
MR TSOTSI:   1215? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, the trail of emails starts there. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You see there, it says Dear Minister 
and then you say: 
“Please find...” 
Go to the next page. 
20 
“Please 
find 
the 
revised 
board 
subcommittee 
deployment as follows.” 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So in December it was your preliminary 
deployment. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 27 of 259 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In December 2016 – if ’16 or ’15?  ’14, 
sorry, December 2014 you send a preliminary deployment 
list. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And now it is January 2015, you send 
the Minister a revised board sub-committee deployment 
list. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And what you see on the first list of the 
10 
December – well, I am looking at the spelling mistakes of 
the names, I see some of them are still incorrectly spelt, 
particularly Mr Zethembe Khoza is spelt as Zathembe 
Khoza.   
MR TSOTSI:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But I know you have an explanation in 
your affidavit now.  Then we have the minister ’s response 
to you on the 26 Jan, if you go back to page 1215 but the 
message is simply another minister writing – sorry, it is a 
forward by the minister by the officials in the department.  
20 
She responds to you on page 1214 on the 28 January 2015 
at 8.21, from Lynne Brown to Zola Tsotsi and others are 
copied there.  It says: 
“Dear 
Mr 
Tsotsi, 
thank 
you 
the 
email 
below 
regarding the composition of board committees.  
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 28 of 259 
 
Given that this is a newly appointed board, it is my 
responsibility 
as 
shareholder 
representative 
to 
formally 
consider 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
committees.  I would therefore appreciate it if the 
composition of both committees is submitted under 
formal cover letter of the following supporting 
information.” 
And she tells you a copy of the board resolution, on the 
composition, the draft resolution and gives you a list.  
What she does not do, however, is to provide you with her 
10 
own composition. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You remember this email? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Seleka, I have been going 
ahead with looking at these emails and left you behind. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I will not say anything about what I 
have seen ahead of you but I will go back to where you 
are.  Okay, what page are you now? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  1214. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   1214? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, 1214. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Of course the fact that 
your next witness will only be after lunch does not mean 
we do not need to finish with Mr Tsotsi as soon as 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 29 of 259 
 
possible.  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thanks, Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We will do the best to the issues – just 
stick to the issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So Mr – we are at the email which is in 
the middle of the page on page …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I just say that – or as far as I am 
concerned, we should not take more than two hours from 
10 
ten o’clock. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair.  Okay, thank you, Chair.  
So, Mr Tsotsi, there is no – you remember this email? 
MR TSOTSI:   I do recall the email, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  What is evident from here is that 
the minister does not communicate her own composition 
there but she does show an interest in the composition of 
all the committees. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  When you say the minister does not 
communicate her own list, she I think indirectly had done 
20 
that because you will recall that she at one point called me 
to her residence. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh yes, you can go there, ja.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, will maybe it will help, where is the 
email from the minister from her composition which you say 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 30 of 259 
 
was the same as Mr Salim Essa’s composition?  I thought 
we did have that.  Did we not have? 
MR TSOTSI:    I am not aware that it is there, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is that so? 
MR TSOTSI:   I do not know whether investigating has 
found any… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No they have not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The email that had spelling errors and 
so on, was it not from her?  I think that your one to her 
also seemed to have some spelling errors.  I do not know if 
10 
it is the same spelling errors but, for example, Khoza was 
written as Xhosa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, was that not the email from her? 
MR TSOTSI:   I think what she had done was simply to just 
reflect what she had been sent because I sent that same 
email as it was to her and it would have come back looking 
exactly the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, you got an email from Mr Salim 
Essa. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   With the composition.  I am under the 
impression that what you sent to the minister was your own 
composition which was different from Mr Salim Essa’s 
composition. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 31 of 259 
 
MR TSOTSI:   I did do that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but are you saying you also sent 
Salim Essa’s email to the minister or you say you do not 
…[intervenes] 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I did sent Salim Essa [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so you sent your own plus the one 
from Mr Salim Essa? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and then what she then sent to you 
10 
was effectively the Salim Essa composition. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that one that came from her why do 
we not have it?  Why do we not have that composition? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The one that came from the minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought we did have. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The one that came from the minister, 
Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, the composition. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do we only have Mr Tsotsi’s one? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We have Mr Tsotsi’s one in the email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  How do we not have that one?  I 
assume that the investigators looked at the …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Tsotsi’s emails. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 32 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   At even the minister ’s emails and her PA 
Ms Kim Davids.  Did they do that?  I was under the 
impression that previously we did have the email from the 
minister and we had the email from Mr Tsotsi to the 
minister 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What I was not sure about was whether 
we had Mr Salim Essa’s email but I thought the one that Mr 
Tsotsi sent to the minister we did have and the one that the 
minister sent back to Mr Tsotsi, I thought we did have but if 
10 
Mr Tsotsi says he is not aware of it, it must be that I was 
mistaken because he would know if that the bundle that he 
has used did have it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you also do not seem to remember 
that we had it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, I know we do not have the 
minister ’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so I must be mistaken then but how 
come we do not have it? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, so he is finding out form the 
investigators because I see the minister is using what 
appears to be her private email address.  Mr Tsotsi, the 
first one is Eskom’s email account, the one in December, 
Mr Tsotsi. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 33 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean, if we have Mr Tsotsi’s email... 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We should have the minister ’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We should have the minister ’s one at 
least. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Because we do have the 
minister ’s response to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And actually, we should have Salim 
Essa’s one as well. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  As well, ja, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So how come we do not have those? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We make note of that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you junior maybe in the meantime 
speak to the investigator?  I assume the investigators are 
not here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  They are not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Speak to them to try and get an answer 
on how come we do not have these emails. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what efforts were made to try and 
get them. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that they have tried everything, they 
could not get them or what is the position.  I mean, that 
would include looking at Mr Tsotsi’s Eskom that he used at 
the time, that would include looking at the minister ’s 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 34 of 259 
 
computers and her PA, Ms Davids’ computers at the 
Department of Public Enterprises and so on.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, just to then go to your affidavit, Mr 
Tsotsi, as you deal with it, this aspect in your affidavit.  I 
think you have now answered – already tendered the 
answer to the Chairperson whether you sent that email 
which had made mistakes or spelling mistakes to the 
minister.  Your first supplementary affidavit answers that 
10 
question. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which is on page 1222. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, can we just maybe quickly go 
through the emails. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Even without going to the affidavit just 
to complete this thing. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Tsotsi, at page 1213 there is an email 
20 
there from you to Ms Lynne Brown, the minister, is that 
correct? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the subject is Deployment of Non-
executive Board Members to Board Committees.  That is 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 35 of 259 
 
the email that Mr Seleka has already read into the record.  
Now that is the composition that you say you sent to the 
minister, that composition of the committees of the board. 
MR TSOTSI:   As I have received it from Mr Salim Essa, 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay. 
 Are 
you 
saying 
that 
the 
composition of the committees of the board as reflected in 
this email that you sent to the minister was taken as it was 
from the email from Mr Salim Essa? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, In other words, this composition was 
not yours. 
MR TSOTSI:   No, it was not my formulation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was Mr Salim Essa’s composition. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you presented it to the minister as 
yours? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is what I did initially and I subsequently 
then sent mine, the one that I had [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes because the email there says: 
“Dear Minister, I trust you are well and enjoying 
some rest.  Please find below the preliminary 
deployment of non-executive board members to 
board committees.  The audit committee at Eskom 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 36 of 259 
 
has always been checked by a CA.  We may have to 
deal with media reaction to this change.  Are you 
contemplating limiting the board to 13?  The 
previous board had 14 members.  For those serving 
on three committees depending on their day jobs, 
the workload may be quite taxing.” 
And then you say: 
“Audit and risk committee, the members would 
Chwayita Mabude and her or she would be the 
Chair, it is just that I do not know if it is a he or a 
10 
she.  Then the other members of the audit and risk 
committee 
would 
Ms 
Viroshini 
Naidoo, 
Nadia 
Carrim, Romeo Kumalo, Norman Baloyi.” 
Then you had the tender and procurement committee.  You 
said the Chair would be Ben Ngubane, the other members 
would be Mark Pamensky, then you wrote Z-a-t-h-e-m-b-e, 
Zathembe, X-h-o-s-a Zethembe, Xhosa.  The next member 
was Nazia Carrim, the next member was Chwayita Mabude.  
Now I stop there.  There was no member of the board who 
was Zathembe Xhosa, is that correct? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was a member of the board who 
was Zethembe, which is Z-e-t-h-e-m-b-e Khoza, K-h-o-z-a, 
not Xhosa. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 37 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So this was to the extent that it may 
have been intended to be a reference to Mr Zethembe 
Khoza, it was a very conspicuous spelling error, certainly 
for his surname.  But also, it is not Zathembe, it is 
Zethembe. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Then we go to the IFC, that is the 
Investment and Finance Committee.  Then you said it 
should be composed in this way.  The Chairperson should 
be Mark Pamensky, the other members would be Viroshini 
10 
Naidoo, Zola Tsotsi, Pat Naidoo, again Zathembe Xhosa, Z-
a-t-h-e-m-b-e Xhosa, X-h-o-s-a, again same mistake as in 
the reference to Zethembe Khoza under the tender and 
procurement committee. 
 
And then you said under the People in Governance 
Committee the Chair should be Nazia Carrim and the other 
members should be Ben Ngubane, Zola Tsotsi, Romeo 
Kumalo, Venete Klein and then under the Social, Ethics 
and Sustainability Committee you said the Chair should be 
Venete Klein, the other members should be Pat Naidoo, 
20 
Viroshini Naidoo and Norman Baloyio, Baloyio is B-a-l-o-y-
i-o.  Now you confirm that there was no member of the 
board who had that surname of Baloyio. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was a member of the board whose 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 38 of 259 
 
surname was Baloyi. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   B-a-l-o-y-i.  So you then say after giving 
this composition: 
“I would be happy to discuss this deployment with 
you should you so wish.  Kind regards, Chairman” 
So you presented this composition of these committees, 
five committees, as your suggestion. 
MR TSOTSI:   Initially, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Initially, yes.  Why did you do that?  
10 
Were you happy with this composition or did you do it 
because Salim Essa made this suggestion that you should 
present it as yours to the minister? 
MR TSOTSI:   Essentially that was the reason, Chair, I did 
it the first time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  And then what happened later 
on? 
MR TSOTSI:   Thereafter, I …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say you sent another one later on? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes because I realised that this would not 
20 
work because a lot of them were not in correspondence to 
their profession that the people had at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And also there were some committees that I, 
as Chairman, should not be involved. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 39 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   The IFC, for example. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   So I certainly had to revise what was here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And then I subsequently then sent the 
revision to – this is what we do not have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, now at the time you sent this 
email to the minister did you appreciate the spellings 
errors that we have talked about in the surnames of the 
10 
two members of the committee and the name in regard to 
one or did you not pick them up or did you have a reason 
to say you do not want to spelling, let it go as it is? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, I just decided to take what I got and 
just simply put it – and just passed it on the minister 
essentially.  So I was not – I did not have any intent of 
changing anything, that – as I had received it initially. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but my question is whether you did 
pick up the spelling errors and decided to leave them as 
they are. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   I certainly did pick up the spelling errors, 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, and decided to leave them as 
they were. 
MR TSOTSI:   I decided to leave them as they were, yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 40 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No special reason to say let me 
leave them as they are or was there a special reason? 
MR TSOTSI:   I would not say there was a special reason, 
Chair, except to say I just wanted what I had received to 
appear exactly the way it had come. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Now do we have your 
subsequent email to the minister where you then sent 
another composition or an amended composition? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   That is the email that I do not see here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And that is the one that we have just had a 
discussion about earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   That you asked that... I see they are 
looking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  We do not have that, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We do have it here, Chair.  Just before 
we move on, Chair, I should also point out the other 
20 
spelling mistake in regard to Nadia Carrim, Nazia Carrim. 
MR TSOTSI:   Nazia, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So under audit and risk. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  She is spelt Nadia and under tender 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 41 of 259 
 
procurement she is Nazia. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the correct one is which one, Nadia 
or Nazia? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Nazia. 
MR TSOTSI:   Nazia. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  Okay, then I think if we have 
got 
Mr 
Tsotsi’s 
subsequent 
email 
with 
a 
different 
composition or an amended composition let us go to that 
one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  That is the bottom of page 1215, 
10 
it starts there and goes to the next page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  So the first one was sent on 
the 16 December 2014 at eight minutes past two by Mr 
Tsotsi to Ms Lynne Brown and then on 26 January at 13.42 
Mr Tsotsi sent to Ms Lynne Brown another email and the 
subject is: 
“Deployment of Non-executive Board Members to 
Board Committees” 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And it says: 
20 
“Dear 
Minister, 
please 
find 
the 
revised 
board 
subcommittee deployment as follows.  Audit and 
risk and tender and procurement and IFC.” 
So I think that is the committees you are going to deal 
with.  And then it says: 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 42 of 259 
 
“Chwayita Mabude, Chair.” 
Then it says: 
“Ben Ngubane, Chair.  Mark Pamensky, Chair.  
Viroshini Naidoo, Chwayita Mabude, Pat Naidoo, 
Nadia Carrim, Zathembe Khoza…” 
Now Khoza is spelt correctly, but I think the A after Z is not 
correct but Khoza is spelt correctly.   
“Romeo Kumalo, Nazia Carrim…” 
So Nazia is written correctly. 
“Venete Klein, Norman Baloyi.” 
10 
I am not sure that I follow there.  What is the position?  
There are too many chairs there. 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay.  Let me just explain how this – this 
unfortunately taking the – this would have been a table but 
I think by the time it got – it got somehow corrupted, I do 
not know, but I can follow it.  What it is, is that you have 
got audit and risk.  If you imagine in a tabular form 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So because you have audit and risk first. 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja, let us say audit and risk is one table, 
20 
tender is another table and procurement is the third table.  
Chwayita Mabude goes into the first table, Ben Ngubane 
goes into the second table as tender and Mark Pamensky 
goes into the third, that is IFC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 43 of 259 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Then you follow the same sequence.  
Viroshini Naidoo goes under audit and risk , Chwayita 
Mabude then goes under tender, Pat Naidoo goes under 
IFC.  The same thing again, the third line, Nadia Carrim 
goes under audit and risk, Zathembe Khoza goes under 
tender and again Zathembe appears under IFC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So Mr Zethembe Khoza would be in two 
committees? 
MR TSOTSI:   Those two committees, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  And then again you have Romeo 
Kumalo audit.  Nazia Carrim is the tender, Venete Klein in 
the IFC and then Norman Baloyi would then be an 
additional member in the audit and risk committee.  So that 
is how it would have worked out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, okay.  And then …[intervenes] 
MR TSOTSI:   The same thing with the following one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then you have got People in 
Governance, Social, Ethics and Sustainability. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is right. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then under that heading you have 
got Zethembe Khoza and the spelling for both the name 
and the surname is correct. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Chair.  Then you have got Venete Klein, 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 44 of 259 
 
Chair.  Ben Ngubane, Pat Naidoo, Zola Tsotsi, Viroshini 
Naidoo, Venete Klein, Norman Baloyi, then you have 
Chwayita Mabude, Zola Tsotsi.  Just explain it here they 
way you explained the first one again? 
MR TSOTSI:   Right.  Again People in Governance, 
Zethembe Khoza is the Chairperson and the Social, Ethics 
and Sustainability, Venete Klein is the Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I am sorry, I think if you do one 
committee and complete it. 
MR TSOTSI:   Right, okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, Chair so and so, then the other 
members. 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay.  The way it would be then, Chair, is 
the People in Governance Committee members would be 
Zethembe, who is the Chairperson.  Ben Ngubane is a 
member of the committee.  Zola Tsotsi, member of the 
committee.  Venete Klein a member of the committee.  
Chwayita Mabude a member of the committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   And then Social Ethics and Sustainability, 
20 
Venete Klein is the Chairperson.  Pat Naidoo is a member 
of the committee.  Viroshini Naidoo a member of the 
committee.  Norman Baloyi, member of the committee.  
Zola Tsotsi, member of the committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  And then you say Emergency 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 45 of 259 
 
Task Team and New Build and then you have Ben Ngubane, 
Chair.  Zola Tsotsi, member.  Viroshini Naidoo, member.  
Nazeem (sic) Carrim and Romeo Kumalo, member.  And 
then you say Kind regards, Chairman, sent from my iPad. 
 
So now this was sent on the 26 January 2015, 
sixteen minutes to 4 p.m.  Was this your real genuine 
suggestion of how the committees of the board should be 
composed? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
And 
when 
one 
compares 
this 
10 
composition with the one you sent to the minister by way of 
your email of 16 December 2014 there are, I would 
assume, a number of differences, is that correct? 
MR TSOTSI:   There are some differences. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   The important difference have to - got to do 
with me in particular. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR TSOTSI:    The important difference have got to do 
with 
the 
Chairperson 
because 
of 
the 
need 
for 
the 
20 
Chairperson not sit in some of the committees. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe what should happen, Mr Seleka… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If your junior could – because I do not 
think this is done anywhere but you will tell me if it is 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 46 of 259 
 
done. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you could work out the differences 
between the two lists. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I assume – I take it she was following 
how Mr Tsotsi explained who would be in which committee 
in terms of his own composition. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes I have done that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And compare and then – because she 
10 
can prepare her document just by hand. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which she can give to you later on 
before Mr Tsotsi leaves the witness stand then he can just 
confirm that the following are the differences between the 
two compositions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright, okay so you confirm Mr Tsotsi 
20 
that this email of the 26 t h of January that you sent to Lynn 
Brown represents your suggestions in the true sense, and 
that the one of the 16 t h of December, although you 
presented it to the Minister as your suggestion, but 
actually, you just took Mr Salim Essa’s composition and 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 47 of 259 
 
you sent it to her as his as well. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, alright.  I think this is important 
because what it means is that you are saying, even if we 
might not be having the email from the Minister, that where 
she sent you her composition, you are saying that once 
you had received it, you compared it with the composition 
of Mr Salim Essa and you realised that they were exactly 
the same. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    That is what you are saying?  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, okay you may continue Mr Seleka, I 
thought it is important to get this right, but it might be 
important to go to the emails that were exchanged in 
connection with this but I just wanted to make sure this is 
clarified.  
ADV SELEKA SC:    Well, that is fine Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:    So I leave it to you, I know they are in 
front of you.  You might have wanted to refer and it may be 
20 
important to refer to the contents of the emails exchanged, 
as well, but I leave it to you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, no that is fine.  I think what the 
Chairperson…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    And of course previously they may have 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 48 of 259 
 
been covered.  
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But there may have been some things to 
highlight, for example, what we have covered now we may 
have covered before, but I do not think as clearly as it now 
emerges. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, so it may well be that in the emails 
there are things that we should highlight such. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    I suggest, Mr Tsotsi. I think the one 
10 
thing that you seek to correct is what was stated previously 
in your first affidavit that you had ignored Salim Essa’s 
submission to you, can you tell the Chairperson. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    So you in fact did not ignore it, you 
did send it to the Minister in December 2014.  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I think ignored in the sense of that 
being the final - ignore it in a sense of it not being the final 
document that would represent the actual formulation, but 
not ignored in the sense of not having passed it on to the 
20 
Minister.  Maybe that is the clarification to make. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Well the other thing I mean, the other 
thing you might want to explain is you when you send the 
email to the Minister in December…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    Well, I am sorry, Mr Seleka I thought 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 49 of 259 
 
you would question Mr Tsotsi further on the evidence about 
ignoring but Mr Tsotsi there are not two meanings about 
ignoring something.  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:    There is only one meaning, ignoring 
something is to do nothing about it, is it not?  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Here you did not do nothing about it Mr 
Salim Essa’s composition, you did exactly what he asked 
you to do, you presented it to the Minister.  
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:    As your own, is it not?  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Therefore, it is not correct to say you 
ignored it, it cannot be correct. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, you may later on have decided that 
no, no you thought that composition was wrong and then 
sent another composition but cannot be correct to say you 
ignored it.  
20 
MR TSOTSI:   I think that is what I meant when I initially 
wrote what that. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, but what I am putting to you is it 
was not true to say you ignored it when you knew that you 
did actually do what Mr Salim Essa asked you to do about 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 50 of 259 
 
it, namely present to the Minister as yours.  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:    You accept that?  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Thank you, Chair, that takes care of -  
I was going to follow it up, it takes care of it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, I am sorry, well it shows that we 
did not collude, so I did I did not know you were still 
coming back to it.  I thought you were leaving it and maybe 
10 
you – ja, okay but ja, you may continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    No, because the submission in the 
affidavits Mr Tsotsi is quite clear he says: 
“I quietly ignored it.” 
CHAIRPERSON:    Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    What Mr Tsotsi said in his affidavit, he 
says: 
“I quietly ignored his submission.” 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    “And sent mine to the Minister.” 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, so it does not suggest that you 
sent it, yes well continue, deal with that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    So, I think it is very clear, Mr Tsotsi it 
does not admit of another interpretation.  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 51 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:    But after you sent this to the Minister, 
you do say in your email: 
“I would be happy to discuss this development with 
you, if you should so wish.” 
Between your - after this and the sending of the next email 
in January 2015 was there a discussion of the Minister that 
led to the revision of this list? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, there was no discussion with the 
Minister itself, no.  
ADV SELEKA SC:    Chair, you may want to know the 
10 
Minister's version of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, no that is important, yes, that is   
important but I do not know whether – ja let us hear the 
Minister's version and obviously, we need to look at that 
email from her to Mr Tsotsi on the 28 t h of January.  
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, that is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And I take it that that particular email, 
which is at 12:14 the bottom one from the middle of the 
page from the Minister to Mr Tsotsi is a response to his, Mr 
Tsotsi’s of 26 January, would that be correct?  
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes sir.  
CHAIRPERSON:    We have a response from the Minister 
to you, in response to your email of 16 December that is 
the one where you sent her Mr Salim Essa’s composition.  
Did she respond to that, as far as you remember? 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 52 of 259 
 
MR TSOTSI:   On there on the 16 t h of December? 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   She, like I said Chair she responded with 
the same version there. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, but that response, do you know, 
whether it was after you had sent the second one, your 
composition on the 26 t h of January or was this before you 
sent your own suggestion of the composition? 
MR TSOTSI:   It would have been before. 
CHAIRPERSON:    It would have been before? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay.  Do you remember whether in 
response to what she sent you, you said anything or the 
next thing you did was to send her your own composition of 
the 26 t h of January?  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, that is what I did, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, okay alright.  
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, so then, Mr Tsotsi while still 
there when does the Minister call you to meet with her?  
Where you found her in the presence of Salim Essa and Mr 
20 
Tony Gupta.  
MR TSOTSI:   I do not remember exactly the sequence but 
obviously, it would have been I think sometime in January, 
because she would have been gone for a good part of 
December and this would have happened sometime in 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 53 of 259 
 
January.  
ADV SELEKA SC:    Okay, this is the impression in one's 
mind that you would have sent the first email of the 
composition in December 2014.  You would have followed 
that up, or prior to you following it up, you say the Minister 
would have sent a composition which match that of Salim 
Essa. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:    But then why would she do that, if it is 
the same as Salim Essa’s because she should actually 
10 
respond to yours, which differs from Salim Essa’s. 
MR TSOTSI:   I - she would have had responded to mine, 
for sure.  Which is what I had said in my affidavit, her 
response would have been, from what I had - the changes 
that I had made in in what I sent her. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, then it makes sense if it is like 
that. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja, do you follow then it makes sense 
if it is like that. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, because if I had not made any changes, 
she would not have any reason to respond with what had 
come from Salim Essa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes.  Chair, what Mr Tsotsi is 
explaining here is the sequence because he was saying to 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 54 of 259 
 
you, the Minister would have responded to him, after his 
email of December with the Minister's own composition.  
But then my question to him was if…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    After his email of? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    December 2014, the first…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, the 16 December one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Correct, he was saying to you the 
Minister 
would 
have 
responded 
with 
the 
Ministers 
composition, which was the same as Salim Essa’s.  So I 
was asking, but what would be the point because the 
10 
Minister had the same composition in mind, she did not 
have to respond to you.  
So what he is explaining is, well, the probability is 
that the Minister would have responded with Salim Essa’s, 
same composition only after his revised composition of 
January 2015.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But is that something you remember as 
having happened in that sequence, or you are speculating 
20 
as to how it happened, namely, when in relation to your 
email to the Minister of 16 December 2014, and your email 
to her of 26 January 2015, in other words…[intervene] 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, there is a communication that is not 
here. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 55 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And that is between myself and the Minister, 
following my sending her what Salim Essa says, sent me.  
So 
I 
then 
sent 
her 
what 
I 
then 
reformulated 
from 
what…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:    I am sorry, I did not hear, following 
your? 
MR TSOTSI:   Following my having sent her what Salim 
Essa had sent me. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, yes there was some interaction 
10 
subsequent to the corrections.  
MR TSOTSI:   Correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you sent the one, you’re one the 
composition on 26 t h January. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, definitely. 
CHAIRPERSON:    During that period. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:    On the same subject the interactions 
were on the same subject? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, Chairman you see that email that I 
20 
have sent to her which differed from what Salim Essa had 
sent is what caused her to call me to her residence where 
Salim Essa and Tony Gupta were present, and then said to 
me, that the composition of the Board will be as she had 
sent it to me.  
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 56 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, now I did see that when I looked at 
your affidavit earlier on that in relation to that you said 
exactly that.  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:    You say in your affidavit that she called 
you. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:    And at that meeting, both Mr Salim Essa 
and Tony Gupta were there. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    That is what you say and you do say in 
your affidavit, she said that the composition of the 
committees of the Board would be as she had sent them to 
you.  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I did see that, ja.  So but I think the 
unfortunate thing is that in your affidavit, you do not give 
dates for that meeting or an estimate.  But what is your 
recollection, if you do have any recollection as to around 
about when that meeting happened in relation to the 16 t h of 
20 
December when you sent her the Salim Essa composition 
and the 26 t h of January, when you sent her what you say 
was your real composition.  Did it happen before, between 
the two dates or did it happen after the 26 t h of January? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, it happened between the two days.  
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 57 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Between the two days? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, sometime in January, it would have 
been early January. 
CHAIRPERSON:    It would have been early January? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:    You see, if it happened after the 26 t h of 
January, it may well be that she would have called you to a 
meeting to make this point because she realised that you 
were not going along with her composition, okay.  If you 
met before, between the 6 t h of January with her then you 
10 
must have communicated with her in one way or another, 
that you were not going along with her list, with her 
composition otherwise, why would she call you. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is exactly what I am saying.   
CHAIRPERSON:    You did communicate that? 
MR TSOTSI:   I did communicate to her subsequent to, like 
I said, subsequent to what I had sent initially as having 
been Salim Essa’s, I sent her my version, and then she 
came back and said, no I must stick to the one that is the 
same as what Salim Essa had sent. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   So then this is all happening before the 26 t h 
to my recollection. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So are you therefore saying, when you 
sent her the composition of the 26 t h of January, it was not 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 58 of 259 
 
the first time that you were sending her a composition that 
was different from the Salim Essa composition? 
MR TSOTSI:   It was not the first time, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:    And are you sure about that because I 
do not think we have an email that that reflects that you 
sent her a composition prior to the 26 t h of January, are you 
sure about that? 
MR TSOTSI:   I seem to recall as such Chair because that 
is the email I am saying we do not have here.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes.  
10 
MR TSOTSI:    Remember initially, I said there is an email 
that is missing. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes.  
MR TSOTSI:   And that is the one which I believe would 
have reflected the changes that I initially proposed to the 
Minister.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, how different if you are able to 
remember you might not remember, is your composition of 
the 
26 t h 
of 
January 
how 
different 
was 
it 
from 
the 
composition that you sent her at some stage between the 
20 
16 t h of December, and the 26 t h of January? 
MR TSOTSI:   To my recollection, Chairman, the only thing 
that I can clearly remember is that I had taken myself out 
of – in particularly IFC. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes.  
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 59 of 259 
 
MR TSOTSI:   The other thing I would have done if it was 
not I do not recall by looking at this, but I would have liked 
to have used the experience of Chwayita Mabude in one of 
the – to Chair one of the committee.  I do not remember 
which one, I suspect it could have been the Audit 
Committee, or maybe people in governance, I cannot 
remember.  But I do not remember the details on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, but also in the meantime, thank 
you for giving me probably the correct pronunciation for Mr 
Mabude is it Chwayita Mabude? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Chwayita.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, no I think I have been saying 
Dhwayita Mabude and I am embarrassed to that, I thought 
it cannot be Chwayita maybe probably Dhwayita so it is 
Chwayita.   
So you say you have taken out yourself out of the 
Investment and Finance Committee that is one thing you 
remember.  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, alright.  So but if that meeting 
20 
happened, somewhere between 16 December 2014 and 26 
January 2015.  It means that despite the Minister having 
insisted to you in that meeting that the composition of the 
committees would be, as in effect Salim Essa had given 
them, of course, she was saying, as she had given them to 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 60 of 259 
 
you, it would mean that you persisted in coming up with a 
different composition.  Is that right?  
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Is that what happened? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, that is exactly what happened.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, and now I see that the revised or 
the composition of committees of the Board that you sent 
on 26 January 2015.  The one that is at page 1215, you 
sent at 13:52, 13 hours 52, but there is another one, which 
appears at page 1218 it is of the same date, that is 26 t h 
10 
January 2015 and it is sent at 18:53, do you see that one? 
Do we know whether it is exactly the same as the other 
one? The - it appears to have been the email to have been 
redone, I am not sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    It is from the duplication.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Mr Seleka, have you checked whether 
the two are the same the composition or you had not 
looked at that?  I think your junior can look as well as to 
whether there is a difference in the composition between 
the email at page 1218 and the emails starting at page 
20 
1215 at the bottom and continuing at page 1216. 
So because if there is a difference between the two 
then we need to know and that might be the reason why it 
may have been sent the latest one was sent a minute or 
two after the other one.  What is your recollection Mr 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 61 of 259 
 
Tsotsi, is it that you may have sent on one day two 
different 
compositions 
or 
what? 
 
They 
seem 
to 
be…[intervene] 
MR TSOTSI:   I would have thought they would have been 
the same, I do not recall quite honestly Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   I would have - my initial reaction would have 
been that they would have been the same.  
CHAIRPERSON:    But I see that is the – or the 
composition in the one or at 1218 in terms of how you 
10 
arrange it needs the same explanation that you gave in 
regard to the other one as to who, if you want to find out 
who was going to be in what committee.  Okay, so I think 
your junior will check that so that we can - we would be 
able to say the first one of 16 December was like this.  The 
second one of 26 January, if you compare the two what you 
find and then if you compare the one at 1218 with the one 
at 1215 what are the differences. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So that we know that okay, alright. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   I have just gone through them Chairman 
they are the same.  
CHAIRPERSON:    They are the same? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, alright but the, Mr Seleka’s junior 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 62 of 259 
 
will just confirm because she will have a little bit more time 
to look at it than you have to, okay alright.   I think Mr 
Seleka if I am not mistaken, you were going to look at the 
content of the emails but you are also going to put Ms Lynn 
Browns version. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So feel free to proceed as you want to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    And Chair her affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh, I see we have gone past the tea 
break. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:    I thought – no I let it go Chair 
because I thought when we take a break, we will take a 
long time break, I was aware of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I suspect you probably still need more 
time than you have between now and twelve. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Because there have been lots of 
discussion on the issues. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:    No, let us take the tea break so that 
20 
when - you can use the tea break also to just rearrange 
how you want to deal with issues.  
ADV SELEKA SC:    Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, okay let us take a tea break.  We 
will return at, it is nearly twenty to, we will return at ten to 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 63 of 259 
 
twelve.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay you may proceed Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Let me go to – let 
me start off with the version of the Minister.  It will take us 
back to the emails.  The Minister ’s affidavit, Chair, is found 
in bundle – Eskom Bundle 7(A). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Eskom Bundle 7? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   7(A) 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I want to go straight to the page 
which is page 444. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the page we should go to? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   444.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom Bundle ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   Which one is it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   7(A). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it 444? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Yes, Chair 444. 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, there is written on top of the 
numbers there. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 64 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  The previous page is 443. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That one, everyone can see.  And 444 
is hidden by the letters of the affidavit but paragraph 43 of 
it.  And I am going to skip some of the paragraphs Chair.  
It says: 
“Legally, 
I 
was 
only 
responsible 
for 
the 
appointment of members of only two board 
committees at Eskom. 
These are the Audit and Risk and the Social 
10 
and Ethics Committees...” 
 
Now you saw in the email, the Minister actually 
wanted you to account to her in respect of all the sub-
committees.  So you have to keep...  Ja, that page 1214 
open in the other file Mr Tsotsi, those emails exchange 
with the Minister. 
MR TSOTSI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So 1214, page 1214, where the 
Minister says:  Dear Mr Tsotsi. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...Thank you for the email.  Then she 
says: 
“Given that this is a newly appointed board, it 
is 
my 
responsibility 
as 
shareholder 
representative 
to 
formally 
consider 
the 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 65 of 259 
 
composition of the committees...” 
 
So she did not limit it to the Audit and Risk and 
Social and Ethics Committees. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  She, actually, had no...  I am saying – 
what is said here Chair is correct that her responsibility 
would be those two sub-committees.  The rest of the 
committees, really, did not acquire her authorisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   But I see here that she states she would like 
to be informed of the composition of all sub-committees. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Because even the next paragraph 
in her email she says: 
“I would, therefore, appreciate it...” 
 
In the email. 
“I 
would, 
therefore, 
appreciate 
it 
if 
the 
composition of board committees is submitted 
under formal cover letter with the following 
supporting information...” 
 
So she wanted all the board -sub-committees. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you respond – did you provide her 
with the information as requested in this email? 
MR TSOTSI:   I would have.  I would, in the normal course 
of things Chair, I would have provided her with the 
information that she required. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 66 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, let us see what...  Chair, there 
are other significant things there in the Minister ’s affidavit 
but I want to go to where she deals directly with Mr Tsotsi’s 
version and that is on the next page 445 from paragraph 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...paragraph 56.  Mr Tsotsi, you are 
there? 
MR TSOTSI:   Wait.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   [No audible reply]  
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  She says: 
“I cannot comment on a list that allegedly was 
sent by Mr Essa to Mr Tsotsi as I have never 
seen it. 
Mr Tsotsi never specified, at any stage, the 
composition of this list, nor did he ever 
indicate what was his own drawn-up list look 
like. 
It is inexplicable to me that in the execution of 
20 
the board’s task of appointing members of 
board 
committees 
Mr Tsotsi 
would 
not 
generate his own list but would rather work 
from a list, allegedly compiled, by a strange to 
Eskom...” 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 67 of 259 
 
 
She says: 
“I persist and deny that any ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, now she is dealing with the meeting 
there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The first two paragraphs. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I said the first two paragraphs. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But she says nothing about, where one 
would have expected to say something, about – this is 
paragraphs 66 and 67 but she says nothing about is the 
evidence by Mr Tsotsi that the composition that he sent her 
on the 16 t h of December was from Mr Salim Essa and that 
the composition that she returned to – she sent to 
Mr Tsotsi was exactly the same. 
 
But of course, she was responding here to 
Mr Tsotsi’s affidavit, not to the evidence that we have just 
20 
heard.  So it might be important to check whether the part 
where Mr Tsotsi says the composition of the committees 
that was sent to the Minister on the 16 t h of December was 
Mr Salim Essa’s composition. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 68 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know if he makes that clear in 
the affidavit.  Do you recall whether you made that clear in 
your earlier affidavit, not this one, the recent ones? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   I would have made it clear chair.  I am sure I 
did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think you did.  You would have 
made it clear that the composition she sent you was the 
same as Mr Salim Essa’s one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would have made that clear? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is clear Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What I am not sure about is whether is 
clear that Mr Salim Essa’s composition is the one reflected 
in Mr Tsotsi’s email to the Minister of 16 December.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Well, right now, Mr Tsotsi says, 
yes, it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He says that is the list he received 
20 
from Mr Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But that is only now Mr Tsotsi because 
in the first affidavit the message that one picks up from 
your affidavit is that, what you received from Salim Essa, 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 69 of 259 
 
you did not pass on to the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Instead, you sent your own and 
ignored Mr Salim Essa’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the submission in the first 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So then, if the Minister says:  The 
letter you say you received from Salim Essa, I never saw 
10 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She will be right in saying that 
because in the first affidavit you said you never passed it 
onto her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But now, obviously, she has to 
20 
respond...  Well, that is she going to know whether or not it 
is Salim Essa’s list of the 16 t h of December 2014.  One 
would have to do a comparative analysis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But what is curious in the response by 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 70 of 259 
 
the Minister, Chair, which is clear from Mr Tsotsi’s version 
is that there was an exchange of emails. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   “I sent my list to the Minister.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The Minister does not seem to answer 
that part. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In fact, she is saying, it is strange that 
Mr Tsotsi would have relied on somebody else’s list and 
10 
not created his own list. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And does not say whether or not she 
received the list from Mr Tsotsi.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She...  Well, she seems to indicate 
that she did not.   
“Mr Tsotsi never specified, at any stage, the 
composition of this list [which is supposedly 
Mr Salim Essa’s list], nor did he ever indicate 
20 
what his own drawn up list look like...” 
 
Now that, obviously, there is an email where you 
sent your revised list.  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  Chair, if – the more I look at this email 
that I sent to her, the more it seems to me that there is a 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 71 of 259 
 
suggestion that I was bribing the Minister, that I would 
make some changes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is a suggestion that? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is was bribing the Minister that I would 
be making some changes in this... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, h’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   ...in this composition. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   So I just think that it is a pity that there is 
not that communication which I subsequently sent to her.  
10 
On the issue of ignoring.  I think the – my original affidavit 
was really dealing with the idea of ignoring the content of 
what Mr Essa had sent me, knowing that I would be 
refusing my own content in terms of the composition. 
 
I mean, that is still in my mind at the time I 
wrote the affidavit because I am now saying to myself I am 
not going to bother with this guy’s submission.  I am going 
to do my own submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   So that, I think that is – I am now to 
20 
interpret what I think what was really in my mind at the 
time.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   It is not reflected like that.  I did send his 
...[intervenes]  
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 72 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but you see.  You – what we do know 
now because you have said you did send Mr Salim Essa’s 
composition to the Minister.  Is that – you did not ignore it? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see? 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So saying you ignored it was incorrect. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Even if you were going to knew you were 
going to send your own later, by sending it to the Minister, 
10 
you were not ignoring it. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see?  So that part of your previous 
affidavit where you may have said you ignored it, could not 
be correct.  Well, I see that in paragraph 40 of the 
Minister ’s affidavit, she does say she rejects Mr Tsotsi’s 
accusation, that is 40.1, 40.2. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
“In particular, I reject the accusation that I was 
20 
in collusion with the Gupta’s or any other 
person in executing my duties as a Minister...” 
 
She puts ‘was in collusion’ in quotation marks.  
So one must take it that she is therefore saying...  Unless 
she would be able to explain how come she came up with 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 73 of 259 
 
exactly the same composition that Mr Salim Essa came up 
with.  Unless she could explain that, it would appear that 
they may have been working together.   
 
Unless, Mr Tsotsi, you are wrong to associate his 
or her, that is the Minister, the Minister ’s composition of 
the committees with Mr Tsotsi’s(sic) composition because 
she would say:  Why do you not associate it with the 
composition you sent me? 
 
You sent me a certain composition by way of 
your email of the 16 t h of December.  I sent you exactly the 
10 
same composition.  Why do you not say the composition 
that the Minister sent to me was the same as the 
composition that I sent him – I sent her? 
 
In other words, the fact that she sent you 
composition of the committees of the board that is the 
same as the composition that Mr Salim Essa sent you, 
might not necessarily mean that there was collusion 
between herself and Mr Salim Essa if she simply said:   
 
I am taking Mr Tsotsi’s composition.  He sent me 
this.  Here is the email of the 16 t h of December.  I was 
20 
happy with that.  I did not say I am happy with your 
composition. I did send him a new document but it was 
exactly the same.   
 
Why – what would you say to that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Like I say Chair, she has – she had two.   
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 74 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Two what? 
MR TSOTSI:   Two compositions that I sent her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is what I said earlier and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I did not hear that.  She sent you 
two compositions are different times? 
MR TSOTSI:   No ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or on the same time? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, Chair.  After I have sent her what I have 
received from Salim Essa as is, the ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Presumption? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, the composition.  I, subsequently, sent 
her my own that I had. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before the 26 t h of January? 
MR TSOTSI:   Before the 26 t h, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Then she responded to say the composition 
that she accepts is the one that I first sent her which is the 
one I have received from Salim Essa, as is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But that is the question I am 
20 
putting to you.  She would say:  Mr Tsotsi, why do you not 
say to the Commission I sent you a composition of the 
committees of the board that was the same as the one you 
sent me?  Why do you say I sent you the composition of 
the board, board committees that was the same as Salim 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 75 of 259 
 
Essa’s one?   
 
Because you do not know whether Salim Essa 
communicated with me but you do know the composition 
you sent me on the 16 t h of December.  Why are you not 
saying 
the 
Minister 
sent 
me 
a 
composition 
of 
the 
committees of the board that was the same as the one I 
have sent to her? 
 
You want to paint her as cooperating with Salim 
Essa in circumstances where there is a document from you 
to her which has this composition and in that email you did 
10 
not say to her:  I got this composition from somebody else.  
You represented it as your own one. 
 
So what do you say to that? 
MR TSOTSI:   She may have reason to say so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   Because she does not know that I have 
received – she has not got proof that I received the 
composition from Salim Essa which I then passed on to 
her.  
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   She does not have the benefit of that 
information. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Unfortunately, I did not indicate to her that 
that is the case ...[intervenes]  
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 76 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   ...that I sent her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you then not agree, therefore, 
that you are being unfair to her to say she sent you a 
composition of the board committees that was the same as 
Salim Essa’s.   
 
Therefore, creating the impression that she had 
worked together with Salim Essa in circumstances where, 
one, you do not know whether she had ever seen Salim 
Essa’s email or composition as coming from Salim Essa but 
10 
you know that she had seen yours. 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, it would not make – that might 
have been the case had it not been for the fact that she 
called me to her residence where upon I found her sitting 
with Tony Gupta and Salim Essa.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And then she said to me that the version of 
the composition of the board’s sub-committees is what she 
had sent me.  That is the version that she... 
CHAIRPERSON:   So your answer is.  On the face of it, 
20 
she may be right if she says – if she was simply looking at 
the emails, the email you sent her and her response. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She may be right to complain that you 
are being unfair to her. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 77 of 259 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To say she sent you a composition of the 
board committees that was the same as Salim Essa’s one, 
instead of saying that was the same as the one you sent 
her on the 16 t h of December but you are saying if that is 
where the matter had ended, she could have had a point. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say the matter did not end 
there. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   She, subsequently, called you to a 
meeting at her residence, is that right, or was it at the 
office? 
MR TSOTSI:   At her residence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At her residence, where you found her in 
the company of Mr Salim Essa and Mr Tony Gupta. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And she raised the issue of the 
composition of the board committees and told you in clear 
terms that the composition of board committees would be 
20 
the way she had sent it to you. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And because of that, your suggestion is 
that the – and you must tell me if I misunderstand your 
evidence – your suggestion is that there was some working 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 78 of 259 
 
together between her and Mr Salim Essa. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is the reason I came to that conclusion, 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Yes, Chair, I – I 
think the point may have been exhausted now.  Ja.  I could 
move on to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you can move onto something else. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, you – I presented to you 
10 
earlier on when you wanted to deal with her version about 
the meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I think you might – you must deal 
with that.  What does she say about the meeting where 
Mr Tsotsi says she said that the composition of the board 
committees would be as she had sent them to him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  She does not say much.  
Mr Tsotsi, that is on page 445, paragraph 58 where the 
Minister says: 
20 
“I persist in denying that a Mr Tony Gupta and 
a 
Mr 
Salim 
Essa 
were 
not 
together 
or 
individually visited at my official residence in 
Pretoria...” 
 
Ja, then she goes on to explain something else.   
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 79 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But does she admit that a meeting took 
place and between herself and Mr Tsotsi when she made 
this 
– 
she 
insisted 
and 
she 
only 
denying 
that 
Mr Salim Essa and Mr Tony Gupta were there or, what is 
the position? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The meeting between her and Mr Tsotsi 
is not specifically dealt with Chair.    
CHAIRPERSON:   She does not deal with it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No.   
CHAIRPERSON:   That is strange. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, she does not specifically deal with 
the meeting.  I mean, it is equally strange that she denies 
seeing Mr Tsotsi’s list of the composition, that it was not 
given to her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does she – which list does she deny 
seeing? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She denies seeing, what Mr Tsotsi 
says is Salim Essa’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the 16 t h of December? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, whichever date it was. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the date is 16 December, the one 
that 
– 
for 
the 
composition 
that 
Mr Tsotsi 
says 
was 
Mr Salim Essa’s composition. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the 16 t h of December. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 80 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
And 
then 
Mr Tsotsi’s 
one 
is 
26 January 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She also denies ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   She denies both? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...that Mr Tsotsi showed her his list. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sent her his list? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, which is paragraph 57. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, paragraph 57 Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That: 
“Mr Tsotsi never specified, at any stage, the 
composition of this list...”   
 
That is the one Salim Essa. 
“...nor did he ever indicate what his own 
drawn-up list looked like...” 
 
So the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But at page 1214 of Eskom Bundle 7. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is an email from her to Mr Tsotsi 
on 28 January 2015 at twenty-one past eight in the 
morning...  No, no.  I am sorry.  Ja, in the morning. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the subject is:  Deployment of Non-
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 81 of 259 
 
Executive Board Members to Board Committees. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Now, 
two 
days 
before, 
on 
the 
26 t h of January, Mr Tsotsi had sent her what he regard as 
his composition. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So she says in that email: 
“Dear Mr Tsotsi.  Thank you for the email 
below regarding the composition of the board 
committees...” 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I do not know whether below, the 
email below is the...  Well, the email below from Mr Tsotsi 
is, I think, the one at page 1215 of Eskom Bundle 7. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sent on the 26 t h of January 2015 at 
13:52. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And we read that, earlier on, starting 
with Dear Minister.  Sent to lynnebrown5@me.com. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is the composition.  So there is 
an email where that appears to respond to Mr Tsotsi’s 
composition. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 82 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   At least, as far as that one is concerned. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That there might not be an email from 
her, I am not sure, that relates to the one of the 
16 t h of December. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But there seems to be a response to this 
one.  And she says in that email at page 1214: 
“Given that this is a newly appointed board, it 
is 
my 
responsibility 
as 
shareholder 
10 
representative 
to 
formally 
consider 
the 
composition of committees. 
I 
would, 
therefore, 
appreciate 
it 
if 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
board 
committees 
is 
submitted under formal cover letter with the 
following supporting information...” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it seems that Mr Tsotsi had sent the 
proposed composition of committees ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   ..in a manner that she did not regard as 
the right one.  And she says it should be send under formal 
cover letter.  And then she says it should be accompanied 
by a number of things that she sets out there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 83 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then she says, after setting out a 
list of six items that should be included: 
“If it can be avoided, I would caution against 
the same membership for the Audit and Risk 
and the Tender Committees...” 
 
And one can look at Mr Tsotsi’s composition of 26 
January whether one is able to see what concern she is 
referring to there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then she says: 
10 
“However, I am cognisant of the need to maximise 
the capacity of the board in assigning membership 
to committees. 
However, I can recall that approval was granted to 
collapse the Audit and Risk with the procurement 
and would appreciate a briefing on the rationale for 
the committee, while noting that there is also a 
tender it would be appreciated if you can provide 
the formal submissions by Friday 30 January 2015.  
Further, I am yet to receive Eskom’s 2015 board 
20 
annual calendar highlighting amongst days the 
proposed AGM stakeholder engagement [indistinct – 
dropping voice] and road show linked to actual 
annual and interim results.  I would appreciate if 
you could expedite within the same timeline as 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 84 of 259 
 
above.” 
Those paragraphs of her email seem to suggest that she 
had seen a composition of the committees from either the 
Chairperson or the board [indistinct – dropping voice] and 
she was commenting as to what – she was making certain 
observations based on those. 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, can I just comment? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   On here on page 445 of bundle 7 
…[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
MR TSOTSI:   445. 
CHAIRPERSON:   445? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR TSOTSI:   Item 57 – item 56 and 57. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Item 56 where she talks about not having 
seen what was sent by Mr Essa, allegedly sent by Mr Essa 
to me.  Now on 57 – because I want to say – because she 
20 
never specified at any stage the composition of this list, 
nor did he ever indicate what his own drawn up of this 
looks like. Now does this imply that she in fact is denying 
having received the email of the 16 December because that 
is where he would have then seen what would purportedly 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 85 of 259 
 
have been, according to me, what Mr Essa had sent me.   
 
So I do not know whether this item refers – the fact 
that she is saying that she has not at any stage received 
composition of any list. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, she says she has never seen a list 
that you allegedly may have received from Mr Salim Essa 
and then she says you never at any stage specified the 
composition of that list which means she, by implication, 
denies having seen that list or composition of the 16 
December that you sent, that is the one you said is a Salim 
10 
Essa composition.  She says she has never seen that and 
then she goes on – or she did not see that one of Salim 
Essa and then she says: 
“Nor did you ever indicate…” 
Or drawn up your own that you sent to her.  That is what 
she says. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  She denies both, Mr Tsotsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  She seems to deny both, but the 
email that I have just read is there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, she has to deal with that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, she would have to explain how she 
reconciles that version with her email to you that I just 
read earlier. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue? 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 86 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair.  Chair, my junior has 
done 
a 
table, 
a 
comparative 
table 
to 
show 
the 
commonalities and differences between the two lists.  We 
need to give Mr Tsotsi [indistinct – dropping voice] 
CHAIRPERSON:   While you are looking that, Mr Tsotsi I 
note that in your email to Ms Lynne Brown, in your email of 
26 January 2015 which you sent at 13.52, after saying 
Dear Minister, you say: 
“Please 
find 
the 
revised 
board 
subcommittee 
deployment as follows.” 
10 
Which suggests that you – you write on the basis that 
suggests she is aware of a previous composition, that is 
why you say please find the revised. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because if she was not aware of a 
previous one there would be no need to say it is a revised 
one. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the face of it, it appears that you 
were saying – you were writing to her on the basis that she 
20 
was – I was aware of a previous composition and now you 
are sending a revised one. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And her in email, that seems to be a 
response to that email, she does not say what are you 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 87 of 259 
 
talking saying it is revised, I have never received any 
previous composition of board committees.  Okay.  Mr 
Seleka?  Do you want to place on record what your junior 
has… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Has done then.  The left hand column 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, the way it would – I think you can 
just say that these appeared to be the differences and Mr 
Tsotsi can confirm if that is so either now or if not, he can 
take this away and do a supplementary affidavit where he 
10 
says I have now had a chance to examine this and I agree 
that this reflects the differences between the different 
compositions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I think the latter, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Tsotsi would you prefer the latter or 
would you feel ready to confirm whether Mr Seleka’s junior 
got it right in terms of the differences? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, I think we can deal with it as is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   From what …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   From what you can see. 
MR TSOTSI:   What I have before me, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka, go ahead and if 
subsequently he thinks there is a mistake he can send a 
supplementary affidavit. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 88 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if he thinks there is no mistake then 
he does not have to send a supplementary affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, thank you, Chair.  So, Mr Tsotsi, 
you will have to have 7B, Eskom bundle 7B in front of you, 
page 1213, where the emails are. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I am sorry, I note that – and this 
question is really for your junior. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Column 1 at the top – I thought – did the 
10 
composition that had – did the composition not of the 16 
December reflect who the Chairperson of the audit and risk 
committee was going to be? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, it does. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you see, this one does not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no, it does, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the one of 26 January that she has 
put up also does not and yet we know that Mr Tsotsi did 
indicate. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I do not think this is correct.  So I do 
not think it is correct.  Did you pick up what I am talking 
about, Mr Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:   The second one I picked up, I did not pick 
up the first one. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 89 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR TSOTSI:   I picked up the second point you made about 
the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, the first one was, if you look at this 
document, you have got 16 December 2014 there. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you look at that committee there, there 
is no indication of who the Chairperson was going to be.  I 
take it that that first line relates to the audit and risk 
committee.  So it does not indicate actually also on the one 
10 
under 26 January 2015, it does not indicate who was going 
to be Chairperson, nor the one of the 6 March 2015.  So I 
am saying it does not reflect the composition as you had 
indicated in the two emails, the one being the one of the 
16 December because I believe that you indicated who the 
Chairperson of the audit and risk  was supposed to be 
there. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And in the one of the – in your email of 
26 January 2015 I believe you had also indicated who the 
20 
Chairperson of the audit and risk  was supposed to be but 
this document does not reflect that.  So those are the two 
points I was making. 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And in the light of that I was saying let 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 90 of 259 
 
us not deal with it, let it get proper attention and maybe 
you might have to just do a supplementary affidavit and 
confirm. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Mr Seleka will need to get a chance 
to double-check that the document is correct. 
MR TSOTSI:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright.  So you will be given 
another one so that one can be thrown away.  You will be 
given another one once there is a correct one. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair, I think that opens the 
door for us to move on.  I have got 30 minutes, Mr Tsotsi.  
Okay… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because he might, like Mr Popo Molefe, 
start threatening us with invoices. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He also did threaten us, Chair.  His last 
appearance he did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you see… At least we have got to 
avoid any costs. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which we do not have, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   We do not have money.  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Tsotsi, then there are matters 
arising from what board members are saying about you and 
the first of those is that the averments of misdemeanours 
against the executives were in fact brought out by you – I 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 91 of 259 
 
mean, you came up with the allegations of misdemeanours 
against board members.  Mr Koko says the same and he 
specifically refers to the aide memoire which Mr Nick 
Linnell 
had 
drafted 
for 
you 
which 
incorporates 
an 
allegation against him relating to this Sumitomo matter and 
by reference to that he says only Mr Tsotsi could have told 
Nick Linnell about that Sumitomo matter. 
 
We can take it step-by-step regarding the board 
members who were saying you were the one who came up 
with allegations of misdemeanours, they relied on you to 
10 
make the decision for the suspension of the executives.  
Your comment or response to that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Thank you, Chair, I have made a submission 
in my most recent affidavit dealing with this matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can repeat what you say. 
MR TSOTSI:   As soon as I can find it.  Oh, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I can give you the page reference. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I have got it now, Chair, page 1222.  
The matter in relation to the alleged misdemeanours arose 
at the Durban meeting.  This matter was brought to the fore 
20 
by Mr Maswanganyi and it is Mr Maswanganyi who 
informed Mr Linnell that there were these allegations of 
misdemeanour and …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry, Chair.  Sorry, the page reference 
is 1230, is actually 1230, Mr Tsotsi. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 92 of 259 
 
MR TSOTSI:   I am sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, the second supplementary affidavit 
which is EXHIBIT U17.3. 
MR TSOTSI:   Oh.  Oh yes, sorry, I was looking at the 
wrong document.  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Perhaps you can summarise it. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  Basically, Chair, I am quoting from Mr 
Linnell’s affidavit to the parliamentary portfolio committee 
where he states exactly that that Mr Maswanganyi provided 
the information about the alleged wrongdoing.  So that, I 
10 
think, is the first point we made and that that is that 
information was not provided by me to Mr Linnell. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you need to deal in connection 
with that point with the allegation that in effect irrespective 
of who, where you may have got the information about 
those allegations from, at the meeting of the 11 t h you 
spoke – you raised the issue of alleged misdemeanours by 
certain people including Mr Koko and I think it has been 
said also about the other executives, I think Mr Molefe, I 
am not sure. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja somebody else, Marokane, I am not 
sure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But part of the point that was made by 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 93 of 259 
 
Mr Koko and I think and a few other board members was 
that at the meeting of the 11 t h you raised the issue of 
alleged misconduct or misdemeanours by these executives 
and – ja, what do you say about that?  Even if they had 
emanated from somebody else. 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, what happened at that meeting on 
the 11 t h was that Mr Linnell had circulated the aide 
memoire, the board members had this document in their 
hands and it is there that they dealt with the alleged 
misdemeanours in that document.   
10 
 
So the board members were wanting to know what 
are these all about, what is going on here?  That is the 
context 
under 
which 
I 
then 
talked 
about 
this 
issue 
indicating to them that there were these allegations about 
the board members. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About the executives. 
MR TSOTSI:   About the executives, sorry.  The executives 
who were to be suspended.  So that is how the discussion 
itself arose. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is the position that you are saying 
20 
yes at the meeting of the 11  March you did speak on the 
alleged misdemeanours by some of the executives or the 
executives. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you are saying you did so when 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 94 of 259 
 
members of the board wanted to know what this was all 
about based on a document that they had which had been 
prepared by Mr Linnell. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what you are saying? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is what I am saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka will tell me if my recollection 
is correct, I seem to recall that one – either Mr Koko alone 
or Mr Koko plus some or other member of the board gave 
impression that you were speaking very passionately on 
10 
these alleged misdemeanours with a view to saying these 
executives 
must 
be 
suspended 
because 
of 
these 
allegations.  Is my recollection correct? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair, that would have been Ms 
Venete Klein and Ms Viroshini Naidoo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Who emphasised the point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, what do you say about that?  In 
other words, saying you were very keen on the suspension 
of the executives, there is an issue about whether you 
20 
were also keen on the issue of the suspension of the 
Financial Director.  There are some minutes or transcripts 
that suggest that you may not have been keen on the 
suspension of the Financial Director, I think, but they say 
that – or some of the witnesses said you spoke kind of 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 95 of 259 
 
passionately about the need to suspend the executives 
because of the alleged misdemeanours. 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, I see and I have heard that 
evidence from some of the board members who were at 
that meeting.  I do not know what their interpretation of my 
being passionate about the suspension of executives is 
about but I was trying to point out the reason why there 
was a discussion in this document by Mr Linnell of 
misdemeanours and at the end of the discussion about 
twenty, twenty five minutes into the discussion, I then 
10 
summarised what I understood to have been the thrust of 
what we were discussing and in my summary I indicated 
very clearly that the discussion is not about suspending 
executives because of misdemeanours.   
 
We talked about the inquiry and the need for the 
inquiry, we talked about what the way forward ought to be 
in relation to the inquiry and that the individuals whose 
portfolios were impacted by the inquiry, having names 
them, were in fact not associated – their suspensions 
would not be associated with any wrongdoing on their part 
20 
and this is a clearly – if I can – I do not know if I can just 
read the extract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can read it. 
MR TSOTSI:   That speaks of this.  I am saying here: 
“The meeting began with board members seeking 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 96 of 259 
 
clarity about ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just tell us what you are reading from. 
MR TSOTSI:   Sorry, this is from the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it minutes or is it an affidavit? 
MR TSOTSI:   It is an affidavit, my affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your affidavit. 
MR TSOTSI:   Page 1231, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  I am making the point by saying that: 
“This meeting began with board members seeking 
10 
clarity about the authenticity of the misdemeanour 
allegation.  The discussion soon moved away from 
ascribing 
wrongdoing 
as 
part 
of 
this 
exercise 
because I pointed out that the understanding at the 
Durban meeting was that the executives were not 
being suspended for any wrongdoing.  Instead, Nick 
Linnell had organised his approach to dealing with 
the matter on the basis of how he had set out the 
aide memoire.” 
I think what needs to be understood, Chairman, is that Nick 
20 
had prepared – he is the only person who had enough time 
and background to have spent time looking at how to 
approach this whole issue of suspension.  None of us had 
that opportunity.   
 
So I think he framed the whole thinking around the 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 97 of 259 
 
issue of the inquiry and what to do with the people whose 
portfolios are impacted on a certain approach and his 
approach had to do with there needs to be some rationale 
why these people should be removed.   
 
Now the discussion at the board dispense with that 
rationale because that is not what the board had intended 
and that was not what was the understanding from the 
meeting in Cape Town, so I now read …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   In Durban.  The meeting in Durban, not 
Cape Town. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   I am sorry, in Durban, yes.  And then I go on 
to say, Chairman, as part of that meeting: 
“As the meeting progressed I decided that I should 
bring clarity as to what this whole exercise is about 
as follows.” 
And I am quoting what I said in the meeting. 
“Okay, so my understanding is quite clear.  First of 
all, this exercise is to be termed an inquiry into the 
status quo of Eskom, right?  Number one. 
Number two, this inquiry, for it to be effective, 
20 
requires us to ask specific executives to take forced 
leave or whatever you call it, to be removed from 
the situation.  This is not an investigation into 
individuals or wrongdoing by individuals, so that the 
media has to get it right.  It is the status quo of 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 98 of 259 
 
Eskom because there are definitely situations that 
one has to look into, what is actually happening in 
the organisation and what we are asking that this 
be done by non-Eskom entity, an independent 
inquiry, right?  And then we are then saying that the 
specific executives who are directly involved here 
would 
be 
Group 
Capital 
Executive, 
Group 
Commercial Executive and the Chief Executive.” 
It then goes on to say: 
“Well, we said the FD.  His situation is different, it 
10 
is not…” 
And then that is when somebody else comes in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   So, in essence, what I am saying, Chairman, 
is that the reason …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are saying you spoke to the alleged 
misdemeanours of certain executives but you were just 
speaking to clarify what Mr Linnell’s document was saying 
because board members wanted know what this was about. 
MR TSOTSI:   Precisely. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say later in the meeting you 
made it clear that the suspensions were not to be based on 
alleged misdemeanours. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you have just read the – quoted the 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 99 of 259 
 
relevant part in your affidavit.  That is what you are saying. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is what I am saying, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But then what do you say to Mr Koko’s 
allegations that to the extent that the aide memoire 
included the Sumitomo matter, that could only have come 
from you. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is not correct, Chairman.  Once again 
…[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry, sorry, Mr Tsotsi and let me add 
10 
so that you can deal with it. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And, by the way, he is referencing to 
that aspect, is to say that you have always wanted at least 
in the lead-up to the 11 March wanted him to be suspended 
for that reason. 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay.  Chairman, let me just paint the 
picture in terms of what actually happened.  At the Durban 
meeting there was no substantive discussion about the 
merits or otherwise of doing this inquiry nor was there any 
20 
discussion as to the merits or otherwise of choosing which 
areas inquiry should be looked into.   
 
The reason is quite simple and that is that nobody 
there knew enough about Eskom’s business to be able to 
engage in that discussion, so that would not have been 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 100 of 259 
 
possible, highly improbable.  
 
But more importantly for me, the fact that names 
and portfolios of people who were to suspended were 
mentioned without any reference to anything other than the 
fact that there was a technical problem with Eskom and 
that there was a financial crunch in the organisation could 
only have meant and on reflection that there was an intent 
to have certain people suspended and this, to me, was why 
I was taken aback and I was objecting to the idea that this 
should happen because it had no merit whatsoever in terms 
10 
of what one would have expected.   
 
There 
was 
no 
discussion 
at 
all 
about 
misdemeanours in that meeting.  There was no discussion 
whatsoever in relation to that.  And secondly …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is that the meeting of the 9 March? 
MR TSOTSI:   Excuse me? 
CHAIRPERSON:   8 March. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh, the meeting of the 8 March. 
MR TSOTSI:   So what I am saying, Mr Koko ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Koko? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:    Mr Koko doing yes.   Is he insinuating that 
there was some value judgment that occurred in terms of 
which areas of the business should be looked into, which 
then would give me the opportunity as he is alleging to be 
able to say no I think also this area of the business needs 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 101 of 259 
 
to be looked into because of whatever evaluation I would 
have proposed or that would have been discussed in the 
meeting, and I am saying names just came up.   Ms Myeni 
simply stated the names of the people who she said 
needed to be suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   And that was the ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But she mentioned the names, that is Ms 
Myeni, or the portfolios. 
MR TSOTSI:   She mentioned the names of the people. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   She did not mention the portfolios. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   The portfolios were then mentioned by me 
because I was the one who knew the portfolios, she simply 
mentioned the names. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay yes.   Now did the meeting in 
Durban say that the suspensions would not be based on 
allegations of misconduct or did it say they would be based 
on allegations of misconduct or did it say nothing about the 
20 
basis for the suspensions, the proposed suspensions?  
MR TSOTSI:   No the meeting in Durban was clear, Ms 
Myeni was very clear to say we are not saying that these 
people have done wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, so what was the context within 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 102 of 259 
 
which Mr Maswanganyi at the Durban meeting started 
mentioning allegations of misconduct against some of the 
executives? 
MR TSOTSI:   Mr Maswanganyi did not mention allegations 
of misconduct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I thought you said in your affidavit 
and in your evidence he was the one who, from whom Mr 
Linnell got information about alleged misdemeanours of 
certain executives? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct Chairman, but that issue was 
10 
not raised in the meeting as a substantive issue of 
discussion.   In fact – in fact I did not know that Mr 
Maswanganyi had stated the issue of misdemeanours to Mr 
Linnell until I saw Mr Linnell’s document, which incidentally 
he produced on the morning of the series of meetings that 
we had, to the extent that I really did not have time to 
really peruse that document, and lo and behold there were 
the issues of misdemeanours.  If I had my way I would 
have told him to excise those issues out of the document, 
because it had nothing to do with what we were there 
20 
about.  I would not have, if I had the opportunity I would 
prevented him from, I would have told him to take those 
out of his document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So are you saying that at the Durban 
meeting Mr Maswanganyi did not raise the allegations of 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 103 of 259 
 
misconduct against certain executives. 
MR TSOTSI:   No Chairman he did not raise any allegation 
of misconduct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So why then – or what is the context 
within which you say in your affidavit, because I think you 
say 
so, 
when 
you 
seek 
to 
say 
the 
allegations 
of 
misdemeanours by the executives did not come from you, 
they came from Mr Maswanganyi I thought that you say 
they came from Mr Maswanganyi at the Durban meeting. 
MR TSOTSI:   No Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t say that in your affidavit? 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay if I may Chair let me just clarify what I 
meant. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   What I meant was there was no discussion 
whatsoever at the Durban meeting about misdemeanours of 
the executive.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Instead what Ms Myeni said was that we can 
handle the fallout about suspensions of the executives by 
20 
simply saying that all they are doing is asking them to step 
aside, so they don’t interfere and that they have not done 
anything wrong, there is nothing wrong that they have 
done.   I don’t know exactly how I put it in my affidavit, but 
it is something to that effect. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 104 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you see in your affidavit at 
paragraph 5 at page 1230 of Eskom Bundle 7 you quote Mr 
Linnell there in your affidavit you say: 
“In his affidavit that is the matter of the alleged 
misdemeanours.” 
That is the heading in your affidavit, then you say in his 
affidavit to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Public 
Enterprises Mr Nick Linnell states in Bundle U17-AZT-149, 
paragraph 16 and then you quote him: 
“Although Ms Myeni’s son took no part in the 
10 
meeting, Jabu [Maswanganyi] provided information 
about the state of Eskom including allegations of 
wrongdoing and reasons for business failure, some 
of which was in the public domain.”  
Now there he is talking about – it seems to me what 
happened at the meeting on the 8 t h, because he says 
though Ms Myeni’s son took no part in the meeting, I think 
he 
is 
talking 
about 
the 
meeting 
of 
the 
8 t h, 
Jabu 
Maswanganyi provided information the state of Eskom 
including allegations of wrongdoing, so you quoted Mr 
20 
Linnell in your affidavit which seemed to say this is how 
the allegations of misconduct surfaced. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And the way they surfaced was Jabu giving 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 105 of 259 
 
documents to Nick Linnell, which I was not aware of.  I did 
not know that Jabu actually had documents which had 
anything to do with the reasons for business failure at 
Eskom.  I did not know that, nor did I know that he had 
documents which stated that there were allegations of 
wrongdoing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you saying that – are you saying 
that Mr Maswanganyi according to Mr Linnell are you 
saying 
that 
the 
provision 
of 
this 
information 
by 
Mr 
Maswanganyi according to Mr Linnell did not happen at the 
10 
meeting publically.  In other words are you suggesting that 
he might have given Mr Linnell this information without the 
information being discussed at the meeting. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is what I am suggesting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or maybe that after the meeting or 
between breaks he might have given the information, in 
other words are you saying as part of the meeting no such 
information was discussed.   If Mr Linnell got information 
about allegations of misdemeanours on the part of the 
Executives from Mr Maswanganyi the two must have 
20 
exchanged that information between themselves without 
involving the whole meeting.  
MR TSOTSI:   That is exactly what I am saying Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR SELEKA SC:   Yes Chair. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 106 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, ja.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Well we have taken much longer than I 
thought but I think nevertheless matters are getting 
clarified that needed to be clarified. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course the other witness I am sure 
she won’t mind if we start later than two o’clock. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She will appreciate that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Huh? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She will very much appreciate that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so we can start later with her. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe at three.  What we need to do is 
whether we continue maybe until we have finished with Mr 
Tsotsi anytime between now and two and then take the 
lunch break or whether we should take the lunch break now 
and then come back and continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And continue, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is your assessment, I know with 
20 
my intervention you cannot be sure how long you will take, 
but what’s your assessment of how much? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  About 40 minutes 
CHAIRPERSON:   About 40 minutes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  40 minutes yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 107 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, maybe let’s take the lunch break 
and then we come back. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Ja, 
Chair, 
sorry 
Chair 
I 
am 
interrupting, I wanted the Chair to read directly from Mr 
Linnell’s affidavit before we take the lunch adjournment. 
Because that will help you understand what Mr Linnell 
himself is actually saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you want to read that into the 
record? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The relevant part? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is – yes Chair.   It is Bundle 7A, 
page 154. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 154. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, 3154. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So at the top of the page, it says: 
“I attended a meeting in Durban Sunday 8 March 
2015.  When I arrived at the Presidency Mr Tsotsi 
and Dudu Myeni were there.  In attendance was 
20 
also Ms Myeni’s son.” 
16 says, which is what is  quoted in Mr Tsotsi’s affidavit: 
“While Ms Myeni’s son played no active role in the 
meeting Jabu provided information about the state 
of Eskom including allegations of wrongdoing and 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 108 of 259 
 
reasons for business failure, some of which was in 
the public domain.” 
And then he says: 
“To the best of my recollection Jabu had a number 
of documents that dealt with alleged events at 
Eskom. 
 These 
were 
largely 
from 
unidentified 
sources, and unverified content.  These were things 
that 
an 
investigation 
would 
identify 
and 
were 
background in context but in part some of the 
allegations did provide some value in scoping an 
10 
approach through the investigation.” 
I don’t know whether that elucidates the point we – Mr 
Tsotsi is trying to make here.   On page 153 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am trying to understand whether there 
is any particular point that Mr Linnell makes about this 
other than that he got the information or document from Mr 
Maswanganyi. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Whether it clarifies whether he got it at 
the meeting in Durban or subsequently. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think it is at the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think the information is exchanged at 
the meeting.  Yes, while Ms Myeni’s son played no active 
role in the meeting Jabu provided information about ... 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 109 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   In any event whether they were 
discussed or not discussed at the meeting the allegations 
what Mr Tsotsi says is that ultimately the meeting in 
Durban was clear that the suspensions were not really to 
be based on any allegations of misconduct, or did I 
misunderstand that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes Chairman that is correct, that is quite 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright.    
 
Okay let us take the lunch adjournment and then we 
10 
will continue at two. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Yes.  Now Mr Tsotsi, 
I was putting the version of the other witnesses to you 
regarding allegation of misdemeanours.  One of the 
20 
versions is that of Ms Viroshini Naidoo in which she says 
that you had asked – allegedly you had asked Mr Linnell to 
meet with the union in order to obtain information of 
wrongdoing from the unions against the executives.  Your 
comment on that? 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 110 of 259 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Thank you Chair.  I think in the discourse 
that that took place in the beginning of the meeting where 
we were talking about the alleged misdemeanours.  One of 
the issues that arose there was what actually took place at 
Eskom in regards to Mr Matshela Koko in particular.   
 
And what I had stated there was that not only did 
I 
ask 
Mr 
Matshela 
Koko 
himself 
directly 
about 
the 
allegation I also asked the chief executive regarding this 
allegation.   
 
And Mr Matshela Koko did not deny that he had 
10 
anything to do with that and Mr Montana, the Chief 
Executive, did not have an explanation or a report to the 
effect of that transpired and he must come in because 
there was then an allegation ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   This is when?  Was the – the step the 
time right?  Are we talking about what happened around 
the 8 t h – around the 11 t h of March, after that or much 
earlier? 
MR TSOTSI:   The incidents that I am recounting now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   No, Chairman this happened the previous 
year.  Sometime in ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   2014? 
MR TSOTSI:   2014, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Seleka, is your understanding 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 111 of 259 
 
that the board member who said that, was talking about 
things that happened before March 2015 or is it not clear? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, my understanding is that Ms Viroshini 
Naidoo is talking about the time when Mr Nick Linnell was 
engaged in March 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   Unless, if you are an answering a broader 
issue which is not directly related to the unions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I think what Mr Seleka says is that 
Ms Naidoo said something to the effect that you made 
10 
arrangements or you had a role to play in terms of which 
Mr Linnell was going to obtain information from trade 
unions 
about 
allegations 
of 
misdemeanours 
by 
the 
executives. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know anything along those lines? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, Chairman I did not play any part in 
Linnell – Mr Linnell getting any information from the union.  
No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you know whether he ever obtained 
20 
such information from unions or is that something you do 
not know? 
MR TSOTSI:   I do not know Mr Chairman.  I could not say.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   I really do not know. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 112 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is – could she be mistaken and 
confusing some other event with this which might be 
similar?  Could she be talking about a different time?  But 
if she was talking about another – the previous year, 
Mr Linnell was not there.  He was not involved in Eskom 
before 2015, is it not? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  I think she – well, she is certainly 
talking about the incidents of that period when Linnell was 
not there.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   For some reason, it would appear as if she 
got the impression that I informed Linnell that he can talk 
to the unions if he wants to know about misdemeanours 
that occurred at Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   And I am saying that is not the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say you did not do that? 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  To the allegations that Mr Koko 
20 
has made or the version that he has made about you 
seeking to get rid of him.  You have set out a response in 
your affidavit to the element of you intending to get him 
suspended.  Now would you quickly relate that to the 
Chairperson, your version as a response to this allegation 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 113 of 259 
 
of Mr Koko against you? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have already said part of it when 
you talked about where the allegations of misdemeanours 
came from. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think Mr Seleka wants you to deal 
with – give evidence with regard to the other parts which I 
knew after which you have not dealt with.  Why you say 
Mr Koko’s 
evidence 
that 
you 
wanted 
him 
suspended 
because of disagreements between you and him regarding 
10 
the suspension of Mr Sekasindi.  Why you say that has not 
validity. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  Well, let me first of all deal with the 
issue of the allegation that I suspended him because of 
Mr Sekasindi.  Chairman, there is an affidavit which was – 
which has been deposed by Mr Montana.   
 
If you recall, Mr Matshela had made some 
allegations – Mr Koko made an allegation that Mr Montana 
had – it is said to him that if – that I spoke to Mr Montana 
and told Mr Montana that if Mr Koko does not unsuspend 
20 
Mr Sekasindi, I would in turn suspend both him and 
Mr Koko. 
 
Mr 
Montana 
has 
then 
responded 
and 
categorically denied that I ever said anything like that to 
him.  And incidentally, where Mr Matshela Koko deals with 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 114 of 259 
 
Mr Montana having shown him evidence of ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   SMS’s ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   SMS’s ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or Whatsapp messages.  I am not sure. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   SMS’s, ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   Where I am, supposedly, complaining to him 
about and talking about suspending Mr Matshela.  He 
denies that as well.  So that I think is essentially the first 
clarity that I would like to put on this issue. 
10 
 
There is also – Chairman, this whole idea that 
Mr Koko has that he and I have an – or had an antagonistic 
relationship.  And I just decided here, Chairman, to just to 
reflect a bit on my experience visa vie him at Eskom and 
try to understand where this – either manifested itself or 
where it emanates from or whether, in fact, there has been 
any clear indication that this been happening. 
 
To that extent, I have recalled Chairman that I 
had a lot to do with Mr Matshela’s promotion, Mr Koko’s 
promotion.  Mr Koko was – the first time I had anything to 
20 
do with that was during Mr Brian Damas’ time.   
 
And Mr Damas wanted someone to act in the 
position 
of 
Group 
Executive 
for 
Technology 
and 
Engineering as it was called at the time, which is now 
Commercial Technology... 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 115 of 259 
 
 
And Mr Koko was the candidate who was most 
likely and who was closest to that position because he was 
already a Division Executive in Technology.   
 
And when I mentioned Mr Koko to him, he 
categorically stated to me that he does not believe that 
Mr Koko is ready to pursue that responsibility.  So he is not 
going to support that. 
 
So it did not happen during Mr Damas’ time.  It 
then 
happened 
soon 
after 
Mr 
Damas 
had 
left 
and 
Mr Matshela was then acting.  And the motivation went to 
10 
the People in Governance Committee of which I was sitting 
and 
I 
remember 
very 
clearly 
having 
supported 
that 
promotion. Mr Matshela Koko came to me and he thanked 
me for it.   
 
And then fast forward now, several months later.  
This is now when Mr Montana just became Chief Executive 
at the beginning of October and in November, Mr Matshela 
came to me – Mr Koko came to me and said to me will I 
support his promotion into that position as a substantive 
Group Executive and I said yes. 
20 
 
And Mr Montana, obviously...  Mr Matshela Koko 
came to me unofficially, obviously, but Mr Montana as 
Chief Executive came to me formally to say he is going to 
make this proposal and would I support the proposal on – 
in the committee.  I said to him, yes, I would support it.  
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 116 of 259 
 
And indeed that is what happened.  And once again, 
Mr Koko came and thanked me for it. 
 
This incident and it happened quite some few 
months after the so-called, of this incident of Sumitomo 
together with Mr Sekasindi.   
 
So when I put these – the totality of these things 
together Chairman, I said to myself I think Mr Matshela is 
being very indigenous by eluding to some, you know, 
conflict or something between us. 
 
I think it is designed to achieve whatever his 
10 
intentions are.  I think he wants to polarise the situation so 
that it becomes clear that I am pursuing him in a basis of 
personal vendetta which is not the case.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You are done Mr Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Anything further you wish to say on 
averments of misdemeanours before I move on, either 
20 
made by other board members? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, I maybe – I might recall something as 
we go along. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 117 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, that is alright.  Now let us deal 
with – look briefly at the reasons why because the reasons 
why the board members then decide to have you removed 
from your position as a chairperson of the board because 
this is linked to the turn of events on the 11 t h of March, the 
suspension of the executives. 
 
And 
eight 
days 
later, 
which 
is 
on 
the 
19 t h of March, you have a meeting.  In this meeting, the 
board members are opening 
out to you 
about their 
displeasure with what they say is your conduct, in the 
10 
conduct, on the basis of which they decided to take the 
decision to suspend the executives. 
 
And you are being, for a lack of a better word, 
accused or singled out – let me use that word – you were 
singled out as the person who caused the board to make 
this decision, one of which is, that there was a report from 
the Presidency which you did not produce, the engagement 
of Mr Linnell and the terms of reference. 
 
And you may want to take the Chairperson step 
by 
step 
in 
dealing 
with 
those 
aspects, 
particularly 
20 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I think it might be better if you put them 
step by step to him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If I put it step by step? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.

ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think, let us start with this one.  One of 
the things that the board members who have given 
evidence here have said as to why they say they have lost 
confidence in you, is that they said that you said, either on 
the 11 t h of March or on the 9 t h of March or both, on the 9 t h 
and the 11 t h of March, in those meetings, that the – that, 
one, Mr Linnell had been appointed by the Presidency to 
assist the – assist Eskom, I think. 
 
And that he had been involved – he had done 
10 
quite a lot of work already and that there was a report that, 
as I understand it, must – that you must have been 
implying was in the Presidency which was relevant to the 
inquiry that was being discussed or that was being 
proposed. 
 
As I understand the evidence of these board 
members, you referred to the existence of such a report as 
indicating that that report shows that there was a need for 
this kind of inquiry.  That is my understanding of what they 
are saying. 
20 
 
But they say you were being untruthful because 
later on you did – either you could not produce the report 
or you did admit that there was no such report or 
something to that effect. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, yes.  That is correct that he 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 119 of 259 
 
admitted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is what they said.  Did you ever 
say Mr Linnell had been doing a lot of work or had been 
appointed by the Presidency to assist Eskom in regard to 
the inquiry?  So we take that then step by step. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  Yes, Chairman in respect of the first 
question you asked.  Yes, I did tell the board that 
Mr Linnell had been asked by the President to assist us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   On this inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Mr Linnell himself made exact – that exact 
statement 
in 
a 
meeting 
where 
board 
members 
were 
present. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   I will just have to find it somewhere.  I did 
actually quote that statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In your affidavits? 
MR TSOTSI:   Somewhere in my affidavit, I believe, where 
20 
he states categorically, where I say he is in fact – he has 
in 
fact 
been 
doing 
substantial 
amount 
of 
work 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   ...in preparation for this. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 120 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   So board members knew that Mr Linnell had 
been tasked to assist and he been the one who had done 
all the work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   In fact, I can quote you what I said in that 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page and ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   This would be page 1237 in my affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1237? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   1237, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I have got that page. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  I put it to the board that – this is now 
26.2.  I say to the board: 
“Nick can put...  Can I put this straight?  Nick 
was asked to do this exercise and he had to do 
a lot of background work because of the 
instruction he got to do the exercise. 
Now 
what 
is 
left 
before 
him 
to 
be 
commissioned formally by Eskom to get into 
20 
the chief of what needs to be done.   
So he has been onboard on this for quite a 
while.  I think he is having difficulty trying to 
say that...” 
 
So what ...[intervenes]  
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 121 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   So Chairman from the standpoint of board 
members understanding where Nick came from and that he 
had been engaged in this matter for some time, in terms of 
background work, was very clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was the basis for saying he had 
been appointed by the Presidency?  What did you base 
that on? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, I based it on a very clear 
indication by the President when the President said this 
10 
gentleman will assist the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Is that at the meeting of the 8 t h? 
MR TSOTSI:   At the meeting of the 8 t h.  The President 
very, 
very 
clearly 
said 
this 
gentleman 
will 
assist 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The board. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   And that he would then help the board in 
getting this inquiry going. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that something you did say before that 
the President said that this gentleman would – will assist 
the board? 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 122 of 259 
 
MR TSOTSI:   I am not sure Chairman.  I – before the 
statements I have made, I would have to check.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   I do not quite recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Any recollection? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I do not recall him - this in those word, 
but I know from Mr Nick himself – I hope I am not mudding 
the waters.  Mr Nick himself had said when he went to 
10 
Pretoria, the first meeting ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Dudu...  Ms Myeni. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was talking about Ms Myeni that the 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You are the right person. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...President.  He was supposed to meet 
the President. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he may have said, Ms Dudu Myeni 
20 
said the President wanted him to conduct the inquiry or 
something like that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Myeni said she had recommended 
him to the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 123 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   As the right person to do... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Uhm... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I am not sure whether Mr Tsotsi 
had put it in the way he is doing it now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I know that I have picked it up 
10 
from the transcript. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That he has told the board that 
Mr Linnell is been given to us by the Presidency. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  So, but as far as you recall, 
you did say something to that effect that he was appointed 
by the Presidency or he was given to Eskom by the 
Presidency. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And you say, you – you said that 
because of the fact that President Zuma had said this 
gentleman would assist the board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 124 of 259 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  And then the question of – you say 
there he has been onboard on this for quite a while.  Was 
that correct? 
MR TSOTSI:   This is what Nick told the board himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Separately. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   There is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But if I understand it, his evidence is 
10 
that 
he 
was 
called 
to 
Mahlamba 
Ndlopfu 
on 
the 
6 t h  of March. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Effectively, he was asked to talk 
everything and left Cape Town and flew to Pretoria.  He 
was called by Ms Dudu Myeni and they had a discussion 
about 
Eskom 
and 
Ms 
Dudu 
Myeni 
said 
she 
had 
recommended him to the President.   
 
So on the evidence that is known to us, he would 
not have started to do anything prior to the 6 t h of March.  It 
20 
does not appear to me that that qualifies he has been 
doing some work for a while.   
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, if we look at the transcript where 
Ms Naidoo is asking him the question in regards to whether 
he is doing this because he is looking to earn some money 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 125 of 259 
 
or something to that effect.  He then elaborates and 
answers that question about this very same issue, where 
he says he spent some time on working on this issue of the 
inquiry.  Now I never – nobody asked him, on the board, 
you know about timeframes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   How long has this been. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   So my statement is really based on what 
Nick had said in the very same meeting that I made this – I 
10 
addressed this issue.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   I cannot recall exactly what page – where 
exactly in the transcript we can find this but there is 
definitely a point that Nick himself makes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, what comes across, at least the 
impression I get from the evidence of the board members 
who spoke on this – testified on this.   
 
The impression I get is that you referred to the 
existence of a report and...  Is that the reason why you 
20 
referred to the existence of a report that they say did not 
exist and that you said Mr Linnell had been appointed by 
the Presidency and that you said he had been doing some 
work relevant to the inquiry for quite some time all because 
you were seeking to persuade them to agree to the 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 126 of 259 
 
establishment of an inquiry, I think, and the suspension of 
the executives. 
 
But 
it 
maybe 
that 
I 
am 
wrong 
about 
the 
suspension of the executive but certainly in terms of the 
inquiry that you were referring.  All of these things to say 
to them, this thing is kind of – or this thing of an inquiry, if 
you make a decision to go ahead, it is something 
worthwhile but that is the impression I get that you were 
pushing, that is what they are saying.   
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, you will recall that I have said in 
10 
my testimony earlier – I cannot remember exactly which 
time – that I had said that I myself have had such 
impression even during the previous ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Previous, ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   But I thought there is a need for an inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   So without a doubt, I was convinced and 
hopefully I convinced them that there is a need to do an 
inquiry into Eskom’s affairs and it is urgent because of the 
situation that Eskom is facing at the time. 
20 
 
So if they understood me to say I am doing my 
best to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   [Indistinct]  
MR TSOTSI:   ...upon them that there is need for an inquiry 
and it should be done, they are correct. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 127 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have no quarrel with that? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, absolutely not.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, that is important.  Let us go back 
to where I said I may be wrong namely that they seemed to 
be saying – there seemed to be saying you were pushing 
for the establishment of an inquiry and the suspension of 
the executives.  I said I may be wrong that they were 
saying that in relation to the suspension of the executives 
10 
as well. 
 
But you are in a position to say whether at that 
stage you were pushing for both or not, the suspension and 
the establishment of the inquiry or the only thing you were 
really pushing for was the inquiry but the issue of the 
suspension you were not so really pushing but you would 
go along if that was the decision. 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, what I said to the board members 
and that is that the inquiry requires that those people who 
are heading the areas that had to be looked into, should 
20 
not be in their positions when this inquiry takes place so 
that you – in fact, I never talked about suspensions, 
interestingly enough. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   I talked about step aside. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 128 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, no.  I am just saying 
suspension.  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Simply because, at some stage in the 
past, either with you or other members, we came to an 
agreement that let us stop saying suspension or step aside 
or special leave because we know what we are talking 
about whether you call step aside or special leave or 
suspension.  The fact is you are not going to get work. 
MR TSOTSI:  Right. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so you might have used the term 
step aside but basically we are talking about the same 
thing. 
MR TSOTSI:   So, Chairman, the consistency of it is quite 
clear from my mind.  Support the inquiry, supporting the 
stepping aside of the executives and that stepping aside is 
not as a result of them having done something. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Something wrong, ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, that was my position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   And hence, as I said to you earlier, I 
summarised the position as such. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, no finish? 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay, I thought now I can deal with the 
issue of this report that …[intervenes] 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 129 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, that is what I want you to deal 
with, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Before he does that, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I think the passage that he might have 
wanted, Mr Tsotsi, it is in your bundle – let us see whether 
that is what you wanted, it is the transcript on page 726, 
that is Eskom bundle 7(A).  726.  That is the bigger file, Mr 
Tsotsi 
MR TSOTSI:   Oh, this one here? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. So it is an engagement between Mr 
Linnell and board members and Ms Naidoo, that appears to 
Ms Naidoo, he is asking a question, 726.    Ja, it says: 
“Ja, Nick, I think that what you shared with us is 
very enlightening and I know that you have in your 
introduction shared with us that you have done 
quite a bit of work for other state owned companies.  
I must admit I was expecting that you would have 
been physically involved with some of the detail 
with.  Where we find ourselves right now and not 
20 
hypothetically, this is what you need to do.  Now 
maybe I understand that brief incorrectly and then I 
will take responsibility for it but I thought that that 
is what you were going to bring to the table.” 
Then Nick – well, Mr Linnell then answers; 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 130 of 259 
 
“If I could answer that.  It is a good point to answer 
it.  The thing is, there is different scores here.  I 
would say understanding of Eskom and the pre-
research that I have had to do to be sitting here in 
front of you has been extensive and it has taken 
some months so I think I have an understanding but 
I think what I see a minute ago is the failing.” 
The failing.  So could that have been the passage you 
wanted because there he says he has done – the pre-
research he has done is extensive and it has taken some 
10 
months but we know from his affidavit that, as the 
Chairperson has pointed out, he was called on the 6 t h to 
come 
on 
that 
day 
to 
the 
official 
residence 
of 
the 
Presidency in Pretoria.  Is that the passage you had in 
mind? 
MR TSOTSI:   Not quite, there is another passage which is 
fairly similar. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh, where he says he has done it. 
MR TSOTSI:   It is in that same bundle.  The one that I 
have in mind. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but I just wanted – because Mr 
Seleka’s junior could look for it while he is asking you 
other questions.  Is it one where Mr Linnell talks about 
having done a lot of work?  Is it a passage – what does the 
passage say, what is the point it advances? 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 131 of 259 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, he is advancing the point that he has 
spent quite some time doing work. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  So maybe your junior can 
check in the meantime. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, so let us go to the report.  
Did you say to them there was a report in the Presidency 
that related to the inquiry that needed to be establish or 
that sought to justify the need for an inquiry or something 
to that effect? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, the answer to your question is 
correct, yes, I did.  You will recall – I might have 
mentioned 
this 
I 
think 
during 
one 
of 
my 
previous 
appearances, there were three people who had documents 
– well, let me say two people who had documents in 
relation to the meeting that we had gone to attend, it was 
Ms Myeni and it was Nick himself and I am under the 
impression that from this that Jabu also had documents 
based on what we talked about earlier this morning.    
Now it would seem to me that some of these 
20 
documents had already contained some sort of background 
work that had been done at the Presidency.  And this is 
what I understood in the course of the conversation there 
that some work had been done and I was not shown these 
documents, I did not ask for them and when I mentioned 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 132 of 259 
 
them in the meeting – in fact I think at one point I even 
mentioned 
that 
I 
could 
get 
someone 
who 
has 
this 
information to bring it along and show it to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say to bring the report? 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja, to produce the report, in other words.  
So I did not have it in my hand.  So yes, the question is 
that – the answer to the question is that yes, I did speak of 
the report, I did not have the report in my hand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But had you seen the report? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, I have not seen the report. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Had somebody said to you there was a 
report that was available. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, this is was discussed in the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And who was that who said that? 
MR TSOTSI:   This was mentioned by both Nick and Dudu.  
Now I do not know exactly who of them had this particular 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did they talk about a report or did they 
talk about some documents that they might have? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, I cannot recall precisely whether 
20 
the term report was used or the term document was used.  
I would suspect the term document was more likely to be 
used.  I think the term report probably came in the 
discussion of board members. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So one, you had not seen any report.  
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 133 of 259 
 
Two, you think either Mr Linnell or Ms Dudu Myeni or both 
mentioned at the meeting of the 8 March in Durban that 
there were documents. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Relating to work that had been done 
which is connected with Eskom, it was connected with 
Eskom. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But if they had there were documents 
why would you have talked about a report? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   As I say, Chairman, the word report probably 
came through in a discussion at the board level and it 
might have been one of the board members who raised the 
word report, it probably was not me, as such.  So the word 
report would have then just came to the conversation in 
that manner but the idea was that the reference is to some 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Because, you know, it is one thing 
to say there are some documents which may be shared if 
the board members want relating to work that has been 
20 
done but to say there is a report is quite something 
different.  It seems to me something you would say if either 
you had seen the report or somebody had said to you there 
was a report but not if somebody talked about loose 
documents.  What do you say to that? 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 134 of 259 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, let us say I cannot really recall, I 
mean, precisely whether there was a statement, the fact of 
there having been a report or documents.  But, as I say, I 
am inclined to think that they will probably refer to 
documents and I think the word report I think came up in 
the discussion among board members as, if you like, 
reference to a document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because my impression of what some of 
the board members will testify to as saying was that they 
were suggesting that you were pushing so much for the 
10 
establishment of the inquiry that you may have told them 
some untruths saying there was a report in the presidency 
when there was no report, saying Mr Linnell had been 
appointed by the presidency, that is the impression I get 
from what they said.  The impression might be wrong but, I 
do not know, Mr Seleka?   
ADV SELEKA SC:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In terms of the impression that you got 
from them in their evidence? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is consistent with yours, Chairperson, 
20 
but I think that I know that, Mr Tsotsi, you mentioned a 
report. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, he admits as well.  I think you do 
admit that you talked about a report, ja. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 135 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  And it may well be – I am making 
an observation and you can – it may well be that it was an 
effort on your part to give the gravitas to what you were 
bringing before the board. 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, certainly not on the basis of some 
untruths, no.  Certainly not.  Certainly not, I think if the 
other person who would have some knowledge of this 
clearly would be Nick. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would be? 
MR TSOTSI:   Nick Linnell. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, as to the existence of the documents 
that I am talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you see, it is one thing if you say 
there are some documents which reflect some work that 
has been done but when you say a report it is weightier, I 
would think, than if you just talk about some reports.  
Would you not agree?  A report seems to be – to say this is 
really something serious, that is, quite a lot of work that 
has been done, so much work that a report has been 
20 
prepared. 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, you can extract a report from 
documents that have been prepared. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, but still… 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 136 of 259 
 
MR TSOTSI:   You know, so it could very well be that the 
documents existed and a particular focus was done on 
something. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   Which was being reported upon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what you do concede is that as far 
as you know, there was no report, you are not able to say 
there was a report, all you can say is there may have been 
some documents, is that correct? 
MR TSOTSI:    What I am saying, Chairman, is that I was 
10 
informed that there were documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Relating to work that had been done at the 
presidency. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  Now in terms of whether these 
documents represent a report or not, quite honestly I 
cannot say yes or no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you do not know. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  On reflection, would you not say 
that given what you knew then and what you know now it 
seems to be the same, namely you had been told there 
were some documents, nobody had used the word report to 
you, as I understand it, but of course it could be among 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 137 of 259 
 
those documents there was a report, not so?  But based on 
that, would you not say you probably should have talked 
about documents because that is what you had been told 
about? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, if it was going to make things any 
clearer, I am more concerned, personally, to be honest, 
about the issue of misrepresentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR TSOTSI:   The matter of misrepresentation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Of the facts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The position, ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   I think for me that to them is really what 
they focused, that I misrepresented.  Hence the charges 
that they brought against me were on the basis of my 
having misrepresented myself to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   So the issue of the report or not a report, I 
do not want to quibble about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   I am not in a position to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   But I just want to make sure that, you know, 
there is no impression of misrepresentation of what 
transpired and what I reported. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 138 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you see, as I understand it, the 
point – part of the point – and I do not know, I do not 
remember that in the charges they included the issue of 
the report. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is not included. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is not included in the charges.    
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But one or more of the board members 
who testified said part of the reason why they lost 
confidence in you is because you had told them on the 11 
10 
March that there was a report.  Came out later on that 
there was no report and I do not know whether he or she 
said you admitted that there was no report at a later – 
when the charges were put on the day where you were 
supposed to answer to the charges but he or she was 
saying part of the reason why they lost confidence in you 
is because you told them something that was not true in 
order to get them to make a certain decision namely that 
there was a certain report in the presidency and they said 
it looks like there was no such report. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, I think we should make this thing 
very clear.  What the board members complained about 
was the fact that I – they say I failed to produce the report 
that they say I mentioned earlier in the board meeting 
previously which is not the same thing as saying that I said 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 139 of 259 
 
there was a report and there was no report in the sense of 
there was never a report or a document in the first place, 
so …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, okay, maybe that is what they – 
maybe that is the point they make, okay?  So if that is the 
point they make, what do you say? 
MR TSOTSI:   I am saying it is correct I did not produce 
the report that they wanted because I did not have it with 
me.  What I said earlier is that I could make someone 
available who would have the report or the document if 
10 
board members wanted to – in fact, this is a statement that 
I think – question or a statement which was made by either 
Norman or I cannot remember but at some point I did 
indicate to them that I could make available or I could I 
bring some – get someone to bring the report or to show 
the board the report.  At some point I also indicated during 
this meeting now on the 19 t h that I did not – I do not 
remember exactly how I put it but the idea was that I did 
not consider myself privy to the report that was spoken 
about.  I think that is a statement that I think I made on the 
20 
meeting the 19 t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you did not what, consider...? 
MR TSOTSI:   I did not consider myself entitled to or privy 
to the report. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 140 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, we have an extract from 
the transcript of the meeting of the 19 March . 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And Mr Tsotsi has it there.  We have 
made copies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because it is not incorporated in the 
bundle yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but you can read the relevant part. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Mr Tsotsi, I think you are referring 
10 
to page 35 of that.  I can hand up a copy for the purposes 
of this session. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if you are going to read it, that is 
fine.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is it fine, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I will manage. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So the report was being asked about 
here on page 35 of the transcript of the meeting of the 19 
March and Ms Naidoo says: 
“You advised us that these people did wrongdoings 
20 
and on the basis of that we need to hold this inquiry 
and that they would interfere in the investigation 
and on that basis I believe you but now you say you 
never saw that report, so did anybody around this 
table see the report?” 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 141 of 259 
 
Then Mr Tsotsi responds. 
“No, no, no, no, no, when I was at the presidency I 
was told quite clearly that there is a problem at 
Eskom and a problem that is known to the President 
and I was not going to ask him what is the problem.  
He said to me I want to assign this man to go and 
help you with this investigation.  Now I do not 
believe that I was at liberty to ask him what was the 
problem.  Quite honestly, I could not do that.  I had 
to accept what he was telling and as I say to you, 
10 
the problem really comes from the fact that I did not 
introduce this guy properly.” 
Is 
that 
the 
part 
you 
want 
to 
communicate 
to 
the 
Chairperson? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair, may I read from the transcript of 
the 9 March?  That one is in the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is a couple of important aspects, 
one of which is this, Mr Tsotsi, page 256, Eskom bundle 
20 
12, you say: 
“I have been summoned by the President three 
times and the most recently was yesterday where 
he has finally made up his mind about what he 
wants to do about the situation with Eskom.  Both 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 142 of 259 
 
Minister 
and 
I 
have 
been 
summoned 
by 
the 
President separately.” 
You said that and then later in the meeting you say: 
“In actual fact what has happened is that the 
Presidency 
has 
already 
given 
us 
a 
particular 
individual who they want to lead this particular 
inquiry and that individual will then engage and 
liaise with us and work with us and as the resources 
are required for these specific issues that maybe 
have to be looked into an then that individual will 
10 
have to deem to source those specific resources.” 
And then you say: 
“So, in a nutshell, I think, to be quite frank about it, 
the Presidency has gone out of its way to do all of 
the governance investigation as to what is possible 
under the circumstances.  I was given a complete 
document which was prepared by the legal people 
at the Presidency which suggests – which actually 
says that what the role of the shareholder and the 
board would be in this kind of thing.  So they have 
20 
covered all the basics in terms of the requirements 
of 
all 
of 
the 
documentation 
that 
governs 
the 
company’s work.” 
So it is not the quite the report you are talking about but is 
the documentation to govern the company’s work and then 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 143 of 259 
 
you go on to the MOI and so on.  So what we see here is, 
you did tell the board Mr Nick Linnell has been assigned to 
assist. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then you are given a complete 
document by the Presidency which deals with the role of 
the shareholder and the board.  So what I was looking for 
was the mention of a report, of an investigation at the 
presidency.  It is alluded to there, I think if we look for the 
passage where you specifically deal in it. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So, Chair, I think that answers him 
having said to the board Mr Nick Linnell was assigned 
where he says …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, he admitted that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the report, I think we are no wiser 
than we were before. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because the passage that Mr Seleka has 
read suggests that you told the board that the Presidency 
had done some investigation and they gave you a complete 
document about the shareholder and the board or Eskom 
but we do not know whether you were referring to that 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 144 of 259 
 
document but based on your earlier evidence it is unlikely 
that you were referring to it because you said your notion 
of a report is connected with documents that you were told 
about at the Durban meeting, if I am not mistaken, is that 
correct? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, Mr Seleka, I think you may 
proceed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, thank you, Chair.  I must say that, 
Mr Tsotsi, I have said to the board members who have told 
10 
the Chairperson, the Commission, about the report, that 
they have nonetheless when Mr Baloyi asked repeatedly 
about that report associated themselves with the – and that 
is exactly what the board ultimately did with the comment 
or the position, the view articulated by Dr Ngubane that 
there might a report out there but that is not our report, we 
must make our own decision. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I recall. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you remember that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And so I have asked them if they 
ultimately made the decision in this regard complete 
disregard of what may have been presented to them as a 
report – I mean, articulated to them as a report, why did 
they turn around and want to blame you again for a report 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 145 of 259 
 
they said they do not need in order to make the decision.  
You follow that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now why did you not tell them that on 
the 19 March? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, that meeting of the 19 March was 
incredibly stressful.  When I reflect on that meeting now I 
have to say that I was under a lot of stress because by that 
time I was aware that the board was pursuing me so I was 
not really at my best in terms of being able to deal with – 
10 
myself in that – the whole meeting was accusatory.  That 
was – it was clear it was the purpose of the meeting.  And 
so I – there were a lot of things which I could have recalled 
that had happened earlier that I actually not – because my 
whole frame of mind was not correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see, why these issues are important 
is in part because they may be relevant to the question of 
what the reasons were for the board to push you out to the 
extent that that is the impression that is [indistinct], did 
they push you out without – because maybe somebody 
20 
outside of Eskom as part of some agenda wanted you out 
because you were not cooperating with the Guptas or is 
the position that indeed there were some grounds for your 
colleagues on the board to feel – for them to lose 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 146 of 259 
 
confidence in you and therefore to seek your removal.  So 
that is where these issues have become important. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As I say, one or more board members 
say part of the reason why we lost confidence is that he 
told us there was a report when there was no report or 
when he was asked to produce the report he could not 
produce the report so therefore suggesting that the reason 
why he could not produce is because it did not exist, he 
had told us something that was not true, that is the 
10 
impression I get from the evidence of some of the board 
members who have testified, therefore we were entitled to 
lose confidence in him or whether you, because you may 
not have been cooperating with the Guptas, some members 
of the board or the board was influenced from outside of 
Eskom to get rid of you.  You see, that is where the 
relevance is. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I think you have said what I think 
you wanted to say on it.  Ja.  Okay, Mr Seleka. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, the other point, Mr Tsotsi, I think 
we could take it also as covered to a large extent is the 
engagement of Mr [name cut-off] because that was one of 
the issues the board members raised with you.   
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 147 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You got this man, engaged him.  You 
did not follow procurement procedures and you engaged 
him without informing the board.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that was covered. 
MR TSOTSI:  That was, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With him and with the board members. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was covered. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  We actually did inform the board members 
then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And then the last thing on this was the 
terms of reference.  And the media statement had got 
leaked.  They also took you to council on that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  We did deal with that as well.  I don’t 
know about the terms of reference.  But … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Didn’t it deal with the leaking of the, the 
alleged leaking of – he dealt with that, you dealt with that 
last time Mister … 
MR TSOTSI:  We spoke about charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You dealt with all the charges as well as 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 148 of 259 
 
I recall or am I mistaken? 
MR TSOTSI:  Dealt with the charges, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they included the allegation that you 
had leaked the media statement to, to the media that had 
not been approved by the board.   
MR TSOTSI:  Mr Chairman that is what the allegation was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  What I’m saying is you have dealt 
with it in your evidence, we have asked you about it.  Isn’t 
it? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes, you have asked me about it.  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So we don’t need to repeat that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So we moving on.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:  There is, there is an aspect Chairman which I 
guess you, you – it will be covered under the terms of 
reference.  Is that where you want to, wanted to go now 
because … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because I’ve seen that the two are 
interlinked. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Having visited the meeting of the 19 t h 
of March 2015, the communication within the board, that 
they have linked the two.  I know that I haven’t linked them 
with you before.  And maybe you can touch on that briefly 
for the Chairperson’s … 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 149 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was the allegation about the terms 
of reference?  That he put himself in the committee that 
was going to do the investigation?   
ADV SELEKA SC:  No. 
MR TSOTSI:  No Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
What 
was 
the 
allegation 
about 
…[indistinct]? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The charge was that he commissioned 
the drafting of the terms of reference.  And … 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That were not consistent with what the 
board had in mind.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that part of the charge or that’s just 
an allegation? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It was part of the charge and the 
debate on the 19 t h of March.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  And he didn’t deal with it.  He 
didn’t deal with it before? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We didn’t go into the details Mr Tsotsi.  
We did with Ms Klein. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, let’s deal with it.   
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And let me just tell the Chairperson 
how the two – because the media’s statement that gets to 
be leaked Chair reports on the terms of reference.   
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 150 of 259 
 
So it says these are the terms of reference and 
inquiry and so on and the complaint is that, that what this 
media statement is communicating to the public as the 
terms of reference for the inquiry, is incorrect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It’s inconstant with the board’s own 
terms of inquiry.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thanks. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that’s how the two connect.  And Mr 
Tsotsi then – you can deal with it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, what do you say about that? 
MR TSOTSI:  Ja. Chairman during that meeting of the 19 t h 
when the issue of these terms of reference was being 
discussed there, there was an allegation that I instructed 
Nick you know to prepare a terms of reference, which were 
a variance with were the terms of reference that the Arc 
had prepared.   
And at one point there was a question which says, 
did I or did Nick have access to the terms of reference that 
Arc had prepared?  And quite clearly he saw them and he 
20 
infused his own view on them.   
Which is what, which is the document which they 
alleged was the one that was leaked.  So in other words, 
the view of the Arc Committee vis-a-vis the view of Nick 
and I were now were …[indistinct] divergence.   
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 151 of 259 
 
Now what transpired in the meeting was that one of 
the board members, I can’t remember exactly who it was, 
had made an indication, a statement to the fact that the 
source of the problem is that the terms of reference which 
Nick had prepared are in fact quite at variance with the 
terms of reference that the Minister spoke of at the 
meeting on the Wednesday.   
That would have been the, the 11 t h of March. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The 11 t h. 
MR TSOTSI:  Now that’s a curious statement because I 
10 
don’t recall the Minister dealing with terms of reference in 
her meeting.  And it seems as though there was some 
information or some knowledge that some of the board 
members had in respect of what should go into the terms of 
reference.   
Which I certainly did not have.  Nor did Nick have.  
So you recall also Chairman at that time there were 
allegations of that meeting on the 16 t h, that supposed that 
the Minister had with some of the board members.   
And it was immediately after that meeting when 
20 
Nick Linnell was informed to cease to get engaged on this, 
on this issue.  So I am, I don’t know whether it is possible 
to connect somehow the whole rational about the objection 
to Nick’s terms of reference as against what, what was 
required by Arc and Arc haven’t been informed from 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 152 of 259 
 
elsewhere as to what terms of reference they should adopt.   
I think the whole attitude towards Nick about the 
work he’d done in terms of reference and simply just 
dumping him from, from doing the hard work seems to be 
informed by something that occurred.   
And in Nick’s statement he also makes the point 
that it is his terms of reference that has caused a rift 
between him and the board.  It is as though these terms of 
reference were not in accordance with some, some interest 
of some sort.   
10 
Now I’m – it’s difficult for me to, to be able to 
adduce anything beyond what I am saying because I’m just 
basing myself on, on the observations that, that I’ve made 
a result of the issue around the terms of reference.   
So I think there is a – I don’t know whether they 
have it and shows anything more, more than this. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, let me read to the Chairperson, just 
to the record as well – the, because I think we need to get 
correct what the member of the board said in this regard.  
Chair is there, it’s a transcript again of the 19 t h of March 
20 
and I’ll read quickly from that.   
The members are debating March 2015.  The board 
members are debating about Mr Linnell getting involved 
and getting involved at the behest of Mr Tsotsi.  Well Ms 
Naidoo says: 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 153 of 259 
 
 
“Nick can be fired and he could leave.” 
 
And she carries on.   
“But if we get these terms of reference incorrect, we 
do not do the right thing on this inquiry, this board 
is going to be a laughing stock.  Going to be like a 
laughing stock.” 
Then she carries on. 
“And right now there is no document in black and 
white that said any of these people have done 
something seriously wrong.  We, the terms of 
10 
reference that this guy put out there is not what we 
have got.” 
He’s referring to Mr Linnell.  
“Or what we have drafted.  And it is not in terms 
with what the Minister said to us on Wednesday.  So 
that is our bigger problem.  This consultant can go 
because he has acted unethically already.” 
I think what Mr Tsotsi is drawing attention to is the 
fact that the terms of reference drafted by Mr Linnell were 
said to be inconsistent with what the Minister had told the 
20 
board or told us it is said, on Wednesday.  But miss – and 
that’s the bigger problem.  Mr Tsotsi you say you were not 
aware. 
MR TSOTSI:  I don’t even know what the Minister said. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I think Ms Naidoo is coming back and 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 154 of 259 
 
we will ask her about that.  But do you know what the 
Minister had said which would have made the terms of 
reference prepared by Mr Nick to be inconsistent with that? 
MR TSOTSI:  No, there’s nothing I know that the Minister 
said to that effect in that meeting Chairman.  Well, I’m at a 
loss as to why that statement is being made.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We’ve covered the allegation, allegations 
by Mr Koko as to what he alleges or was Mr Tsotsi’s role in 
his suspension.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We’ve covered the allegation about that 
Mr Linnell, that Mr Tsotsi said that Mr Linnell had been 
appointed by the Presidency.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We’ve covered the allegations that Mr 
Tsotsi said there was a report in the Presidency and then 
you have just covered the terms of reference.  But I don’t 
know whether there is anything more Mr Tsotsi just wanted 
to say on the terms of reference.  I think you are, you are 
20 
done with them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You, if you still have some questions on 
them that’s fine, but I’m trying to remember whether how 
much else is left in terms of matters of substance that were 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 155 of 259 
 
raised by board members and Mr Koko and maybe whoever 
else.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  [Indistinct]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair, can I raise another issue? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Tsotsi may need to deal with. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that Mr Tsotsi, yes Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do we have a fresher recollection? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the issues we needed to cover with 
him? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  I think Chair he’s covered.  You 
have, he’s covered those aspects.  I mean he’s covered 
them in his affidavit as well.  Mr Pamensky.  I mean the 
last page of your affidavit … 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
What, 
what 
was 
Mr 
Pamensky’s 
allegations against Mr Tsotsi? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It’s the same that Mr Tsotsi motivated 
20 
for the suspension of the four executives, including the FD.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja here is … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And allegations of misdemeanours.   
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 156 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So there is, is nothing different from 
what we have dealt with already. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  No, it’s, it’s all in the same … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Broad things.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But what I wanted to check was whether 
there is anything, there are any issues outstanding that 
you intended to raise with Mr Tsotsi that have not been 
covered.  Or whether we have covered them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We have covered, though there was one 
10 
issue of interest.  It doesn’t, does not relate to an 
allegation against him.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But you’d like him to deal with it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, I would like to ask him that question 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  To see if he can answer it.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Before … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He wanted to say something.  Mr Tsotsi 
20 
you wanted to say something on this? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On what I was saying? 
MR TSOTSI:  No, not on what you are saying.  I just 
wanted to amplify something that has come to light, which 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 157 of 259 
 
has not been raised in the Commission before in regards to 
this matter.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, do that.   
MR TSOTSI:  And that is that it has come to light that Mr 
Linnell was actually paid by Eskom for his services that he 
provided from the 11 t h to the 18 t h of March 2015.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought, I thought Mister – I’m sorry.  I 
thought when he gave evidence, I thought Mr Linnell said 
he had not been paid.  I may be mistaken.  So you say he 
has been paid for those, for those days? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  [Indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:  For the work that he did for Eskom during 
that time? 
MR TSOTSI:  That’s correct Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But apart from, apart from making the 
statement is there some point you seek to drive with the 
statement with the fact that he was paid by Eskom? 
MR TSOTSI:  Well all I’m really is driving at Chairman is 
20 
that, that to me seems to be at the very least a tacit you 
know acceptance of the fact that the board considered him, 
having him been employed.   
It’s a tacit admission that he has been remunerated 
because he had provided a service to the board. Which, 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 158 of 259 
 
which service the board would want to you know disavow at 
some point.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Based on your experience, I mean you 
were Chairperson of the board for a number of years.  I 
don’t know whether three or four before the 2015 board.  
Would that kind of payment have had to be approved by the 
board?   
In other words can one say that because he was 
paid, the board must have approved that he be paid?  
Because if he submitted an invoice and some official paid, 
10 
the board might say, well that issue never came to us.  If it 
had come to us we would have said no.   
MR TSOTSI:  Chairman the, the short answer is definitely 
the board would have had to approve for the simple reason 
that Mr Linnell was not engaged by any of the executives, 
by any executive or order or authority.  He was engaged 
directly by the board.   
And the services provided were not provided as a 
result of some executive requirement.  There’s nothing in 
the books of the executive, the management at Eskom 
20 
which says Mr Linnell was asked to do this and therefore 
he needs to be remunerated for it.   
It’s clearly coming from the board, it has to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well what about the, the fact that you 
told the board that he had been appointed by the 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 159 of 259 
 
Presidency, shouldn’t one expect that he would be paid by 
the Presidency, why was he paid by Eskom? 
MR TSOTSI:  Well I don’t know where the word appointed 
was use.  I don’t recall but I do recall saying the President 
had asked that this man assist.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I thought you used the word 
appointed and I thought same. 
MR TSOTSI:  I – maybe …[indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You also said the Presidency gave, gave 
Mr Linnell to you or this gentleman to Eskom to help them.  
10 
Help Eskom.  How can they give without paying?  Yes.  
MR TSOTSI:  Well that would have been an observation 
that Eskom themselves would have made.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The clear response regarding the 
request for payment by Mr Linnell shows that it’s an email 
from him, 16 December 2015.  And its addressed to Mr 
Khoza.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Indistinct]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  [Indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was he acting CEO at the time?  You 
don’t know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  December 2015 … 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 160 of 259 
 
MR TSOTSI:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, Mr Molefe would have been the 
acting.  While Molefe would … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you would have been appointed 
permanently actually by December, I think, isn’t it? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Brian Molefe. 
MR TSOTSI:  As the CEO, that’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:  So Mr Khoza then became a normal board 
10 
member. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Or was he the Acting Chairperson? 
MR TSOTSI:  No, he was not the Acting Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, he was not at that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So he, ja the email is to him.  He 
thanks for following up, I have attached the invoices.  And 
then Mr Zithemba Khoza forwards the invoices to Mr Anoj 
Singh.   
This, the next day, the 17 t h of December 2015.  
20 
Then the invoices or there’s a reply from Ms Maja Bhana to 
Mr Zithemba Khoza, said we will sort the payment by next 
week.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, I haven’t placed …[indistinct]. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 161 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let’s leave it at that.  I think ask your 
last question to Mr Tsotsi. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  My, my next question is this Mr 
Tsotsi, on the -  I mean it has now become common cause 
before the Commission, I put it at that level, I hope it is at 
that level, that on the 9 t h of March 2015 no – the 
suspension of the executives was not mentioned.   
Mr Pamensky has said that.  You have said that.  
The executives have said that.  Mr Matona and Cyril 
Ramolefe.  Now when you look at the transcript you pick up 
10 
comments by two board members.   
One Dr Ngubani and the other, by Mr Pamensky.  
And his comments to this effect, you have introduced the 
idea of the inquiry from the Presidency and so on. Firstly 
Dr Ngubani, Eskom Bundle 12, page 263.  Just for the 
purposes of the record, he says: 
“Now we are being asked to form a sub-committee, 
committee, commit our fiduciary duty to this thing.  
And then the sub-committee takes very serious 
steps that will involve cost that we might involve in 
20 
restructuring the organisation, etcetera, probably in 
firing some people.” 
And he says: 
“No Chairman.  I mean we cannot work like this, I’m 
sorry.” 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 162 of 259 
 
 
And I was curious on the comment that this might 
involve firing some people.  Did this occur to you at that 
stage? 
MR TSOTSI:  Chairman, I know there’s nothing that, of that 
nature that occurred to me at that time.  To go with firing 
some people. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No what I’m saying, what I’m asking 
you is, did you pick this up that he had said the inquiry 
might probably involve firing of some people?   
MR TSOTSI:  The statement was not significant to me at 
10 
the time.  I mean I did not attribute anything of significance 
to the statement at the time, absolutely.  I had no basis 
whatsoever to, to think that there could be such a 
proposition at any point in the process. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In, in similar vein, I want to read to you 
what Mr Pamensky says, again Eskom Bundle 12, page 
270.  He says: 
“Yes, thank you Chair.  Some of my concerns are 
first of all I really think we should all as a board 
meet with the stakeholder.  My biggest concern is 
20 
that we, is that we going down on this report and it 
is going to take up a lot of management time and as 
what we know it is the skill set at the high extra 
level that is a massive problem.  If we lose top, top 
staff members during this critical time, it really puts 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 163 of 259 
 
the business at a huge risk.  And that is my biggest 
concern.  You know skills are very hard to find 
within this level and I think we really need to 
understand 
that, 
like 
in 
a 
normal 
process 
I 
understand that an investigation wants to happen.  
And I’m very, and I am very for an investigation 
should it happen, but it is all about the timing of the 
investigation.” 
 
But he says, if we lose top, top staff members 
during this critical time.  But there hasn’t been any mention 
10 
of that.  And once again my question is, did you take note 
of this at that stage, on the 9 t h of March 2015?   
MR TSOTSI:  I did not take it as something that could have 
imply any consequences, that might you know occur down 
the line.  An inquiry versus vis-à-vis loss of top skills in the 
business, that relationship I did not make anything of it, at 
all.   
At 
the 
time 
when 
Mark 
was 
saying 
it, 
Mark 
Pamensky.  So on reflection Chairman it may, it may mean 
something more than meets the eye, but right now at the 
20 
time I was, we were dealing with this matter at that 
meeting, no there was no significance in my mind.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, isn’t that surprising?  Because at 
least if anybody knew about the pending, the idea to 
suspend it would have been you.   
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 164 of 259 
 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Even though you did not articulate or 
communicate it to the board on the 9 t h? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So when you said there and you hear 
one says, some people might be fired, and you haven’t 
introduced the idea, top staff management might be lost 
and you haven’t introduced that idea, you say you didn’t, it 
didn’t strike you as something strange? 
MR TSOTSI:  Certainly not at the time. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not at the time? 
MR TSOTSI:  No.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka, just – I missed something.  
Who said what about top people being fired and when?   
ADV SELEKA SC:  That, the last one is Mr Mark Pamensky 
Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  As speaking when? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On the 9 t h of March 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, what did he say? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He says to Mr Tsotsi talking about the 
20 
inquiry.  He responds, he says: 
“My biggest concern is that we going down on this 
report 
and 
it 
is 
going 
to 
take 
up 
a 
lot 
of 
management time as we won’t – as we know it is 
the skills set at the high extra level.  There is a 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 165 of 259 
 
massive problem.  If we lose top, top staff members 
during this critical time, it really puts the business 
at a huge risk.  And this, that is my biggest 
concern.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is, you are reading from his affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, I’m reading from … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Talking about what he said at the meeting 
of the 9 t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I’m reading from the transcript Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Of?  Of the meeting of the 9 t h? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Of the meeting of the 9 t h.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So does it amount to him saying at some 
stage, some top people at Eskom would be fired?  What 
does it say about firing? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The, the … 
“If we lose top, top staff members during this 
critical time.” 
 
He seems to, to express either … 
CHAIRPERSON:  A fear or concern that the Eskom could 
lose top people? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And from the context of the transcript, 
does it indicate where he was coming from with this idea?  
From the transcripts? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That’s the point Chair.  No. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 166 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now was that the … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now that’s the point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Point you were raising? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say, how could he talk about the 
possibility of Eskom losing top … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Top staff.  
CHAIRPERSON:  People. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the 9 t h. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In circumstances where we know that the 
previous day at the Durban meeting the discussion had 
included the suspension of some executives. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That’s right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And because it was only Mr Tsotsi from 
the board who … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had attended the Durban meeting, we 
expect that if any board member knew about what had been 
20 
discussed at the meeting in Durban, he or she would know 
it through Mr Tsotsi? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That’s right.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And if Mr Tsotsi had not told any member 
… 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 167 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On the 9 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then there is a question mark as to why 
Mr Pamensky was talking about the possibility of Eskom 
losing top people. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When in two or three day’s time that 
topic was going to be before the board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And of course a decision taken to 
suspend. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Occurred.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  And the evidence is that it was only on 
the 11 t h, two days later … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That the Minister came to the meeting 
and planted, they use the word, planted the seed of 
suspensions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So two days before, apart from Mr 
20 
Tsotsi, nobody should be knowing in the board that there is 
a possibility of us losing, and he uses the word top, top 
staff … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Members.   
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 168 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Where, where is that transcript?  
[Indistinct]? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Eskom Bundle 12. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bundle 12. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Bundle 12 Chair.  Page 270.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  At the, at the bottom of the page.  
Against line 20 Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I’ll, I’ll read it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Later to see the – if there is a 
connection. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you done?  Or you still … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I am.  Dr Ngubani also made a similar 
comment Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  2 – 263. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s not the same bundle.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, the same transcript. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At 212.  Tell me where about? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, page 263.  At the bottom, against 
line 20 as well.   
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 169 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just read it into the record.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Shall I read it Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Against line 20 it says: 
“You know we have had coal plus cost, you know, 
mines.  This and that, but it is all being electorates 
to us without a chance to interrogate.  Now we are 
being asked to form a sub-committee, commit our 
fiduciary duty to this thing.  And then the sub-
committee takes very serious steps that involve 
10 
cost.  That we might be involving restructuring the 
organisation etcetera [then he says] probably in 
firing some people. The answer is no chairman.  I 
mean we cannot work like this.  I am sorry.” 
Why do they think about – why do they think people will be 
fired?  Why do they think top dog staff members would lose 
their jobs on the 9 t h March 2015? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes I think – I think questions should be 
put to them about this statements. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that they get a chance to explain, 
maybe then provide an understandable explanation of 
contracts. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that your last question? 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 170 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That was the last. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Ntsebeza I merely just 
assumed that you might have no re-examination.  Do you 
intend – would you like to re-examine or not yet? 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   Chairperson yes but very briefly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja what is your estimate?  Five minutes, 
ten minutes? 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   Ten at most. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   Ten minutes at the most. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay that is right, let’s go for it. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   Thank you very much.  I would beg the 
chairperson’s pardon in as far as correct referencing of the 
bundles before me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not have similar ... (intervenes). 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   I do not have a full sight with me but 
the documents have been referenced. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe we will be able to just follow. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja okay, alright.  Are you fine doing it 
20 
from there or would you like to go to the podium? 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   No it is fine.  I can proceed from here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Okay. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   The first one is to make reference to 
this to bring to the attention of Mr Tsotsi. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 171 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry I think you might deprive 
yourself of the opportunity to appear on television.  They 
must sanitise the podium then you can – you can stand 
there.  I know that is not your concern. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   It is not our primary concern at all, but I 
do understand ... (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but the ... (intervenes). 
ADV NTSEBEZA:  You have an overarching ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The TV people might complain because 
they want to – you to appear on their television. 
10 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   Thank you chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi in 
your affidavit – supplementary affidavit that you were taken 
through by the evidence leader earlier.  The last one you 
filed.  Where you are discussing issues related to Mr Nick 
Linnell.  I think it is paragraph 13 of your affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got it ... (intervenes). 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   Yes I am told it is Eskom 071233. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got it. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   Thank you very  much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja if you refer to any of his affidavits 
20 
and you mention the paragraph I will get it in front of me. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   Wonderful.  Mr Tsotsi if you do not mind 
let’s look maybe or for expedience let me read paragraph 
13.  You state in his affidavit for the portfolio committee on 
public 
enterprise, 
Mr 
Nick 
Linnell 
states 
on 
page 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 172 of 259 
 
U17AZP149, 13.1 at paragraph 16. 
 
“Whilst Ms Myeni’s son played no active role in 
the meeting Jabu provided information about the 
state 
of 
Eskom 
including 
allegations 
of 
wrongdoing and reasons for business failures, 
some of which are in the public domain.” 
13.2 at paragraph 17. 
 
“To the best of my recollection Jabu had a 
number documents that dealt with alleged events 
at Eskom.  These were largely from unidentified 
10 
sources and unverified content.  These were 
things in investigation would identify and were 
background in the context but in part some of 
the 
allegations 
did 
provide 
some 
value 
in 
scoping an approach to the investigation.” 
Now there was a conversation between the chairperson and 
yourself regarding documents versus report.  Is this by any 
chance dealing with that conversation or is this something 
completely different? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes this was the conversation. 
20 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   Ja and I am on specifically the 
terminology.  Here we use the terminology documents.  In 
the earlier record were I think it is in the transcripts of 
proceedings if not mistaken of the 11 t h March 2015.  There 
appears to have been an allegation that you indicated you 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 173 of 259 
 
have a report from the President.  Are you talking about 
the same thing here or are you talking about a different 
thing here? 
MR TSOTSI:   This is the same set of documents.  The 
reference in the board meeting was in reference as 
indicated here of documents that deals with the alleged 
events of Mr Minnies at Eskom. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   Okay now we have established that you 
enter – and correct me if I am wrong.  You used the word 
documents or at least Mr Linnell who you are quoting 
10 
verbatim here, uses the wording documents.  Yet when you 
are recorded in the transcript of the 11 t h March you use the 
word reports.  And you were meaning the same thing or you 
was talking separate thing. 
MR TSOTSI:   I was referring to the same things. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   Alright yes.  Now since we have now 
established, we talking about the same thing.  In the same 
transcript 
and 
I 
beg 
your 
pardon 
again 
chairperson 
because I do not have it with me as we speak.  At the time 
when – I think it was Mr Norman Baloyi in particular who 
20 
persisted a request that you provide a report at the 
meeting that will be the basis amongst which reliance could 
be sought for the mooted suspension.  What if you recall 
was Dr Ben Ngubane’s engagement on that topic. 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair my recollection there was that Dr 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 174 of 259 
 
Ngubane was not interested in a document which is not our 
document, meaning an Eskom document.  His attitude was 
that is a report – someone else’s.  We are looking for our 
own report and that is what we should be looking.  
Essentially that was the comment that he made. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   Now did that intervention that by Dr 
Ben Ngubane dispel of the need for the report to be 
brought forth or was there follow up requests after he had 
made that intervention? 
MR TSOTSI:   No there was no follow up request in terms 
10 
of board members wanting me to produce a report. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   Put differently if the fellow board 
members of the meeting accepts his intervention when you 
said but we not interested in the reports of other entities 
like the president’s.  We want our own report.  Because I 
am trying to deal with this issue that says that later – a few 
days later an allegation is made that you make reference 
to 
a 
report 
which 
Nick 
Linnell 
refers 
to 
some 
documentation here which you say is the same thing. 
 
But Dr Ngubane intervenes in the conversation 
20 
against the backdrop of a request from Norman Baloyi and 
says but we not interested.  It is not our report, we need to 
do our own.  Was there a follow up request? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman the board members appeared to 
have lost interest in pursuing that issue when Dr Ngubane 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 175 of 259 
 
made the statement he made.  And I – at that time too I 
was not – I did not pursue the issue any further after the 
Dr Ben Ngubane had indicated that he felt that we should 
be talking about our own report. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   My learned friend’s junior is very kind 
to me.  It is Eskom 2038 – sorry Eskom 12 381 in terms of 
your bundles chairperson.  In particular I think Mr Baloyi 
starts, speaker and then later the chairperson.  And it runs 
up to 12 382. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am able to follow. 
10 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Able to follow ja. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   So the in the light of this record on the 
19 t h it would appear an allegation is then made against you 
that you by the way told us of a report that you later could 
not produce.  That you say the acceptance there was that it 
is not necessary even if it was available.  Is that what you 
said. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is the view we should take chairman 
because I just say I was under pressure a lot in that 
20 
meeting on the 19 t h.  And there are a number of things 
which I could have indicated which I did not indicate.  
Because the whole mindset was you know focussed on by 
having to defend myself from the attack which was made 
against me by the board. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 176 of 259 
 
 
Yes but in answering the question, that would be 
the case.  I will accept with what Mr Ntsebeza say. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   In as far as the alleged misdemeanours 
that was also discussed at length earlier on, certainly it 
would appear on record you had to clarify as you testified 
what Nick Linnell document would have been referring to.  
And 
then 
you 
testified 
also 
today 
that 
but 
the 
conclusionary[sic] remarks you made as found in your 
affidavit were clearly stated as you read into the record.  
That there was no basis upon which wrongdoing was 
10 
imputed on the executives to be contemplated to be 
suspended.  Notwithstanding the fact that there may have 
been allegations that had not yet been verified, is that 
correct to understand? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes that is correct yes. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   So when then there is an allegation 
later that – and I am treating really the thing that could 
have – could there have been a proper basis for your 
fellow board members to have lost confidence in your other 
than for the fact that there was a plan that you may not 
20 
have been aware of that was going on hijacking these 
proceedings that you thought were ordinary, innocent 
enquiry yet there were people that may have been aware of 
other things unbeknown. 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman this is a conflict for me because I 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 177 of 259 
 
have – I think earlier even myself stated that there were 
some goings on which are difficult to explain, in terms of 
impacting the issues that were currently going on at the 
time.  So it could very well be that this could have been 
the case. 
 
You will recall also Chair – I do not know whether 
this was put before the commission as evidence.  But I 
simply say that it was.  That following the – one of his 
allegations about secret meetings.  I wrote a letter to the 
minister complaining about - in fact this very existence of a 
10 
secret meeting. 
 
And 
that 
these 
meetings 
were 
designed 
to 
sabotage the work that the board is doing.  And in fact the 
contrary to the spirit that we were doing this business and 
as a consequence of that the board is not doing what it is 
expected to do. 
 
I even suggested to the minister that minister 
should dissolve the board on the basis of the – this kind of 
behaviour.  So there was a lot of that going on. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   Perhaps to move now to Mr Linnell’s 
20 
affidavit which was – as I understand it filed in December 
last year – 2020.  This chairperson I do not know whether 
it is read in the record but was made available to us.  At 
least to me, late yesterday.  And I do believe that my 
colleague – we received it from Advocate Seleka. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 178 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   What document is it? 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   It is Mr Nick Linnell’s supplementary 
affidavit pursuant to him having appeared on the 5 t h and 
the 6 t h October last year.  Where he seeks to explain 
certain things that he believes that when reflecting on the 
transcript of proceedings were not put orally as he would 
have loved to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay I am not sure if I have seen it.  
But if you have got it – either we have it or the evidence 
leaders have got it. 
10 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   I am sure the evidence leaders do have 
it because we got it – the specific paragraph is paragraph 
50 ... (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   You should just state what the date of 
the affidavit is so that it will be easy to trace it.  When it 
was deposed to. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   Yes chairperson I will get to it now.  
The 17 t h December 2020. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I think Mr Seleka appears to want 
to say something about this.  Maybe speak from where you 
20 
are Mr Seleka if you can because the person who is going 
to sanitise seem to be far. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   (Inaudible – away from mic). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   (Inaudible – away from mic). 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 179 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   (Inaudible – away from mic). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the Chair and us will not have it in 
the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the moment. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   At this present moment yes.  Because 
Mr Tsotsi did not address the situation in his latest 
supplementary affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright just in case that was not 
10 
captured in the record.  Mr Seleka says that affidavit to 
which Mr Ntsebeza is referring was received by the 
commission but has not been included in the bundle.  But 
you may – go ahead Mr Ntsebeza. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   I am indebted ... (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   We want to finish Mr Tsotsi’s evidence. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   I am indebted.  Paragraphs 50.14, and I 
will read it into the record very shortly.  Certainly to my 
knowledge there was no involvement of Mr Popo or the 
...(indistinct) the 11 t h March 2015. 
20 
50.14. 
 
“If I had been part of the ploy to suspend 
executives under the pretext of an inquiry it 
would have been logical to assume that I would 
have as a business consultant who derives his

the board’s demand to limit enquiry and simply 
... (indistinct).  R23-million is that Dentons and 
through a limited investigation.  One would not 
expect me to act to my own detriment.  The only 
benefit I secured for this engagement was the 
R30 000 that ultimately was paid for my services 
for the work done from the evening of the 8 t h 
March to about the ... (indistinct).” 
That is – and I close the quotation there, you had made the 
10 
reference to payment being made to Mr Linnell.  Is this 
where you attribute this fee that was paid for or is there 
any other ... (indistinct). 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct chairman.  I saw it in that 
document. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   I could be done – if I may beg your 
pardon just one more second. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   Thank you one last point chairperson.  
A lot of discussion occurred earlier regarding the exchange 
20 
between yourself and the minister in particular regarding 
the composition and the names of the board committees.  
That on the 16 t h December 2014 you had sent to the 
minister.  And then later on - at least on record what has 
been made available is the revised one that you send to 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 181 of 259 
 
the minister in January.  Now if I may beg my evidence 
leader ’s assistance on that specific affidavit.  Because I 
want to make reference to a specific paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright okay.   
While your counsel is looking for the relevant 
passages 
can 
I 
clarify 
this? 
 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
composition of the different committees of the board that 
we talked about earlier; ultimately the composition of the 
committees of the board that prevail and was implemented.  
Was it the one that the minister had insisted upon had sent 
10 
to you or was it another one that you put up? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman from what I saw of the document 
that I was referred to show the two – 16 December and 26 
January.  The 16 t h December one is the one that I had sent 
to the minister which I had received from Mr Salim Essa.  
Which I may say and I will say this in a follow up affidavit, 
is substantially the same as what appears on my – on the 
26 t h January. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but my question was not that.  My 
question was we saw the composition of the board 
20 
committees that you sent to the minister on the 16 t h 
December which you say you got from Mr Salim Essa – the 
composition.  But the email was your email? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then we have seen the composition 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 182 of 259 
 
of the board committees that you sent to the minister on 
the 26 t h January. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you said the minister sent you the 
same composition as the composition you sent him on the 
16 t h December which was the composition given to you by 
Mr Salim Essa.  My question is, which composition 
ultimately - was ultimately implemented? 
MR TSOTSI:   It is that same composition. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which one? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   The one that I received from the minister 
and I said ... (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   The one I had sent to the minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes that is the one that was ultimately 
implemented. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that ... (intervenes). 
MR TSOTSI:   Same as I said chairman or my involvement 
– my membership of the investment and finance committee. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So when – in the one that you sent to 
the minister on the 16 t h December your name was reflected 
also in the investment and finance committee. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the one that the minister sent to you 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 183 of 259 
 
was the same except that your name was no longer in the 
investment and finance committee, is that what you 
saying? 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is – what she sent you was exactly 
what you have sent him? 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But later on you yourself took your name 
out of the investment and finance committee. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And was there a replacement for you in 
that 
committee 
or 
was 
there 
no 
replacement 
... 
(intervenes). 
MR TSOTSI:   There was a replacement.  There was 
somebody else who took my position. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja would you have decided on the 
replacement or would the minister have? 
MR TSOTSI:   I decided on the replacement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Without the minister? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  So but ultimately is the 
one you receive from the minister that was implemented 
subject to the fact that your name was no longer in 
investment and finance committee. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 184 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And somebody else was put in there and 
the person who was put in was decided upon by yourself. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  But you just said now I think that 
the – you said the composition was substantially saying – 
you remember in the morning we talk – we tried to 
establish from you whether it was exactly the same or 
substantially and I thought you said exactly.  But now you 
say substantially.  Do you remember that discussion? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes chairman I remember that.  I think and I 
10 
might have used the word exactly in my affidavit to the 
portfolio committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   But now on seeing and on recalling that I 
have actually moved myself out of the IFC, it would not be 
identical. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well it may be that I keep putting to you 
something in a different context – something you said in a 
different context.  Because you may have been saying in 
the morning the composition that the minister sent to you 
20 
was exactly the same as the composition you sent to her 
on the 16 t h December. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if you say the two were the same – 
exactly the same that would correct. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 185 of 259 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is different is the composition that 
was ultimately complete – implemented because the one 
that was ultimately implemented in fact from the one you 
sent to the minister on the 16 t h December and the one the 
minister sent to you only in one respect.  Namely that your 
name was no longer in the committee for investment and 
finance, otherwise it was the same. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct.  Do not forget chairman I also said 
that I also did my changes which included amongst others 
10 
my removal of myself from the IFC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, no, no I understand that but ... 
(intervenes). 
MR TSOTSI:   So the only thing the minister – the only 
thing 
that 
got 
retained 
even 
after 
the 
minister 
had 
instructed the composition of the committee should be 
exactly as she has sent it back to me which included me 
and the IFC.  I still changed myself – took myself out ... 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   That time, ja. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Even post that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja no that is fine.  Okay Mr Ntsebeza. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   Precisely my area of interest in 
clarification on re-exam ... (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 186 of 259 
 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   May I request that we first focus on 
Eskom 071222, paragraph 4, as we try and clarify ... 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes you can continue. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   And I will read into the record, this is 
Mr Andile Zola Tsotsi’s affidavit – supplementary affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay you reading too softly. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   Oh, it is Mr Tsotsi’s affidavit at 
paragraph 4 and I read ... (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja it is the one that we based Exhibit 
10 
U17.2, starting at page 1222 and you are reading from ... 
(intervenes). 
ADV NTSEBEZA:   Correct paragraph 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV NTSEBEZA:    
“To the best of my recollection the allocations as 
reflected in my email of 16 December 2014 are 
precisely as I had received them from Mr Salim 
Essa.  At the time I decided to pass it on to the 
Minister 
Brown 
as 
is. 
 
And 
my 
commentary 
20 
regarding 
the 
chairperson 
of 
Audit 
& 
Risk 
Committee needing to be a CA, I was priming the 
minister to changes that I intend to make which 
subsequently did – I suppose I did. 
One such change was removing my name from the 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 187 of 259 
 
investment and finance committee.” 
Now what do you mean by this?  Do you want to expand?  I 
mean we understand what you meant.  You did pass 
exactly that which you received from Salim Essa to the 
minister.  But also you say you were priming the Minister 
for changes, what do you mean by priming, expand on 
that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman when I looked at the committee of 
the allocation, I clearly did not agree with what was on 
there, so when I am talking about priming the Minister I 
10 
was alerting her that I am likely to make some changes 
because that was my ...[intervenes]  
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Hold on there.   Now Chairperson if 
I beg your pardon and ask this, you see Eskom 07031, this 
is Mr Tsotsi’s original affidavit.   On paragraph 20.3 I start 
to read. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let us read. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:    
“The other occasion was when the new Board came 
into being, where I was required to place Board 
20 
members in sub-committees of the Board.  Salim 
Essa sent me his configuration and asked that I 
pass it on to the Minister as my submission.  I 
quietly ignored his submission and sent mine to the 
Minister whereupon the Minister responded with the 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 188 of 259 
 
exact submission I have received from Salim Essa.  
I kept going back and forth with this process of 
chopping and changing locations with the Minister 
until she called me to a meeting, at the meeting was 
Salim Essa and Tony Gupta, she merely informed 
me that the Board allocation will be the way she 
sent them to me.  This she did in the presence of 
these two gentleman.  I do not know if Mr Essa had 
any involvement in my resignation.” 
Now, I close quote there.   What we are picking up from the 
10 
original affidavit read together with this supplement, is that 
- and you must correct me where I am wrong.  The original 
list that you sent on the 16 t h of December was received 
from Salim Essa and was sent as is to the Minister, is that 
correct?  
MR TSOTSI:   Correct.  
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Secondly, what we are picking up 
specifically reading from your original affidavit, is that, 
whereas we have dealt with the Chairperson, regarding the 
inaccuracy of placing the words quietly ignored, was not 
20 
what really happened.  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Notwithstanding what your intention 
was to convey this. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 189 of 259 
 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   But the reality is that there was a 
back and forth chopping and changing between yourself 
and the Minister.  Can you expand on that what you meant? 
MR TSOTSI:   What I meant, there is that I made the 
changes or suggested changes following what Minister's 
response 
was 
when 
I 
sent 
Salim 
Essa’s 
original 
submission, and I then got the idea from the Minister 
again, that I should not make any changes and the 
allocation is as what she had sent me. So…[intervene] 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Yes, continue.  
10 
MR TSOTSI:   So this culminated then in her calling me to 
a meeting because I suppose in her mind, I was resisting 
what she was saying, by introducing changes that were not 
in accordance with what she had wanted to happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know why she would insist on the 
composition of committees being the way she wanted them 
to be, other than the one or two committees that she says 
in her affidavit, she was legally entitled to decide upon 
because she says in her affidavit: 
“Legally, I was entitled, or obliged or I had the 
20 
responsibility to see to the composition of.” 
I think the Audit and Risk Committee and the Ethics 
Committee. 
“To the others, the other committees.” 
She seems to concede that she did not legally have a right 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 190 of 259 
 
of power to proceed, to determine their composition.  But 
here now, on your version, she was insisting that even with 
regard to the other committees, the composition should be 
the way she wanted, and not the way you as the 
Chairperson or you as the Board wanted it.  Do you know 
why she would have insisted on doing something that she 
had no right to do? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, I do not know of that explicitly, I 
do not have any evidence to that so that I can say I know.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   However, the moment I got this document 
with the composition from Salim Essa where he said I 
should pass it onto the Minister, I immediately had in mind 
that there must be some relationship between Salim Essa 
and Minister Brown.   
That Salim would ask me to do a thing like this, and 
then what was reinforced in my mind in terms of that was 
when I then was called by the Minister, and she insisted on 
what she insisted i.e. that allocation that I originally got 
from Salim should stay as it is and unchanged. 
20 
And say, doing that in the presence of Salim Essa  
and Tony Gupta.  So I came to the conclusion there, and 
then that she was serving the interests of people outside of 
Eskom, namely the Gupta’s.  That is the impression I have 
and that is the impression I got at the time.  
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 191 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Ngcebetsha.  
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   That will be all, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you.  I think there is just 
one or two last things Mr Tsotsi.  You know, your counsel 
referred you to your affidavit where you - where he quoted 
or where in your affidavit had quoted Mr Linnell, talking 
about documents that Mr Maswanganyi had the meeting in 
Durban, 
and 
he 
asked 
you 
whether 
those 
are 
the 
documents that you were talking about when you said there 
was a report, and you said, yes, you remember that?  
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But I am under the impression and I 
think I did say this before you, you did not say that is not 
true.  I am under the impression that you are reported to 
have said to the Board, on the 11 t h that the report you were 
talking about was in the Presidency.  
If I am wrong about that, my question might fall 
away but if I am correct about that, there might be a 
question of, how it is possible that you could say that 
those are the documents we are talking about, which Mr 
20 
Maswanganyi had that meeting of the 8 t h if you had said 
the report you were talking about was in the Presidency. 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, I did say that because do not 
forget, from my perspective, because this thing was 
entirely new.  There were people who had documents 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 192 of 259 
 
there, and I took the view, that these documents were part 
of documents which were in the hands of people in the 
Presidency, it happen to be in the hands of a particular 
individual at that time. 
And I understood that they themselves would have 
gotten 
those 
documents 
from 
the 
Presidency, 
from 
somebody within the Presidency, and so, I was referring to 
the to the source of the document, the fact that someone 
else had physically the document in their hand was not 
really the issue.  I was really saying, this is the source of 
10 
the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, then there is the question of when 
exactly the meeting that you talked about, involving 
yourself, Ms Brown and Mr Essa and Tony Gupta took 
place.   
Your counsel also referred to quoted paragraphs 
from your affidavit where you seem to say there was 
too’ing and fro’ing between or talking between yourself and 
the Minister in relation to the composition of the Board 
committees, until she called you to a meeting and said, the 
20 
composition that will be implemented was the one she had 
sent to you.  
That seemed to suggest to me that you may be 
mistaken in thinking that a meeting took place before the 
26 t h of January.  I do not know whether you have the same 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 193 of 259 
 
feeling because when you say until it's like after that 
meeting, the too’ing and fro’ing stopped because now she 
had put her foot down, but before that, there was exchange 
of different compositions between yourselves or you kept 
on sending.  
In the end, it might not matter whether it was before 
or after the 26 t h of January but I thought I must just raise 
that again, whether in your own mind you seem quite clear 
that it was before the 26 t h of January, or whether it could 
be that it was after. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, it was before the 26 t h of January. 
Do not forget also, if you recall some of the evidence from 
other Board members, that they were already operating in 
sub-committees in January.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So this was before? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, it would have had to have been 
clarified to a large extent. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that is fine.  Okay, nothing 
arsing? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Mr Tsotsi just opens another just 
20 
opens another can of worms after the other. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Ngcebetsha? 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Chairperson, certainly for me I 
probably was over simplistic, I thought the point was made, 
maybe if you indulge me just on this last point arising from 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 194 of 259 
 
your comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Maybe you can do it from 
there. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Yes.  Mr Tsotsi now, the back and 
forth between yourself and the Minister a t what point does 
that happen, if you were to give a proposed dates because 
we know that the 16 t h of December 2014 you received from 
Essa you passed onto the Minister. 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair this would have occurred shortly after 
I have received the response from the Minister. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Right. 
MR TSOTSI:   After I had sent I passed on what Salim Essa 
had sent me, she came back and said, this is okay.  Then I 
- following that that would have been post the 16 t h.  So it 
would be sometime between the 16 t h and let us say, maybe 
the first week or so of January.  That would have been the 
sort of the timeframe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, maybe before you proceed Mr 
Ngcebetsha let me just interpose this question.  You see, 
20 
the letter, the email letter read to you from the Minister of 
the 28 t h of January, which we all thought must have been a 
response to the composition you sent to her on the 26 t h of 
January. 
If you read that email she seems not to be 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 195 of 259 
 
responding to the composition you sent in substance, she 
seems to be saying you sent it in a wrong way, you must 
send it under cover of some letter, and then she sets out a 
number of items, she says you must send it together with 
all of those requirements.  
Now, if she had directly prior to that said to you, 
you shall implement my composition there may be some 
tension there because she seems to be in that email to be 
saying I will consider your composition but after you have 
done the following, put it under cover of a certain letter 
10 
and also give me the following things, she sets out six 
things.  Now, if your version, on your version that prior to 
the 26 t h of January, she had already said implement my 
composition and nothing else.  
It seems that that might not be consistent with the 
tone of her email of the 28 t h where she seems to be 
entertaining, and not rejecting your composition but saying 
bring it under cover of another letter and include the 
following other things.  But you might say look I am clear 
in my mind it was before or you might say, look, maybe it 
20 
was after.  In the end, it might not matter and I was just 
thinking you might be able - it might jog your memory. 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman what I said is that the meeting of 
the Minister where the two gentlemen were present Salim 
Essa and Tony Gupta, is really the culmination of what the 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 196 of 259 
 
Minister 
wanted 
and 
that 
was, 
as 
far 
as 
she 
was 
concerned, putting your foot down as you say, this is what 
is going to happen, right.   
Now, that meeting occurs before the 26 t h so on the 
26 t h I sent to her, in essence, what she says, is the 
culmination of what should be done for the saying for the 
that I insisted on taking myself out of the IFC.  She 
accepted that that insistence on my part, but the rest of 
the composition is the same as what Salim Essa had sent 
me on the 26 t h, notwithstanding my iterations that I sent to 
10 
her in the interim between the 16 t h of December and the 
date on which she put her foot down in the presence of the 
Gupta’s.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   So what she was asking for on the 28 t h is 
just a formalisation of what I had sent her on the 26 t h in a 
format which she can use in her reporting, in a format she 
can use in the, what was called the shareholders meeting 
with the Board.  So it was just a formalisation on her part 
to say, I want this composition you sent me on the 26 t h put 
20 
it and include the following things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Ngcebetsha, you had asked for 
one question I gave you but you might have the last one. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   The last is that put differently, this 
is the proposition I put to you, you need to correct me if it 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 197 of 259 
 
is wrong.   
` 
The 26 t h correspondence becomes the culmination 
of your conceding that all the changes you had suggested 
were rejected safe for you taking yourself out of A, B that 
the response by her on the 28 t h simply suggests that now 
that I am satisfied that you are doing what I want, and not 
what you post, now you can formally put it in this post. 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, I wish I could have put it that way 
but that is precisely, precisely the situation. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   Thank you, very much. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you pay him for that.  But let me 
ask the question, your composition of the 26 t h, because Mr 
Seleka’s junior has not, we have not had the final version 
of what she is preparing.  Your composition of the 26 t h that 
you sent to her, to the Minister was it the same as the 
composition she sent to you, except that your name was no 
longer in the Investment and Finance Committee? 
MR TSOTSI:   The answer is yes, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Now, in your affidavit in 
the paragraph that your counsel have read, you seem to 
20 
suggest that you intended making changes to the 16 t h 
December composition, but you have only talked about 
removing your name.  Does that mean you decided not to 
make any other changes that you may have thought you 
would make? 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 198 of 259 
 
MR TSOTSI:   The other – yes one change I recall making 
was to take Chwayita Mabude out of, as Chairperson of 
ARC and put in Mark Pamensky because Chwayita although 
quite she is a financial person at the time, I do not think 
she was a CA, and I made the point in my statement that 
ordinarily that position is occupied by someone with a CA, 
so Mark Pamensky being a CA, I put his name there.  
So that is one of the changes I recall.  Some others 
I could have made on the basis of the CV’s of the Board 
members when I looked at, which is what was guiding me 
10 
in terms of the allocation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is the position therefore, that the 
composition of the committees of the Board that was finally 
implemented was one, not exactly the same as the one that 
the Minister sent to you.  Two, one difference was that you 
had taken your name out of Investment and Finance 
Committee but that was not the only change you made.  
You also made some changes relating to Mr Mabude and 
Mr Pamensky. 
MR TSOTSI:   Ms Mabude. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh is it Ms I am sorry, Ms Mabude, but 
are you saying there could be other changes that you do 
not remember? 
MR TSOTSI:   There could have been other changes Chair 
that I might have proposed but I do not recall, quite 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 199 of 259 
 
honestly.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So, from what you are now saying, it 
looks like there may have been substantial changes to the 
composition that she sent you that you effected. 
MR TSOTSI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, first you said one, your name.  Now, 
you have said also Ms Mabude but you have said there 
could be others.  So I am saying it looks like could be 
substantial because the committee's members were not 
many in any committee. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you – there was about four or five 
people at most of the time, is it not? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, so let me put it another way.  The 
Minister 
rejected 
every 
change 
I 
made 
save 
or 
my 
exclusion of myself from the IFC that is…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well if that is so then you must be back 
to 
your 
version, 
which 
is 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
committee's that was ultimately implemented, was the 
same as the composition that the Minister sent to you, 
20 
except 
that 
your 
name 
no 
longer 
appeared 
under 
Investment and Finance Committee.  
MR TSOTSI:   That was what ultimately happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but are you saying in between 
before you reached that point, you had suggested other 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 200 of 259 
 
changes including Ms Mabude and Mr Pamensky? 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But that was rejected. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And you are saying there may have been 
others that you cannot remember, other changes but 
whatever other changes you suggested were rejected by 
the Minister, and the only one she accepted was your 
removing 
yourself 
from 
the 
Investment 
and 
Finance 
Committee? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, Chair thank you.  I thought the 
last question, which was asked turns everything by my 
learned friend around.  That last question, Mr Tsotsi said to 
you, does it mean that your email of the 26 t h to the 
Minister, which email is your revised list?  You were simply 
saying to the Minister, okay, now that you have asked me 
to do the changes, here is your changes, and the Minister 
responds and say, okay, formalise it, you know, follow this 
20 
formalities in submitting it to me.  
But earlier, that is not how we understood you to be 
saying, we understood you to be saying the email of the 
26 t h of January 2015 contained your own list. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I had understood him like that. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 201 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   No, Chairperson if you allow me? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Ngcebetsha. 
ADV NGCEBETSHA:   To complete what actually happened 
Mr Tsotsi said, there are missing exchanges of email, 
which is where these changes were, and the only ones he 
sees now are the 16 t h of December 2014, and the 26 t h and 
the 28th of January.  That is where they gap warranted is 
for clarity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, look in the end it may not or may, 
10 
may or may not matter a lot, but at this stage one does not 
know whether it will end up being material or not.  But the 
one thing that we know you have said now, Mr Tsotsi is the 
ultimate composition of the Board committees that was 
implemented was the same as the one the Minister sent to 
you, except in one respect.  That one respect was that your 
name was no longer in the Investment and Finance 
Committee.  
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what you say.  Okay, and we 
20 
ought to have somewhere a document that can prove what 
the ultimate composition of the committees was I would 
imagine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It should be somewhere. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 202 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja, that we should have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    We will certainly have that, so we will 
incorporate it in that comparative table, so we can see the 
evolution of the changes in the ultimate that we have.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay thank you very much Mr Tsotsi, 
I did not think that we would - you only finished now but 
that is what has happened and matters needed to be 
clarified. Some have been clarified, maybe others need to 
be but thank you very much, I will now excuse you. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Thank you, Chairman I think Mr Seleka must 
think that I have a very high entertainment value that is 
why he keeps me here for so long. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry just repeat? 
MR TSOTSI:   I am just saying I think the reason why I stay 
here for so long is because Mr Seleka thinks I have a very 
high entertainment value, so he likes for me to be around 
but thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Thank 
you, 
Mr 
Tsotsi 
and 
Mr 
Ngcebetsha, you are also excused.  I know you would like 
20 
to be excused as some of us are going to continue into the 
evening session.  Okay, I think we will take an adjournment 
Mr Seleka we at half past four, of 15 minutes will that be 
enough to? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    I had the same in mind Chair. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 203 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, 15 minutes and then Ms Daniels can 
be connected.  
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES

10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good afternoon Ms Daniels. 
MS DANIELS:   Good afternoon Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you for availing yourself.  Have 
you been waiting for a few hours? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I have indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  We apologise that we did not 
finish earlier with the previous witness but I am sure you 
also want to get done. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.   
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you have been appearing 
before the Commission quite a few times. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, Mr Seleka.  I think we will 
administer the oath afresh. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 204 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please administer the oath again. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.   
REGISTRAR:   Please state your full names for the record. 
WITNESS:   Suzanne Margaret Daniels. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you have any objection in taking the 
prescribed oath? 
WITNESS:   No. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you consider the oath binding on your 
conscience? 
10 
WITNESS:   Yes. 
REGISTRAR:   Do you solemnly swear that the evidence 
you will give, will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing 
but the truth?  If so, please raise your right hand and say, 
so help me God. 
WITNESS:   So help me God. 
SUZANNE MARGARET DANIELS:  (d.s.s.) 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you.  Mr Seleka. 
EXAMINATION BY ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  
Ms Daniels is coming back, as it were, to complete if we 
20 
can, I hope we will, the – her evidence or testimony in 
regard to the – the last time we were at the penalties.  The 
R 2.17 billion penalties claim that Eskom had against 
Optimum under Glencore. 
 
And then we will also touch on her evidence in 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 205 of 259 
 
regard to McKenzie/Trillian to the extent that she played 
any role in regard to the transactions relevant to the two 
entities. 
 
And that will map the end Ms Daniels.  So let us 
start with the penalties.  And Ms Daniels, my approach is 
going to be this.   
 
I will tell you what I see from the evidence 
because, really, about the penalties is – is the big question 
is.  Why the claim which started as R 2.17 billion was 
settled at...  Well, the allegation is that it was settled at 
10 
R 577 million but when you look at the figures, the actual 
settlement, is actually R 419 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought it went even below that.  I must 
be mistaken. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought it was two-hundred and fifty 
something million ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   R 255 million after further deductions. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then the payment is a little over 
half of that and over R 133 million was not paid.  Now – 
and Ms Daniels, you will tell the Chairperson, when do you 
become involved and comment on what I am about to put to 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 206 of 259 
 
you and you can take the Chairperson into the details. 
 
What I have seen from the...  Oh, Chair just 
before I do that.  We will be using mainly Ms Daniels’ 
affidavit on the transactions which is found in Eskom 
Bundle 18(A) for Hadkowiez[?].  It is on page 236 of the 
bundle. 
 
Ms Daniels, yours I know is not marked in terms 
of A, B and C.  So it is just page 236. 
MS DANIELS:   Okay.  I will go there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is Exhibit U-34.1. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got the affidavit but I was still 
looking for the page where it starts dealing with penalties. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you might draw – you will refer me 
to the page when ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, page ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...you need to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 263 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS DANIELS:   Apology Mr Seleka.  Is this in Bundle 18? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Eskom Bundle 18. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.   
MS DANIELS:   Can you just repeat the number for me, 
please? 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 207 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You can go to page 263. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It starts at paragraph 89 of your affidavit 
from the transactions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the topic of penalties. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   I am there, yes.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I would like the Chairperson to have 
Eskom Bundle 14(C), also next to you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I reject it ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   It has just been ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...when my registrar said it was here 
because I said you will tell me when I need it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then it will be brought. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because there is not much space here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay Chair.  Thank you.  Ms Daniels, 
the – I have looked at your affidavit against the affidavit of 
Mr Rishaban Moodley of CDH, which is the law firm that 
represented 
Eskom 
in 
the 
arbitration 
regarding 
the 
R 2.17 billion penalty.   
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 208 of 259 
 
 
I appreciate the fact that you came to dealing 
with the matter, I believe it is in 2016.  Is that correct? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct.  Mr Chair, it was around 
September 2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What I have seen from Mr Moodley’s 
affidavit of CDH, is their involvement dating back to 
October 2013.  That is at the time when Eskom goes into a 
cooperation agreement with OCM.  OCM, yes, under 
Glencore.  Even at that stage, they are given instructions 
to advise on the penalties.   
10 
 
And they give an opinion, a memorandum which I 
have indicated as the first opinion to Eskom in regard to 
the penalties in October 2013, 23 October 2013. 
 
Already in that opinion, they raised concerns 
regarding the calculation of the amount, on the one hand, 
and on the other, they also raised concerns about what 
they perceived to be Eskom’s abandonment of its rights in 
terms of the agreement. 
 
And we will come back to these issues that they 
raised.  There is interaction from that date onwards 
20 
between 
CDH 
and 
Eskom, 
particularly 
the 
Finance 
Department, in order to try to get to the bottom of the 
figures. 
 
And this leads to a second opinion by CDH on 
the 17 t h of March 2015 in which again CDH raised concerns 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 209 of 259 
 
in regard to the calculation of the amount. 
 
Now I should indicate that in respect of the first 
opinion, the amount was not R 2.17 billion.  It had been 
calculated to be at R 1.3 billion.  Even as at the second 
opinion, 17 March 2015 ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  Where did you say the 
opinion are, the first one? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They will be found Chair in the 
affidavit of Mr Moodley which is Eskom Bundle 14.  And I 
...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is that the bundle you wanted me to 
have? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you did not tell me that I need it 
now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I want to lay the background so 
that when Ms Daniels answers, we can then go into...  I 
want to create ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I want to have it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Eskom Bundle 14(C). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 891. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not have pages 877.98. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is it Eskom Bundle 14(C)? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have got 879.2.  It is a memorandum 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 210 of 259 
 
dated 17 February 2017. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   891 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I say...  No, I know you said 891 
but I am saying that is the last page I have and the next 
page is 951.  It looks like there are some pages in between 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Missing? 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that are missing.  And I do not 
remember that I may have taken them out. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, my junior says hers is also the 
10 
same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have seen a continuation of Moodley’s 
affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The affidavit is missing there.   
[Discussion between speaker and junior counsel – unclear.] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh.  Chair, it seems the – there is an 
overflow from 14(B) to 14(C).   
CHAIRPERSON:   The bundle I have is 14(C). 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, you have 14(C).  I see from 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is the correct one? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...from my junior that 14(B), right at 
the end of it, has the affidavit starting at page 882. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I hope I did not take the pages out 
from...  I forget to them taken back into the bundle.   
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 211 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, my junior does indicate several 
pages are missing.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In both your bundle and her bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe, probably, the missing 
pages are in my residence.  [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, they are missing in hers as well.  
So. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, we will...  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I have got Moodley’s affidavit.  But 
now it means we will be looking at different bundles and 
pagination or you will use the paragraph numbers. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The page numbers are the same, I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, is that so? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   My only concern is whether the 
annexures are going to be in the right place. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it not easier to quickly make copies of 
20 
exactly the pages that are missing ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That are missing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...from the other bundle?  Well, I do not 
know.  I do not know where the nearest photocopier may 
be. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 212 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, she is communicating with the 
bundles people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay maybe we can go on so long. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  So the page and 
paragraph I wish to refer to of this bundle is – now it is 
Eskom Bundle 14(C) – I mean, (B).  For you Ms Daniels, it 
makes no difference. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is page 891. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, sir, I have got that page. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, paragraph 22.  But the bottom line 
is this.  Let me start with that and we can go into the 
details.  If Chairperson...  like to see Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does it make ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, no.  It is just that I wanted 
Chairperson’s attention. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, I was listening. [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I want to do – I want to lay the building 
blocks and the Chair – I do not want to leave the Chair 
behind. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 213 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] Ja, I want to be at the same 
stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I am happy that today you do not 
want to do that.  [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  In short, Ms Daniels, before we go 
into the details.  What we see from the concerns raised by 
the attorneys for Eskom, CDH.  In the ultimate end which 
leads 
to 
the 
amount 
being 
drastically 
reduced 
from 
10 
R 2.1 billion to eventually R 419 million, is a distinction 
between two periods.   
 
There is the penalised period, which is from 
March 2014 to May...  Sorry, it is March 2012 to May 2014.  
They call it the penalised period.  That means Chair, that is 
the 
period 
when 
Eskom 
had 
imposed 
penalties 
and 
deducted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the period? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   March 2012 to May 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now they had deducted an amount of 
R 158 million from OCM but in that period ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   One second Mr Seleka.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 214 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that period has on the one hand an 
amount that was actually deducted.  This amount gets to 
the be included in the claim.  Then it becomes a double 
claim. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So an amount that was deducted from 
the claim? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was deducted from – so it is imposed 
as a penalty. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then deducted from the invoices.  
10 
So ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It means OCM paid. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You paid – paid the penalties. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Penalties in that period. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To that amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
They 
still 
included 
it 
in 
the 
R 2.17 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and how much was that amount? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is R 158 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 215 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now Chair, let us see whether I can 
help you.  I can talk...  Yes.  Chairperson, go to page 928 
of Eskom Bundle 14, that affidavit of Mr Moodley.  There is 
a table there with the figures, 928.   
TECHNICIANS:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. The recorder – the recording 
people, Chair, say your – when you speak the mask on, 
they cannot hear you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They cannot hear me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [laughs] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought they could hear me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, the sound system does not pick 
up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   They might be able to hear you but the 
technology fails to hear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  So that table at the bottom of the 
page, Chairperson, that is a summary of this claim. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And... 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the amount ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   This table ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...shows how the settlement was arrived 
at or shows something else? 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 216 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, that is right, how the settlement 
was arrived at Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you will see the amount I am 
talking about is in the second row. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which is less penalties already 
deducted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, from the R 577 839 105,42 amount. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So the R 158 million had already 
been imposed as a penalty and taken off from OCM but 
nonetheless the executives within Eskom included it in the 
arbitration 
claim, 
thus 
increasing 
the 
claim 
to 
R 2.17 billion.  That is the one aspect. 
 
The other aspect, which is not apparent from the 
table Chair, is what they referred to as penalties for sizing 
specification.  So they are saying OCM in the period of 
March 2012 to May 2014, you delivered coal that was not 
20 
according to size specification.   
 
That penalty amount was R 1.4 billion but Eskom 
had problems with it in the sense that in succeeding to 
prove the claim because they had not complied with the 
agreement to notify OCM as and when the breach occurred 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 217 of 259 
 
that you have breached and this is how we are going to 
calculate the penalty. 
 
If you do that – if you do not do that then you 
assume to have accepted ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You are taken to have no problem with 
the coal. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you will see ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So the failure to give that notice 
resulting you being barred from claim if you did not give 
that notice within the time ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Contemplated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I remember seeing that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And now this is three years later.  
This is in 2015, March 2012, March 2013 and then 
20 
May 2014.  Three years later, CDH says these are the 
concerns.  You are taking – you might be taken to waived 
your rights because you did not evoke those rights. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
That 
R 1.4 billion, 
Chair, 
the 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 218 of 259 
 
abandoned it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On that ground or ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is another ground. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is another ground.  But I think it 
is an accumulative effect of all these grounds.  The other 
one, and you see this from the memos Chair, the other one 
is 
that 
Eskom 
had 
agreed 
with 
OCM 
in 
2015 
on 
specifications, size and specifications that now matched 
the coal that OCM had supplied during the past three 
10 
years. 
 
And once they did that, OCM says:  So what is 
your problem?  Why are you putting this in the claim?  
Because you have agreed with us and you did not any 
suffer any harm to your power station.   
 
So that R 1.4 billion which Eskom should have 
known, ought to have known, they had capitulated on that 
but they still included it in the amount.  So nothing then 
gets to be claimed for the period March 2012 to May 2014. 
 
Then there is a period from June 2014 to 
20 
May 2015.  Eskom, again, included a claim for sizing 
specification.  That claim, Chair, had to be abandoned 
because of that agreement.  Because of not invoking the 
clauses that say you are in breach.  We will impose the 
penalties ...[intervenes]  
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 219 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   The notification(?) clause? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Ja. 
 
And 
that 
amount 
was 
R 744 million.  What Eskom, ultimately, pursued against...  
Now this is Tegeta.  This is now in 2016/2017.  But they 
ultimately pursue against them and then to settle.  It is 
amount of R 419 million.  That amount is penalties imposed 
only in respect of quality specifications.   
 
And then from that amount you will find the 
10 
deductions on page 928 in that table.  The total penalties, 
R 419 million and then there is less CV penalty which is 
R 126 million.  So they are deducting from the amount, two 
further amounts, R 126 million and R 37 million and the 
amount, ultimately, is R 255 million.  Ms Daniels, you 
follow that? 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, I did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now, ultimately, the attorneys for 
Eskom gave, what I see from the evidence, to be five legal 
opinions where they raised concerns.  Could you comment 
20 
on the correctness or otherwise of what I have explained to 
the 
Chairperson 
in 
regard 
to 
how 
the 
amount 
was 
ultimately reduced?  On the other hand, or first and 
foremost, but on the second or secondary to that, to 
explain to the Chairperson why was the higher amount 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 220 of 259 
 
pursued despite the fact that the officials within Eskom 
ought to have known that they had already charged OCM in 
respect of one amount, why are they double-claiming it, or 
sought to do so?  And two, why they sought to incorporate 
in the claim way after the fact penalties that they had 
failed to pursue during the first three years when the 
breach occurred? 
MS DANIELS:  I am sort of – Mr Seleka did a very good 
summary there so I am not sure how much I am going to 
repeat when I say what I say but you can guide me on that.  
10 
It is correct what Mr Seleka was saying about how this 
amount was arrived, there are really those two factors, the 
double-counting of the 158 million and the application of 
the size in penalty which in reality was not a penalty, as 
such, but it was really supposed to be a payment reduction 
for coal received.  The formula was set out in the first 
addendum to the coal contract and it is correct that the 
attorney in CDH way back in 2013 had raised the issues 
that they raised and both to Eskom’s internal legal advisers 
and to – and I mean, to them and also to the executives 
20 
responsible in primary energy in generation and also the 
chief executives.  So in 2015 just before the decision to 
institute action, this would have been head of generation 
was Mr Matshela Koko, the chief executive was Mr Brian 
Molefe and I think the head of primary energy at that time 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 221 of 259 
 
was Mr Johan Bester.  I think he was acting.  I seem to 
recall from his testimony that he did raise these concerns 
with Mr Koko and Mr Molefe. 
 
The attorneys have been consistent since 2013 in 
respect of three aspects.  Eskom, in terms of its contract 
management procedure in primary energy, did not provide 
the 
proper 
notices, 
the 
proper 
contract 
management 
mechanisms to actually enforce the sizing issues and in 
effect waived its rights by doing so and you will see in the 
later opinions Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr does talk about the 
10 
argument for rectification because it seemed to be an 
unattended consequence.   
At the time the issue when the first addendum was 
concluded the issue was around sizing and the protection 
of, you know, the right kind of coal going to the power 
station.  So that was one issue. 
So 
the 
contract 
management 
– 
and 
that 
is 
consistent throughout that they say even in the opinion 
that I asked for in late 2016 they do say that this is an 
issue that we have in terms of we do not have sufficient 
20 
evidence to prove that we had invoked our rights and 
effectively we had then waived them so we could not 
enforce them. 
The methodology in terms of calculating the other 
payment deductions was also inconsistent, so that is why 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 222 of 259 
 
you have the quality issues that we have.  The unattended 
consequence of the sizing formula that we had was that 
pertinent quality parameters were then not penalised and 
that was another issue that Cliffe Dekker raised and this 
was not the first that this issue was raised in 2016 when 
the opinion came.  If you look at the 2013 opinion that Mr 
Seleka mentioned, 2015, you will see that those issues are 
there.  The issues have been consistent throughout and 
last but not least, there was also an issue with the manner 
in which Eskom was sampling the coal. 
10 
And a further issue was that Optimum did raise that 
they were not able to meet the sizing requirements and 
that 
their 
parties 
then 
entered 
into 
negotiation 
and 
effectively what that negotiation was then suspend the 
sizing payment reduction mechanism.  So this was – I think 
you would see it in the documentation around 2014/2015 
when Glencore or Optimum said that they would need to 
renegotiate 
that, 
that 
was 
part 
of 
the 
cooperation 
agreement. 
Now this was presented to the primary energy 
20 
people and it was presented to Mr Koko and Mr Molefe at 
the 
time 
and 
they 
notwithstanding 
these 
procedures 
insisted on going ahead and claiming the 2.1 billion.  
Effectively, Mr Chair, if you took the sizing, if you included 
the sizing penalty, it took the amount up to 2.1 billion.  If 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 223 of 259 
 
you removed it, it was at the 419 mark.  So I think there 
were those – all those factors but Mr Koko and Mr Molefe 
insisted on proceeding with the summons and you will see 
that when Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr issued the letter of 
demand, they do say that this issue needs to be further 
investigated and…. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Looks 
like 
there 
has 
been 
an 
interruption. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   …Mr Seleka, does that cover...? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well you disappeared not in terms of 
your picture but your voice, we could not hear you for a 
few seconds, maybe 10, maybe 15, I do not know, so we 
did not hear.  I think you maybe need to start that answer 
afresh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We lost the signal, Ms Daniels, when 
you were talking about CDH sending a letter of demand 
and then said something, further work needs to be done. 
MS DANIELS:   Okay.  In the letter of demand when the 
instruction was provided, this was in 2015, Mr Chairman, 
20 
the instruction was provided that they need to issue the 
letter of demand.  They did indicate that further work 
needed to be done on assessing the claim because 
effectively what the sizing provisions in the first addendum 
did was if they were not enforced by Eskom they actually 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 224 of 259 
 
fell 
by 
the 
wayside, 
so 
effectively, 
like 
Mr 
Seleka 
explained, they were waived.  I think in terms of the 
agreement it actually says that the coal – it is not a waiver 
in the traditional sense but the coal had – in the event that 
Eskom does not raise objections, the coal is accepted to 
have met the quality specs and CDH indicated that we have 
to investigate if that is so.  You know, there was not 
enough paperwork at the time and this was presented, this 
fact was presented to the executives at the time and they 
decided notwithstanding that to pursue the claim as 
10 
instructed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, thank you.  Chair, if we take it 
step-by-step and we start on bundle 14, page 891, 
paragraph 22, with that background in mind, we go back to 
October 2013.  Ms Daniels, you got the page? 
MS DANIELS:   You said 822? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  891.  Eskom bundle 14, ja. 
MS DANIELS:   Okay, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Paragraph 22.   
“During October 2013 CDH provided a legal opinion 
20 
to Eskom relating to the potential penalty claim on 
the sizing quality parameters under the CSA and 
addenda thereto including our preliminary concerns 
relating to the evidence which would be necessary 
for such a claim to succeed.” 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 225 of 259 
 
And they refer to: 
“See item 11 of the bundle.” 
Chairperson, that is the opinion, it is on page 984 but let 
me read further here before we go to it.  It says: 
“Pursuant to this advice…” 
984, Chair, the same bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not think I have got…[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, no, no, that is where the overflow 
comes in. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not think I have 980 something, my 
10 
last page is 950.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed, Chair.  Sorry, that is where we 
overflowed to the next, 14C, 984. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  That is a memorandum on page 
984 from Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr dated 23 October 2013 
addressed to Mr Johan Bester and, Chairperson, in this 
memo they will then raise the concerns which they refer to 
in the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So I will confine myself for present 
purposes to the affidavit – well... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Am I right to suspect that we might be 
using this bundle for some time? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 226 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I can get rid of the other two that I 
have got here for now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chairperson.  Yes, Chair.  B and 
C, 14B and C go together, Chair, and I am sorry, you do 
not have space there because the affidavit is in B, 14B and 
the annexures are in 14C. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can see, Ms Daniels, what they are 
doing to me. 
MS DANIELS:   Ja, it is terrible and this is quite complex, 
Mr Chair, you know, to navigate between the two, I do feel 
10 
sorry for you, I will try my level best to keep it simple. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Okay, I will keep all the files here.  
Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  So if I may just pick up on certain 
points in that memorandum of 23 October 2013 and this is 
under 
the 
heading 
Coal 
Quality, 
so 
that 
is 
quality 
specifications on – it is paragraph 4 and it tells – they first 
set out how you should impose a penalty in paragraph 4.2, 
4.2.1, 4.2.2 and so on.  So if you want to claim, that is 
Eskom, a penalty for coal that does not comply with 
20 
quality, you need to invoke those provisions.  So Eskom 
had failed to do so.  And then you go to paragraph 4.4, 
Chair, on page 985.  They say: 
“However, the apparent abolishment of Eskom’s 
rights…” 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 227 of 259 
 
And I think this is the abolishment was referring to.  Ms 
Daniels, you will explain that. 
“…to an outright rejection of payment for coal which 
fails to comply with the volatile quality parameter 
may well have been an unintended consequence of 
the amendment of the CSA.” 
Ms Daniels, are you able to explain that statement? 
MS DANIELS:   I will try to explain it in simply layman’s 
terms. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well, let me express my understanding 
10 
of it and you can comment on that. 
MS DANIELS:   Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The way I read it or understand it, it 
seems to me that the CSA was subsequently amended and 
with that amendment Eskom’s right to refuse to pay for 
coal that is noncompliant with quality specifications was 
abolished or it was deleted, taken away. 
MS DANIELS:   It was essentially with the first addendum 
it was taken away if Eskom did not follow the procedure set 
out as they are set in 4.3.  So yes, it was an unintended 
20 
consequence.  The reason for that, Mr Chair, was that in a 
previous arbitration we – Eskom lost the case because the 
arbitrator felt that we could not not pay for coal that we 
had burnt because it had already gone through – because 
the issue here is that the quality results would only 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 228 of 259 
 
become known once Eskom had burnt the coal, you know, 
it has gone through the power station.  So the argument 
was that we had had benefit of using the coal even if it was 
at a lower grade but we had burnt the coal and therefore 
we had gotten value for it and we ought to pay for it.    
 
And in the first addendum, that was the reasoning 
that led us to put the sliding scale for qualities.  Volatility 
is one of those issues that it needs to allow the coal to 
ignite and spark and this was an unintended consequence 
that the attorneys picked up but in the overall picture, it 
10 
was not really an abolition the penalty regime because we 
more equitable for both supplier and Eskom.  That was the 
rationale at the time.  And I think these are the problems 
that the attorneys picked up as the application of that 
provision. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, that is – it is hard to follow that 
explanation.  Anyway, they say it may well have been an 
unintended consequence.  Then they go further to say: 
“The nature of the volatiles of coal is that should it 
exceed the prescribed range contemplated in clause 
20 
4.4.1 of part 2 of schedule 1 to the CSA it is 
relatively incombustible and of no or little use to 
Eskom.  That being the case, Eskom may want to 
consider bringing a claim for the rectification of the 
CSA and addenda in order to ensure that the 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 229 of 259 
 
intention of the parties is correctly portrayed.  As 
the CSA with the first addendum thereto currently 
stands, Eskom’s remedy for coal which does not 
meet the volatiles quality parameter is limited to the 
payment reduction contemplated in clause 3.6 of 
the first addendum and the other remedies provided 
(specific performance) therein.” 
Then they go on to say: 
“Provided that Eskom has evidence of the people 
who negotiated the first addendum available to 
10 
prove their common mistake and that the arbitrator 
shall rectify the common mistake of the parties.” 
Now there are two things.  Firstly, it is whether if the 
amendment brought about an unintended consequence, the 
attorneys are saying you will have to bring people who 
negotiated that amendment to come and show that this was 
indeed a common mistake between the parties in order for 
you to succeed with a rectification  Is that a correct 
understanding? 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You will need the evidence of the 
people who negotiated.  On the other hand, they say: 
“The 
remedy 
available 
to 
you 
under 
the 
circumstance, in the present circumstances, is what 
is contemplated in clause 3.6.” 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 230 of 259 
 
Which they set out in paragraph 4.2 in the previous page.  
Is that correct? 
MS DANIELS:   I am just reading.  Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  And then in terms of clause 3.6 
this is what Eskom needed to do. 
“4.2.1 In the event that any quality parameter is not 
met 
for 
a 
three 
day 
rolling 
period 
no 
adjustment shall be made to the purchase 
price.” 
So you paid a full purchase price. 
10 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct, even if there was an 
issue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:   With any of the quality parameters but this 
would imply that Eskom kept proper records. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see.  That is the first three day rolling 
period. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Let us go to the next one. 
“4.2.2 In the event that any quality parameter is not 
20 
met for a four day rolling period…” 
So in the period of four days. 
“…you have failed to meet the quality spec 
then Eskom shall only pay 90% of the 
purchase price for such coal.” 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 231 of 259 
 
MS DANIELS:   That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But then again it requires you to 
monitor the situation. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, it requires – and that is why the 
integrity of the sampling process that you will see CDH 
talks about later on was so paramount because in order for 
this to work, Eskom would have to have records of daily if 
not hourly monitoring so that we could have a proper 
average. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes and it goes on like that to next 
10 
page, paragraph 4.2.3: 
“If after five days the supplier is supplying coal that 
does not need quality specification, then Eskom has 
an entitlement to pay only 75%.” 
And if it is a breach of six days then they only pay 50%.  If 
it is a breach over 7 days or more then it is calculated 
differently. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The purchase price shall be reduced to 
R1 per ton. 
20 
MS DANIELS:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is on quality, but Eskom had not 
done – invoked this clause. 
MS DANIELS:   No, it had not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And that red flag is raised way back in 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 232 of 259 
 
2013. 
MS DANIELS:   Yes it is and it is repeatedly raised in – 
well, it is consistently raised in CDH’s communication with 
Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So it is a bit of a technical 
territory and I am trying to move slowly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I understand, it needs …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Careful consideration. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Patience.  So, ja, no, no, that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is why I thought I would start with 
10 
the bottom line. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And then we go without the picture from 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  So that is on quality.  On sizing – 
that is quality specifications because there is two specs, 
Chair, we are dealing with here, there is quality and size.  
Size comes on page 986. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, that is: 
“Risk for Eskom.  On the imposition of payment 
reduction for coal which fails to comply with size 
and specification.   The risk for Eskom...” 
Now they are going to set out the risk and they say in 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 233 of 259 
 
paragraph 6: 
“One of the major concerns Eskom has raised is the 
apparent failure or refusal by OCM to supply and 
deliver to the Eskom Hendrina power station coal 
which complies with the average monthly size 
distribution contemplated in clause 3.4.3 of the first 
addendum to the CSA.   
The apparent failure, refusal by OCM to supply.  
Eskom has not imposed any penalty or payment 
reduction for the continued failure by OCM to 
10 
supply and deliver to it coal complying with the size 
and specification but now it intends to do so.  
However, during the past few months a number of 
issues of concern have been raised.  Should Eskom 
decide to impose the payment reduction for the 
period May 2012 to date, these concerns are inter 
alia the following: 
The credibility of the sample process used to 
analyse compliance with the sizing specification of 
the coal supplied and delivered to the Hendrina 
20 
power station by OCM which OCM has placed in 
dispute.” 
And Chairperson, then they explain and what is important 
is what you see on the next page, page 987.  That 
paragraph at the top of the page, I want to read – to 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 234 of 259 
 
capture it there where it says, the three lines to the bottom 
of it: 
“However, of concern for Eskom should be the 
statement made in its internal report titled Hendrina 
HEMA Sampler audit date 7 June 2013 as prepared 
by Mr Khulakane Dladla which records the following 
about the sampling process.  The HEMA Sampler 
misalignment is the major concern with regards to 
the reliability and representativeness of sample 
issues experienced with the HEMA sampler.  The 
10 
original equipment supplier must be contacted in 
order to repair the misalignment of the HEMA 
sampler.  The sampling system can then be audited 
again once this issue has been resolved.” 
Ms Daniels, can you explain that?  That concern? 
MS DANIELS:  In essence Eskom was not able to sample 
properly at that stage Mr Chairman.  It was defective, the 
sampling system.  So it was riddled with errors.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  So in, in other words whereas Eskom 
was now intending to charge or to impose a penalty for 
20 
quality that did not comply with sizing specification, Eskom 
had, or their attorneys were identifying that, but you do 
have a problem in that intention or in that pursuit, because 
your sampling process is not in order. 
MS DANIELS:  Well Mr Seleka, I would put it a little bit 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 235 of 259 
 
strongly if I remember what was happening at the time.  I 
think the, the sampling system, not that CDH was saying 
we have a problem. I think they were saying that we can’t 
actually prove our case.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see. 
MS DANIELS:  Until, until we fix the hammer sampling 
process, and that was an issue at the time, you know that 
we would actually not be able to prove reliably that the 
supplier failed to meet the sizing requirements.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Chairperson there is 
10 
still … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, I’m sorry.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Details. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ordinarily how would you prove that the 
sizing 
requirement 
had 
been 
met 
under, 
on 
normal 
circumstances? 
MS DANIELS:  Standard operating procedure Mr Chair, 
there would be a sampling process every, determined at a 
determined timing period.  This was on a conveyor into the, 
into the power station, so there would be samples taken at 
20 
different parts of the conveyor.   
That will then be taken to a lab and there would be, 
you know a composite sample tested.  And those results 
would be made available to both the supplier and to 
Eskom.  What was happening here was that the, the 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 236 of 259 
 
hammer sampler was not taking regular samples.   
It was not taking comparable samples, you know 
like for like sizes.  So the test results were always in 
dispute.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So the problem was that you, you had no 
records to prove the results of any testing that may have 
been done?  Or the testing … 
MS DANIELS:  Yes … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or the testing had not been done, hence 
you did not have the records? 
MS DANIELS:  Or if the testing was done, the records were 
faulty and not consistent.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was effectively Eskom’s own failure 
to do what they were supposed to do? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes, at that time and they … 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that time. 
20 
MS DANIELS:  Ja.  It was just, it was a mess if I can use 
that word. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ms Daniels where were you at the time 
of October 2013?   
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 237 of 259 
 
MS DANIELS:  I think I was in … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well … 
MS DANIELS:  The commercials.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is a very broad question.  What was 
your position at Eskom at the time? 
MS DANIELS:  I think I had moved from private energy to 
the office of the, the Group Executives or the Chief 
Commercial Officer.  So Family(?) Energy was one of the 
divisions.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So this, ja just go ahead.  I’ll ask you.   
MS DANIELS:  So ja, I had, Mr Chair the familiarity with 
some of the, you know the operational issues with Optimum 
is because Optimum was one of the first contracts that I 
managed when I got to Eskom in 2006.  So when it was 
first sold to I be it BHT Billiton to Optimum, I managed the 
due diligence process.   
So I do have a little bit more insight than what is 
normally, what’s the word?  Expect of like a lawyer or 
something, because I worked on the operational side at 
20 
that time.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  Chair there’s seven more 
points and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You will tell me how much detail should 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 238 of 259 
 
be laid on the table here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well continue, let’s see. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that’s the on specific sizing stack, 
that’s the first concern under 7.1.  Then you go to 7.2 the 
attorneys are raising another point of concern.  And they 
say the contingent by OCM is on page 987.   
The 
contingent 
by 
OCM 
that 
the 
sizing 
specifications contemplated by the first addendum is no 
10 
longer properly N/O realistically representative of the coal 
which the OCM Colliery could reasonably be expected to 
achieve from exploiting the coal deposits constituting the 
Optimum Colliery.   
Ms Daniel are you able to explain that?   
MS DANIELS:  What, what it meant was Mr Chair is that 
the sizing specifications as set out in the first addendum, 
the supplier could no longer meet.   
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
So 
is 
it 
an 
impossibility 
of 
performance? 
20 
MS DANIELS:  It is, that’s the legal term, that’s correct Mr 
Seleka.  What that then meant is in terms of the 
agreement, the parties needed to renegotiate the sizing 
specification.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which is what? 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 239 of 259 
 
MS DANIELS:  And during that … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry, I interrupted you.  Proceed. 
MS DANIELS:  And during that period then the sizing price 
reduction formula would not be applied.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  And we see the re-negotiation on 
the next page.  Page 988 paragraph 7.2.2. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So it this … 
MS DANIELS:  So … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Let me read it.   
10 
“Eskom and OCM are also currently re-negotiating 
the sizing specification.  Should Eskom impose the 
payment reduction, this could potentially be used 
against Eskom should it be established during a 
dispute resolution process relating to the sizing in 
the 
re-negotiation, 
that 
it 
is 
not 
realistically 
possible for OCM to supply and deliver the size in 
specification contemplated by the first addendum.” 
 
You may comment. 
MS DANIELS:  That is what I was talking about.  So during 
20 
that, during that period when there was the re-negotiation, 
that, those provisions that the, that you read out earlier Mr 
Seleka would not apply. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see.   
MS DANIELS:  That is how it written in the first addendum. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 240 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Then there is paragraph 7.3, 7.4 
and 7.5 which raises further concerns.  7.3 says: 
“The risk that should Eskom set off the payment 
reduction for OCM’s apparent failure to comply with 
the size in specification, OCM will attempt to 
terminate the CSA on the basis that Eskom is not 
entitled to impose the prepayment reduction inter 
alia for the following reasons:  The sampling 
process used to determine the payment reduction is 
not credible.” 
10 
 
And I think this goes back to the Henwa sampling 
tool. 
MS DANIELS:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
MS DANIELS:  So combined, combining that, that we did 
not have a credible sampling process, with the fact that we 
are now re-negotiating the sizing issue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  Meant that Eskom could actually not apply 
the payment reduction provisions in the contract.  And what 
20 
CDH is saying is that this would give the supplier, if in the 
event that we should apply the payment reduction penal – 
you know mechanisms, that it could lead to the supplier 
cancelling the contract.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  I think you’ve touched on both 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 241 of 259 
 
7.3.1 and 7.3.2.  And if you are busy re-negotiating, why 
would you settle, deduct, when they say that would be a 
bona fide conduct? I mean a mala fide. 
MS DANIELS:  Mala fide …[indistinct] conduct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That’s right, not justified, not bona fide. 
MS DANIELS:  And that also, that also lead to the double 
counting that you referred to earlier Mr Seleka.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Then 7.4 says: 
“The risk that the payment reduction could be 
deemed as an excessive penalty stipulation in terms 
10 
of the Conventional Penalties Act, 15 of 1962.  No 
documents have been provided which reflects the 
financial loss or damage to Eskom to date.  Or in 
the medium to long term as a result of OCM’s 
failure to comply with the sizing specification.” 
 
Well that speaks for itself, isn’t it? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. That, that is what I was trying to 
explain earlier with the earlier arbitrations that we had, 
where the arbitrators would say, but you can’t prove 
damage to your power station, yet you have burnt the coal.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  7.5 says: 
“Eskom 
has 
waived 
its 
rights 
to 
impose 
and 
subsequently enforce the payment reduction for 
certain of the months OCM failed to supply and 
deliver 
coal 
which 
complies 
with 
the 
sizing 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 242 of 259 
 
specification due to Eskom failure to inform OCM of 
the 
payment 
reduction 
and 
calculation 
thereof 
timorously as required by the terms and conditions 
of the SCA that with the addendum.” 
 
I think that too speaks for itself. 
MS DANIELS:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That concludes the concerns in regard 
to sizing specification.  Now back to that background 
Chairperson I sought to paint, the penalty for sizing was a 
huge amount of that 2,1 billion.  It was a huge amount.  1,4 
10 
Billion.   
And because of these reasons Eskom could not 
pursue, pursue that line.  But what it means is, Ms Daniels, 
this claim could never been pursued in the first place.   
MS DANIELS:  Mr Chairman, that is, that is correct.  It, it 
was essentially a paper exercise.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the purpose being? 
MS DANIELS:  Well I think the purpose here was to, as we 
came to know is to ultimately put pressure on Glencore to 
20 
renegotiate the contract.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought that … 
MS DANIELS:  At that stage.  At that stage it was 
Glencore.  Glencore had come with – because they owned 
Optimum at that stage. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 243 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought that you didn’t want Eskom 
didn’t want Glencore, didn’t want a renegotiation.  They 
wanted to pin Glencore down to the terms of the agreement 
or is that much later?  Is this at a different time. 
MS DANIELS:  This was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was a different time.  I may, I may have 
missed something.  I know that … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Glencore sought renegotiation of the coal 
price in terms of the agreement and during, or that was 
10 
during, well even before Mr Brian Molefe arrived, but when 
he arrived he was rigid that that would not happen.  And he 
admits that.  So that’s not the time you are talking about.   
MS DANIELS:  My, my apology Mr Chair.  I made a mistake 
with the timing sequence.  This is, this is, this is 2013. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  When this first opinion was, was arrive, 
arrived at.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  In this time there was still the cooperation 
20 
agreement being negotiated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS DANIELS:  That still, I think it’s just to put into context. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 244 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS DANIELS:  At this point in time there was still a good 
relationship with the supplier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS DANIELS:  But the supplier had already indicated 
hardship 
which 
was 
one 
of 
the 
provisions 
in 
this 
cooperation negotiations.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS DANIELS:  And this is why this, these issues were 
asked, asked of the attorneys to a final.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Indeed Chair.  The corporation 
agreement was concluded on the 23 r d of May 2014, so the 
following year … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So the corporation agreement was 
concluded.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which gets to be terminated only in 
2015.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But what precisely did Eskom in 2013 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 245 of 259 
 
want the renegotiations to, of the agreement to be about 
Ms Daniels? 
MS DANIELS:  From my understanding Mr Chair, it was the 
coal, the coal quality issues were raising its head again, 
notwithstanding the amendments to the contract in terms of 
the first addendum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS DANIELS:  And the supplier already was having issues, 
meeting the sizing which was a big issue for Eskom.  And 
that is where this, where this, these issues started.   
10 
But I must give you context that this has always 
been 
an 
issue 
with 
Optimum 
and 
it 
required 
close 
management from both parties’ sides. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chairperson I see its 
about 18:10.  Should I pace myself to finish by 18:30? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Or to stop? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let’s, let’s, well put it this way, if you are 
not done at 18:30 and there are still important issues … 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can look at adjourning for the day 
and then finding another hour or whatever.  If Ms Daniels 
would make the time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 246 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sure she would make it, it’s a 
question of what date. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am aware that on Tuesday I’ve got an 
evening session, but I don’t know whether you and I 
already made any arrangements for an evening session on 
Monday.  And if we haven’t subject to Ms Daniels being 
available, we could try and finish with her on Monday.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, the, the Monday witness is Mr Koko 
Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you think we might need to go into the 
evening with him? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We can put anybody in the evening. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hey? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We can put anybody in the evening.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It’s a huge risk.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But, but we could try and find some time 
20 
one of the evenings next week.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  [Indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does that sound … 
MS DANIELS:  That will be okay. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 247 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  More or less still fine with you Ms 
Daniels? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes Mr Chair, that will be … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS DANIELS:  In order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  So I think let’s continue 
until 18:30. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then we can adjourn and continue on 
some evening next week. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Yes Chair.  I will tell …[indistinct].  
So Ms Daniels then those are the concerns … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I wanted to ask you Mr Seleka was 
whether there was, you were moving away from that 
opinion 
without 
going 
to 
the 
conclusion 
thereof 
deliberately? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No.  I’m not moving away yet.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I thought … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought you were moving away, okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  There is, there is the last point on 
quantity specification.  The last point on quantity.  Ms 
Daniels that is raised immediately after paragraph 7.5.  
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 248 of 259 
 
You see the heading in respect of coal quantity? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes, that’s correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You see that.  But what they do first, 
paragraph 8, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 to 8.4 they set out the terms of 
the contract.  And the concerns are raised on the next 
page, page 989 under the heading, conveyor availability 
dispute.  Paragraph 8.5 then reads: 
“Eskom’s rights to impose a penalty for short supply 
of coal has also been disputed by OCM on the basis 
that Eskom is not entitled to impose a penalty for a 
10 
short 
supply 
due 
to 
the 
unavailability 
of 
the 
conveyor system operated by Eskom.” 
 
8.5.1: 
“OCM contends that its failure to supply and deliver 
the required quantity of coal per month is directly 
linked 
to 
the 
unscheduled 
stoppages 
of 
the 
conveyor system by Eskom.  Eskom has disputed, 
obviously a mis-contention, that unavailability of the 
conveyors is directly as a result of Eskom’s conduct 
and reserved it’s rights to claim the penalty pending 
20 
the finalisation of the dispute relating to the 
conveyor availability.” 
 
It will need to be considered, paragraph 8.6: 
“It will need to be considered whether the dispute 
relating to the conveyor availability should be 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 249 of 259 
 
joined with the hardship arbitration and future 
disputes relating to the entitlement of Eskom to 
impose the payment reduction.” 
 
Ms Daniels I’ve had the benefit of going through all 
of this memos and all the way to the end of the settlement.  
And I have struggled to find a penalty being pursued by 
Eskom in regard to short supply.  Your comment? 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Seleka based on what I have seen from 
the documentation, Eskom in the first instance reduced the 
supply, the quantity in the first addendum to not the 5,5 
10 
million tons.  It was reduced.  There is a figure in there.   
And the – always the issues around the conveyor 
availability made this very difficult for Eskom to actually 
impose the penalties.  If not impossible, because it was 
always in, on the back foot in terms of it not performing 
100 percent.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes because, well that’s fine.  But you 
will recall from the settlement that ultimately the penalty 
that was pursued and on the basis of which a settlement 
was concluded, related only to quality.  I don’t know 
20 
whether you can recall offhand.   
MS DANIELS:  I can’t recall offhand.  I would just have to 
look, but quality, that was the only aspect that we could 
actually prove on a balance of probabilities.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  And Chair I can, the conclusion 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 250 of 259 
 
then comes, follows after that.  And it’s a summary of what 
we have traversed …[indistinct].  Should I read it to the 
record Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well not necessarily. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not necessary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You don’t think there’s anything in 
dispute? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For your purposes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, I think the points raised in the body 
10 
of the memorandum covers the issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which are then summarised in the 
conclusion.  So let’s go back to Mr Moodley’s affidavit.  
And at paragraph 22 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you going back to … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  To the affidavit Chair which is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where does it … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In 14(b).  At the end of 14(b).  page, for 
your purposes Ms Daniels is page 891.   
20 
MS DANIELS:  Thank you Mr Seleka.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  We were at paragraph 22.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You, so you say you are going to 
Bundle? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  14(b). 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 251 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  14(b). 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 8 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Moodley’s affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And paragraph 22 you say? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  22 Yes.  Which is on page 89.  891.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  So we had read the first 
part of the paragraph until see item 11 of the bundle, which 
is what we were reading.  But let me read it again. 
10 
 
“So during October 2013 CDH prove …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that you are going back to this 
affidavit at 19 minutes passed.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you think we can make use of the next 
12 minutes or 11 minutes effectively we can continue.  I’m 
thinking just in case you are starting something that might 
be better started when we would have more time.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if we can make use of it, we can 
make use of it.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  I hear the Chairperson.  I think I will 
end with this paragraph. 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 252 of 259 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because the next thing is the second 
opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no that’s fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And that reply has a time of its own. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, not then that’s fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So the paragraph, let me just read this.  
It said: 
“During October 2013 CDH provided a legal opinion 
to Eskom relating to the potential penalty claim on 
10 
the sizing quality parameters under the CSA and 
addendum 
thereto 
including 
our 
preliminary 
concerns relating to the evidence which would be 
necessary for such a claim to succeed.” 
 
And then they refer us to that opinion which we’ve 
read.  Ms Daniels, you follow? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I am following. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  “Pursuant to this advice an  
extensive exercise was embarked upon in order to 
consider 
and 
review 
the 
methodology 
Eskom 
20 
needed 
to 
apply 
or 
should 
have 
applied 
in 
calculating the penalties for various coal quality 
parameters under the CSA.  The reason being that 
Eskom itself was unclear as to how the penalty 
regime contained in the first addendum to the coal 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 253 of 259 
 
supply agreement should be applied.”  
 
You see that? 
MS DANIELS:  Yes I see that.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  So it begs the question, how does one 
then adamantly say, or forcefully say OCM needed to pay 
us 2,17 billion rand?  When you as the claimant don’t even 
know how to arrive at the amount?  Do you have a 
comment? 
MS DANIELS:  Mr Seleka and Mr Chair, this was in 2015 
and the decision was made, the Executives did not listen to 
10 
any reason, they were determined to go ahead and 
notwithstanding these flaws which actually did not get any 
better they persisted with the claim and actually I think 
excluded for the time period even the internal legal 
department from the discussions with the supplier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not sure if I understand that.  Mr 
Seleka’s question is how do you proceed or pursue a claim 
against somebody in circumstances where you are not 
clear as to how to apply the agreement on which the claim 
is based, I think that is the question. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the least that can be expected is that 
if you pursue a claim based on an agreement you know at 
least, you should know how to apply that agreement, or 
that claim in terms of the agreement, so if you pursue it in 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 254 of 259 
 
circumstances where you are anti how to apply it, it is – it 
calls for an explanation, why do you – how do you do that. 
MS DANIELS:   But you would have to ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you able to throw light on that? 
MS DANIELS:   I am not able to throw light on that Mr 
Chair because I was not there at the time but you would 
have to ask Mr Molefe and Mr Koko for the basis on which 
they made those decisions, because you will see from the 
evidence that you know the advice did not change, and you 
will see later on that ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Mr Molefe was not there, or maybe 
Mr Koko, 2013 Mr Molefe was not there isn’t it? 
MS DANIELS:   Ja, but what happened in 2013 you will 
remember they did try and do the cooperation negotiations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS DANIELS:   That was from 2014 onwards.  So there 
was work done and they went into Primary Energy and 
Glencore, Eskom and Glencore went into these discussions 
and they were quite extensive, and that is how they ended 
up with the increased price. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, so to explain it properly Ms 
Daniels you will say yeah or nay to this, so Chair in 2013 
the parties are still negotiating what culminates into an 
agreement in 2014.   
 
There is no claim yet but CDH is engaged to advise 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 255 of 259 
 
on what is potentially a claim.  The agreement is meant for 
the parties to cooperate, to reach a commercial amicable 
agreement going forward.  That agreement, which would 
have then changed the main agreement between the 
parties, the co-supply agreement, was terminated after Mr 
Molefe comes there, and that is when the penalties then 
are sought to be enforced, and that happens the 22 n d of 
June 2015.  
 
And so then that question arises given all this 
information, given to you already in October 2013 how do 
10 
you with a clear mind, a clear conscience pursue the claim 
when this information is already given, and that question 
arises at that stage, and on that note Chair I think I will 
pause there, because we will then be going into the second 
leg of this exercise, which is just as detailed as the first 
one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would you estimate that we might need 
an hour or two hours? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Two hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Two hours? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Two hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, and would it not be better 
that Ms Daniels should have completed her evidence 
before certain witnesses testify such as Mr Brian Molefe?   
Or 
not 
necessarily? 
 
 
I 
am 
thinking 
about 
– 
not 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 256 of 259 
 
necessarily? 
ADV SELEKA SC: I think not necessarily Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that’s fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    I have an ...[indistinct] with that, but 
because of the opinions which we rely on in Mr Moodley’s 
affidavit, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that is fine.  The missing pages 
from one of the bundles that we were talking about, I would 
be glad if ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair it is sorted. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is sorted? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is sorted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So okay, alright, so if that can be 
included in the bundle then as soon as we adjourn and 
then registrar I would like you to make sure that the 
protectors will know which bundle that is, so that they can 
show it to me later on which bundle that one is, which had 
missing pages, which will now be inserted I guess. 
 
I do suspect now that I did take out the missing 
pages to read and sometimes and I suspect they were not 
20 
taken back and I should have them at home, but because 
they have been prepared they can be put in, I may have 
made some notes on those ones, if so I will just replace 
them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will check your volume.  Chairperson 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 257 of 259 
 
may I bring to our attention the following in regard to Mr 
Anoj Singh? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, he has brought an application or is 
bringing an application for a postponement, I saw the email 
during the lunch time so they have printed out a copy for 
me.  The Chair will remember that he is scheduled to 
testify on the 3 r d of March which is next week Wednesday, 
so maybe we need some direction in regard whether they 
should 
come 
to 
argue 
this 
application 
before 
the 
Chairperson, because summons were issued for him to 
10 
appear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, well they will have to do that, and it 
might be late, it shouldn’t be handed on the day he is 
supposed to be here, it should be handed in before so if 
it’s granted maybe the date can be used for another 
witness, but I will read the application, I am not aware of it 
yet, or it has not been lodged, or it has been lodged? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It has been ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh it is still on the way? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    No it is here, I can hand up a hard 
20 
copy Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no don’t hand it up, it must be sent 
to me in the other way other than handing it up. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay next week I am hearing – 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 258 of 259 
 
continuing with Eskom related evidence and the witnesses 
that are lined up, who is testifying on Monday? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is Mr Koko. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Koko, Tuesday? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Brian Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and Wednesday is supposed to be 
Mr Anoj Singh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Anoj Singh and Thursday is Ms 
Janke Goodson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and Friday is Ms Brown, the former 
10 
Minister? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I think Eskom is only four days 
next week. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that so?   Is there another day when 
Ms Brown is being scheduled – I had the impression she 
would be in March. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I am not aware yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright.  Okay that’s fine so 
that will have to be done, she will have to be scheduled to 
give evidence before us, she has to deal with some 
20 
important issues. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So after next week if all the witnesses 
that are lined up for next week they are all done you would 
be left with Ms Brown and how many others? 
26 FEBRUARY 2021 – DAY 351 
 
Page 259 of 259 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There is Minister Zwane as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh and Minister Zwane. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which we intend calling. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Romeo Kumalo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the Chairperson has made a 
request for – well it has to be finalised with you Chair, Mr 
Eric Woods, Mohamed Bobat. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh ja, ja, ja, okay no that’s fine. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so just for the public so next week 
we will be hearing, we will be continuing with Eskom 
related evidence.   Okay, we are going to adjourn so Ms 
Daniels the legal team will be in touch with you with regard 
to an evening session next week. 
MS DANIELS:   Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, thank you very much, we adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.
