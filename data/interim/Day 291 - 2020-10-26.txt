PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 26 OCTOBER 2020 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Good 
morning 
Mr 
Kennedy, 
good 
morning everybody. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is everybody ready? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I am here with the rest of my team, 
Ms Carol Sibiya and Ms Refilwe Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like with the mask on I might not 
10 
hear you very well – unless your raise your voice. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I am sorry if I was faint.  I am 
appearing together with the rest of the legal team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  For the Denel stream – Ms Carole 
Sibiya. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And Ms Refilwe Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that – that is fine.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  May we proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do – do you want to give me and the 
public a little bit of context and background to this week’s 
evidence? 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 4 of 142 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes thank you Chair.  Chair you will 
recall that this commission heard various evidence to a 
differently composed legal team some considerable time 
ago – I believe it was the end of 2018 and early 2019 when 
you heard evidence from various other witnesses.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And they raised issues which need to 
be taken further in the evidence that we will lead for the 
whole of this week and the few days in November that have 
also been allocated this stream of the commission’s work.   
10 
Some of the issues that were raised particularly in 
the evidence of Mr Saloojee on the previous occasion are 
the subject of various affidavits that have been obtained 
from other witnesses some of which casts some blame on 
Mr Saloojee or put a different perspective.  
So some of the witnesses that we will seek to – with 
your – with your leave in due course to – we will deal with 
issues that Mr Saloojee raised.  And because some of them 
make allegations that implicate or criticise him he has been 
scheduled to respond to those aspects at the end of the 
20 
session in November. 
 
Now Chair you will recall that some of the issues 
that were raised in evidence previously related to the 
suspension of Mr Saloojee as the then Group CEO of Denel 
and two of his colleagues the Chief Financial Officer and 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 5 of 142 
 
the Company Secretary Ms Africa.   
And some of our witnesses will deal with that 
aspect.  In fact the first witness that we propose with your 
leave to call will be Ms Mandindi who was then a member 
of the board of Denel which took the decision to – to deal 
with Mr Saloojee and his colleagues as well as other 
matters that came before the board when she was a 
member of that board. 
 
Chair the second witness that we have provisionally 
lined up for your approval is Ms Hlahla who is the current 
10 
board Chairperson and she will deal briefly in her evidence 
with steps that have been taken by the current board to 
deal with allegations of impropriety and corruption.  Some 
steps that have taken in relation to disciplining of staff, 
steps to deal with the operational and financial difficulties 
that Denel has been and is still facing. 
 
Chair other witness whom we propose to call will 
take forward issues that were raised on the previous 
occasion as well as others which may not have been raised 
previously but appear to be relevant to the work of the 
20 
commission and its Terms of Reference particularly relating 
to procurement issues and whether compliance – there was 
compliance with procurement processes.  But which also 
have been alleged to involve individuals who have been 
implicated in relation to allegations of state capture 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 6 of 142 
 
including Mr Salim Essa in particular and the Gupta 
brothers and others. 
 
And 
you 
will 
hear 
evidence 
relating 
to 
some 
disagreements between members of management within 
Denel and its operating divisions as to the wisdom of 
various business ventures such as contracts that were 
awarded – three contracts that were awarded to the 
company VR Laser and whether that followed proper 
processes – whether those were lawfully done – whether 
they were done for good business reason – the financial 
10 
implications that flowed from them and whether they have 
any bearing on state capture allegations. 
 
Then too there will be other transactions that will 
the subject of some of the witnesses such as the Asian 
venture where there was a Joint Venture again with VR 
Laser to develop business in Asia and particularly India.  
And again whether that was done for good reason; done 
through good process and whether state capture issues 
and personalities are implicated in that evidence. 
 
Chair I believe that – that is obviously a very board 
20 
outline overview of where we propose to go. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But with your leave may we then 
unless you wish to raise anything for clarity – may we then 
proceed to call our first witness? 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 7 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no let us proceed. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is Ms Mandindi he? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Please stand up Ms Mandindi.  Do 
you take an oath or do you do an affirmation? 
MS MANDINDI:  I take an oath Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You take an oath.  Okay – do you have – 
10 
or rather let us start with you placing your full names on 
record. 
MS MANDINDI:  Nonyameko Mandindi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Do you have any objection to taking 
the prescribed oath? 
MS MANDINDI:  No Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you consider the oath binding on your 
conscience? 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If so please raise your right hand and 
20 
say, no, no, no I think I am getting this wrong.  I have not 
done it in a long time.  Let us start afresh.  Do you have 
any objection to taking the prescribed oath? 
MS MANDINDI:  No Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you consider the oath binding on your 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 8 of 142 
 
conscience? 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you swear that you are going to speak 
the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the truth? 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please raise your right hand and say, so 
help me God. 
MS MANDINDI:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Thank 
you. 
 
You 
may 
sit 
down.  
Somebody else normally does this so I have to do it from 
10 
my head.  But I think I – ultimately I got it right.  Thank 
you.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Morning Ms 
Mandindi. 
MS MANDINDI:  Good morning Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Ms Mandindi you have provided an 
affidavit to the commission, is that correct? 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes I have. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Chair the affidavit is to be found in 
the Denel Bundle 01 as Exhibit W8. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I have got it.  Thank you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  And the affidavit for the 
record appears from page number Denel 01003.  Ms 
Mandindi when I – when I ask you questions and refer you 
to page numbers or you give me page numbers of your 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 9 of 142 
 
affidavit can we please look at the black letters on the top 
left rather than the red letters on the top right. 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes it is okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and Ms Mandindi he will just say 
page 3 for example not 003 but then you would know 3, 4, 
5, 6, 12 and so on. 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Ms Mandindi is it correct you have 
had a consultation with us as the legal team as well and 
10 
we have been through your statement and ask you for 
clarification of certain issues? 
MS MANDINDI:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And do you confirm that you are 
satisfied with the correctness of what is set out in your 
affidavit? 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes I am satisfied. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right may we now have regard to only 
the particular areas that we will want to focus on today.  
Just to look at your background.  You were a non… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Kennedy does she confirm 
that that is her signature at page 9? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  I beg your pardon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that your signature at page 9 Ms 
Mandindi of your affidavit? 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 10 of 142 
 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is.  And you confirm the content of this 
affidavit to be true and correct to the best of your 
knowledge and belief? 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Would you like me to admit it Mr 
Kennedy as Exhibit W8? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes please Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit of Ms Nonyameko Mandindi 
will be admitted as Exhibit W8.  Thank you. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Mandindi you 
describe yourself as a quantity surveyor by profession and 
qualification?  Is that correct? 
MS MANDINDI:  That is correct, that is my profession. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But you – it appears that you have 
had experience also in managerial positions; executives 
positions? 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes over time I have progressed more into 
management and leadership roles. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  May I ask you to just raise your 
voice. 
MS MANDINDI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe do not speak too far from the 
microphone. 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 11 of 142 
 
MS MANDINDI:  That will be good? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
MS MANDINDI:  Thank you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And you have – is it correct that you 
have served on various boards? 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes that is correct I have. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Could you give a few examples?  
Whose board do you currently serve on? 
MS MANDINDI:  I am currently serving on the – on two 
private sector boards – listed boards Hyprop and Hudaco – 
10 
Hudaco Industries. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And have you served previously on 
other boards apart from those entities and Denel 
MS MANDINDI:  I have served on public sector boards 
PRASA, when it was still SARCC.  I served on Propnet 
which is a subsidiary of Transnet.  I have served on Inter 
Sight board.  So I have in the public sector as well. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And you mention in paragraph 4 on 
page 2 of your affidavit that you have also had involvement 
working 
on 
various 
infrastructure 
projects 
such 
as 
20 
Gautrain, Monte Casino, Sandton and Durban convention 
centres etcetera. 
MS MANDINDI:  Ja that is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  What sort of work did that involve 
very briefly? 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 12 of 142 
 
MS MANDINDI:  Predominantly project management and 
quantity surveying involvements Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now let us get to Denel is it correct 
that you were a non-executive director for a period of 
Denel SOC Limited? 
MS MANDINDI:  That is correct non-executive. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Who appointed you Ms Mandindi? 
MS MANDINDI:  It was Minister Lynne Brown; the Minister 
of Public Enterprises at the time. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And when did your appointment take 
10 
effect? 
MS MANDINDI:  The appointed was in May 2015 and the 
induction was around July 2015. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So your induction was in July 2015? 
MS MANDINDI:  That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Can you recall when the first board 
meeting was when you attended – which you attended after 
going through the induction process? 
MS MANDINDI:  It was shortly after the induction Chair.  I 
would need to verify the exact date.  So it would have been 
20 
towards the end of July or early August 2015. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Are you still a member of the 
board? 
MS MANDINDI:  No Chair I resigned in July 2016. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  2016 so you were there basically for a 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 13 of 142 
 
year? 
MS MANDINDI:  Just about. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now you deal with the 
circumstances relating to her appointment that I am not 
going to go through here in oral evidence.  They are before 
the commission – Chair now that he has submitted the – 
the entire statement.  I would like to get to two particular 
aspects relating to decisions of the board and your 
knowledge of the relative facts in that regard.  Who was 
the Chairperson of the board to which you were appointed 
10 
by Minister Brown? 
MS MANDINDI:  It was Mr Daniel Mantsha – Lugisani 
Mantsha. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now the first of the topics that we 
would like to draw to the attention of the Chair today is the 
actions of the board including yourself in relation to the 
suspension of the executive such as Mr Riaz Saloojee.  
Now in your paragraph 15 you refer to a second board 
meeting where you were asked to have your cell phones 
stored etcetera and can you recall roughly when that 
20 
second board meeting took place? 
MS MANDINDI:  Chair I would have to confirm that.  I do 
not have the exact date of [talking over one another]. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Just give a rough estimate? 
MS MANDINDI:  Roughly it would have been…. 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 14 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe the month? 
MS MANDINDI:  Towards the end of August/September. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Towards 
the 
end 
of 
August 
early 
September? 
MS MANDINDI:  Early September. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And you indicate that Mr Mantsha 
asked that all the board members explained that they hand 
in their cell phones to be stored during the meeting. 
MS MANDINDI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then you refer in paragraph 16 
10 
two issues being raised in the meeting of the board that 
had not been part of the board pack did you raise those 
issues or did your colleagues? 
MS MANDINDI:  One of the colleagues raised a question 
around property in a meeting where there was nothing 
relating to the property portfolio in the board pack so that 
sort of took me aback because there was nothing tabled 
about that.  And you sort of wonder how did they know the 
details on the property side of the business.  But of course 
you also recognise that some board members may be more 
20 
informed than others.  So – but it was something that took 
me aback a little bit. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now that issue seems to have 
arisen… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Kennedy. 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 15 of 142 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you talk about the second board 
meeting where this happened is that a second meeting – 
the first board meeting after the induction or there was an 
induction then another board meeting which would have 
been the first and then the second? 
MS MANDINDI:  Ja.  It was – actually my statement says 
around the second board meeting.  It could have been the 
second or the third.  It was after the induction Chair 
specifically [Chair talking over Ms Mandindi]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the induction you do not refer to it as 
a board meeting? 
MS MANDINDI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just an induction. 
MS MANDINDI:  It was just an induction session. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Okay.  Thank you Mr 
Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Mandindi you 
then deal in paragraph 17 with another meeting that 
followed either the third or fourth board meeting and again 
20 
are you – can you be sure now as it whether it was the 
third or the fourth or give us a date or is it still 
approximate? 
MS MANDINDI:  It is still approximate.  Chair let me just 
mention that we were handed tablets and most of the board 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 16 of 142 
 
information went to the tablets to the company tablets.  So 
when I resigned those tablets were handed back to – to the 
company.  So when I do not have exact information it is 
because it did not come through my channels in which case 
I would have the ability to go back and verify the 
information.  So I do apologise if I am approximating some 
of the information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I assume Mr Kennedy that the 
reason why there is not much about the first board meeting 
is maybe because there is nothing relative to us that 
10 
happened in that meeting? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Its relevance was only to indicate a 
background to concerns about items being presented. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  To board members for discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  In those meetings without it being 
part of the pack. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And as it would be taken by surprise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Let us get to the third or fourth board 
meeting.  In fact I see in your affidavit you do give a date 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 17 of 142 
 
for that.  That is the 23 September 2015 and that was – 
that was scheduled to discuss the – it was a special board 
meeting and the purpose was to discuss the LSSA deal. 
MS MANDINDI:  Hm. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now just in a sentence or two if you 
would please Ms Mandindi was that the only purpose for 
the special board meeting as you recall? 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes Chair the proposed – because in that 
meeting it was proposed that we would have a special 
board meeting around the 23 r d and to discuss that – that 
10 
specific transaction.  And the reason was it was fairly 
urgent that it be concluded and discussed.  So hence it 
had to fall in between the board meeting – scheduled board 
meeting dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does – does this mean that with regard 
to the second meeting your suggestion and maybe the 
suggestion of other board members that the issue that was 
sought to be discussed that had not been part of the board 
pack your suggestion the it should not be discussed was 
accepted? 
20 
MS MANDINDI:  Which paragraph are you referring to 
Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see at paragraph 16 you say: 
“During this board meeting questions were 
raised by certain board members on issues 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 18 of 142 
 
which were not part of the board pack.  As 
someone 
who 
reads 
board 
packs 
meticulously I pointed out that such issues 
cannot be discussed because it was not in 
the board pack.” 
 
And then after that you go to the third or fourth 
board meeting. 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am just saying does it mean that 
that was accepted so issues which were not part of the 
10 
pack was – were not discussed? 
MS MANDINDI:  It was noted Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MS MANDINDI:  It was noted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you – Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Mandindi it then 
appears from your affidavit that you did not go straight into 
the board meeting at the – at the due time because there 
was a meeting in progress of the ARC Committee – the 
Audit and Risk Committee and you had to wait. 
20 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes we did.  Yes we did have to wait for 
the meeting to start because the – the Audit and Risk 
Committee session was still in progress when we arrived. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then it refers to a discussion 
between you and Mr Mantsha the Chair that happened in 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 19 of 142 
 
his office.  Was that before the board meeting actually 
convened? 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes it was Chair.  The – the Audit and Risk 
Committee meeting delayed so we were waiting outside for 
over an hour.  So the chairman called me into his office to 
just give me a briefing of why there was a delay effectively. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And did he indicate to you why – what 
the ARC was having to discuss before the board meeting 
could convene? 
MS MANDINDI:  He just mentioned that there were some 
10 
issues and concerns with the CEO that the ARC meeting 
was discussing before we start with the board meeting.  
But he did not specify what those concerns would have 
been. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well at the time that he was speaking to 
you did he limit the concerns to the CEO and CFO or were 
there other people that he said they were concerned 
about? 
MS MANDINDI:  No he just mentioned the CEO according 
to my recollection Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MANDINDI:  He was just explaining why the meeting 
was delayed.  He was not pre-briefing me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes. 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 20 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then your statement says that: 
“The concerns that he said were being 
discussed related to assertions by the Audit 
Committee that there was misinformation 
and 
inadequate 
detail 
in 
information 
provided.” 
 
Did you know what that related to? 
MS MANDINDI:  No not the misinformation and inadequate 
information recall the LSA SAA transaction had come to the 
10 
board.  I am just trying to see because I think I have 
mentioned it in my statement or in the attached referenced 
NM1 attachment.  That that had come to the board but 
because we were not all informed to the same level as 
board members we requested that that – that transaction 
we get more information so that we can adequately 
participate as the other board members were not part of 
the Audit Committee at that time. So that was the 
addressing that concern.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay now your affidavit in paragraph 
20 
records that you raised a concern with Mr Mantsha – you 
expressed surprise because you believed the 2015 board 
tenure was too short in office to sufficiently and fairly 
assess the CEO.  Was he indicating in fact that the board 
meeting would – would called upon to assess the CEO? 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 21 of 142 
 
MS MANDINDI:  No – no Chair not necessarily.  It – my 
statement there was relating to the concern about the CEO.  
Because my assertion was we were appointed in May.  We 
started sitting in July and in September we already have 
opinions 
or 
at 
least 
judgments 
around 
the 
– 
the 
competency or lack therefor – thereof by the management 
team and we also are insinuating issues of misinformation 
and inadequate information.  So I just felt that was a bit 
too soon to have judgments around the management team 
and how they were conducting themselves at the time. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you recall who the CEO and the CFO 
were at the time? 
MS MANDINDI:  The CEO was Mr Saloojee, the CFO was 
Mr Mhlonto.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And the company secretary? 
MS MANDINDI:  Was a Ms – Ms Elizabeth Africa. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now you para – same 
paragraph 2 expresses another concern on your part and 
that is that you were confused because according to the 
20 
agenda for the special board meeting we were supposed to 
consider the LSSA deal and it transpired that the company 
secretary 
Ms 
Africa’s 
competence 
was 
also 
being 
questioned as well as the – that of the CEO and CFO. 
MS MANDINDI:  That is correct Chair because the – the 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 22 of 142 
 
notice to that meeting was to discuss the LSSA deal as we 
had also dealt with it previously.  So when the agenda 
seemed to have shifted now we 
were focussing on 
discussing the executives.  I was a bit confused because 
that was not the purpose of the meeting actually. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So was the LSSA deal the only issue 
really that had been agreed would be on the agenda for 
this board meeting? 
MS MANDINDI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So now other issues were being brought 
10 
up for discussion? 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes and were taking priority over the exact 
issue we had come for. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Now that the company secretary’s 
competence was also being questioned is that what you got 
from Mr Mantsha or is that something that you understood 
later after your meeting with Mr Mantsha? 
MS MANDINDI:  I understood in the process of the 
20 
discussions in the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the meeting? 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  So Mr Mantsha only talked 
about the CEO and the CFO? 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 23 of 142 
 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes Mr Mantsha just explained that there 
was a bit of a delay.  The Audit Committee had concerns 
about the CEO and there was some sort of misinformation 
and inadequate information hence the delay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So once you had the one on one 
meeting in his office with Mr Mantsha did you then proceed 
to join your colleagues and have the – the full board 
meeting? 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes we proceeded to have the board 
10 
meeting Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And that was after the ARC – the 
Audit and Risk Committee’s meeting had concluded? 
MS MANDINDI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now what was discussed 
during your board meeting?  Did you discuss the LSSA 
deal? 
MS MANDINDI:  We did not get to it Chair.  Whether that 
was the – we did not get to it as I have alluded later on in 
the pack. I left that meeting earlier.  But we did not get to 
20 
it in that – during my presence in that meeting. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes you say later in paragraph 22 that 
you left the meeting early.  We will deal with – with that in 
a moment.  But during the time that you were present in 
the board meeting there was no discussion of LSSA deal. 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 24 of 142 
 
MS MANDINDI:  No Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  What – what was the discussion 
about? 
MS MANDINDI:  The discussion was really around the 
unhappiness with the – with the CEO and the CFO and the 
company secretary came in the midst of that.  So it was 
really around the executives’ performance and behaviour 
along those lines.  It was not about the deal – the 
transaction at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was there an agreement by the board to 
10 
change its agenda?  Was there a formal agreement to say, 
we know we had called this meeting for the LSSA deal but 
let us deal with that later.  There are other matters that are 
urgent that we need to deal with?  Or – and was that 
justification given as to why the LSAA – LSSA deal was not 
being discussed? 
MS 
MANDINDI: 
 
I 
do 
not 
recall 
having 
that 
acknowledgement 
Chair. 
 
I 
do 
not 
recall 
that 
acknowledgement because the meeting started and the 
Audit Committee gave the report and the report just 
20 
centred around the three executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  And Ms Mandindi 
did you raise with your board colleagues during that 
meeting concerned that it was not part of the pack and it 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 25 of 142 
 
was not on the agenda and you had been unable to prepare 
and consider in advance? 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes I did Chair raise that – the concerns 
around the discussion and the concerns around the – what 
seemed to be hasty judgment on the – on the executives 
and I followed that up with a letter to the Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who at the meeting was expressing 
unhappiness or concerns about the CEO, CFO and the 
company secretary?  Was it members of the ARC? 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes.  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Committee. 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes predominantly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And who was the Chairperson of the 
ARC Committee if you are able to remember?  If you do not 
remember, that is fine. 
MS MANDINDI:   That was Ms Mpho. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MANDINDI:   Ja.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You can tell me later ...[intervenes]  
MS MANDINDI:   ...proper(?) law firm. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  So and was there a 
particular person who was reporting on behalf of the AFC 
Committee, like a chairperson or different members of the 
RC Committee was speaking on the unhappiness with these 
executives?  
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 26 of 142 
 
MS MANDINDI:   Hmm... 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is something you cannot remember. 
MS MANDINDI:   Chair, I am sorry.  I just cannot recall that 
specifically who was talking but it was a collective report 
back by the Audit Committee in terms of their proceedings 
...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MS MANDINDI:   ...board meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Now the other 
10 
concern that we have touched on earlier related to your 
feeling as new and recently board members.  It might be 
inappropriate 
for 
you 
to 
assess 
qualities 
of 
senior 
executives.  Did... was that because you had only recently 
come into office? 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair it was on that basis.  The board 
that came in...  According to my knowledge, all of were new 
except for one person who was coming from the previous 
board who had been carried over.  So we were fairly new and 
my sense was, we would have been finding our feet around 
20 
the business of Denel at that stage.   
CHAIRPERSON:   The previous evidence that I heard was 
that the board member who came from the previous board 
was a very quiet member during board members. 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, he was not...  I mean, he is not a 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 27 of 142 
 
talkative(?) ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MANDINDI:   ...really. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay  alright.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  And what about the Chair, 
Mr Mantsha of the board that you served on?  Had he served 
on the previous board or was he also knew? 
MS MANDINDI:   Not to my knowledge.  I understood that he 
was also new. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, he was also knew. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.   
MS MANDINDI:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So did you raise with your colleagues 
concern that it may be inappropriate for yourselves as board 
members to proceed with a discussion relating to the 
competence and performance of senior executives, such as 
the CEO and the CFO? 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, I raised my concerns and I raised my 
objections because I felt that if we are to be getting into a 
discussion, especially if it is that advanced that you are 
20 
talking of suspending senior people in the organisation, we 
should be receiving a report back from the Audit Committee 
so that all of us as board members are present in that 
sitting.   
 
And also, we would have applied our minds as to the 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 28 of 142 
 
facts that were considered by the Audit Committee.  So I just 
felt it was a bit odd and rather unfair, not only to the 
executives but also to us that you should be thrown into such 
a drastic decision without prior preparation.   
 
And also, my feel that was that, by that time, we had 
inter-reacted with the executives and we have had the 
briefings 
by 
the 
executives 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
various 
businesses within Denel.   
 
And there was nothing within me that gave me any 
suspicion that they were incompetent or misinforming us.  So 
10 
I could not make a valued judgment with regards to the 
misinformation or inadequacy of misinformation or even 
incompetence claims.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You mentioned... I am sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You mentioned suspension.  Was that 
possibility raised by anybody in particular?   
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, that is how the discussion was going 
Chair.  I am trying to recall if there was a specific mention 
but at the fact that I left the meeting and wrote a letter 
20 
afterwards and referred to it, suggests that it would have 
been mentioned specifically in that meeting. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you recall by whom?  Was it the 
AR... sorry, the... Yes, the IRC chairperson or the board 
chairperson? 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 29 of 142 
 
MS MANDINDI:   I do not recall who specifically. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay. 
MS MANDINDI:   H’m.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And was that suspension being 
proposed for the board members to decide on there and 
then? 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And was that the proposed... was the 
suspension proposed in respect of the CEO and the CFO and 
the company secretary? 
10 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, the company secretary also, her name 
came in the mix and her behaviour was being questioned.  
So she was also being considered for that.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Apart from suspension, was it 
proposed that there would be a disciplinary process against 
them?  In other words, it was suspension pending a 
disciplinary process? 
MS MANDINDI:   It would have been Chair.  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   H’m. 
MS MANDINDI:   There was not a... I mean, that process, 
20 
you start with the suspensions.  So it did not follow.  It 
follows that there would have to be some level of disciplinary 
investigation and sittings necessary to conclude. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you recall whether the basis for the 
suspensions of these executives that was being proposed, 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 30 of 142 
 
that were being proposed, was allegations of misconduct or 
simple that they were not competent or both?  Or is that 
something you cannot remember?  What is your recollection 
of ...[intervenes]  
MS MANDINDI:   My recollection ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...what was being said against them at 
this meeting that was thought justified suspending them? 
MS 
MANDINDI: 
 
 
My 
recollection 
Chair 
was 
around 
misinformation.  There was a sense in which the Audit 
Committee felt that some of the facts around the LSSA 
10 
deal... transaction, were being... were not as clear or as 
truthful as we thought they were.   
 
And also, there was inadequate detail around some of 
the nuances(?) of that transaction.  So that was mostly the 
feeling.  And of course, Ms Africa’s issue came into the 
question as well.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So the complaint was that the CEO and 
the CFO had not provided correct or truthful or accurate 
information to the ARC Committee or to the board with 
regard to the LSSA deal? 
20 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what it was about? 
MS MANDINDI:   That was the feeling, yes.  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now the company secretary, did that apply 
to the company secretary or was there something, a separate 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 31 of 142 
 
issue with the company secretary? 
MS MANDINDI:   I did not understand how... You know, 
things just deteriorate fast in some of these meetings Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  And of course, you will have to 
...[intervenes]  
MS MANDINDI:   I do not remember how she just ended up 
as part of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MANDINDI:   And I think it had to do again with the 
misinformation because remember, the company secretary 
10 
handles the distribution and the quality of information 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MANDINDI:   ...that gets distributed to the board 
members.  So she may have come into the debate and the 
questioning of her abilities in that sense. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But is your recollection that when the 
meetings started maybe the focus was the on the CEO and 
CFO but somewhere during the meeting, the company 
secretary’s name also was brought in or is that something 
20 
you cannot remember? 
MS MANDINDI:   No, it sounded like she was already 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   She was included from the beginning? 
MS MANDINDI:   She was included in the questioning. 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 32 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MANDINDI:   In the questionable behaviour or whatever. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
MS MANDINDI:   Ms Mandindi, you in fact deals specifically 
with your concerns about the company secretary, as well as 
the other two executives in your letter. 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We will come back to that if we may.   
MS MANDINDI:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In a moment.  If we can just complete 
what your evidence is on the meeting itself.  You expressed 
your concerns that it was no appropriate for board members 
to assess these executives and decide on such important 
issues as suspension and disciplinary action for executives.  
Firstly, where you had not been forewarned about that.  It 
was not on the agenda. 
MS MANDINDI:   H’m. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It was not in the pack.  And secondly, 
where you did not... where you were so new to the job as 
board members. 
MS MANDINDI:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And were not that familiar with the 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 33 of 142 
 
corporation or its executives.  When you raised those 
concerns, what was the reaction of the other board members 
overall?  I am not wanting you to get, at this stage, 
specifically as to what each member said.  But were your 
concerns taken seriously and did they agree to abandon the 
efforts as you were seem to be suggesting?  What was 
done? 
MS MANDINDI:   No, they were not addressed, specifically 
Chair.  So it is... you say something and then it moves to the 
next person saying something else.  So they were not 
10 
specifically acknowledged.  Not dealt with specifically at that 
time because it was a broad discussion by the board.  So, 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was Mr Mantsha chairing that board 
meeting? 
MS MANDINDI:   That is... Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now the executives...  The CEO and 
the CFO, I would have imagined...  Well, I guess they would 
ordinarily be part of any board meeting.  Is that correct? 
MS MANDINDI:   They were recused at that stage. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   They ...[intervenes]  
MS MANDINDI:   But they were in the building.  They were in 
the building. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For that meeting, they were asked to 
leave? 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 34 of 142 
 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now...  Thank you, Chair.  Now Ms 
Mandindi, you then say in your affidavit in paragraph 21 the 
following: 
“Tau Mahumapelo was nominated to act as Company 
Secretary if the then incumbent company secretary 
would be suspended and Zwelakhe Ntshepe as 
acting CEO if the CEO would be suspended.” 
 
Was there a discussion in your presence of what would 
10 
happen to the positions of the CEO and Company Secretary 
if those individuals were suspended and who might then take 
their 
places 
in 
an 
acting 
position 
while 
they 
were 
suspended? 
MS MANDINDI:   Chair, as indicated in that paragraph.  The 
proposal was that Mr Tau Mahumapelo, would be the 
company active, the Company Secretary and then, indeed, 
Mr Ntshepe would act as the CEO as it happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was Mr Tau Mahumapelo a member of the 
board or an official of the company? 
20 
MS MANDINDI:   He was a member of the board, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A member of the board? 
MS MANDINDI:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And Mr Ntshepe, what was his 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 35 of 142 
 
position? 
MS MANDINDI:   Mr Ntshepe at that time, he was the 
Executive responsible for Business Development.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MS MANDINDI:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And what, did he sit on the board? 
MS MANDINDI:   No, Chair not in that capacity. 
MS MANDINDI:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did anybody at the meeting say why it was 
so urgent that you deal with this matter as the board? 
10 
MS MANDINDI:   That was my concern, Chair.  That was my 
concern because if you read later in my letter, I talk about 
haste.  That it sounded like it was a hasty decision to do so 
because we have not fully evaluated the facts in hand as a 
board.  So we were merely taking a decision on the basis of 
the recommendation by the Audit Committee and we had not 
brought the whole board’s confidence in that regard.   
CHAIRPERSON:   And did anybody give you a response to 
this?  An answer to why this was so urgent?  Why this could 
not wait until you had been properly briefed by the ARC 
20 
Committee and you were ready to deal with this? 
MS MANDINDI:   No.  No, there were no specific response to 
that question, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Because one would have expected 
and I think you made the point that the ARC Committee 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 36 of 142 
 
being a committee of the board, if it had certain concerns, it 
would first shared them with the board. 
MS MANDINDI:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And everybody gets enough chance to 
apply their mind to those issues.  And then the board could 
take a decision ...[intervenes]  
MS MANDINDI:   Take... 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...whether to... on the way forward.  And 
whether there should be a contemplation of suspension and 
so on. 
10 
MS MANDINDI:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MS MANDINDI:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  In paragraph 22 you 
say you left that board meeting early around nine o’clock 
before its conclusion. 
“I was extremely concerned at the manner in which 
the meeting was unfolding and concerned that there 
was a possible action being taken against three 
20 
senior people, the CEO, the CFO and the Company 
Secretary.” 
 
Now at the stage that you left, had the board taken a 
resolution to suspend or discipline the three executives 
concerned? 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 37 of 142 
 
MS MANDINDI:   No, Chair it had been discussed.  The 
names had been put on the table with regards to the acting 
people but the final decision had not been concluded in 
the... on that particular sitting Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you recall roundabout what time that 
meeting had taken... had started?  I see you had left at 
about nine o’clock. 
MS MANDINDI:   Nine o’clock Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When had it started, the meeting? 
MS MANDINDI:   I think the meeting was scheduled to start 
10 
around...  If I may recall, it would be a five o’clock or 
something like that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright.   
MS MANDINDI:   But that would need to verified. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MANDINDI:   But it was an evening meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
MS MANDINDI:   H’m. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then how long it was scheduled to 
start around five but you then had... you were delayed.  The 
board meeting was delayed in starting because the ARC 
meeting was still in progress. 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 38 of 142 
 
MS MANDINDI:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Roughly, how long was the delay 
period? 
MS MANDINDI:   It was long Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you said about an hour, earlier on. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   About an hour? 
MS MANDINDI:   I would need to confirm the five o’clock 
start time but it was an evening meeting.  It could have been 
scheduled for six o’clock or whatever the case may be. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
MS MANDINDI:   But we waited for more than an hour before 
the meeting started. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MANDINDI:   It was quite a long wait. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  And ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   When you left...  I am sorry, Mr Kennedy.  
When you left at nine o’clock, did you have a sense of where 
the meeting was heading in terms of the suspension or it was 
not clear yet? 
MS MANDINDI:   I was getting a feeling Chair that that is 
20 
what was going to happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The suspension of the executives? 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, yes.  Because that is where the whole 
discussion was headed towards. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Where there people, maybe other 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 39 of 142 
 
than yourself, were there people, members of the board who 
were speaking against this haste and was speaking, maybe 
was speaking against the suspension at that stage?  Or 
saying:  Let us delay this.  We need more information.  Or 
anything along those lines? 
MS MANDINDI:   To start off with Chair.  It was not a full 
sitting, a full board sitting because some of the members 
were not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  H’m.  But was there a quorum, do you 
know? 
10 
MS MANDINDI:   It is curated, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MS MANDINDI:   It is absolutely curated but it was not a full 
sitting at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MANDINDI:   I do not recall...  Well, I was vocal but I 
cannot say I was the only opposed to the decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS MANDINDI:   And so ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It might have been two or three people 
20 
who were ...[intervenes]  
MS MANDINDI:   I cannot recall Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot recall? 
MS MANDINDI:   Specifically. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 40 of 142 
 
MS MANDINDI:   Because remember, at this point, people 
are still discussing whether there are strong positions for or 
against the discussion, around the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MANDINDI:   The progressing of a discussion.  So I 
would not know who else was part. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But when you left, your impression 
was that the majority 
seemed to be 
moving towards 
...[intervenes]   
MS MANDINDI:   The ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...the decision to suspend the executives. 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MS MANDINDI:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So was that discussion moving in that 
direction still happening when you left the meeting early? 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now can you explain to the Chair 
briefly why you left the meeting at that stage? 
MS MANDINDI:   I did not like the discussion Chair and I did 
20 
not come prepared to have a discussion like that.  I was 
prepared to discuss the LSSA transaction which is the pack 
that was circulated and the notice of the meeting.   
 
So I felt ill-equipped to engage further with that 
discussion and I made my concerns known to the meeting.  I 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 41 of 142 
 
raised them very clearly.   
 
So I just did not feel I was going to add any more value 
because I had stated my concerns and the fact that I would 
have had a feeling that the matter should have been delayed 
and the board apprised of the developments within the 
company before we proceed.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now, do you know what the outcome of 
the meeting’s discussion about the possible suspension of 
the three executives was? 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair.  I mean, we were informed the 
10 
following day that the members had been suspended, the 
three members. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Then you mention a letter that 
you wrote.  Is that the letter you told the Chair about earlier 
that you sent after the meeting? 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So the meeting was in the evening of 
the 23rd of September.  You then sent a letter.  If I can ask 
you, in this bundle again.  Look at the top left numbers. 
MS MANDINDI:   H’m? 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is the letter that you have referred us 
to.  Is that the letter that we find at page 12? 
MS MANDINDI:   That is correct, Chair.  That is the 
Annexure MM1. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And that runs for three pages.  
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 42 of 142 
 
And you deal with various issues that you right.  Procedural 
issues, modus operandi and the company secretary. 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It was addressed to Mr Mantsha.  Is 
that right? 
MS MANDINDI:   That is the chairman, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Why did you sent this letter?  
What was your overall objective? 
MS MANDINDI:   Chair, as I indicated.  I was greatly 
troubled and concerned when the events unfolded in the 
10 
meeting the way they did because I felt that suspending or 
releasing senior members of the organisation has to have 
had very serious allegations levelled against them.  And 
these things are very disruptive to these entities.   
 
And I just felt totally troubled that we did not even have 
something, a report, that is written as the board that we 
could apply our minds to with regards to the allegations 
levelled against the three senior executives.   
 
And yes Chair.  And it just happened to fast.  From July 
to September.  I just felt that was a bit too much.   
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now your affidavit sets out a summary 
of what you raised in the letter.  Paragraph 25 of your 
affidavit.  Sorry, 23.  Refers to the letter and to discuss the 
issues raised during the meeting to which you did not 
receive any response.  Did you not receive a response to the 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 43 of 142 
 
letter itself? 
MS MANDINDI:   No, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And the summary sets out the main 
points.  23.1 refers to the fact that: 
“The agenda for that meeting related to the LSSA 
transaction, not the suspension of the directors.” 
 
We have dealt with that. 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Secondly.  Point 2. 
“That such a decision to suspend is serious, would 
10 
have necessitated a full board meeting sitting with 
ample notice time, not the short notice.” 
 
And then he says: 
“not all the board members were present because of 
the short notice.” 
 
We have dealt with that. 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then you say in point 3: 
“The ARC report was not circulated with the meeting 
notification.  It was not circulated before the 
20 
meeting.  It was only handed to board members 
during the meeting and therefore no opportunity was 
provided to you as board members to apply your 
minds 
to 
the 
facts 
to 
contribute 
wisely 
and 
constructively.” 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 44 of 142 
 
 
How serious do you feel that that concern was? 
MS MANDINDI:   You said how serious? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Was it a serious concern for you? 
MS MANDINDI:   It is a serious concern Chair.  I mean, you 
do 
not 
suspend 
senior 
executives 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
documentation you have just received at the meeting without 
applying your mind.  So when you get to have received that 
information so that we can also objectively evaluate if it is a 
good... it is a wise decision or not. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then in point 4, you say: 
10 
“The intended decision to suspend them was only 
communicated to the board members during the 
meeting.  The finding of the ARC report was not 
discussed rigorously by the board with reference to 
the merits and demerits of the LSSA transaction.” 
MS MANDINDI:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then: 
“The ARC report did not analyse the various aspects 
of the LSSA transaction.  No conclusion were 
reached on the basis of the analyses.” 
20 
 
Oh, sorry.   
“That on the basis of the analyses there is a need to 
act against these directives.” 
MS MANDINDI:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then: 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 45 of 142 
 
“The structure of the ARC report, it looks like they 
approached the documentation with a purpose of 
formulating a charge sheet and there was some 
inaccuracies 
that 
could 
open 
the 
board 
to 
challenges.” 
 
Can you recall any detail in that regard? 
MS MANDINDI:   I cannot recall specific detail.  I just pulled 
that basically on my letter but the fact that there was not 
any... Remember, the fall off between the Audit Committee 
and 
the 
executives 
was 
centred 
around 
the 
LSSA 
10 
transaction, according to our knowledge.   
 
So then you would have had to analyse the LSSA 
transaction to evaluate or form or come to an opinion or a 
judgment that the executives were either misinforming us or 
had put in inaccurate details.  So the fact that that report 
had not been put before the board, for me was not right.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If I might ask you to move, just for a 
moment, to the letter itself at page 13?   
MS MANDINDI:   It is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Line 3.  That is the section above the 
20 
heading modus operandi.  Do you see that? 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And line 3 on the top of the page, you 
say: 
“Based on the foregoing, one would have expected a 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 46 of 142 
 
report 
analysing 
the 
various 
aspects 
of 
the 
transaction.” 
 
Is that the LSSA transaction? 
MS MANDINDI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Are you with me? 
MS MANDINDI:   No, I am not with you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Can you... if you look at the top page 
13. 
MS MANDINDI:   I have got page 13. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Line 3. 
10 
MS MANDINDI:   Oh, I went to number 3.  Sorry. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   No, no.  Line 3. 
MS MANDINDI:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The third line.  “Based on the 
foregoing...”  Are you with me? 
MS MANDINDI:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You say then: 
“...one would have expected a report analysing the 
various aspects of the transaction.” 
 
Is that the LSSA transaction? 
20 
MS MANDINDI:   That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then: 
“On the basis of that analyses concluding that there 
is a need to act against the executives directives.” 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, correct.  Yes, that is correct Chair. 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 47 of 142 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, that is what you say also in your 
affidavit. 
MS MANDINDI:   Indeed. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But you carry on.  You say.  In fact, 
this is also in your affidavit.   
“The structure of the report to the Audit and Risk 
Committee tabled on 23 September, looks like they 
approached the documentation with the purpose of 
formulating 
a 
charge 
sheet. 
 
There 
is 
some 
inaccuracies 
which 
could 
open 
the 
board 
to 
10 
challenge.” 
 
It is the next few lines that I just want to take you to. 
MS MANDINDI:   H’m? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
“There is no reference to the merits and demerits of 
the transaction.  There is no reference to the 
decisions that the board might need to make to bring 
the transaction back on track or recommendations to 
strengthen controls and other mitigations.” 
MS MANDINDI:   That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Did you think that these issues that I 
have just read out were just in the interest of good 
governance in general or did they also have any relevance to 
the decision to suspend the executives? 
MS MANDINDI:   Effectively, if we were to suspend the 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 48 of 142 
 
executives on the basis of what they have put on the table in 
the context of the transaction, then we would need to 
analyse as I have said before.  We would need to analyse 
the transaction and see where the gaps are.   
 
And that analyses of the transaction would need to bring 
us back to board because the business is not the business of 
releasing of executives.  It is the business of running the 
business of Denel.   
 
So we would need the recommendations as to how do we 
bring the transaction back on track.  So that is what I was 
10 
alluding to in that paragraph.  That the report did not seem 
to give us any information regarding the transaction.   
 
It dealt with the shortcomings or whatever allegations 
were levelled against the executives, basically.  That was the 
concern. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  May I take you 
Ms Mandindi on the same page of your letter to...  Near the 
end, you have got a heading, Company Secretary.  Do you 
see that? 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, that is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then your paragraph 1 under that 
heading says: 
“I did not note to what extent the HR has been 
involved in this process but I find it harsh that what 
looks like a lack of report(?) between the Audit and 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 49 of 142 
 
Risk chair and the company secretary, ends up 
constituting a dismissible offence.  I would have 
thought a warning would suffice and then we all 
work 
on 
creating 
positive 
relationships 
going 
forward.” 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, that sentiment I still hold Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.   
MS MANDINDI:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Had you raised that sentiment during 
the meeting itself or is it only raised after the meeting in 
10 
your letter of the 25t h? 
MS MANDINDI:   I do not know if that specific point was 
raised at the meeting but it was a matter of concern that I 
ended up putting.   
 
Because I got a feeling that there were personal lack of, 
you know, personal relations or whatever the case may be.  
There was just fall off.  The personalities did not come 
together.   
 
But then again, back to my point.  In three months’ time.  
You work on personal or personal relationships within 
20 
creating 
a 
working 
environment, 
a 
positive 
working 
environment where the executives do their job.   
 
The board can do their job.  So I will not have thought 
that such conflicts should result into dismissible offenses. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then again, on the same page.  If 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 50 of 142 
 
we go up under the heading modus operandi. 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You deal with your concerns that you 
have already discussed.   
“That there had not been much opportunity to 
deliberate, yet there were some urgency.” 
 
This is paragraph 2.   
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   There was some urgency.  So although 
you did not have much opportunity to deliberate, there was 
10 
this urgency for them to leave immediately.   
MS MANDINDI:   H’m. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
“Why?  This tendency not to afford proper handover 
processes for senior executives.  Rob entities of 
continuity and sustainability.  We cannot build a 
strong democracy on the basis of weak... on the 
back of weak institutions.” 
 
In paragraph 3... 
“…recommendations for the CEO and CFO have 
20 
been tabled an unfortunately I have no prior 
knowledge of the individuals.” 
When you see that those recommendations were tabled, 
tabled in what way?  Was that during the course of a 
meeting or not before the meeting? 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 51 of 142 
 
MS MANDINDI:   No before the meeting. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MS MANDINDI:   In the course of the meeting. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And: 
“…unfortunately I have no prior knowledge of the 
individuals nor am I able to pose an opinion on their 
capabilities over this brief time on the board.  In 
this regard one has to trust the judgment of the 
audit and risk committee.” 
And then you make a different point in 4: 
10 
“The recommendation for Mr Tau to act…” 
That is the same Mr Tau Mahumapelo, is that right? 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, that is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   “…to act I believe is bad judgment, 
could lead to the board being discredited.  I would 
advise that the board does not get involved in 
whatever capacity in operational matters to ensure 
we maintain our objectivity and oversight role.  
Further, Mr Tau is part of the audit and risk 
committee which is making the recommendations, 
20 
so his acting role constitutes a conflict of interest.” 
The acting role, would that be as company secretary in the 
place of Ms Afrika? 
MS MANDINDI:   That is correct, Chair.  That is correct, 
Chair. 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 52 of 142 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright, thank you.  May I now take 
you back to your affidavit? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe before you do that, Mr Kennedy.  
Ms Mandindi, you say in paragraph 3 of that page of that 
letter, page 13, that one has to trust the judgment of the 
audit and risk committee.  Do you know how often the audit 
and risk committee had met by then because except for 
one member of the board everybody was new on the board 
but now they have reached a point where they say 
executives must be suspended.  Do you know by any 
10 
chance how much – how often they had already met?  How 
much interactions they had already had with the executives 
within this short space of time? 
MS MANDINDI:   No, Chair, I will not say how much but 
ordinarily audit committees are more involved and more 
immersed in the business. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MANDINDI:   Than the other board members. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Than the other board members. 
MS MANDINDI:   So they would have had a lot more 
20 
interaction than us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MANDINDI:   Which is why when they were putting the 
commendations on the LSSA transaction beforehand, we 
requested that the balance of the board be brought on 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 53 of 142 
 
track. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MANDINDI:   With regards to the information because 
we did not have the same level of knowledge and 
information on the transactions than they did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MANDINDI:   So, Chair, they would have had a lot more 
interaction but still I still believe that not to be able to 
formulate such harsh judgment against management. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Kennedy? 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  And in fact still on page 
13, below the section headed Company Secretary, the last 
four lines of this page 13, what you say is: 
“Finally, Chair, I do understand it may be necessary 
to change the executive directors.  What I am 
challenging is the manner in which these things get 
done.  It is possible to part in amicable ways 
leaving the dignity, reputation of both parties intact.  
As it is, we have a lack of black talent in our 
country, we cannot continuously send a message of 
20 
malice and reputational damage towards this talent 
especially by state entities. How we going to 
implement the critical transformation as prioritised 
by our government if we are not able to nurture our 
professionals?  How is it that we get so intolerant of 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 54 of 142 
 
our own and end up creating unnecessary anarchy?” 
Am I right in understanding this paragraph firstly to make 
the point that you recognise that it is possible that there 
may be a case to take action against the executives but it 
is the manner in which it was being done that you objected 
to, correct? 
MS MANDINDI:   I think my – that is correct but my 
concern also cantered – was based on that, on that fact, 
and also if you look at my – under modus operandi number 
two, reference 2, the issue is, there may be a lot of 
10 
challenges that happens in public institutions but the lack 
of 
continuity 
and 
the 
malicious 
manner 
in 
which 
professionals are let go or victimised is a big concern and 
it is a concern that does not only relate to opportunities for 
corruption and maladministration but it is a loss value to 
the nation.   
So, for me, I was raising a broader issue there, that 
not only centres around these individuals but centres 
around 
the 
victimisation 
and 
unfair 
treatment 
of 
professionals, especially black professionals who happen 
20 
to sit in those organisations and doing good work and 
serving the country and now they have to be victimised in 
that matter.  That is the principle I was raising in those two 
paragraphs, Chair, if I may just clarify.   
 
And also, if you let people go, supposed there is a 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 55 of 142 
 
need to let them go, but we have to do it in a way where 
their dignity is maintained, you know, it remains intact.  It 
happens even in the private sector.  You know, a new 
shareholder comes in and they are not comfortable with the 
currency or they want to drive a different strategic agenda.  
So the manner in which you let people go also can destroy 
them because a lot of black professionals – I mean, Mr 
Mhlontlo is a chartered accountant and if his name is 
dragged into controversial issues like – as in the manner in 
which we are doing then his career, it is really heavily 
10 
impacted.  So I was basically raising an issue that we need 
to be sensitive.  Whilst we may be exercising the oversight 
that is necessary as a board, we need to also be fair and 
just in the manner in which we do that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, thank you, Ms Mandindi, may 
we now go back to your affidavit, take you to page 7, 
paragraph 24.  You set out above that a summary of the 
letter and you have indicated that there was no response 
from the Chairperson, correct? 
MS MANDINDI:   No, Chair. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then you deal in paragraph 24 with 
his obligation to inform Minister Lynne Brown as the 
shareholder for the government about the intent to suspend 
the executive directors but you are not aware of any 
feedback from Ms Brown as to that suspension, is that 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 56 of 142 
 
correct? 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair, that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  Now the next few paragraphs 
deal with another decision that appears to have been taken 
by the board and you refer to a round robin resolution on 
the 7 October, so that was a couple of weeks after the 
board meeting that we have just dealt with of the 23 
September and the round robin resolution related to 
appointing a law firm called Dentons to conduct an 
investigation into the LSSA deal.  Now as that appointment 
10 
of Dentons not discussed in the board meeting that you 
had attended on the 23 September? 
MS MANDINDI:   No, Chair, that was to discuss an 
appointment of a legal entity for that.  No, it was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does that include after you had left that 
meeting?  In other words did you see minutes – did you 
subsequently see the minutes of the full meeting and they 
did not refer to any discussion about that? 
MS MANDINDI:   My recollection, Chair, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and the 7 t h – or after the meeting 
20 
of the 23 September between that date and the 7 October 
was there another meeting of the board that you were 
invited to or you cannot remember? 
MS MANDINDI:   You are referring to 27, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see on paragraph 25 you say: 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 57 of 142 
 
“On 
7 
October 
2015 
I 
signed 
a 
round 
robin 
resolution.” 
So I am asking whether between the 23 September when 
there was that meeting which you left at nine o’clock. 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the 7 October there was no board 
meeting that took place? 
MS MANDINDI:   There was another a board meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was another, okay, alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So when you – I am sorry, Chair, 
10 
may I proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   When you were presented with the 
round robin resolution you had not participated in any 
discussion with the board as to what this related to, the 
appointment of Dentons. 
MS MANDINDI:   No, we had discussed it, Chair, that there 
would need to be an appointment of a law firm to – it had 
been discussed in a subsequent board meeting, the 
appointment of a legal firm to investigate the LSSA 
20 
transaction and I think in one of my annexures deals with a 
concern around that appointment because if we are dealing 
with the LSSA transaction it is not purely a legal matter so 
my recommendation was to appoint a transaction advisory 
firm or that sort of entity that would be able to evaluate the 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 58 of 142 
 
merits and demerits of the actual transaction and go into 
the legalities, not just look at the legalities of the 
transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I may have I misunderstood you, I 
thought you said there was no board meeting between 23 
September and 7 October. 
MS MANDINDI:   There was, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was? 
MS MANDINDI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
10 
MS MANDINDI:   There should have been a board meeting 
to discuss that because I do recall there was a meeting but 
I would not know the dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you do not recall the dates. 
MS MANDINDI:   No, Chair, I would not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So it was at that meeting of the 
board that the possible appointment of a law firm was 
discussed. 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Kennedy? 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Mandindi, if I 
can take you in your bundle to page 16, is that the round 
robin resolution that you were asked to sign? 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And if I can just take you to 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 59 of 142 
 
paragraph A under the heading …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe – I am sorry, Mr Kennedy, maybe 
if before we talk about the round robin.  Ms Mandindi, if 
you able to, can you tell me more about the meeting that 
happened between the 23 September and the 7 October 
where the issue of Dentons or the appointment of a law 
firm was discussed?  That is if you are able to remember, 
what was the purpose of that meeting? 
MS MANDINDI:   Chair, I will try now to [inaudible – 
speaking simultaneously] from my recollection. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   As you recall obviously. 
MS MANDINDI:   It could have been an HR committee 
meeting, maybe not a full board meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS MANDINDI:   But we were discussing the whole process 
that 
needed 
to 
take 
place 
because 
remember, 
the 
executives were suspended, now we needed to get into the 
process of the suspension so that there is a disciplinary 
hearing.  So that meeting would have discussed that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, it might not have been a full board 
20 
meeting, it might have been an HR committee. 
MS MANDINDI:   Might not have been, yes, it might have 
not. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Okay. 
 
And 
that 
committee 
had 
concluded – what had it concluded, if anything, about the 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 60 of 142 
 
appointment of a law firm and/or …[intervenes] 
MS MANDINDI:   There was a need to appoint someone to 
look at the transaction and formulate the charges of 
course, so …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and you were a member of that 
committee. 
MS MANDINDI:   And I decided to sit as member of that 
committee.  I was a member of that committee, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  And so there was a 
decision that a law firm and maybe forensics of other 
10 
people be appointed to look at the LSSA deal? 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And it was arranged that a round 
robin resolution would be circulated in due course or 
something like that? 
MS MANDINDI:   To enable the management to – the 
executives to appoint the legal firm, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  If I can take you 
at page 16 to the text of the round robin resolution.  About 
20 
half down you will a heading Whereas… You see that? 
MS MANDINDI:   [indistinct – dropping voice] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Page 16. 
MS MANDINDI:   Page 16. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   There is paragraph numbered A. 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 61 of 142 
 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Whereas, yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If I can just read out: 
“As a result of the finding of the audit and risk 
report dated 23 September 2015 regarding the 
conduct of the executive directors of the company 
and the Group Company Secretary in respect of the 
purchase of Land Systems South Africa by the 
company…” 
Land Systems South Africa is LSSA, is that right? 
MS MANDINDI:   That is correct, Chair. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:    “…by the company, the transaction,  
 it is necessary to appoint a law firm to investigate 
the transaction and any alleged irregularities and 
provide a report and recommendations to the board 
in respect thereof.” 
And then there was a resolution at the foot of the page: 
“It is resolved that…” 
And then there is a reference to the Acting Group CEO. 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Inviting bids from at least three law 
20 
firms.  Did you – is that your signature that appears on 
page 17 where you were asked to put your vote as to 
whether you agreed or disagreed? 
MS MANDINDI:   That is my signature, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, on the 7 October 2015. 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 62 of 142 
 
MS MANDINDI:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you indicated there that you 
disagreed with the resolution. 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair, I disagreed on the basis that I 
have indicated to you, Chair, that my contention was that 
we should be appointing someone who is more able not – 
better placed, let me not say able, better placed as skills-
wise to evaluate the transaction holistically rather than 
only the legal aspects of the transaction.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So you were saying a law firm alone 
10 
without certain skills, non-legal skills that you considered 
important was not good enough? 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS MANDINDI:   Because we would not have had the 
evaluation or opinion on the financial aspects of the 
transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MANDINDI:   The risky elements for instance related to 
IP and so forth, so would not have had more information or 
20 
ability to evaluate those other aspects of the transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so your view that an evaluation by 
lawyers only of this transaction would be inadequate to 
enable the board to make any decisions. 
MS MANDINDI:   Correct, Chair. 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 63 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, may I ask you for guidance?  
Are you proposing to take a short adjournment before we 
conclude this witness’s evidence or do you want me to 
proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:   We can try and conclude because I 
suspect it is not going to take long before she is done. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, I think so.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let us continue.  Ja, we can take the 
tea adjournment after she has concluded. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Mandindi, the 
point about your feeling that a law firm alone would be 
inadequate because of needing other skills such as from 
an investment company or an audit firm, you refer to in 
your affidavit paragraph 26 and – is that correct? 
MS MANDINDI:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then if I can take you to page 
19, is this the email that you referred to? 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In which you made the same point. 
20 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In fact your first bullet point said it 
needs... 
“The LSSA transaction needs analysis on whether it 
was a sound investment decision or not and what 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 64 of 142 
 
remedial actions we should be taking to ensure that 
Denel is not in a worse position.  This requires an 
investment 
company 
or 
an 
audit 
firm 
with 
transaction and analysis expertise.  A legal firm will 
be focusing on the legalities of a transaction which 
may not be sound anyway.” 
MS MANDINDI:   True. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then your second bullet point says: 
“We have not discussed this transaction as a board, 
its merits and demerits.  I believe we still need to 
10 
do 
that 
objectively, 
come 
to 
a 
common 
understanding.” 
And then your next bullet point: 
“Propose 
that 
the 
board 
considers 
having 
an 
investment committee whose role and expertise is 
different.”  
Now did you receive a response to your email and the 
concerns that you raised here? 
MS MANDINDI:   No, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now to go back to your …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you ever receive any response to 
any 
of 
the 
letters 
or 
emails 
that 
you 
sent 
to 
the 
Chairperson? 
MS MANDINDI:   No, Chair, not – no, I could not find any 
record or any of those, Chair.  I do not recall receiving 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 65 of 142 
 
direct responses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then to go back to your affidavit 
page 8, paragraph 27, it says: 
“Despite your disagreement and your views and 
sentiments, a firm of attorneys, Dentons, was 
appointed to investigate the Executive Director 
Claims with the intention of formulating a charge 
sheet.” 
What happened to your suggestion that the board should 
10 
appoint a – rather a committee to take the matter forward 
before such a decision were taken and to have discussion 
at board level.  You did not receive a response but who 
took the decision to appoint Dentons, do you know? 
MS MANDINDI:   I think Dentons followed this resolution to 
a point out of three legal firms. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MS MANDINDI:   The resolution that we had already 
signed, Dentons was appointed subsequent to that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And in fact the resolution that we 
20 
looked at earlier provided for the procedure to be followed 
by the Acting Group CEO to …[intervenes] 
MS MANDINDI:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   To solicit bids and then to make an 
award.  In your affidavit, page 8, paragraph 28, you say 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 66 of 142 
 
you 
were 
part 
of 
a 
committee 
that 
looked 
at 
the 
investigative work. 
“I was consciously part of this committee to ensure 
that there was justice and fairness in the process.” 
Now what committee was that? 
MS MANDINDI:   Chair, it was subcommittee of the board 
to look at the investigations, what is coming out of 
whatever 
legal 
work 
that 
would 
then 
form 
of 
the 
disciplinary action. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From Dentons? 
10 
MS MANDINDI:   That is the committee that was supposed 
to formulate the whole process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it was a committee that was going to 
evaluate whatever reports were coming from the Dentons 
investigation? 
MS MANDINDI:   That is true, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  I see that at paragraph 27 of your 
affidavit you say: 
“Despite my disagreement, view and sentiment 
expressed, Dentons Attorneys were appointed to 
20 
investigate the Executive Director Claims.” 
I guess those are the claims against – or allegations 
against the executive directors.  And then in brackets you 
say: 
“With the intention of formulating a charge sheet.” 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 67 of 142 
 
MS MANDINDI:   That is true, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now when you appoint somebody to 
investigate, normally you are expected to say they must 
investigate and they can come back with yes, it looks like 
there is something wrong, or we have found something 
wrong or they might come back and say there is nothing 
wrong. 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But when you put it like this: 
“..with intention of formulating a charge sheet” 
10 
It gives the impression and I want to check with you 
whether that is the impression you had.  It gives the 
impression as if the investigation was meant to come out 
with a finding that there was a proper case for charging the 
executives. 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that your – what your impression was? 
MS MANDINDI:   That was my impression at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MANDINDI:   And also remember, Chair, by that time 
20 
the executives had already been suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Suspended, yes.  Yes. 
MS MANDINDI:   So there needed to be a follow-up 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Okay, you told us that the 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 68 of 142 
 
CEO – Acting CEO was Mr Ntshepe and the company 
secretary was Mr Mahumapelo.  Who was the – or the 
Acting Company Secretary was Mr Mahumapelo.  Who was 
the Acting CFO?  Do you remember? 
MS MANDINDI:   I do not recall if by this time – I am 
forgetting his name. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you do not remember, it is fine.  
Probably 
we 
have 
got 
it 
in 
Mr 
Saloojee’s 
affidavit, 
probably, but we do not have to look for it. 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, there was someone subsequently 
10 
appointed to act as CFO, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright. 
MS MANDINDI:   I am not sure if at the time this was all 
happening he had already appointed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MANDINDI:   Because he did not get appointed at the 
same time as Mr Ntshepe. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  Then in paragraph 29 of 
your affidavit you say you saw the Dentons report and in 
20 
your view they struggled to find sticky points against the 
executive directors and Mantsha – sorry, against the 
directors and Mantsha became increasingly impatient with 
Dentons.  Where do you get that knowledge from?  In what 
way did he show or express impatience? 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 69 of 142 
 
MS 
MANDINDI: 
 
 
He 
was 
getting 
impatient 
in 
the 
interactions with Dentons when they were presenting their 
first round of findings, their first report.  And also 
remember, Chair, his impatience could have also been 
related to the time because now the investigation was 
taking longer than we had anticipated so we had executive 
directors who were on suspension without a clear timeline 
on process that the board was going to follow, so it may 
have been twofold. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Could you give please to the Chair 
your overall impression of how the board and the ARC 
acted in this process of suspending and then later starting 
the disciplinary process against Mr Saloojee and his 
colleagues? 
MS MANDINDI:   In conclusion, Chair, I just felt that the 
process was unfair, unjust, hasty and in many ways 
unjustifiable against the executives.  We could have 
handled things differently.  We could have taken time to 
observe and also build the relationship between the board 
20 
and the executives.  So I just felt that the process was 
hasty and in the hastiness of the process we were standing 
to disrupt the organisation because once you lose a CEO, 
a CFO, definitely the organisation is disrupted, there is 
uncertainty, there is fear, there is, you know, a lot of 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 70 of 142 
 
disillusionment within the staff, the morale issues.  So it 
always impacts the organisation and those were the 
concerns that were there at the time. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And these concerns were concerns 
that you raised both in the meeting itself and in a letter 
after the meeting of the 23 September. 
MS MANDINDI:   That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you raised - when you were 
presented with a round robin resolution you raised your 
concerns in your email. 
10 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   How do you feel your concerns – to 
what extent, if any, your concerns were taken seriously by 
Mr Mantsha? 
MS MANDINDI:   It is difficult to pose an opinion with 
regards to that matter because within a board you have got 
many voices speaking, you know, there is a number of 
other people who may have a different opinion to what I 
was raising but I felt strongly enough about the matters 
that I was raising that I put them in writing.   
20 
 
So I would not say or blame the Chairman for not 
having taken or heeded some of those because there is 
seven or eight other people who are speaking something to 
the Chairman and influencing the events differently. 
 
So I cannot say he was unfair or whatever the case 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 71 of 142 
 
may be and at the time there was a lot happening so 
maybe it was still his intention to respond to the matter 
specifically. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess also if you are chairing a 
meeting and there is a certain issue that is being 
discussed, sometimes you just want to hear as many views 
possible …[intervenes] 
MS MANDINDI:   Absolutely, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  …without taking a particular view or 
without responding to a particular view and engage the 
10 
views of the people in the meeting. 
MS MANDINDI:   That is correct.  That is correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then you say, Ms Mandindi, in 
paragraph 30 by the time when you left the matter had not 
been finalised.  Was that leaving the board? 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, the finality of the disciplinary 
process against the executives.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, right. 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, that is at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know whether by the time you 
20 
left 
the 
board 
the 
investigations 
that 
Dentons 
was 
conducting were showing any different picture in terms of 
any probable guilt on the part of the executives or there 
was nothing as yet that you were aware of that they were 
putting on the table? 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 72 of 142 
 
MS MANDINDI:   By the time I left, Chair, there was not 
anything strong enough to justify, so to say, the action that 
we had already taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MANDINDI:   And secondly, I recall the one meeting 
where 
they 
were 
briefing 
the 
committee 
about 
their 
findings.  So by the time I left it had not quite solidified in 
terms of process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Well, I just want to mention, 
you do not have to comment on this, that having heard in 
10 
recent weeks evidence relating to the suspension of 
executives at Eskom and how that process happened, and 
hearing from you how this process of the suspension of 
executives at Denel happened, there seems to be certain 
common features.  At Eskom it was also a Board that was 
appointed in 2015, it was a new Board, when they 
suspended four executives there, the CEO, the Financial 
Director, and somebody else, and two others, also under 
circumstances that were quite questionable, but one or 
more of the board members at the time who was giving 
20 
evidence here has already said that he thinks that they 
should not have suspended the executives, he thinks there 
was not a proper basis and so the CEO there was 
suspended and the Financial Director.  The board members 
were fairly new and wouldn’t have known much about the 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 73 of 142 
 
abilities of the executives, new people or officials that 
were also put in, board members being new would not have 
known a lot about the abilities of people to be appointed 
at, but like in your case at Denel it may be that there might 
have 
been 
a 
committee 
that 
might 
have 
had 
more 
interactions with some executives within the short space of 
time than the rest of the Board members, and Dentons is a 
common feature in Eskom, Dentons was brought in to do an 
investigation as well and here at Denel Dentons was 
brought in as well, ja so there may be other features so I 
10 
just mention that. 
 
Are you done?   Yes.  Maybe let’s take the short 
adjournment, yes because I see it is twenty five to twelve, 
and then when we come back we can just finish her 
evidence. 
 
We will take the short adjournment and we will 
resume at ten to twelve.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let’s continue.  Your mic, you may 
switch on your mic as well Ms Mandindi. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair, there is a reference 
to the Denton’s report, if I can just for your assistance 
Chair indicate that the Denton’s draft report is to be found 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 74 of 142 
 
in an exhibit bundle that I believe may have been made 
available to you Chair, it’s called Exhibit WAT, and it is a 
bundle of various reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And there’s a draft report from 
Denton’s to be found at page 06-03. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said Bundle 06? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, it is WAT – sorry I beg your 
pardon, it is Bundle 06 correct, and it is Exhibit WAT, at 
page 3, if I can just indicate I have shown Ms Mandindi the 
10 
report now but she would need more time to familiarise 
herself, to confirm that that is in fact her report, so I am 
not – I don’t propose to lead her on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And the current Chair will deal in her 
evidence with a later report that was received very recently 
from Denton’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So I propose Chair to leave that 
topic, which was the main topic to be dealt with, with this 
20 
witness.  May I now deal with another topic Ms Mandindi 
and that is the establishment of Denel Asia, may I take you 
again to your affidavit and you will find that at page 8, 
paragraph 31 and 33.   
 
Now you indicate that during October 2015, this is 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 75 of 142 
 
paragraph 31, if my memory serves me correctly I read the 
board pack pertaining to the establishment of Denel Asia 
by way of a joint venture between Denel and Malaysia, 
Asia, so was this an example of where the Board got it 
right that you were given a board pack that contained the 
material necessary to prepare on before the board meeting 
would discuss it? 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes Chair that was the agenda of a 
particular meeting, part of the agenda of a board meeting.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, and what did you understand 
10 
was being proposed for your consideration at the level of 
the Board, a joint venture, and what was this joint venture 
for? 
MS MANDINDI:  The joint venture was the establishment of 
an entity which would be Denel Asia, to enable Denel to 
pursue business opportunities in Asia in all that region 
effectively.      
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you took a view about what was 
being proposed, was the Board being asked to give a 
decision to approve this venture? 
20 
MS MANDINDI:  There were two aspects, one it was the 
aspect of approving the establishment of the entity Denel 
Asia, and then there was also the aspect of approving the 
association with VR Laser who would be our JV partner at 
that time.  
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 76 of 142 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right and you indicate in paragraph 
32 that you were of a particular view that the Denel Asia 
deal was a set aside of government processes and I was 
concerned 
about 
the 
sovereign 
IP 
of 
our 
defence 
innovations not being sufficiently protected.  Let’s just 
unpack that, was this a view that you had raised with your 
Board colleagues at the Board meeting? 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes Chair, yes Chair, I did raise the 
concern at our board meeting when we discussed this, that 
there didn’t seem to have been a process to secure VR 
10 
Laser as our partner to start off with, so VR Laser was then 
enjoying an exclusive arrangement with Denel which would 
enable them also to access the Asia market and then the 
second aspect of my concern centred around the benefit 
flow to VR Laser as a result of that agreement, because 
then any other entity, South African entity that would have 
been interested to do some work for Denel couldn’t access 
those opportunities because they were ring-fenced, they 
seemed to be ring-fenced, that was my interpretation of the 
deal as structured Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What do mean when you say you thought 
it was a set-aside of government the deal, Denel Asia deal, 
what does it mean?    
MS MANDINDI:  Set aside would mean that nothing related 
to that business and the flow of the benefits would then be 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 77 of 142 
 
open to tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so that it would be the transaction 
would not be open to going through open tender?  
MS MANDINDI:  No Chair, if that transaction then was with 
VR Laser then the flow of the benefits would accrue to VR 
Laser, it wouldn’t go back to a process of tendering within 
Denel and open it up to other service providers or 
manufacturers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is what you mean when you 
say you thought it was a set aside. 
10 
MS MANDINDI:   It sounded like that, the whole structure 
felt like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So am I right in understanding Mr 
Mandindi that what you’re really saying is that you were 
concerned that the process being followed would conflict 
with government procurement process requirements? 
MS MANDINDI:  It will Chair, the governance aspects of it 
were concerning.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you also had concerns 
20 
about the sovereign IP of our defence innovations, it is 
Denel’s intellectual property? 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes, yes Chair  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that wasn’t being sufficiently 
protected and then in paragraph 33 you say effectively all 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 78 of 142 
 
manufacturing would have gone to VR Laser so effectively 
that would have given them an exclusive right to do the 
manufacturing for the Denel Asia project, is that correct? 
MS 
MANDINDI: 
 That 
was 
my 
interpretation 
of 
the 
transaction Chair, and again there I am beginning to deal 
with a broader issue where government has spent on 
research and development of IP and innovation aspects 
and it applies to a whole lot of other entities, and then 
when those entities partner with other private sector 
individuals that IP is not protected and accrue value back 
10 
to government, so I was concerned about that principle 
that 
there 
should 
be 
value 
that 
is 
ring-fenced 
to 
government, especially this one, it is defence IP and it 
deals with the issues of the sovereignty of our defence IP 
as a nation so I was concerned that we didn’t seem to be 
paying much attention to the protection of the IP and just 
partnering with someone, obviously they will have access 
to those aspects of our business without protection of 
Denel so they can reproduce it whatever the case may be, 
so those are the issues I was raising at that point.   
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  Maybe then turn to the 
last page of your affidavit, page 9, and you deal in various 
paragraphs with the adverse publicity, the negative media 
that was circulating at around the time of 2016 and you 
were concerned about reputational damage and then you 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 79 of 142 
 
refer to your resignation in paragraph 37, I am going to 
come back to paragraph 36 in a moment, and then in 
paragraph 38 you deal with your understanding that your 
initial appointment had followed correct meeting processes, 
and just confirm on the last point you were answering there 
a question posed by the investigators of this Commission, 
is that right? 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And is that how you came to give the 
affidavit, you were invited as an ex Board member to 
10 
answer various questions? 
MS MANDINDI:  Yes Chair.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Do you know whether the other Board 
members 
have 
provided 
similar 
cooperation 
to 
the 
Commission? 
MS MANDINDI:   I am not aware, I am not in touch with the 
Board members Chair so I cannot confirm that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright, thank you.  Now I just want 
to go back to something you raised earlier about the AR, 
the Audit & Risk Committee and a report that they had 
20 
produced.  The Chairperson of the ARC, that committee, 
you couldn’t remember her name, may I just ask you if the 
name is Ms Mpo Ramogwe[?]. 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes that is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that correct name, thank you.  And 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 80 of 142 
 
do you have a copy of the ARC  
MS MANDINDI:   No Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair may I just indicate that we 
have been informed by Denel that they have been unable 
to track down a copy of that report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The current Chairperson will address 
in her evidence shortly the fact that some records have 
been difficult and in some cases impossible to trace. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
10 
MS MANDINDI:   And again Chair it deals with what I 
raised earlier around the company tablets that we had 
because 
all 
the 
information 
and 
Board 
packs 
were 
circulated through those gadgets so unfortunately when 
you resign you hand it over, so it is difficult to keep track 
of the records in a way that you would ordinarily have 
access to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now the final issue if I may, that I 
would like to raise with Ms Mandindi is in your affidavit 
20 
paragraph 36.  May I read it out? 
“I had my reservations as to the expertise and 
experience of the other Board members and in 
particular was not convinced that the Chairperson 
of the ARC [that we have established is Ms 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 81 of 142 
 
Ramogwe] was strong enough for the portfolio and 
recommended to Mr Mantsha, Chairperson, that  a 
chartered accountant should be considered for the 
portfolio of Chairperson of the ARC to ensure that 
there is adequate oversight by the Committee.” 
Could you confirm that that was your view and whether you 
conveyed that to Mr Mantsha or the rest of the Board. 
MS MANDINDI:   To the Chairman I did, in a conversation 
thought it was never reduced in writing and again it is just 
sharing my insights on the Board and maybe areas we can 
10 
improve in, so it was in that spirit, it wasn’t ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It was not formal? 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes, it wasn’t instructive.  I just felt that 
Denel is a huge organisation, it is a big business, and we 
needed a stronger experienced Chairman of the Audit 
Committee, 
the 
Audit 
Committee 
carries 
a 
lot 
of 
responsibility and we needed someone more experienced 
in chairing an audit committee to ensure that adequate 
oversight is exercised and also someone who would be 
able to just look out for the governance issues that may be 
20 
lacking or not lacking Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well there was evidence last year in 
regard to Denel and I think an official of the Department of 
Public Enterprises who analysed the qualifications and 
skills and abilities of the Board members who testified that 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 82 of 142 
 
there was no balance in terms of skills and expertise that 
would be required.  I seem to remember that there seemed 
to be a lot of lawyers and there might not have been a 
chartered accountant or there might have been one, I can’t 
remember, but I seem to think there wasn’t any in that 
Board, because there was a document that was presented 
which showed who had what qualifications, who had what 
skills and what experiences they had, so when you 
mentioned the point that you suggested to Mr Mantsha that 
the Chair of the ARC Committee or of the ARC should be a 
10 
chartered accountant that reminds me that there was 
criticism of that Board in terms of the skills. 
MS MANDINDI:   Yes Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair, those are questions 
for this witness, thank you very much.

ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair.  Good morning Ms

MS HLAHLA:  Good morning.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is it correct that you have provided 
the Commission, at its request, with an affidavit? 
MS HLAHLA:   Yes sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And may I ask you in the file in front 
of you to look at Exhibit W9, that is file Denel Bundle 01, 
Exhibit W9 and if I can ask you please to look at the first 
page of the affidavit at page 42, if you would look at the 
20 
numbers on the top, printed on the top left, not the top 
right, the top left, the black, that’s correct, Denel 0142, do 
you see that? 
MS HLAHLA:   0142.  I am on page 0142. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And is this the first page of the 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 85 of 142 
 
affidavit that you have signed? 
MS HLAHLA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And may I ask you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You just have to raise your voice Ms 
Hlahla. 
MS HLAHLA:   Yes that is the first page of my affidavit. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, and can I ask you to turn 
in the same bundle, using again the pages on the top left, 
page 86. 
MS HLAHLA:   Yes.  I am on page 86.  
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that your signature? 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct so it is my signature. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, alright thank you.   Ms Hlahla 
you are currently he Chairperson of the Board of Directors 
of Denel? 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   When did ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, do you want me to admit it? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes I beg your pardon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Ms Hlahla do you confirm that the 
20 
contents of your affidavit are true and correct? 
MS HLAHLA:   They are correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you would like me Mr Kennedy to 
admit her affidavit as exhibit? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes please Chair. 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 86 of 142 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   As Exhibit what, W9? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes it will be W9. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavit of Monhla Wilma Hlahla, 
starting at page 42 will be admitted as Exhibit W9. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I propose to focus only on certain 
aspects of the affidavits today Ms Hlahla because it’s very 
detailed and clear, your involvement as Chair of the Board 
of Directors, you’re appointed by the Minister of Public 
10 
Enterprises, Mr Gordhan, is that correct? 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct Counsel. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you say that that appointment 
was on the 9 t h of April 2018, did you take up the 
appointment on that day or any other day can you recall? 
MS HLAHLA:   We started on the 8 t h of April as an Acting 
Board yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, and what is your own 
background, very briefly in a sentence or two? 
MS HLAHLA:   My technical training I have a Masters in 
20 
Urban Planning from UCLA School of Architecture and 
Planning, I have got my junior degree from ...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry Ms Hlahla I think your voice 
is probably by nature very soft, so please just raise it and 
maybe speak closer to the mic, I cannot hear you.  Can you 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 87 of 142 
 
just start afresh on answering the question of your 
background, just start again. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I just make a suggestion Chair, 
apropos your comment, can I suggest, I know the human 
inclination is to look at the person who is asking the 
question but then you tend to look away from the Chair and 
the microphone, so can I just ask your ears to listen to the 
question and not to look at me, rather look in the direction 
of the Chair and you will find that that will be easier for 
him as well as the microphone.  
10 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, so can you just repeat 
what you said. 
MS HLAHLA:  I have a Master ’s degree in Urban Regional 
Planning from UCLA School of Architecture and Planning 
and over the years I have acquired vast experience in 
infrastructure development, planning and finance and I got 
several certificates in governance as well as management 
and the like, but I want to say that I am one of the few 
people that grew out of SOE’s, and have learnt vastly to 
20 
appreciate 
the 
role 
they 
can 
play 
in 
different 
circumstances.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now if I can take you please to page 
46 in your affidavit you deal with the composition of the 
current Board, in paragraph 3 your name and your 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 88 of 142 
 
background, not the qualifications but the experience the 
work that you have been involved in is set out in 321, is 
that right? 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you set out the other 
directors, 
there 
are 
twelve 
non-executive 
and 
two 
executive directors, is that correct? 
MS HLAHLA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you were all appointed at around 
the same time, April/May 2018 for a three year period? 
10 
MS HLAHLA:   That is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you refer at page 48 paragraph 
32.14 as I understand it two individuals who at one stage 
served on the Board which you chair that have since left, 
Mr Zwelakhe Ntshepe was Group Chief Executive. 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Would he have sat on the Board in 
that capacity as an executive director? 
MS HLAHLA:   Yes sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And Madododwa Mhlwana who is he? 
20 
MS HLAHLA:   The Chief Financial Officer or Finance 
Director of Denel. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you then continue to say in your 
affidavit 
Mr 
Ntshepe 
resigned 
and 
Mr 
Mhlwana 
was 
disciplined and dismissed, was that during the period of 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 89 of 142 
 
the Board under your chairmanship chairpersonship? 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right and then Ntshepe was replaced 
after his resignation by Mr du Toit, is Mr du Toit still with 
Denel? 
MS HLAHLA:    No he resigned recently to pursue other 
interests. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:    And then you refer to Mr Sadick, is it 
Mr or Ms Sadick who is acting Group Chief Executive 
currently?  
10 
MS HLAHLA:   Mr Taliep Sadick is the Acting Group CEO 
of Denel currently. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right, thank you, and then Mr 
Mhlwana after he was dismissed after a disciplinary 
process was succeeded by Le Grange and is that still the 
case? 
MS HLAHLA:   It is still the case.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   As CFO? 
MS HLAHLA:   Yes sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right thank you.  If I can just take 
20 
you back to paragraph 3.2.3 there’s a reference to one of 
the 
other 
directors 
Ms 
Manso 
Kabelo 
Lehloenya, 
a 
chartered accountant, is she still on the Board?   
MS HLAHLA:   The process to accept a resignation is 
underway 
between 
Denel 
and 
the 
Minister, 
she 
has 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 90 of 142 
 
subsequently resigned. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Please speak clearly please? 
MS HLAHLA:   Ms Lehloenya has resigned as a director, 
non-executive 
director 
of 
Denel 
and 
the 
process 
is 
underway with the shareholder to process that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.   And what was her normal 
post to which she was appointed apart – at the time of her 
resignation from the Denel Board, did she have any other 
capacity in government? 
MS HLAHLA:   Yes sir, Ms Lehloenya was the Chief 
10 
Financial Officer for the Department of Health of Gauteng. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And so she has stepped aside from 
the Denel Board now. 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Of the current members of the 
Board whose names and details are set out in this 
paragraph were any on the previous Board? 
MS HLAHLA:   Yes sir, we are unusually enriched with 
people with experiences of Denel in the past, and I would 
like to recognise the – and may his soul rest in peace – we 
20 
also had Lekhurleni as a member of this Board and he 
passed away recently, may his soul rest in peace.  In 
addition to that Mr Taliep Sadick who is now Acting Group 
CEO for Denel had actually been an Executive of Denel in 
the past and then in addition to that we have had Dr 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 91 of 142 
 
Sibusisi Sasibisi he had been Chair of Denel in the past.  I 
think that would complete the three individuals who were 
part of this Board that had also served in one form or the 
other if not on the Board of Denel in the past. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Those that you say were members of the 
Board in the past is it people who were members of the 
Board of Denel at some stage or another or is it people 
who were part of the Board that was before your Board? 
MS HLAHLA:   They were members of the Board way in the 
past, not the most recent Board that we took from. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the Board that you took from was 
the Board that was chaired by Mr Mantsha? 
MS HLAHLA:   It was the Board that was chaired by Mr 
Mantsha and I can confirm that it continued into our board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright thank you.   And then if I can 
ask you please to move ahead in your affidavit to page 50, 
50 paragraph 4 you then refer to the next governance 
structure being the executive committee comprising the 
Group CEO, the Group CFO, the Group COO and Group 
20 
Human Resources and Transformation Officer.  Is that 
correct? 
MS HLAHLA:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And that executive committee does that 
then report to the board? 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 92 of 142 
 
MS HLAHLA:  That executive committee would then report to 
the board.  The would represent all of management’s work 
and fill into the board. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
The 
– 
the 
Group 
COO 
and 
the 
Transformation Officer are they two different people or is it 
one person? 
MS HLAHLA:  Two different people Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  Ms Hlahla you then deal 
10 
ion paragraph 5 with the state in which the board found 
Denel.  Now I am not going to ask you to go into all of the 
detail that you have set out in – in this paragraph but can 
you just sum up in a couple of sentences why you refer in 
your affidavit in paragraph 5.1 to your being appointed at a 
time when Denel was in what you refer to as a crisis mode?  
Why was there a crisis at Denel – what respects when you 
took over as the new – newly appointed board in mid-2018? 
MS HLAHLA:  Denel sadly was in a deep liquidity crisis 
whereby the company did not know whether they would be 
20 
able to cover costs of staff.  We have suppliers that needed 
to be paid as well.  But the shortage of cash was so dire that 
you were aware that the company was unusually unbusy 
because they were not producing stuff because of lack of 
money and there was just general confusion.  The company 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 93 of 142 
 
looked headless as if there was no leadership.  And 
obviously the staff and management would then look up to 
this new board as if it would – it would have a magic wand 
when in fact we are – all going to be part of the same 
solution to figure out what caused it and how to get out of it.  
But it was almost a hopeless scenario in the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to say for how long it 
appeared that Denel was in that situation at the time you 
came in or are you not able to say?  In other words this 
liquidity crisis that you talking about that I understand you to 
10 
say you found Denel in when your board came in.  Did it – 
was it something that had been there for quite some time or 
is that something you are not able to tell me? 
MS HLAHLA:  Sir for a situation like that to arise it must 
have started a while ago. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know how long? 
MS HLAHLA:    It is almost impossible that you only find out 
today when you cannot pay month to month that there is a 
crisis.  It means that the indicators of shortages of cash 
must have started somewhere in the past but maybe you 
20 
managed to survive for a while but now the chickens have 
come home to roost and the very people that are important 
and critical to your business are looking at you – your 
suppliers, your customers.  And importantly Denel itself to be 
able to produce the goods and services that they serve 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 94 of 142 
 
globally in the name of South Africa you are not investing in 
it.  A crisis of that nature starts for a while.  The indicators 
are that we came at the heart of it – the end of it almost. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well for what it is worth I just mention that 
I heard evidence from I think – I do not know if it was 
Professor Van Rensburg or Ms Van Rensburg who was 
chairperson of the board that was before the board that was 
chaired by Mr Mantsha who gave evidence that when they 
left Denel was if I recall correctly in a very good position 
financially and they had a plan and everything was going 
10 
quite well in terms of what the board had in place to make 
sure that it continued to do quite well.  So I thought I would 
just mention that there was that evidence that was given 
from.  Yes Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Hlahla then you 
refer in paragraph 5.1 was what your focus as the new board 
has been on addressing this crisis mode.  You refer there to 
going 
into 
the 
business 
decline 
and 
liquidity 
crisis, 
investigating allegations of fraud and mis-management.  We 
are going to deal with that in a little detail later.  Taking 
20 
control of the business environment to address issues with 
leadership and then looking at governance 514 to ensure 
compliance with the PFMA and related legislation.  And 5.2 
you deal with some PFMA related deliverables can you just 
tell the Chair please the external audit process.  There has 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 95 of 142 
 
been a change of external auditors and it is – am I correct in 
understanding the current external auditor is now the Auditor 
General? 
MS HLAHLA:  Correct Sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then secondly revising the 
corporate plan and shareholder compact.  Has that been 
completed? 
MS HLAHLA:  Yes Sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then you say: 
“Determining immediate liquidity relief to 
10 
resume payment of salaries.” 
 
What is – have you resolved that currently or is that 
still a problem? 
MS HLAHLA:  That is still a problem and it is become even 
more because we have to also catch up on the payment of 
historical liabilities that eat up the available cash for Denel 
to reinvest in its business. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright now if we can turn to your 
heading Key Learnings and Observations again I am just 
going to focus on some of the – some of the points.  You set 
20 
out here in summary form the findings of yourselves as the 
board and its chairperson.  5.4 sets out the foot of this page 
51 going over to the next few pages a number of findings 
that you - that you made including poor governance 
structures and financial management.  Is that correct? 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 96 of 142 
 
MS HLAHLA:  Correct Sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Then you refer to a lack of enforcement 
of 
framework 
or 
governance 
being 
sufficiently 
robust 
manifesting in such issues as irregular expenditure and in 
the –  in the previous financial year 2017 to 2018 and there 
was no record of consequential management.  Now without 
delving into the detail just as a bird’s eye view can you just 
indicate to the Chair what you found? 
MS HLAHLA:  So the lack of – the general lack of 
appreciation of the need to comply was very glaring and we 
10 
were not sure whether it is because everyone is stressed 
they do not know if they are going to get paid or is it just the 
way things are at Denel.  Things you would assume that 
every SOE would be well acquainted with that their finance 
teams will meet with the Treasury monthly to look at how to 
provide numbers and to comply.  There was simply a general 
– almost a general lack of awareness and therefore 
accountability.  That is how I would summarise it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright thank you.  And then 543 you 
talk of a lack of compliance with the relevant regulatory and 
20 
governance framework and policies and you give us an 
example Denel Asia.  Denel Asia of course was a venture 
that – that has been the subject of evidence already and will 
be the evidence of – of further witnesses later.  And then in 
544 Ms Hlahla you deal with some issue relating to minutes 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 97 of 142 
 
of meetings for governance structures such as the board and 
its committees and general company records.  That these 
were not captured or they were inadequate or were not 
retained.  Just explain to the Chair please what you – what 
you were able find or not find? 
MS HLAHLA:  Chair one of the biggest risks for boards of 
SOE’s today is the ability of the company secretariat function 
to deliver on its mandate.  Meaning that they take your 
minutes – meaning they recording it on some instrument – 
they write them down – they get approved – they get stored 
10 
so that any time you need to find out what happened 
historically you are able to find it.  The lack of information 
management around minutes in the case of Denel makes it 
impossible for you to even learn from the past because you 
are always looking.  But also the – exacerbated by the fact 
that the company secretary who came from the previous era 
also resigned.  So you were really left without a person with 
a memory and on the files where you expected to find 
anything the logic that you would otherwise expect is not 
there. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And is it correct that the legal team as 
well as the team of investigators from the commission has a 
number of time being asking Denel witnesses such as 
yourself and management to assist with minutes some of 
which have been found but others cannot be traced. 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 98 of 142 
 
MS HLAHLA:  It is correct Sir and I was worried that it would 
end up making us lose credibility when in fact we are all 
digging up in a hole trying to assist.  The reality is we should 
all remember that information management of such critical 
information is a heart of a business.  When you do not have 
it no-one is going to trust you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you might or might not have known 
about this but the reports I received last year and early this 
year in terms of attempts by the legal team and the 
investigators 
to 
obtain 
various 
documents 
from 
Denel 
10 
particularly through whoever was the company secretary 
where to the effect that there was not proper cooperation.  
And at a certain stage I had instructed that compulsion be 
used.  I do not know how far that went but there seemed to 
be no cooperation at all certainly from whoever was the 
company secretary towards the end of last year and early 
this year. 
MS HLAHLA:  I can promise you Sir the team of the 
commission raised the issue directly with the board Chair 
and then we could make a concerted effort to also find out 
20 
where the gaps are and report accordingly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS HLAHLA:  It was unfortunate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Sorry.  Who provide the function of 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 99 of 142 
 
company secretary now Ms Hlahla? 
MS HLAHLA:  On taking over as a board the easiest thing to 
do was to contract out the company secretariat role and the 
company Fluid Rock has been able to provide us a 
consistent number of very senior people and it has been very 
helpful to bring our board minutes up to date as well as 
those of EXCO.  Because what we share with you in terms of 
gaps of information you can duplicate it every structure of 
the governance structure of Denel.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  If I may now proceed to paragraph 5.5 
10 
of your affidavit.  That is at page 54.  You refer to the 
financial status the fact that you found Denel had cash flow 
challenges and was in liquidity crisis, banks and the note 
holders were withholding support and there was very poor 
representation of the financial status of the company.  Now 
you have indicated to the Chair that that is – that there is 
still a serious financial issue in relation to Denel.  I would 
just like you to explain to the Chair please in 552 what you 
referring 
to 
when 
you 
state 
there 
was 
very 
poor 
representation of the financial status of the company when 
20 
you took over as chair? 
MS HLAHLA:  Within the first week of engaging the treasury 
our shareholder finance division in the DPE, the banks, the 
statement or the biggest ask to the board and the chair were 
that your financial data, your numbers are so unreliable that 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 100 of 142 
 
if there was one thing you can do for us is to get Denel help 
to give us credible numbers, we cannot go on like this.  And 
unfortunately with the Auditor General taking over now as 
our external auditor between the AG and ourselves it has 
been a journey to now get that credibility right because now 
the AG has forced us to go backwards in years to correct a 
lot of the mistakes in the financial statements and I am 
pleased to say that the AG has also identified already areas 
of improvement that have been made. But a lot is still to be 
done 
to 
give 
the 
full 
credibility 
of 
Denel’s 
financial 
10 
statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So must I read or do I read that – or 
understand that paragraph or sentence correctly.  If I think it 
means that the financial statements did not correctly reflect 
the financial status of the company? 
MS HLAHLA:  According to the Auditor General every year 
they would highlight.  That is why our statements were 
qualified it is because there were always major areas around 
historical contracts, how we interrupted what is revenue that 
we have to go back without people that had been in the 
20 
business to find all contracts and interpret them correctly in 
the financial statements.  And for an old company like Denel 
it is a lot of work but I am pleased that the AG and – and the 
extra teams that we have had to hire when we do not have 
enough money have made some good improvements. But it 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 101 of 142 
 
will take Denel a little while to actually say we are there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether that – the impression 
is 
that 
that 
may 
have 
come 
about 
as 
a 
result 
of 
misrepresentation or – or incompetence or both?  Or is that 
something that you do not know and whether also what the 
AG’s opinion is as to what brought that about? 
MS HLAHLA:  The AG does pronounce a lot on it.  But 
because it is our second year we are now two and a half 
years in their comments on the financial statements each 
year become more and more clearer of what they see.  But I 
10 
am hoping that from them, ourselves we will get to a stage 
where we understand what really caused it because some of 
it is incompetency but some of it is simply confusing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just that when one hears this kind of – 
these kinds of stories about an SOE like Denel which I think 
I was told in evidence last year that at some stage being I 
think the envy of such entities internationally was highly 
regarded just like I was told Eskom once upon a time was 
really highly regarded internationally.  When you hear what 
they seemed to have become it is – even just as a citizen it 
20 
is kind of distressing. 
MS HLAHLA:  Very distressing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say how do we take an entity that is 
highly regarded internationally as an entity that is well run – 
professionally run that it envied internationally.  Whose 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 102 of 142 
 
personnel are respected because of this to a point where 
one hears the kinds of things that one is – hears about Denel 
and Eskom.  It is distressing.  But of course it will not help 
us to just feel distressed we must play a part to try and bring 
back the days of glory in those entities and there are enough 
men and women in South Africa who would be committed to 
do that and would work hard to bring that about.  So maybe 
one day we will feel that we are back in those days. 
MS HLAHLA:  I cannot wait Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Mr Kennedy. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   [Not speaking into the microphone]. 
MS HLAHLA:  Correct Sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you my microphone was not on.  
I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  May I just – may I just put the question 
again – I apologise for being remiss. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes yes ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Paragraph 5.7 refers to investigations 
by Dentons 571 and by Ngidi Business Advisory 572.  Am I 
20 
correct in understanding that those investigations were 
commissioned prior to your taking up office as the new 
chairperson of the new board? 
MS HLAHLA:  Correct Sir we in fact inherited draft reports 
from those investigations. 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 103 of 142 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes and you refer to the draft report 
from Dentons which dealt with the acquisition of Denel 
vehicle systems and the draft report Chair is the one that 
was referred to earlier in the previous witness you will find 
that Chair I am not going to take the witness to it to Bundle 
06 Denel Bundle 06 Exhibit W18.  Now your affidavit then 
goes on Mr Hlahla to talk of the updated report and that is – 
that was dated the 18 October just a – just over a week ago.  
So was that recently received by you? 
MS HLAHLA:  Yes Sir and I think thanks to the process that 
10 
you have undertaken.  I think we can now say that Denton 
has provided a final report.  It is sitting with our Audit 
Committee and I am hoping to at least receive it at the board 
level once they have engaged it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Sorry it needs to be processed by the 
Audit Committee.  They will then report on that to you as the 
board. 
MS HLAHLA:  Yes Sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And you will then have to consider it 
and take action if you feel it appropriate.  We have not been 
20 
as a legal team been given a copy of that – of that final 
updated report.  Is it possible to make arrangements to have 
that made available to the commission? 
MS HLAHLA:  Certainly Sir I will request the Audit 
Committee and I hope that the commission will remember 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 104 of 142 
 
that it has not as yet served on the board for consideration 
but I am sure that we can request my counsel and make sure 
that it is made available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I – hoping that the board would deal 
with it … 
MS HLAHLA:  Urgently. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Soon. 
MS HLAHLA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The legal team will reflect on whether we 
need to see it before the board sees it if at all possible we 
10 
can see it after the board has seen it.  But if there are 
reasons that require that we see it before I am sure there 
will be discussions to see how that can be agreed. 
MS HLAHLA:  We will try and see if the – the Audit 
Committee and the board cannot meet you halfway Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  But am I right to say they seem to 
have taken quite long Dentons from 2016 to 2020 or do I 
misunderstand something to investigate this LSSA issue? 
MS HLAHLA:  My understanding is that at some point the 
position they took was to refuse to go any further in dealings 
20 
with Denel.  It would appear that between our management 
which is our executives trying to get a final report issued 
there was just a misunderstanding or lack of cooperation.  
But I am just pleased that they have actually issued it final. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there may have been a period when 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 105 of 142 
 
nothing was happening because of whatever. 
MS HLAHLA:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Misunderstandings? 
MS HLAHLA:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  Ms Hlahla then you deal 
with 
the 
other 
draft 
report 
received 
from 
the 
other 
investigators 
Ngidi 
572 
of 
your 
affidavit. 
 And 
as 
I 
understand it there has only been a draft report. 
MS HLAHLA:  Yes Sir. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Is that correct? 
MS HLAHLA:  Correct Sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It has never been finalised? 
MS HLAHLA:  Correct Sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And do you know whether it is going to 
be finalised? 
MS HLAHLA:  The confirmation from management and the 
Audit Committee is that Ngidi have flatly refused to take that 
study further.  And you will recognise that the board then did 
the next reports because we had to do an investigation 
20 
regardless of whether they wanted to proceed or not.  That is 
as far as I know sitting here today. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  May we then turn to your next 
section paragraph 6 which is the work done by the board to 
date and I am not going to Chair unless you would like me to 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 106 of 142 
 
go in any detail through this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no it is not necessary. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  It is before you in 
considerable detail and it is very clearly set out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  They have been numerous steps taken 
by you as Chair and your colleagues as board members to 
try and improve things within Denel and its management and 
with other stakeholders such as employees, unions, banks, 
the attorney – the Auditor General looking at instilling an 
10 
ethical culture and trust, improving morale and the like.  
Correct? 
MS HLAHLA:  Correct Sir.  There are still good people in 
Denel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MS HLAHLA:  There are still good people in the middle of 
the kills. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS HLAHLA:  That will take a mound like this and save their 
own company. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Then for those who were not good 
people if I could take you to 610 where there were 
allegations 
of 
misconduct 
and 
irregularity 
against 
executives.  Disciplinary proceedings have been instituted, 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 107 of 142 
 
correct? 
MS HLAHLA:  Correct Sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And that resulted in the dismissals of 
the previous GCFO, - just give me the name of that person? 
MS HLAHLA:  This is our former Group Finance Director it 
is.. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mhlwana. 
MS HLAHLA:  Mhlwana – Mr Mhlwana. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right and also the previous GE 
strategy who is that? 
10 
MS HLAHLA:  I have given you the name somewhere and I 
cannot remember the name now Sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  And then you have also referred 
to invest – internal investigation of Supply Chain Processes 
and a review of the SCM Policy.  Has that been completed – 
the SCM Policy review? 
MS HLAHLA:  A lot of work it is actually an understatement 
because we had just given you excerpts of what we have 
done in a big attempt to overall procurement.  At the heart of 
the weaknesses in SOE’s today is tightening that area so it 
20 
is – it is an on-going set of works – work streams. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then in 6.1.14 one of the steps that 
you have indicated as being taken by the board involves a 
review 
of 
the 
company’s 
delegation 
authority. 
 As 
I 
understand it to tighten up what may have been too – too 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 108 of 142 
 
much latitude given to specific members of management and 
that is now tightened up, is that correct? 
MS HLAHLA:  Correct Sir.  In particular we inherited an odd 
situation where between the board and management’s 
executive committee a new structure was placed in between 
without minutes, without proper delegation but with enough 
power to make recommendations to the board.  And we had 
to immediately restore the powers of an executive committee 
which is the normal governance framework that we are used 
to and to remove that layer in between. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now I would like to skip through pretty 
quickly the next few sections.  6.2 gives further details in 
relation 
to 
issues 
raised 
by 
the 
auditor 
general 
and 
strengthening of the financial function.   
 
Then 6.3 on page 60 deals with progress that you have 
made as a result of those interventions that have been 
itemised before.   
 
Both financial and regulatory governance controls as 
well as other steps in relation to the business.  At 6.3.3 you 
referred to exiting certain contracts.  Why did you exit 
20 
contracts? 
MS HLAHLA:   In the termination of our managers and 
supported by us, the reasons would include our conditions 
being onerous.   
 
In some instances, because we had used the money, 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 109 of 142 
 
what happens in Denel programmes because of their size.   
 
The common practise in project management is that the 
project owners would give you an advance payment so that 
you can start analyses the designs and preparing for the 
project.   
 
So those advanced payments for the programmes, Denel 
had used for working capital instead of using them on the 
project.   
 
And we just had to settle the liabilities associated with 
those so that the challenge does not grow bigger year-on-
10 
year.  And some of them were terminated because of those 
reasons.   
 
And it is not because Denel does not think those 
countries were important.  Yes, they are.  But the liabilities 
associated with those programmes were just too big for 
Denel to continue with.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you have indicated that contract 
which have now been exited because of the onerous nature 
of those contracts.  Instances are contracts with the DCR, 
Chad and Venezuela.  Correct? 
20 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   On a more optimistic note.  You refer 
in 6.3.4 to pursue in a winnable pipeline which you hope will 
provide a solid base for the continued implementation of the 
turnaround plan and grow the business.   
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 110 of 142 
 
 
And in 6.3.5 you refer to Denel maintaining its strong 
brand within the global defence sectors.  So despite its 
problems, financial regulatory and otherwise, does Denel 
still have in general a positive image and reputation in the 
international marketplace? 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, sir.  Although, we must not 
underestimate how much Denel has been damaged.  The 
reality is that, because of its unique specialisations amongst 
some of their products, Denel continues to have people 
knocking on its doors, wanting their services.   
10 
 
It is finding the right way to see those green shoots to 
provide a good base for Denel going forward.  It is quite 
unique.  It does not dried(?) up a hundred percent. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Thank you.  You refer then to 
some improvements noted by the auditor general in 6.4 and 
then 6.5, that is certain areas on which the board remains 
focussed to ensure that Denel achieves objectives, such as 
ethical leadership, corporate governance, et cetera. 
MS HLAHLA:   Yes, sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Can we... and then you also deal with 
20 
strategic objectives for stabilising particular aspects of the 
business in 6.6.  Now Ms Hlahla, your affidavit then 
proceeds to raise from page 64 in paragraph 7 a number of 
investigations commissioned by the board.   
 
Now as I understand it, what then follows, starting with 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 111 of 142 
 
the BDOPS Advisory Report.  It follows investigations 
commissioned by the board of which you were chair at the 
time and still are, correct? 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So this is not the two reports of the 
Dentons and Engedi(?) that were referred to earlier that 
were 
commissioned 
by 
the 
previous 
board 
under 
Mr Mantsha? 
MS HLAHLA:   These are our investigations as a board. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And they relates specifically to 
10 
matters 
where 
corruption 
and 
mismanagement 
was 
suspected or alleged.  And they have been conducted under 
the instructions of the Audit Committee, paragraph 7.2.  Is 
that correct? 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And am I correct in understanding that 
the Audit Committee then considers the report of the 
investigators in each instance. 
 
And then the reports to the board for your to take any 
final decisions on whether you accept the report, whether 
20 
you 
accept 
recommendations 
and 
whether 
you 
give 
instructions and approvals for steps to be taken pursuant to 
what comes out of those reports? 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, sir.  Our Audit Committee is an 
independent and senior committee of the board.  We give 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 112 of 142 
 
them the space and the latitude to investigate to the extent 
that 
they 
can 
and 
then 
to 
let 
us 
know 
what 
their 
recommendations are in terms of an election.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now again, I am going to go through 
this fairly quickly because you summarise in some detail the 
report of the first lot of investigators that you set out in 7.4 
and that is BDOPS advisors.  And they were appointed to 
investigate 
non-adherence 
to 
policies 
procedures 
and 
legislation by corporate office of Denel employees.   
 
DLS, that is Denel Land Systems.  LMT, that is Land 
10 
Mobility Technology and Denel Vehicle Systems, DVS.  And 
that 
included... 
their 
scope 
included 
investigating 
the 
establishment of Denel Asia.   
 
And you refer in 7.4.2 to the BDO Report dated 9 May 
2019 having been provided to the Commission with the 
affidavit of Mr Taliep Sadick.  Now that has already come 
before the Commission, correct? 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then you deal, and this is where you 
deal in some detail with the findings of the BDO investigation 
20 
and its report.  And it is correct – the Chair obviously has 
that available to him – but is it correct that various 
irregularities were found to have been committed by the 
investigators, BDOPS Advisory? 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, sir. 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 113 of 142 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you analyse the various aspects 
that were investigated where such findings were made.  
From 7.5.3 you deal with procurement contracts between 
Denel and VR Laser.   
 
And 
you 
refer 
to 
three 
contracts 
that 
were 
then 
considered.  You stated elsewhere in your affidavit that VR 
Laser had in fact been a good supplier of various items to 
Denel over many years prior to these three contracts.  Is that 
correct? 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, sir. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But what was investigated, because 
there were allegations of irregularity with these contracts 
that you refer to in 7.5.3, long-term contracts with VC Laser 
in November 2014.  Sorry, a long-term contract that is seven 
years.   
 
The one awarded in November 2014 for specific holds(?) 
relating to the Badger(?) Programme.  And then 2, single 
source memoranda of agreements concurred in May and 
December 2015.   
 
The one was DLS and the other was DVS and each of 
20 
those was for a period of ten years.  Correct? 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, sir. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 And 
then 
also 
investigated...  
Paragraph 7.6 with Denel Asia and there is reference again.  
I am not going into the detail but investigation of allegations 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 114 of 142 
 
relating to the possible relationship or actual relationship 
between Mr Mantsha, Mr Ntshepe, Mr Essa and Mr Seleke. 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, sir. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 And 
allegations 
of 
a 
corrupt 
relationship 
involving 
various 
individuals 
including 
Mr Mantsha.  Travels overseas by him with the Gupta family 
linked members.  Payments for travels, et cetera.  All of that 
is set out in their report, correct? 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then your summary continues.  
10 
Transgressions in the process followed in relation to the 
incorporation of Denel Asia.  And again, the links with 
Mr Essa, various Gupta brothers.   
 
You refer to that in 7.6.3.6.  That you will find at page 70 
of your affidavit.  May I just ask, while we are looking at your 
evidence relating to Denel Asia.   
 
From your perspective as the current board chairperson 
where you have had these aspects investigated and you are 
also aware of the implications and consequences for Denel.   
 
Can you sum-up for the Chair in a sentence or two what 
20 
the upshot of the Denel Asia Project has been for Denel, its 
business, its reputation, its finances? 
MS HLAHLA:   I want to make sure I understand your 
correctly.  You, in fact, wanting to know what the impact of it 
is? 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 115 of 142 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Correct. 
MS HLAHLA:   Okay.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Has it been positive or negative? 
CHAIRPERSON:   On Denel’s reputation. 
MS HLAHLA:   It has been damning on Denel’s reputation 
and even worse on the moral(?) side.   
 
One of the key features of why, when we arrived, it 
looked like we had taken over a headless, a leaderless 
business is, because the staff, the managers, the technical 
people that you allow in a business of this nature, had no 
10 
confidence in management anymore.   
 
Denel which used to be very, very strong is suddenly 
being looked with suspect because where South African 
would use the Department of Defence and Armscor to sell 
Denel’s products to the world, suddenly Denel came up with 
this entity that was supposed to be now the new way that 
Denel engages.   
 
Unfortunately, the defence industry has got its own way 
of doing things and culture.  When you change like that, you 
can destroy relationships that have been built over a very 
20 
long time.  And I think we are still feeling the impact of that 
today. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tell me.  I know that in your affidavit you 
deal extensively with some of the challenges that your board 
found when it came into Denel.   
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 116 of 142 
 
 
Is there a single document that exists somewhere that 
gives one the state of Denel as at the time your board took 
over?  Or does one piece that together by reading different 
documents?   
 
In other words, is there a document that I can go to and 
if I want to see what was wrong with Denel when your board 
came in?  You know, 1,2, 3, 4 – whatever the list is.  To say 
this was the state of Denel or the state of affairs at Denel 
when this board came in? 
MS HLAHLA:   I wish it existed because when you deal with 
10 
non-executive directors, we tend to...  I think this was the 
most focussed attempt to put it together.  While it is not 
impossible ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Because I would like such a document, 
you know.  I... with a number of SOE’s, I would like a 
document that tells me that, particularly when you get...  I 
mean, Denel.   
 
When the board comes in after a board against which 
there were all kinds of allegations of wrongdoing.  When a 
board that comes in that is credible, I would like a document 
20 
that says this is the state in which we found this entity.   
 
A complete, you know, document, you know, which would 
then show what damage may have been caused to the entity 
before the particular board  Obviously, such a document 
would be important, also to assess the size of the job that 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 117 of 142 
 
the new board has to do.   
 
But also, such a document would be helpful to say, by 
the time that the new board came, to be able to say having 
arrived and found this entity in this situation when we left, 
this is how much we have put in place to try and rectify 
things.   
 
So much, we could not reach everything.  We could not 
do everything.  But we did so much.   
 
So that the board that comes afterwards, can then 
continue on that journey.  If it does not exist but it can be 
10 
put together, that kind of document would be very helpful. 
MS HLAHLA:   It would be an excellent handover report.  
Even for the shareholder minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS HLAHLA:   I am sure with my counsel, we can think 
about and the management team and the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS HLAHLA:   How we can look at that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS HLAHLA:   I am just fearful to overpromise. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS HLAHLA:   Given that we have got time pressures, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright.  Thank you.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Ms Hlahla, you 
have at a very broad level dealt with some of the outline in 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 118 of 142 
 
your affidavit from page 50 to 64 in paragraphs 5 and 6.  But 
perhaps you can assist the Commission by fleshing out the 
bones, as it were, in that regard in the report that the 
Chairperson has asked you to provide.   
MS HLAHLA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  May I just have a moment, 
Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now if we can turn to... back to page 
72. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Mr 
Kennedy, 
I 
think 
let 
us 
just 
acknowledge that... we have just gone past one, I think.  On 
my watch seven minutes past one. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If we might be able to finish by half-past 
one, I think we could possible agree that let us continue so 
that when we adjourn we are done. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She is done. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But I think there is a fair chance.  I 
20 
cannot give you a guarantee of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But there is a fair chance that we will 
be finished by then. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Is that fine with everybody if 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 119 of 142 
 
we do not take lunch now? 
MS HLAHLA:   I am smiling, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are fine with that.  Counsel? 
COUNSEL:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us try, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  May I take you to 7.6.4, 
page 72 of your affidavit?   
MS HLAHLA:   [No audible reply]  
10 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
This 
is 
a 
summary 
of 
the 
recommendations in the BDO Report in particular relating to 
Denel Asia opening criminal investigations against Messrs 
Ntshepe, Mantsha and Burger.   
 
Possible action against board members for the election 
of their fiduciary duties.  And your affidavit records that you 
as Denel have referred the BDO Report to the SAPS and 
also sought legal advice.   
 
From that, does one infer that... should one infer that 
you as the board have accepted the reports, the findings and 
20 
the recommendations of BDO? 
MS HLAHLA:   We have accepted the report and accepted 
the elections and have required our management to start 
acting that way immediately after that report served on the 
board.  
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 120 of 142 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you... that includes taking legal 
advice for possible action against the individuals mentioned? 
MS HLAHLA:   Yes.  And I mean, in that case, it is going to 
take another investigation, figuring out what happened in the 
board meetings.   
 
Just to make sure that you do not judging your luck 
probably(?) 
or 
act 
against 
even 
very 
good 
people 
unknowingly.   
 
It would require an additional action with the Audit 
Committee, guiding that process, taking the minutes to make 
10 
sure that we do it right and not put the company under 
disrepute.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then in paragraph 7.7 you refer to 
court papers having already been lodged to review the three 
contracts between Denel and VR Laser.   
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Has that litigation been concluded or is 
it still ongoing? 
MS HLAHLA:   It is still ongoing, sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then 7.8 refers to disciplinary 
20 
proceedings and the fact that BDP recommended that these 
be brought against the relevant individuals but you say that 
all of them have left the employee of Denel. 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct.  And then other actions are being 
looked at regardless of the fact that they are no longer in the 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 121 of 142 
 
business. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then steps have been made to 
deregister Denel Asia.  Are you receiving any cooperation 
from any other state entity in that regard? 
MS HLAHLA:   I think the SIU had been helpful on this one 
because we were dealing with a different jurisdiction and I 
am pleased that the liquidation processes are on the way.   
 
One of the difficulties was that our management could 
not even tell us who the shareholders were of Denel Asia.  
And some of those details create a lot of problems.   
10 
 
But I am pleased that the latest update I have received 
from my management and the Audit Committee is that as far 
as grounds is almost done.  Almost completed. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then in 7.10 you refer to the Anti-
corruption Unit of the Police Service.  At their request, Denel 
has submitted a statement to the police relating to the 
relationship between Denel and VR Laser based on the 
findings and recommendations of the BDO Report.  Is that 
process relating to the criminal investigation concluded or is 
it still ongoing? 
20 
MS HLAHLA:   It is still ongoing with SAPS, continuing to 
question some of our manages for further data.  What we 
have became quite aware of early is the national interest in 
issues around state capture that citizens, if not political 
parties, also do and go and lay their own charges.   
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 122 of 142 
 
 
But fundamentally, the main report that was put together 
by the Denel Board, the video report is substantially it.  And 
we have made it available to the Anti-corruption Unit.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now if we can go through the 
reference to PWC.  They were appointed to review something 
else and that is a request for loan financing by Denel to 
LNT(?) and how the funds were utilised.   
 
And 7.12 refers to - that is at the top of page 74 - refers 
to the report currently being considered by the Audit 
Committee.  Is that still the case now? 
10 
MS HLAHLA:   That is still the case, sir.  One of the things 
that they found is the fact that also we have now appointed 
an acting Group CEO and we have a new chair of Audit.   
 
But I am sure that she will be getting through this work 
speedily to make sure that it is completed and it serves in 
front of the board.   
 
But the main thing to note is that the issues of cash that 
we could be utilising for the development of our core 
business and paying for our staff who works hard, we are 
using the money to pay everyone else than to grow Denel 
20 
and this is why the Audit Committee is investigating this 
issue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  Now we come the next 
investigation by EMS Africa Forensics.  The law firm’s 
forensic unit.   
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 123 of 142 
 
 
And that looked at specifically at allegations regarding 
bursary irregularities outside the framework of the Denel 
Bursary Policy where there were three students including the 
son of the former North West Provincial Premier, who were 
awarded bursaries and it was alleged that this was done 
irregularly.   
 
Is it correct that PWC... Oh, sorry.  EMS did in fact 
submit a report and made findings and recommendations? 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct.  It did serve on our board and we 
accepted it. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And this implicated in 7.15 for Denel’s 
former executives.  They were members and what was called 
the Central Executive Committee.   
 
Now you have given evidence earlier Ms Hlahla to the 
Chair that there was an Executive Committee comprising the 
Group CEO and some other members of top management.   
 
Is that the same as the Central Executive Committee or 
are the two committees different? 
MS HLAHLA:   It is exactly the same committee.  It is the 
committee that sat between Exco and the Board.  It was a 
20 
powerful body of management. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you have acted on the findings.  
You set out on page 75 a number of actions you have taken.  
You started disciplinary action against the executives but 
you indicated they resigned before the hearings started. 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 124 of 142 
 
MS HLAHLA:   Yes, sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   7.16.   
MS HLAHLA:   Yes, the CEO had resigned by the time that 
we instituted the disciplinary hearings. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Yes, I am sorry.  I skipped over 
the reference to the former GCFO.   
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And the Group Executive Strategy.  But 
the others implicated is the CEO and the COO had resigned. 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, sir. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  And the board has instituted 
civil proceedings against the Denel executives.  Are those 
civil proceedings completed or are they still ongoing?  Do 
you know? 
MS HLAHLA:   They are ongoing in the sense that the... they 
are ongoing sir and then the issue of settlement comes out 
later which will have an impact on it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Then you refer in 7.18 to the fact 
that the police are apparently investigating the matter and 
had 
been 
requesting 
statements 
from 
some 
Denel 
20 
employees.  Is Denel cooperating with that process? 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, sir.  One of the sensitive issues and 
said issues about this investigations is that it almost makes 
you forget that bursaries are dealing with young people.  And 
that actually they fall in between the cracks and you just 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 125 of 142 
 
hope that as our information gets in other hands, that 
everybody is sensitive to the children that are involved in it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  7.19 refers to, apart from the 
police, the SIU also conducting investigations.  And you 
referred to a settlement proposal that has been received 
from Mr Mahumapelo to reimburse Denel for the payments.   
 
And then you set out how that would be paid in equal 
instalments over 36-months.  Your statement does not 
indicate but are you able to tell the Chair, has the settlement 
happened?  Has there been an agreement?  What status is 
10 
there of that? 
MS HLAHLA:   The status, as at today, is that our Audit 
Committee 
has 
considered 
it 
and 
not 
accepted 
the 
settlement offer but they are engaged now to look at the best 
way to conclude. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Then we get to the next 
investigation by the attorneys firm, Bowmans.  You deal with 
that on page 76 and following. 
MS HLAHLA:   Yes, sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that also submitted a report.  Is 
20 
that correct? 
MS HLAHLA:   Yes, sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And has that report been accepted and 
acted upon by the board? 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, sir. We have received it and 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 126 of 142 
 
accepted the recommendations and the remedial actions. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And you referred 7.23 to Mr 
Ntshepe and Mr Mhlwana being solely responsible for the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
contract 
in 
September 
2017 
and 
prejudice that resulted and it was recommended that they 
personally be held liable for the losses and that this be 
pursued through court action in the civil courts and other 
steps. 
 
7.24 you refer to a statement arising from that 
recommendation 
that 
has 
been 
filed 
with 
the 
police 
10 
requesting 
further 
investigation. 
 
Was 
that 
request 
submitted by Denel to the police? 
MS 
HLAHLA: 
 
 
Correct, 
it 
was 
submitted 
by 
our 
management to the police. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you refer in 7.25 to 
disciplinary proceedings against four employees implicated 
in these irregular payments who were still in the employ of 
Denel, that they have been subjected to disciplinary 
proceedings.  Are you able to tell the Chair what the status 
is of those proceedings?  Completed?  Still pending? 
20 
MS HLAHLA:   Those have been completed with two 
individuals, I think, who were not found guilty and then two 
found guilty and you will recognise that there is now 
additional work being done for those that are not in the 
company and have been found guilty for us to recover the 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 127 of 142 
 
money from them. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you refer in 7.25 to Mr Ntshepe 
…[intervenes] 
MS HLAHLA:   And the Group CEO. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The Group CEO at the time, who was 
implicated but of course he left Denel and so there has 
been no disciplinary action possible against him. 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   That your paragraph 7.26 refers to 
instructions having been given to attorneys to institute civil 
10 
proceedings.  Is that process underway? 
MS HLAHLA:   It is under way, Chair, and I was made 
aware of the fact that one of the challenging issues for 
management implementing some of the recommendations 
has been the fact that any of the external parties who are 
not members of Denel staff, i.e. the technical assistant that 
got paid out, they are in a different jurisdiction with bank 
accounts in another – between Denel and the SIU they 
have been trying to figure out, the cost related to it, how to 
effect the decision and there have been some difficulties, 
20 
Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you and then the foot of page 
77 and the following pages deal with a section devoted to 
an investigation by Fundudzi Forensic Services.  That 
related specifically to the appointment and payment of an 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 128 of 142 
 
entity known as ENNE7 to provide certain services relating 
to the supply of Casspir Chassis vehicles to Denel and is it 
correct that that investigation has submitted a report which 
made findings and recommendations? 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, Chair, and it was [indistinct – 
dropping voice] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In 7.29 you refer to some of the 
findings and then in 7.30 that the amount of R69.6-odd 
million, R69.6 million was paid to ENN7 which constituted 
irregular and fruitless and wasteful expenditure. 
10 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
Then 
it 
made 
certain 
recommendations.  The first in 7.31.1 is that disciplinary 
action be taken against four employees, criminal action 
against eleven people including employees for collusion 
and/or corruption and that Denel considers a civil claim to 
recover financial loss.  Has that been acted upon? 
MS HLAHLA:   With regard to the Fundudzi forensic report, 
it is still coming to the board and it is one of those that will 
try and accelerate but the actions will be taken upon in full 
20 
by the board. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  So this paragraph 7 that we 
have just been through has set out in some detail various 
investigations commissioned by the board under your 
chairship that have in fact been completed where reports 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 129 of 142 
 
have been furnished findings made and recommendations 
made by the investigating teams or firms where – and you 
have indicated the extent to which the board has acted or 
is 
currently 
acting 
based 
on 
those 
findings 
and 
recommendations. 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If I understand it, paragraph 8 of 
your affidavit deals with a number of further investigations 
that are being initiated or have started but are not yet 
complete.  Again, under your – the board which you 
10 
currently chair. 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, Chair, and they are underway, they 
are [indistinct] 05.35. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  So that – and they had been 
overseen by the audit committee. 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And they involve various entities 
including Regiments Capital and Fireblade Aviation. 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Who is doing the Regiments Capital 
20 
Investigation? 
MS HLAHLA:   I have provided you additional data that 
gives you the firms that are working with the audit 
committee on it.  I cannot personally remember it offhand, 
Chair. 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 130 of 142 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And then you say in 8.3 that: 
“The 
audit 
committee 
intends 
to 
initiate 
more 
investigations 
to 
deal 
with 
supply 
chain 
management processes, irregular expenditure and 
the like.” 
And then 8.5 you refer to requesting a high level lifestyle 
audit of Denel employees and if there are any red flags 
that may result in further investigations.  Has that – you 
say there it is not yet been done, process is underway to 
appoint a service provider, but has the board decided to 
10 
pursue this as one of the interventions? 
MS HLAHLA:   The board has long decided that it would 
undertake a lifestyle audit.  It is just a matter of, with our 
limited budget, the audit committee being able to prioritise 
between the investigations into allegations of corruption 
and this one at the same time.  But we also lost a lot time 
during Covid, I think, maybe a lot of work would have been 
done by now. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Then in paragraph 9 you deal 
with the SIU again.  You touched on that in a different 
20 
context earlier and you have indicated that the issues with 
the SIU have been delegated by the board to be handled 
by the audit committee. 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that, as you pointed earlier, 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 131 of 142 
 
there is cooperation with the SIU in that regard. 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   There is a proclamation that the 
President has issued dealing with the SIU scope of 
reference specific to Denel. 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you have set out in 9.3.1 to 
9.3.4 the specific items, IT security assessment services, 
legal services, steel fabrication acquired from VR Laser 
and the awarding of bursaries by Denel and …[intervenes] 
10 
MS HLAHLA:   These are areas, ja, of those SIU interests, 
Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes and then 9.4 appears to indicate 
that the President proclamation has been amended to 
cover further a wider scope of matters to be investigated 
by the SIU. 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Then you respond to certain 
questions in paragraph 10.1 that the Commission has, 
through its investigator, posed to you about what you know 
20 
about the Hoefyster project based on reports that you have 
received as the board and you refer to the classification of 
the DOD, Department of Defence strategic project and you 
indicate that certain aspects you cannot deal with in detail 
in this affidavit which is going into the public domain 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 132 of 142 
 
because of that confidentiality.   
 
Then you refer to in 10.4 to what the project 
involves, a new generation armoured vehicle contracted in 
2007 
to 
be 
developed 
and 
then 
you 
deal 
with 
the 
development contract phase 1 and phase 2, the production 
contract. 
 
10.5 you say that the objective was that the 
development contract would be completed in 2012, eight 
years ago, it has been delayed.  Has the development 
contract in fact been completed now in 2020 or is it still at 
10 
a stage of being delayed? 
MS HLAHLA:   It is during the phase of being delayed, 
Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you refer to the reasons, 
the liquidity challenges, the state capture related issues.  
Why 
have 
state 
capture 
related 
issues 
delayed 
or 
complicated the completion of the development phase? 
MS HLAHLA:   The entire investigations around now 
related to state capture issues have to do with this 
programme.  Whether people leave, whether they are still 
20 
there, whether anything that – the loss of knowledge, this 
is the heart of it.  So sometimes you are delayed, 
sometimes you are successful but the heart of it is this 
Hoefyster. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And has the delay of phase 1 meant 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 133 of 142 
 
that phase 2 is likewise delayed? 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct and some of the technical issues 
that have got to be completed between Denel and Armscor 
have got to do with the transition between the two phases. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And there are complications, you 
indicate in your paragraph 10.6, relating to the financial 
aspects arising from guarantees, advance payments made 
by Armscor, etcetera, and your difficulty in generating 
funds from the programme to reduce the obligation or to 
return the money to the ring fenced account.  And you are 
10 
ongoing discussions with Armscor/Denel to look at the 
possibility of restructuring that financial obligation, is that 
correct? 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, Chair, but merely understanding a 
programme which should have been completed eight years 
ago and we have not for one or more reasons.  What it 
basically means for the Denel employees and managers of 
today is that they are likely to either receive penalties or – 
because it has gone way over schedule and those critical 
issues of can they proceed on what terms are really critical 
20 
for this programme which remains the single biggest 
contract in Denel’s books. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Then you deal in 10.7 with VR 
Laser Services having been appointed to provide cutting 
and bending services for armoured steel for the hulls and 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 134 of 142 
 
turrets and that was deemed to have been irregularly 
contracted and a legal process has been followed for the 
termination of those contracts and the review of those 
contracts, is that right? 
MS HLAHLA:   Correct, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now you make a comment in 10.8 
about LMT and DVS having both been acquired by Denel to 
bolster its landward capabilities and mitigate against the 
disturbances.  Was that not able to resolve the problem? 
MS HLAHLA:   It is very odd because we bought LMT and 
10 
DVS to give us the capacity to do work but instead of using 
them we then hired – passed the job on to VR Laser and 
they do the work and then we are sitting with all these 
gaps.  That is just to pose the challenge for this board that 
you have now taken a liability onto yourselves and you are 
sharing income if not give it all over to somebody else. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   The final point that I would like to 
raise in this concluding section of your affidavit relates to 
your section paragraph 11, what still needs to be done and 
the negative impact that has happened in relation to 
20 
Denel’s finances as well as its reputation and you refer to 
the ongoing situation of losses due to significant declines 
in 
revenue, 
deepening 
liquidity 
crisis, 
impacts 
on 
productivity that Covid is having.  But, of course, seen 
against 
the 
background, 
as 
your 
earlier 
paragraphs 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 135 of 142 
 
indicate, the problems relating to the relevant transactions, 
governance issues, financial and operational implications, 
can you indicate in relation specifically to the Hoefyster 
project and the transactions with VR Laser, what in the 
bigger picture of Denel’s finances, its operations, its 
reputation, its strengths as a business, what are those 
problems relating to Hoefyster and VR Laser?  To what 
extent did they have an impact? 
MS HLAHLA:   Generally speaking, Chair, it is impossible 
that these issues that we have investigated or these 
10 
contractual agreements that we have investigated, could 
not have impacted the situation of Denel today.  The best 
example being that the huge debt that current Denel has to 
service is largely around this programme.  The amounts of 
monies that we had to divert from projects towards working 
capital have only meant that you are delaying paying and 
the current Denel has got to try and pay off that liability. 
 
In summary, Chair, when people see the men and 
women who work for Denel being unhappy or disgruntled 
because they cannot get paid, part of it has been these 
20 
issues of corruption as well as mismanagement because 
the resources that the need as engineers to do their work, 
we are busy paying for a past that has been unproductive 
in a sense.   
 
The impact is dire and some of the markets would 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 136 of 142 
 
not do business with us again until these issues are 
concluded and they know that they do not have to deal with 
any corrupt tendencies within Denel.   
 
But I want to - you know, to assure everyone that 
Denel’s people, management and board are working very 
hard to try and restore whatever Denel is left of into a 
productive entity for this country. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, thank you, those are the 
questions from the legal team, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MS HLAHLA:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much, Ms Halle for 
coming to share with the Commission what the board has 
been doing. 
MS HLAHLA:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And some of the challenges that had 
found at Denel.  You do have the homework that we spoke 
about that you and your team will work on.  If it is possible 
to 
get 
us 
such 
a 
document 
that 
would 
really 
be 
appreciated. 
20 
MS HLAHLA:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But thank you very much for coming, we 
appreciate it, but you are now excused.  Thank you. 
MS HLAHLA:   Thank you, Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, thank you that completes the 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 137 of 142 
 
witnesses that we have scheduled for today.  We have 
more witnesses scheduled tomorrow that will be present. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Who are scheduled for tomorrow?  
Is it one witness? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, the next witness will be Ms 
Celia Malahlela.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If I can just indicate we have 
prioritised her tomorrow.  She is in the country presently 
but will be flying out I think it is tomorrow night. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Overseas. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And initially it appeared that she was 
not available to us at all because she was overseas but 
fortunately it happened that she is in the country at the 
moment so we have grabbed the opportunity to have her 
give evidence tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Mr Fikile Mhlontlo, who was 
20 
originally scheduled is not available but the other witness 
we have lined up tomorrow is Mr Dennis Mlambo, his 
evidence will take a bit of time, it is a very lengthy affidavit 
but we will be as productive and efficient as we can be. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 138 of 142 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   He is the Group Supply Chain 
Management executive at Denel. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so tomorrow you have two lined 
up? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Two lined up, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Two lined up, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   We had three but the one has 
unfortunately dropped out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, is there a need for us to start 
earlier than normal, like nine o’clock, half past nine? 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I do not think so, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It might be necessary. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, the only reason why my 
colleagues - learned colleagues are suggesting nine is 
because of concern about Ms Malahlela’s commitment to 
fly tomorrow night and we are just concerned that there 
might be some problem.  We should easily complete her 
evidence in the morning but they are suggesting perhaps 
we start at nine o’clock just to make …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but if we are starting with her and 
20 
she should finish during the morning. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, we really should, I do not 
believe that there is any danger …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   That should not be a concern.  I would 
understand if the concern was about Mlambo. 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 139 of 142 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For later because – or if the concern- 
there will be a concern if she was the second to come, but 
if she is the first one… 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I just confirm something? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It has just occurred to me, I was told 
that she may be travelling during the afternoon, not the 
evening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I just confirm that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   No, in fact, I am told apparently now 
her travel arrangements are not Tuesday but in fact 
Wednesday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So there should not be a problem so 
ten o’clock if that will suit you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so ten o’clock will be fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But where there is a need we can start 
at nine, we can start at half past nine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If we can …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is just that it does not help much to 
start early if we are not going to use the rest of business 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 140 of 142 
 
hours. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it is useful to start at nine if we know 
that we – the normal business hours are not going to be 
enough and we might have to go into the evening, that is 
fine. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I think we are going to need that 
from Wednesday. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   From Wednesday? 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
From 
Wednesday 
because 
Wednesday we have a full programme of three witnesses 
who are available to us.  Thursday the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Friday we apparently have only one 
witness who has been allocated for Friday.  So that you 
may want to start early so that we do not run into a late 
stage of the afternoon, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, that is fine, we could start early 
20 
on Wednesday when there is good reason for it.  With 
regard to Thursday maybe somebody in the legal team 
could speak to Adv Seleka because I was in discussion 
with him and I said we could have an evening session on 
Thursday for him to bring a certain Eskom witness to finish 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291

his evidence but that was on the assumption that the 
normal business hours would be enough for you.  If you 
will need the evening then we might have to change that 
plan.  So maybe if somebody can speak to him and maybe 
you can speak to him. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I will. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And one of you can come back to me. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I will do so, Chair.  Certainly our 
view, based on the consultations we have had with all 
three witnesses already, scheduled for Thursday, suggests 
10 
to me that we should be able to finish their evidence if we 
start at nine, within the normal hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So if you and Mr Seleka need some 
time in the evening I do not believe there should be a 
major – unless something unforeseen happens. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, if that is your assessment then 
you might need even to talk to him because the plan is that 
I would finish at four, take a break of about an hour, then 
start the evening session at five with his witness up to a 
20 
certain point. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will then adjourn for the day and 
26 OCTOBER 2020 – DAY 291 
 
Page 142 of 142 
 
tomorrow we will start at ten.  We adjourn.
