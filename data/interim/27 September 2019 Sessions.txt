PROCEEDINGS RESUMES ON 27 SEPTEMBER 2019 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Wentzel, good morning everybody.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready?  Yes.  Mr Khuba you will continue to 
give evidence on the strength of the oath that you took two days ago.  
Okay.   
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. Alright.  Continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Khuba you were testifying yesterday that 
you briefed Mr McBride on the Rendition case and he then instructed 
10 
you to go and collect the docket which you did.  Could you then tell the 
Chair how it came about that what is now known as the second report 
was prepared? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Wentzel I did not hear the question and 
the reason I did not hear it is because I saw what they have written on 
your name tag there.  Did you see that? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It says you are Advocate Wentzel SC. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I know that is a very nice promotion.  I will 
tell the bar council.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes.  Do you want to repeat the question so I 
can hear it? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair.  Could you explain to the Chair 
how it came about that you compiled the second report together with 
Sibiya?  I mean Sesoko – Sesoko.  I beg your pardon. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 3 of 194 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Thank you.  After I was allowed 
to go and collect the docket from Gauteng I came back with the docket 
and I had already been informed because Mr Sesoko was not involved 
from the onset to say that I need to involve Mr Sesoko.  So I did 
attachment of the evidence that we – that I had already acquired and 
we evaluated the evidence in totality which gave birth to what is called 
the second report. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And is that the report that appears in the 
bundle at page 139? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now the final recommendation in that report is 
as follows: 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think let us always as far as possible refer to them 
as either the first report, the amended report or the second report so it 
would be clear which one we are talking about. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  The – if you have regard to page 176 of the 
second report it says: 
“Based on the available evidence the independent 
20 
police investigative directorate recommends that no 
charges 
should 
be 
brought 
against 
Lieutenant 
General Dramat and Major General Sibiya.  The 
investigation established there is no prima facie case 
against them.  However with regard to Colonel 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 4 of 194 
 
Maleleke there is a prima facie case to sustain 
charges of kidnapping and defeating the ends of 
justice.” 
Is that correct? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And this report was signed both by you, Mr 
Sesoko and Mr McBride, is that correct? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And what was Mr McBride’s involvement in the 
compilation of the report? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Mr McBride was not involved in 
the actual compilation however what happened is that because he was 
going to co-sign the document went to him for spelling check and it was 
returned to us until he was satisfied about the quality of the report. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now if you go to page 25 of your statement at 
– in paragraph 81 you say: 
“Shortly before Mr McBride’s suspension in March 
2015 you received a number of calls from the 
personal assistance of the then Minister of Police 
Minister Nathi Nhleko.” 
20 
Could you tell the Chair and direct your answers to the Chair please 
what was that about? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The call was about the Minister 
wanting to see me personally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we go further on that point.  Let us go back to 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 5 of 194 
 
the point that – to the answer that you just gave earlier to Ms Wentzel’s 
question.  I understand from the report of Werksmans or Werksmans do 
you know whether they prefer to be called Workmans or Werksmans? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I do not know.  I always call them Worksmans 
but other people call them Werksmans. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  It seems from that report of 
Worksmans or Werksmans that the report says that when they 
interviewed Mr McBride he said that he had not seen the first report 
when he signed the second report.  But they say that you contradicted 
him when they interviewed you and in this regard if I am not mistaken 
10 
they say that you – he had – you said he instructed you to retrieve the 
docket and from that they seem to infer that he must have seen the first 
report.  Did you say to them that he had seen the first report? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Chairperson I still remember 
very well that they wanted to know whether when he wanted an update 
he – I had handed him a copy of the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the first report? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Of the first report but I indicated 
to them that I handed a copy to Mr Sesoko who might have handed to 
McBride. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who might have handed it to – oh. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Handed it to McBride. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I never saw whether he … 
CHAIRPERSON:  He did or not. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 6 of 194 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He handed – not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And yesterday when I was 
testifying I indicated that the report – there was a report which was 
sent to Mr Sesoko on the 23 r d which means that report had already 
changed.  So if I can say what I handed to Sesoko was a January report 
I would not really be very correct on the basis that they had that slight 
change only on recommendation that we cannot place General Sibiya at 
the scene. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the short answer is that you do not know whether 
10 
or not Mr McBride did see the first report before signing the second 
report? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I do not know Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  He may or he may not you do not know? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Mr Khuba just to clarify the report that 
you sent to Mr Sesoko was that what we are now calling the amended 
report 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So it was not the first report it was the 
amended report? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do you know whether Mr McBride saw the 
amended report before signing the second report? 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 7 of 194 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Now if you go now please 
deal with the telephone conversation – the telephone call you received 
from the Minister’s personal assistant dealt with in paragraph 81 of 
your statement, page 25? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I received a call from the 
personal assistant to the Minister.  It was Minister Nhleko and she 
made it clear that she is the personal assistant of the Minister and she 
told me that the Minister wanted to meet me personally.  I then 
10 
requested to know what was that about – she just gave me a highlight 
to say it is about the Rendition.  Then I indicated – I informed her that I 
would need permission from the Executive Director Mr McBride and I 
cannot be able to just go and meet with the Minister.  Then she 
suggested and that was I think on the subsequent call.  She suggested 
and said to me the Minister would want to meet with you in Cape Town 
over the weekend.  They will arrange transportation and McBride will 
never know.  Then on Sunday you will be back and then on Monday you 
will be able to report on duty.  Now I indicated to her that it does not 
matter it is over the weekend because if I come there I will be 
20 
discussing issues pertaining to the department and the Accounting 
Officer must know.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was her response to that? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No she indicated to me that she 
will talk to the Minister again. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 8 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is when on the following 
day I received a call from the Minister himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Both these numbers were saved 
in my cell phone and I still have them today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and therefore you would – would you have the – 
even the exact date when you received these calls or not the dates? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I may not remember but it may 
appear somewhere. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because shortly after that I had 
spoken to the Executive Director.  There were some … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr McBride? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  McBride. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  There were some documents 
which were done.  I think they might have captured the date I cannot – 
but now I cannot remember the date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it was March? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But what I have it is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it was March 2015? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay so you… 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But the exact date I cannot 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 9 of 194 
 
remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you received a call from the Minister himself Mr 
Nhleko? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and what – what did he say in the telephone call? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  His call lasted very – it might be 
less than – not even a minute.  He just said I want you to cooperate 
with Werksmans.  And then I said okay and then he terminated the call. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  At that stage had you been – had Werksman 
been in touch with you at that stage? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They had been in touch with you. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But had you had an interview with them already or not 
yet? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No I had not yet had the 
interview with them. 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They just call me requesting me 
to attend the… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Interview. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Interview. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And I referred them to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Executive Director. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 10 of 194 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  To the Executive Director. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  And what did the – what was their response 
when you referred them to the Executive Director? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  At some stage there were some 
exchange I think of emails between them and Mr Sesoko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because I also indicated to them 
that even though the Executive Director is the head of the department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Sesoko is the direct supervisor 
10 
and I report direct to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So I gave them I think the email 
of Mr Sesoko and then they started liaising with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  And when you – if you look at the time when you 
had that interaction with Werksmans and the time or the date when the 
Minister spoke to you and said he wanted you to cooperate with 
Werksmans did – how much time had elapsed? Do you have a 
recollection?  A week, two weeks, a few days? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I cannot remember but the time 
20 
lapse there was not really huge on the basis that after I indicated that I 
will not be able to meet with the Minister in Cape Town McBride was 
then suspended. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that like in a few days’ time after the call? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It did not take a month. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 11 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But I cannot really quantify in 
terms of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh but maybe around a month or so after the call. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Less than a month – less than a 
month – let us say… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Less than a month? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Weeks. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Weeks ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So did you get the impression that Werksmans 
had reported to the Minister that you had referred them to Mr McBride 
when they wanted to – you to come for an interview? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I just got an indication that 
probably Werksman had contacted him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is why he had to contact 
me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  And he must have formed the view that you were 
not cooperating with them? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And thought it was necessary that he should make the 
call personally to you and – actually he had wished to have a meeting 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 12 of 194 
 
with you. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In Cape Town. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The call must – he must have made the call because 
you kept on saying that you would need Mr McBride’s permission. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct but I need to 
indicate clearly Chairperson that it is not the Minister himself who 
proposed Cape Town.  It is the PA saying the Minister wants to meet me 
with – with me in Cape Town. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no I understand that completely but 
obviously she was conveying to you what the Minister had asked her 
because she was the PA’s Minister and she was – I am saying she it 
could have been a he – was – had been sent by the Minister to call you 
and ask you come to Cape Town.  Otherwise the PA would not say come 
to Cape Town unless the Minister wanted you to come to Cape Town. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And was this the first time that you spoke to – 
you were speaking to the Minister? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But he – what he had to say was just brief.  I 
want you to cooperate with Werksmans. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When he came on the – when he phoned – were you 
phone by his PA who then said please hold on for the Minister or did he 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 13 of 194 
 
phone and you picked up the phone – the call.  You did not know the 
number and he said this is the Minister of Police or I am Nathi Nhleko 
the Minister of Police I would like you to cooperate with Werksmans.  
How did it – how did he introduce himself to you? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He phoned directly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They were having different 
numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Well was that on a cell phone or on a 
landline? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He used a cell phone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A cell phone okay.  So how did he start the 
conversation with you? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He introduced himself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja in what way? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  To say that he is the Minister of 
Police. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And I could hear the voice 
because I think few weeks he had come to our office and addressed us. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So I was really familiar with his 
voice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With his voice yes.  And then he just said he would 
like you to cooperate with – with Werksmans. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 14 of 194 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Khuba after Mr McBride was suspended 
who replaced him? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was Mr Israel Kgamanyane. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Wentzel.  Did you see the direct 
approach by the Minister to you as opposed to him talking to the 
Executive Director to pass on the message to you as something 
unusual or strange or did you see nothing unusual? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  For me it was very unusual 
because politicians normally will not communicate with the staff.  They 
make communicate with heads of departments because they report 
direct to them.  So I felt that probably he wanted me to do something 
without Mr McBride knowing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr McBride never told you anything along the 
lines that the Minister did approach him to ask him to release you to go 
and see him in Cape Town? 
\MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No he did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if he – if that had happened he probably would 
20 
have told you? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you get any impression that the Minister was 
trying to bypass the Executive Director on this matter – on the 
Rendition matter? 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 15 of 194 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Khuba you say in 
paragraph 83 on page 26 of your statement that hereafter you went to 
Duma Nokwe Chambers in Sandton and met with Advocate William 
Mokhari SC.  Could you explain what happened at that meeting?  Firstly 
who told you to go and what happened? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Shortly after the appointment of 
Mr Kgamanyane as the Acting Executive Director I was told by him to 
go to Duma Nokwe Chambers in Sandton to meet with Advocate William 
10 
Mokhari.  In the morning I went there as I was instructed and when I 
arrived at the reception I just sat there and waiting for him.  He came 
down and never requested me to go with him to his office.  He spoke 
with me at the reception.  He was standing.  And I was standing 
because I was shaking his hand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that Mr Kgamanyane? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No that is Advocate Mokhari at 
Duma Nokwe Chambers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh in his chambers. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now he requested me to make a 
support affidavit a confirmatory affidavit in support of the Minister.  I 
then refused and I told him that if I do that I will be lying.  And he did 
not say anything.  He said no it is fine you can go back.  And then I 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 16 of 194 
 
left.  It was the shortest meeting I had.  Then I went back. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now tell me… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had you seen – I am sorry.  Had you seen the 
Minister’s affidavit that you – that he was asking you to – to sign a 
confirmatory affidavit about. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I had not yet seen it.  I – even 
now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I do not know that affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh But what – how – how could you say if you signed 
10 
a confirmatory affidavit you would be lying if you had not yet seen what 
the Minister’s affidavit said or was saying? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I said that on the basis that this 
issue was on the media and the Minister had a version of what 
happened.  So now it immediately came to my awareness that what I 
have to confirm it is what he has been speaking publicly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the media.  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because – and that was not the 
true reflection of what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in brief what was the version that you had seen 
20 
in the media being attributed to the Minister? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The version is that McBride 
altered – influenced me to alter the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The report was deleted to suit 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 17 of 194 
 
the recommendation that NPA cannot charge Dramat and Sibiya. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Did you hereafter attend further interviews 
with Werksmans or Worksmans? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct.  I had three 
interviews with them.  And in my first meeting with them they assured 
me – it was a panel of three or four – I think three and they assured me 
that the investigation they were doing will not result in a criminal or 
departmental recommendation against me or resulting in me being 
charged.  And I said is there a need for me to be legally represented?  
10 
And they said no.   I did not record that but we had discussed this at 
length with Mr Sesoko and Sesoko said we – you must not forget we 
need to raise this issue.  And I thought they captured it in their record.  
For some reason I did not see that appearing.  And that is when I 
started to be free to talk to them after that assurance.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Were they recording you? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So from their recording whatever you said in 
terms of this issue should appear? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether it does appear in their 
transcripts or have you not had a chance to… 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I checked the transcript because 
we once requested them when we were being charged but we could not 
get the audio. They sent the transcribed record. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 18 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And that part did not appear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm.  Did you ask for the audio and they did not 
provide it or did you not ask for it? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I think we might have asked for 
it but let me say I am speaking under correction now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But my common sense tells me 
that if you are to do a [indistinct] you want to compare. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The difference between what is 
transcribed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because some words cannot be 
as audible as one may think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja.  But do you have a clear recollection whether 
when you raised that issue namely could this result in me being 
disciplined or being charged. Do I need a lawyer here?  Do you have a 
clear recollection that at that stage the recording was on because it – it 
having been a first thing – the first thing you raised it may well be that 
20 
you raised it before the proceedings started formally and therefore it 
might not have been captured? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I did after they introduced 
themselves.  They indicated that they are on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 19 of 194 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And then they introduced each 
other.  Then I started asking the question.  And that part I was 
fortunate enough because Mr Sesoko had a separate recording which 
he used himself and that was captured. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your one as opposed to Mr Sesoko’s one? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  His one? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And it just gave me a 
consolation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That I could not record but our 
situation was just exactly the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm.  But – but is your answer to my question 
that you do know that it was recorded and therefore if the audio 
recording could be accessed it will be there or it should be there or are 
you saying you are not sure? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I am sure that if it is recorded it 
is there.  But let me just give a little bit of just… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well – I am sorry before you do that.  You see my 
question is whether if we get the recording we are likely to find it there 
20 
unless there has been interference.  As far as you know and that 
depends  
1. On whether you know that when you raised that point the 
recording had started or you do not know? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  What I can say Chairperson is 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 20 of 194 
 
that after they introduced themselves that is when I indicated that part 
regarding legal representation.  But the point that I am coming to 
Chairperson is that I am not sure whether they – but the recording was 
there in front of me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So that part I may not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes or whether the recording was on. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was playing or… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or not. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I cannot really tell that much. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But you said something earlier on about them 
saying we are on record. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that before you raised the point? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That was before they raised the 
point because they indicated they had a way where they did their 
things.  They would firstly indicate the day … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And mention the date and then 
after that they will say … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The recording? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They are on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but what I am asking is whether when - as far as 
you can remember - when they said we are on record … 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Hm. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 21 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether that was before or after you had raised the 
point to say do I need a lawyer to - to represent me here.  Am I at risk 
for a disciplinary charge or a criminal charge? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  What I can say I think it was 
after they said they are on record but what I remember vividly … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Is that it is after they introduced 
themselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  Thank you.  I think attempts should be 
made to try and get the record - the audio. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  We will make a note of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now after the interviews Werksmans produced 
a report which appears at the bundle page 178. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you deal with the report Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will recall that yesterday I indicated that I would 
like Mr McBride, Mr Sesoko and Mr Khuba to look at the report properly 
20 
and submit affidavits that deal with the findings of the report and the 
reasons given for the findings relating to them.  Now I do not know 
whether in regard to Mr Khuba you propose to deal with those issues 
with him now while he is on the witness stand or whether you intend - 
you propose to let him also go and do that - submit that an - an 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 22 of 194 
 
affidavit that does so of course with him, Mr McBride and Mr Sesoko if 
there is a need for anyone of them or all of them to be called back to 
deal with that aspect that can be done.  Have you applied your mind as 
to how you propose to deal with it? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair, I was going to deal with it with the 
witness because … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  There is a great deal of what is said … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  In the report is based upon what they say 
10 
they were told by Mr Khuba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  There is also part of these papers a 
confirmatory affidavit that Mr Khuba deposed to in support of McBride 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  In his disciplinary proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  In that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Affidavit. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Affidavit … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  He deals with  
CHAIRPERSON:  The report? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Comprehensively all the things … 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 23 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  The - the grounds upon which Werksmans say 
they came to their final conclusion that the report had been altered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Because of that I think that perhaps … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  He is in a position to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  To deal with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is - this fine and Mr Khuba you are ready to deal 
with this report … 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Properly? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I - I think - I am okay.  We - we 
dealt with - with it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But I think what will be a little 
bit of a challenge … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Would be if I get more time … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The recollection is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 24 of 194 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Enhanced. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  In terms of certain things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because how I articulated it in a 
confirmatory affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was when things were still 
fresh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes.  Well of course when things were still 
10 
fresh it would mean that you had a better recollection … 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of what had happened? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so you said something about if you have more 
time. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  More time to go through that 
confirmatory affidavit … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And the report itself. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have not had time to do that comprehensively of 
late? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I - I did it last night … 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 25 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because that is when you raise 
it Chairperson … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You prefer to have more time? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Then if I can have a little bit of 
indulgence to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Really make the difference. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I - I would be - I - I would want you to do that 
because you see that report is important with regard to the role of 
Werksmans on this whole issue and I will give Werksmans an 
opportunity.  I think Mr July will need to be called to give evidence and 
to give their side of the story with regard to how they handled this and 
the conclusions that they reached in the - he reached in the report but I 
- I would like you, Mr Sesoko and Mr McBride to really look at the - the 
report.  How it dealt with issues. 
20 
What it says about each one of you and what findings it 
makes?  What the reasons are that given for each finding against you 
and against the material that Werksmans had before the remuneration 
to - what statements did they have?  What documents did they have you 
know on which their findings were supposed to be made. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 26 of 194 
 
So - I - I would be inclined to give you that opportunity 
because 
also 
the 
- 
because 
I 
think 
that 
the 
Minister 
and 
Mr Kgamanyane or the Minister must have made the decisions to 
suspend or was it the - the Acting Director.  I cannot remember now 
who made the decision to suspend the three of - the three of you - must 
have made that on the basis of that report and the three of you were 
put through quite a difficult situation and - and I would like you to be 
able to deal with it quite properly so that when I evaluate all the 
evidence about how the three of you were dealt with and how the 
Minister - what role the Minister played, what role Werksmans played, 
10 
what role Mr Kgamanyane played and everybody. 
I have a full picture.  So that - that is what I am inclined to 
do.  What do you say Ms Wentzel? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I - I have got no difficulty with that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  That approach whatsoever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  The only thing Chair is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  There are one or two aspects in the report … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  That I would like to draw to your attention … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And also to the attention of the witness … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 27 of 194 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Which do not deal specifically with the 
allegations … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Against him or things that they say he said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  That is fine. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So if we could have regard to page - the 
report Chair starts at page 178. 
CHAIRPERSON:  100-and …? 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  78. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then if you can go to page 182 of the 
bundle and you will see the introduction.  It says: 
“The Offices of Werksmans has been mandated by 
the Honourable Minister of Police Mr Nathi Nhleko 
to 
conduct 
an 
investigation 
into 
the 
report 
submitted by IPID which deal with the rendition.” 
But the terms of reference for the investigation are very 
important Chair.  They say: 
20 
“In conducting the aforesaid investigation the 
Minister has provided Werksmans with the following 
terms of reference.  Your terms of reference in the 
investigation are the following.” 
And they are quoting it would appear from the instruction 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 28 of 194 
 
from the Minister. 
“Who and under what circumstances was the 
original report altered or how the second report 
came about with both reports signed by the same 
person i.e. Mr Khuba?  Whether any misconduct or 
offence has been committed and if so by whom?  
Whether there is a prima facie evidence of 
misconduct 
and 
criminal 
liability 
by 
Lieutenant Dramat, Major Sibiya and any other 
officers mentioned in the original report?  The 
10 
circumstances under which the report and the 
docket was handed to the NPA and what happened 
to the docket whilst in the NPA’s possession and 
five any other matter that might come to your 
attention during the investigation relevant to your 
conclusions and findings.” 
Now to me and the way that I read this if it is correct that as 
you and Mr Sesoko say that you were told that you were not being 
investigated and there was no prospect of you being investigated for 
any misconduct or wrongdoing or offence even.  This would seem not to 
20 
be correct because their terms of reference were specifically whether 
any misconduct or offence has been committed and if so by whom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  The other aspect … 
CHAIRPERSON:  May - maybe what one can ask is whether Werksmans 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 29 of 194 
 
at any stage before the interview started told you what their terms of 
reference were. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That part Chairperson I cannot 
remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I cannot remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Do you know when for the first time you 
saw in writing what their terms of reference were?  Whether it was 
when you saw the - their report for the first time or whether you got to 
know the terms of reference at some stage as they are put here. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That part Chairperson it - it is 
very difficult to say because I cannot remember whether they show me 
there … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But I saw it in this report  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  When I did the (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair the second aspect I wanted to deal with 
is what you testified to yesterday.  You were explaining what the 
20 
purpose and role was of an IPID Report and what the - what you 
understood the role was of the NPA once they received the report … 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And just by that I would like you to comment 
on this.  If we can have regard to page 196. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 30 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  196.  In paragraph 3.1.2 it says what you 
have stated. 
“The first report was compiled by Khuba with the 
assistance of Moukangwe and the guidance of 
Mosing and Moletsi.  In the section we elucidate the 
circumstances 
under 
which 
this 
report 
was 
produced 
by 
Khuba 
and 
Moukangwe. 
 
Our 
explanation of the circumstances under which this 
report was produced is based on the interviews 
10 
conducted with Khuba, Moukangwe and Mosing.” 
But then they state this: 
“It is important to state that the Special Projects 
Division in the Office of the NDPP was tasked to 
provide guidance to Khuba and Moukangwe during 
the course of their investigation.  The Special 
Projects Division is headed by Mosing assisted by 
Moletsi.  The role of Mosing and Moletsi was never 
to make a decision on whether to prosecute or not.” 
Can you comment on that? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  This part it is - it is very 
misleading because my experience when I deal with prosecutors who 
are guiding the case quite often they are the ones who will take the 
decision on the matter and they model out that case in terms of what 
they can really prove in court. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 31 of 194 
 
Now this also comes to the issue of the guidance of the 
report to say here they indicate that the - Advocates Mosing and 
Moletsi were guiding this report but the truth of the matter is that it is 
IPID that needs to make that report without the involvement of any 
advocate from the NPA because it is like when I am writing a letter to 
you but you write a letter to yourself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 You 
are communicating 
to 
yourself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So it was supposed to be an 
independent one but I have already given a justification because of the 
closeness we had.  It just became so normal that it flew that they 
started commenting and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But who - who said that Mr Mosing was the person 
who was going to guide the investigation?  Who came with that - from 
whom did you hear that for the first time? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  For the first time when I had a 
meeting with Colonel Moukangwe at Emperors Place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That meeting was aimed at him 
explaining to me the investigation he did, what was outstanding, what 
needed to be done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So that is when he said there 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 32 of 194 
 
are prosecutors who are already guiding this investigation and he gave 
me their name and their numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Mosing was one of them? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you initiate communication between the two 
of you or did he call you at some stage or is that something you cannot 
remember? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I remember because one - once I 
was given the number I called him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you confirmed from him that he was - he had a 
role in this investigation and that role was to guide the investigation? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I cannot remember whether I 
confirm … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But I indicated that I am now 
investigating this case which I heard that he was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He was - he was dealing with 
20 
and then we scheduled a meeting from there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay and that is how you then cooperated 
throughout? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it the first time that you were involved in an - in 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 33 of 194 
 
an investigation under IPID where a member of the NPA was playing an 
active role during the investigation? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No.  I - I think there was a - a 
certain investigation like the Cato Manor which I indicated that I 
investigated first.  That is when I started to know Advocate Mosing but 
at that time we put dockets together and he told us what needed to be 
done but I think I had only one or two meetings with him. 
Then 
after 
that 
they 
put 
another 
person 
who 
was 
Advocate Mathenjwa.  So Advocate Mathenjwa came at a time when I 
10 
was already on exit.  Then I had to meet with him.  That is the advocate 
who was very, very close who was telling them on a daily basis what to 
do but most of the activities I cannot really attest to because I used to 
get a telephone call from the team members. 
We still had a link even though I was not there.  They would 
tell me what was happening.  Some I used to advice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Khuba if you could then have a look at 
page 200 paragraph 3.1.21. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Page? 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  This is another issue that you - you dealt with 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Extensively yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page - page 200. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 34 of 194 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  200. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What paragraph? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  3.1.21. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got it Mr Khuba - the paragraph? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I got it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It says here: 
“According to Khuba the first report was submitted 
as a final report and they expected the NPA to take 
further action as required by law on the basis of 
10 
their recommendation set out therein.” 
Can you comment on that? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct.  The - during the 
interview as I indicated … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Wentzel that would form part of what he is 
going to deal with. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  But it is only that he was debating yesterday.  
He said he was party to drafting the IPID statute and he said in terms 
20 
of 
that 
statute 
they 
are 
not 
required 
by 
law 
to 
take 
the 
recommendations that IPID sends them.  That - if you remember he 
said there was this distinction … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you have a look at - at the statute? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I actually did not get a chance as yet because 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 35 of 194 
 
I have been trying to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I - I suggest you have a look at it first. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I will. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you ask him … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because that will be much more helpful.  I saw 
something quoted in the - in the Werksmans Report which may be 
relevant to what he was saying and it might - I did not understand it to 
be consistent with what he said but he will get a chance to deal with 
everything that refers to him here in the report by way of an - of an 
10 
affidavit and he will have a chance - he will have had a chance to 
reflect on everything and probably he will need to come back after 
submitting that affidavit and then he deals openly with all of these 
issues. 
So - so it seems to me that as far as the report is concerned 
we should not go further.  Let him go and … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do that homework.  Submit that affidavit. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then we will call him again.  Then he can deal with 
20 
all of these issues and in the meantime also Mr McBride and Mr Sesoko 
can do the same but as far as other matters are concerned I think you 
can still ask other questions if there are other matters other than the 
contents of the report. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  It was only with regard to the … 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 36 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the report. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Cellphone records … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  But I will deal with that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  When he testifies again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine.  Would that then place us a 
stage where I can release him … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For now? 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Not quite yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not - ja, okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  But … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought you said there was nothing else.  It was just 
the report you wanted to deal with. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No.  I - I just need a few issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Not that is fine. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I am not going in a lot of detail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can - you can deal with them, ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  We know that Werksmans 
20 
recommended that you, McBride and Sesoko be criminally charged for 
defeating the ends of justice or obstructing the administration of justice 
and that disciplinary charges be brought against you in your capacity 
as employees. 
Now you will deal with the report and you will deal with that 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 37 of 194 
 
recommendation.  If you can go now to paragraph 87 on page 27 of 
your report … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of his affidavit? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Of - of his affidavit.  I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  27 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  There it is said that: 
“Around November 2014 Mr Sesoko, Mr McBride 
and I had a meeting with the reference group 
10 
appointed by the Minister.” 
Could you just explain what happened at that meeting and 
what happened thereafter? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  We had the meeting with the 
reference group and they indicated that they were set up by the 
Minister to look into policing matters.  One of the members of the 
reference group was known to me because I walked with him summarily 
in KZN investigating Cato Manor and that is Advocate Mathenjwa. 
He gave me a call the other day after the meeting and he said 
to me he wants the copies of the rendition docket.  He was mentioning 
20 
it in a - like as if he was demanding it but I - I never had a problem with 
that because we had some dealings in the past.  Probably he was so 
free to - to talk to me. 
I refused and I told him and I still remember I was no, no you 
need to speak with … 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 38 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Executive Director? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The Executive Director. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what did he say? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He said it is okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you then deal with your suspension 
which you start to deal with from paragraph 88 of your report? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Chairperson in - in May 2015 
that was 21 May I received a letter of precautionary suspension signed 
by the then Acting Executive Director Mr Kgamanyane.  The letter was 
served to me by Ms Netsianda.  That was after McBride was suspended 
around March 2015. 
Now she gave me a telephonic call and told me that she 
wanted to serve the suspension letter and apparently the Minister 
wanted me to receive that letter.  Now at that time she indicated that 
she was driving.  It was very late and I knew that she was going to 
cover between 200 or 250 to 300 kilometres to arrive in Polokwane. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when she - when you say at that time that - which 
I - I take - I assume you mean at the time she phoned you.  You say it 
was very late.  Around what time would you think it was? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I think it might have been around 
three or 4 o’ clock because she was leaving Pretoria I think around that 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 39 of 194 
 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  To - to go to Limpopo? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Continue. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And then I said it is fine.  
Whatever time you arrive I am going to wait for you and then I - the call 
was recorded.  I also sent it to the company that transcribed it and she 
also deposed a statement confirming that because I made her to listen 
to the call.  I still remember the day I made her listen.  She just said 
you are a witch.  Why did you record me?  So … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And said I am putting her at a 
very difficult position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And I said even if you do not 
give a statement I have your … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your recording? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But the statement was not given 
20 
direct to me.  I think she did a confirmatory to either … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  McBride or Mr Sesoko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So where she said the Minister wanted you to receive 
the letter of suspension that day was that captured in the recording as 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 40 of 194 
 
well? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Do you have any idea why if the decision to 
suspend you was that of the Acting Executive Director namely 
Mr Kgamanyane why the Minister would have an interest that you 
receive the letter of suspension on that day?  What did that have to do 
with him? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I’m not really sure, but seeing 
previously I had received a call from the Minister, I realised that 
probably 
that 
the 
acting 
Executive 
Director 
was 
just 
10 
being…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was just being an instrument. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  An instrument to achieve that 
goal. 
CHAIRPERSON:    These were decisions being taken by the Minister? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct and probably to 
add on that Chairperson, if I had not had an experience where the 
Minister called me directly it would have been another issue, but 
because 
he 
had 
called 
me, 
I 
realised 
that 
these 
things 
above…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Executive Director. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The Executive Director it’s no 
longer the interest of the Department there is somewhere where their 
interest is being said and I was not aware of that – what kind of 
interest they were saying. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 41 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, if you had not -  you say if you had not 
received this call – the call from the Minister directly earlier on it would 
have been another issue, what do you mean, how would you have taken 
this interest of the Minister in you being served with a letter of 
suspension on a particular day? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Normally I would not really have 
– I would have doubted the words of the person. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Not necessarily, I would thought 
that probably she’s just trying to make the situation big, so that I feel 
10 
compelled to cooperate but the previous call, I realised what I was 
dealing with. 
CHAIRPERSON:    So the letter of suspension and I know I’m jumping 
now, the letter of suspension was signed by Mr Kgamanyane? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Suspending you. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But the Chief Director, Miss Nitsiyanda who came to 
serve it – who called you to say he had a letter to give to you said that 
the Minister wanted this letter served on you on the particular day, is 
20 
that right? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And – okay and you say when the call came it was 
around – it must have been around three in the afternoon. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:    That’s correct. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 42 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    So you said you would wait for her. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    If you have regard to page 25…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m sorry I think he – you don’t want him to continue 
how Miss Nitsiyanda then reached Limpopo and served first or is there 
something that you want to deal with before that? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It’s about exactly what he’s testifying now, I 
want to show him the transcript of this conversation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    If you could have regard to page 253. 
CHAIRPERSON:  253? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes, now this is not a certified transcript, 
you’ve said you recorded this, when was this transcribed? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was transcribed – I did it in 
Polokwane but it was – I think it was some weeks after the incident it 
took a bit of time before – I cannot remember exactly when but it was 
sometime after this call but I did it in Polokwane. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    And did you personally transcribe it? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes and I think I can go to the 
20 
company and get any record probably regarding this matter. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Okay it’s also confirmed in an affidavit by 
Miss Nitsiyanda but if we can just have a look at what is said at line 
10- well let’s start at the beginning, she says, 
 
“Yes Mr Khuba, how are you, I’m fine okay I’ve been asked 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 43 of 194 
 
 
[inaudible] where are you, I must come and serve you with a 
 
letter.  Okay I’m in Polokwane.  You are in Polokwane? Yes. 
 
Because apparently the Minister said that you must have the 
 
letter today and I am still in the office which means I must 
 
drive right now, will you wait for me and then I will call you 
 
when I am closer so that we can meet somewhere.  Yes, yes.  
 
Okay no thank you so much for your understanding.  Okay 
 
thank, sure yes”, 
 
And then if we have regard to an affidavit that was deposed 
to…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, maybe just in case we didn’t ask this.  You 
confirm that substantially this transcript reflects the conversation that 
took place between you and Miss Nitsiyanda? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Thank you Chair.  Mr Khuba if you can then 
look at a confirmatory affidavit that was deposed to in the disciplinary 
proceedings in the matter between IPID and Mr Sesoko on page 257 
and at page 258 paragraph three, she says, 
 
“I confirm in addition that upon receiving instructions from – 
20 
 
sorry I hereby confirm same insofar as they relate to me 
 
regarding circumstances around the handling of a letter to Mr 
 
Khuba.  I confirm in addition that upon receiving instructions 
 
from the current acting Executive Director Mr Kgamanyane, 
 
he specifically told me, in no uncertain terms that the 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 44 of 194 
 
 
aforesaid letter must be delivered to Mr Khuba that same day 
 
and that those were the specific instructions of the Minister  at 
IPID when we refer to the term Minister, it is the Minister  
of 
Police 
that we duly – that we normally refer to.  I duly  
complied with the 
instruction and called Mr Khuba to arrange  for delivery of the letter as 
properly articulated in the  
Annexure to Mr Sesoko’s affidavit 
marked NS6”. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now is it correct…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Now Miss Wentzel you said something earlier on 
10 
about, I think in response to which Mr Khuba may have said that he 
would need to go back to the people who transcribed that conversation, 
or did I misunderstand?  In response to which he – I understood him to 
be saying he would go to the people who made the transcription. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Oh yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    What was that about, it seems to be quite – 
especially with the affidavit, I’m not sure if we need anything further? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I don’t think we probably need anything 
further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes ja I don’t think so because the person who had a 
20 
conversation with Mr Khuba has confirmed in an affidavit the relevant 
part. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  After you received your 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 45 of 194 
 
notice of suspension did you, thereafter participate in a disciplinary 
hearing? 
CHAIRPERSON:    Or maybe let’s connect it to where he was before we 
went to the transcript.  Miss Nitsiyanda left Pretoria and drove to 
Pretoria to serve the letter on you, is that right? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja she came to Polokwane. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Polokwane yes and she served you with the letter. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    In the conversation that the two of you may have 
had is there anything of importance that you want to mention? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  What she did was to appreciate 
my understanding and also compromising because I had to fit within her 
schedule.  I also had to gather all the things that I had to hand over to 
her.  I had a laptop, I had a 3G card, those things that I was using I 
had to hand over the items and I still remember she arrived, it was late, 
very late. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Around what time in the evening? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I do not know whether it’s eight 
or nine but it was late. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
So 
when 
she 
phoned 
me…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Well from Pretoria to Limpopo is it not about three 
hours or is it two hours? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:    It’s around three hours but I do 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 46 of 194 
 
not know what caused further delay because when she came, I saw she 
was with her husband. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So I realised probably she might 
have gone home first but she came late to Polokwane. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But other than that there’s nothing of consequence 
that transpired in the conversation when you met with her? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No and also from my side, I 
could not talk.  For me it was – I was not settled because it was my 
first time in my 16 or 17 years’ career in the IPID to be getting 
10 
that…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    A suspension letter. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja so I was really unsettled, so I 
could not really formulate any discussion about anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Did the letter of suspension or did the news that 
you’re being suspended come as a shock to you or not really? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was a shock, it was a big 
shock. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay thank you, have we got the letter of 
suspension here? 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Yes we have. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Let’s go through it. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   The letter of suspension is Annexure HIK15, 
if you just bear with me I don’t seem to have put a reference it will be 
250 something.  It’s page 382, Mr Khuba is that your letter of 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 47 of 194 
 
suspension? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s Correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    If you have a look at the…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Well I think it appears from the first paragraph of 
the letter that we might have skipped a step earlier.  Prior to you 
receiving the letter of suspension did you receive a letter in terms of 
which you were asked to make representations why you should not be 
suspended. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, and did you consult with attorneys who helped 
10 
you to prepare such representations? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, and you submitted the representations to Mr 
Kgamanyane? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:    That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, and the letter that had asked you to make 
those representations had come from Mr Kgamanyane, the letter that 
asked you to make representations, did it come from him? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja all the correspondence I think 
they were coming from Mr Kgamanyane. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, yes I get the impression in making that point 
you are emphasising that the decisions might not have come from him 
but the correspondence was coming from him. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay alright, you think the decisions were coming 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 48 of 194 
 
from where? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I think the decisions were 
coming from people outside the department and in this case I suspect 
the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay alright, did - and Miss Wentzel have you got 
that letter here, the letter that preceded the letter of suspension? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I don’t believe so but I will verify. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Because we should also have a copy of the 
representations that he made. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    We don’t have them either here? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No Chair I don’t remember seeing it myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Would you have that letter somewhere and the 
representations somewhere? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:    I think if I try Chairperson I can 
also get it from the lawyer. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja from your lawyer. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because he might be having 
…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja try and get those and send them to the legal 
20 
team because it will be important to see what was said in that letter to 
which you needed to respond and to also see how you responded in 
order to evaluate the decision – the decision to go ahead and suspend  
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Thank you Chair.   In paragraph 91 page 28 
of your statement, you say that on the 19 t h of June 2015 you deposed 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 49 of 194 
 
to a supporting affidavit in the High Court in the matter between Mr 
McBride and the Minister of Police, could you have regard to page 260 
and confirm whether this is the supporting affidavit that you referred 
to? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And Chair it is also in this supporting affidavit 
that certain issues and aspects in – with regard to the Werksmans 
report are dealt with but that we will canvas at a later stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, no that’s fine. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Then on the 7 t h of July 2015 you were 
10 
served with a notice to attend a disciplinary enquiry and that appears 
at page 284, is that correct, is that the notice? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s the one. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you please tell the Chair what 
happened at that disciplinary inquiry? 
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m so you were called to a disciplinary inquiry and 
effectively a senior counsel Advocate William Mokare SC and a junior 
counsel Mr Thembetha Nkatube [?] instructed by Morgan Lourens 
Attorneys were appointed effectively to be the prosecutors to prosecute 
you in the disciplinary inquiry, is that correct? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Had there been any disciplinary inquiries of IPID 
personnel before – before he disciplinary inquiries of yourself and Mr 
McBride and Mr Sesoko? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
I 
think 
there 
were 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 50 of 194 
 
but…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Did they – did IPID always bring senior counsel to 
prosecute its staff in disciplinary inquiries? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  What I can say Chairperson is 
that the one that I remember I don’t think – they did not bring the 
person who is at this level. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, I mean senior counsel is very high level of an 
Advocate somebody who has – usually who has been an Advocate for 
many years and somebody who is very good and somebody also who 
doesn’t come cheap. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Chairperson I understand that, 
but I think I looked at it to say, if really you want to draw blood from the 
stone you need experts probably because you get your normal people, 
they may not be able to achieve that with ease. 
CHAIRPERSON:    But is your answer that there had been disciplinary 
inquiries involving IPID personnel before this and the organisation had 
brought outside lawyers but not at the level of senior counsel, is that 
what you’re saying? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja I don’t remember where they 
brought a heavyweight like this. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, a heavyweight but did they always or often or 
sometimes bring an outside lawyer? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was not often but also 
considering that our department, more especially on a higher level, you 
don’t really get a lot of misconduct cases. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 51 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It would be once after a while. 
CHAIRPERSON:    The ones that you can remember, namely 
disciplinary inquiries that had happened before your one and Mr 
McBride’s one and Mr Sesoko’s one you would think would have been 
how many more or less that you can remember that had happened, two, 
three, more or less even if it’s not an exact number? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  There was one which was done 
for the person who was in a Provincial Head for KZN and the one which 
was done for the Provincial Head of Eastern Cape but these, I don’t 
10 
think they brought any senior person. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Any senior lawyer from outside? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   Any senior lawyer because we 
are very economical with our budget. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, but do you know whether they brought any 
lawyer from outside at all or only internal people were used? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
That 
one 
I 
cannot 
really…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Because that’s the important part, whether it was 
the first time that outside lawyers were brought to – in regard to 
20 
disciplinary inquiries when your inquiry, Mr Sesoko’s inquiry, Mr 
McBride’s inquiry happened or whether it was not the first time but it 
had happened before but rarely but even then not senior lawyers such 
as these? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:    I remember most especially on 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 52 of 194 
 
the KZN one because it was coinciding with the time when I was going 
to assist the Province but I cannot remember what was the level of that 
person, I cannot remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay during the interval that is going to be there 
before you come back, please find out that information, how many 
disciplinary inquiries had there been before your one and Mr McBride’s 
one and Mr Sesoko’s one, did it involve outside lawyers who were 
there, what was their level and so on. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay thank you. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Thank you.  Now just for the record 
Advocate Makwari was the same Advocate who you say, a month or two 
prior to this had asked you to depose to a confirmatory affidavit in 
favour of the Minister. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:    That’s correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And that was in proceedings against Mr 
McBride? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Now do you remember when the disciplinary 
proceedings were ultimately held? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The disciplinary inquiry was held 
on the 17 t h of July 2015 but on that day it was postponed, we finally 
had it on the – it was set for the 13 t h, 14 t h and 17 t h of August and we 
made an application for suspension of that hearing pending outcome of 
the Constitutional Court which was brought about by McBride and the 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 53 of 194 
 
Chairperson dismissed that application…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And the Chairperson was Advocate Mojana? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I think that’s the one, he was the 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now we finally had it on the 22 n d 
and 23 r d of September 2015.  What happened on that particular day, Mr 
Sesoko could not avail himself because he was not well.  Now they 
requested that we need to separate this hearing so that they could have 
some progress.  I was represented by Advocate Phooko, let me say I 
10 
might be just using the word Advocate loosely but it’s a lawyer. 
CHAIRPERSON:    He’s a lawyer so he would be an Advocate or an 
attorney you’re not sure? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now what happened is that, 
while we were there Advocate Makari went out with – he requested my 
lawyer to say, let’s go out and have a discussion.  It was after there 
was an issue of separating the hearings.  Now when they went out, he 
came in but Mr Phooko called me and he says, come I want to talk to 
20 
you.  Then I went out and he said to me – and I just want to indicate 
how he put it, he says, these people are proposing that we need to 
settle this case and he used the word – they say if you continue they’re 
going to fire you, it does not matter what you are going to say.  Now 
that part…[intervenes]. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 54 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m sorry just repeat, he said, bru if you what they’re 
going to fire you, they say if what they’re going to fire you? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  If I continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:    With the hearing? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:    Ja and lead evidence, they are 
going to fire me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.     
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
So 
they’re 
proposing 
a…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay just repeat that because it’s important, you 
10 
said something about no matter what, just repeat exactly how he put it 
to you? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
He 
said, 
no 
matter 
what 
evidence you are going to lead there, they are not going to take it, they 
are going to fire you.  So it also gave me a bit of surprise on the basis 
that he was one person who was saying – he was enjoying doing my 
case, he said, this one it’s just going to be a walk in the park. 
CHAIRPERSON:    As you were preparing for…[intervenes]. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I was preparing, I was telling 
him. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was confident yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He was very, very confident. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes but now he said this is what they’re saying. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He said this is what they are 
saying.  Now I had a very lengthy discussion and I said, I think I need 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 55 of 194 
 
to talk to Mr Sesoko.  I gave him a call sometimes we had a discussion 
with Mr Sesoko’s lawyer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And the discussion there was to 
discuss the issue of how we are going to do that because immediately 
when he said they were going to fire me I started to panic.  
CHAIRPERSON:  hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because when you receive such 
type of information. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The first thing that you think is 
how are you going to pay for your car?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   How are you going to pay for 
your house? 
CHAIRPERSON:    Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  You switch off completely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  From the amount of evidence 
that you can have. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because the fate has been 
decided. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now I tried to speak to Mr 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 56 of 194 
 
Sesoko and Mr Sesoko he was warning me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  To say he does not think that it 
is right idea. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To settle. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  To settle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And he also indicated that once 
you settle they will take you as dishonest.  Because you settle on a 
level that you accept this and you go back to work.  Now I went back to 
10 
my lawyer it was like to and fro.  We were discussing trying to find out 
– and my lawyer was telling me, do you want to keep your job let us 
just get these things wrapped up.  And he was telling me that the way I 
spoke with the council you are not going to make it.  Whatever we are 
going to do they are going to deal with you.  Now… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this is the same lawyer who as you are preparing 
to come the disciplinary hearing was saying this is a walk in the park. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja this… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was very confident? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now I then – I phoned my wife, I 
phoned my uncle it was all calls all over.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Trying to get… 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Trying to get… 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 57 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Other people’s views and so on. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now it came to a part where – 
what I did… 
CHAIRPERSON:  At this stage as you were making these calls had your 
lawyer told you whether there was an offer on the table that they were 
putting – these – the employer was putting on the basis of – on the 
basis of which they were saying let us settle this matter.  Or at that 
stage they just wanted to find out whether in principle you would be 
10 
agreeable to talk in settlement but – and if you were agreeable they 
were still going to come up with an offer? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He told me immediately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ys. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That they are going to give you 
a warning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  A final warning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Written warning. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now and there was this… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say what you would need to admit to in order 
for them to give you a warning or what it is they wanted from you?  
Because I – I assume if you were going to give – to be given a warning 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 58 of 194 
 
you were going to be required to admit that you are guilty of 
something? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  What was that? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He said I need to make a 
statement admitting to the wrongdoing of the report.  Now that part I 
refused from the onset.  And I said it cannot be.  Because I will be 
lying. I did not do what they say I have done.  Now what he did he also 
went back to [indistinct] and they discussed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But the following day because I 
even stopped everything there and I said I need to go and sleep on this 
issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the first day of the hearing. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja I said I was going to sleep.  
They gave me a chance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So before you – I take it the disciplinary hearing was 
adjourned to enable you to go and sleep over the matter.  Around what 
time of the day was it after you had been making calls to various 
people and there have been discussions between the Advocates? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was in the afternoon. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 59 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they – and you had met at what time – in the 
morning at the disciplinary hearing? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I cannot remember whether it 
was nine or ten. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it was in the morning? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was in the morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So… 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But when it was towards or in 
the afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is when… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They indicated that okay we are 
going to give you an opportunity go and think about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now I went… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the matter was adjourned to the following day? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  To the following day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I went to the hotel I continued 
20 
with the calls. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you – as the proceedings were adjourned at what 
stage were the discussions in terms of what you needed to do in order 
to say have the matter settled.  Now initially they said according to 
your lawyer you would have to admit to wrongdoing in regard to the 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 60 of 194 
 
report.  Did that – had that changed to something else by the time you 
adjourned or had that not changed as yet? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They – it had slightly changed 
because they were proposing something.  They were trying to bend to 
what I was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  To compromise. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  To compromise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because I said I cannot … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Admit to wrongdoing. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ai. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And they were – they were 
slightly mentioning the issue of what if we do an agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh they were saying. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja an agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What – what would you give – what were you 
prepared to give in order for there to be an agreement to settle.  They 
were talking along – they were trying to find out if you were not 
prepared to admit to wrongdoing what is it that you were prepared to 
20 
admit? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  You can – that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But even the issue of the 
settlement agreement they were the ones who came up with – because 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 61 of 194 
 
that word was not even in my mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The one who came with it and 
they indicated that if we do an agreement where this issue is resolved 
we want you to come back to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would keep your job. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  You keep your job, you come 
back to work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And I want to tell you when you 
10 
have been suspended for the first time in your over 20 years’ 
experience in different sectors or in government I have never met that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  To tell you the honest truth my 
mind switched into survival mode. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And I said what do I do to save 
my family. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But I was not ready to 
20 
compromise the issue that I was not going to put a statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because a main investigator I 
know you cannot really put the statement on same issue different. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 62 of 194 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because I said this is the 
position but I need to keep my job I want my job back.  Now then I went 
to the hotel and then I continued with the calls.  And that time I was not 
only confined to – to only relatives.  I was calling even the friends in 
government, in – who have senior positions because we normally know 
– communicate and – and they were telling me that if they are giving 
you that deal let me tell you one thing with our government they are 
going to fire you the [indistinct].  That was one of the friends that is 
what he said to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He say with this government of 
ours when they want to get rid of you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  They will get rid of you. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They will get rid of you.  It does 
not matter what you do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So now they are giving you a life 
line. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Take it. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  At least you will – you will carry 
20 
this shame just for a bit but you will come… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  You will be back at work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now… 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 63 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those were the sort of advises you were getting from 
people. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I was getting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now then I – the following day 
then we had to engage in the issue of that settlement agreement.  They 
went and drafted it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well overnight when you came back in the 
morning was there something that you – had you made up your mind 
how you wanted to sort this out or you just wanted the discussions to 
10 
continue. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No I had already decided that as 
long as whatever I am going to sign it is not going to make me to 
commit perjury.  That is what I told myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  As long as I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not want to say anything that was not true. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And my wife was very supportive 
20 
of the fact that it is better to go back to work and really continue 
sustaining the family.  Now when I went back they drafted the – it did 
not take too long  
CHAIRPERSON:  An agreement. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  An agreement.  Now the 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 64 of 194 
 
agreement the first page it was talking about … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry let us go to the agreement. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  The agreement is at page 287 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  287? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  287. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay continue talking I just wanted us to find 
where the agreement is for later but I want you to continue to talk – to 
tell me how the discussions went up to the time that the agreement was 
signed. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  When they brought the 
agreement the – it was already typed.  There was a… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that – was that before you told them what you – 
what would be acceptable to you?  Because you must have come back 
and your lawyer must have said what did you think or what do you 
think? Are you prepared or not prepared and you must have told him 
something which he passed on to Mr Mokhari. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They had something that has 
already been drafted which I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you came? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja which I – when I pointed 
some of the things I do not know how it was changed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And then I was called to a 
smaller office to sit and discuss.  Now when it came back now we 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 65 of 194 
 
discussed and my lawyer was happy with it.  He was really fine.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now if you check the part of the 
agreement it is where he talks about plea to the charges as per 
departmental hearing charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But the issue there when we got 
this – this report I was still not comfortable – I was still not comfortable 
with this part. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you signed? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  When I signed.  In fact I said to 
my lawyer when we were doing this that this fist page I am having a 
problem with it. But he indicated that this is an agreement there is 
nothing – it does not have any effect on what you said previously. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And they have already indicted 
that I am free to testify in support of Mr Sesoko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which was important to you? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes which was important to me.  
Now I do not know being out of sarcastic or what but I took this 
20 
agreement and did not want to sign the first page.  And it was initialled 
by my lawyer.  It was only the page where he initialled.  And I signed 
the subsequent one.  So my lawyers initials  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Are only on the first page. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 66 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the one looking like… 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  LEP stand for Poko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the – he initialled there. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja.  If you check that HI – HI 
was basically for me when I was preparing this thing for the – for this 
hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so it was not there. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was not there ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh which – okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And MB or well – or is it MS? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That MS is the police officer who 
certified the documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And then you have a signature 
towards the corner that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did not somebody initial on this part of the – on 
behalf of the employer?  On the first page. 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It is initialled at the corner 
there.  If you check there is a… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I see that. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja a [indistinct] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who did that, do you know? 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 67 of 194 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is the head of Legal 
Services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is her name – his name? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ms Morashe[?]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Marine Morashe 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And if you check there that 
signature there it is similar to the one in the subsequent page which 
is… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes on page 2. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The second page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you – you were – you went – you had some 
discomfort with the first page? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I had a discomfort with the first 
page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you were not prepared to even initial it. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And your lawyer initialled it? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you signed the second page? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that your own way of trying to protect yourself by 
not signing at a page that you were not comfortable with? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No I was – I was – for some 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 68 of 194 
 
reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You were just not comfortable. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I was just not comfortable.  I 
knew that when I sign at the end it binds me of course. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that will mean – yes yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But the truth of the matter is that 
I was just really not comfortable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – ja, ja.  You knew that it would bind you but… 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And it seems as in terms of 
negotiation on the proposed offer that was the cul-de-sac for us.  There 
10 
was no way I could go. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now if we have regard to that letter that you 
signed and I think it is important that – that we see what was actually 
said so that we can understand why you felt so uncomfortable.  It says 
under the introduction  
“The first employee Innocent Khuba was charged 
with dishonesty and defeating the ends of justice as 
more fully set out in the charge sheet attached 
hereto marked A.  Pursuant to the institution of 
20 
disciplinary action against Mr Khuba the parties have 
reached agreement on the 23 r d September 2015.  The 
parties wished to record in writing the terms of the 
agreement which terms they record below.  Under the 
terms of the agreement: 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 69 of 194 
 
Mr Khuba being legally represented freely and 
voluntarily pleads guilty to the charges proffered 
against him as set out in Annexure A.” 
Is that the – the main part that made you feel very uncomfortable?  
Sorry are you still looking for the page?  It is 287.  I did not realise you 
had closed your file. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Then it says: 
“The employer will impose a sanction of a final 
written warning valid for six months against Mr 
10 
Khuba.  Mr Khuba’s suspension will be uplifted and 
he will report for duty on Monday the 28 t h September 
2015 and then under 7 it says: 
Despite the seriousness of the offence the employer 
is satisfied that Mr Khuba’s candid and openness 
about the offence the fact that he did not waste the 
employer’s 
time 
by 
engaging 
in 
a 
protracted 
disciplinary inquiry and his remorse to be a sufficient 
mitigation against a sanction of dismissal which 
ordinarily would have been appropriate.” 
20 
How did you feel about that? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I will just request you to – to 
just repeat that? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Oh sure.  Do you want to have a look at page 
288 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 70 of 194 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well he was looking at the agreement.  Is that not the 
- what you want him to look at? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes but he seemed to not – I noticed him 
paging… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I think it is your question.  I think he had the 
agreement.  You had the agreement? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I have the agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Oh. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No it was your question. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes oh okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think your question – let me say this.  It would seem 
that the reason why you were uncomfortable with the first page is that 
it saying you were pleading guilty to a charge of dishonesty and 
defeating the ends of justice.  Is that right? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You were uncomfortable about that? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I was very uncomfortable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because your position was that you were not guilty of 
20 
any dishonesty and you were not guilty of anything? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Chairperson and actually for me 
to look at the charges of dishonesty and look at what they were 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 71 of 194 
 
bargaining with me to say this is the sanction.  It could not really – it 
could not balance.  To say a warning when somebody say you have 
been dishonest in the department.  It – more especially as my level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm at your level yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I would have expected the 
employer to say whatever may. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have to go. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  We are not really settling. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So I think the strategy was they 
10 
put a dangling carrot to say we are going to give you this warning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  For this serious, serious, serious 
charge and I took it on the basis that I felt a warning but the charges 
which they were saying they were very serious – they were not 
balanced.  It was not proportional.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want – could you just reiterate again your 
reasons for signing the agreement nevertheless? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The reason for signing for… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Despite your discomfort, despite your position that 
20 
you were saying you were not guilty of anything where – what was your 
– what were your reasons for signing nevertheless? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  As I have indicated and I think 
that part is squarely falling in my warning statement.  Because I 
reflected exactly to how I reached that level to such an extent that I 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 72 of 194 
 
said to myself I have never been in that situation before with the 
department.  I came from the private sector and everywhere I go I was 
the most abused employee.  In terms of the work because I had to do a 
lot of work.  Now the thing was even though the position was so senior 
the picture came that you took yourself to the university.  The 
struggles, the pain of which many people had been saying to me you 
managed to reach a level where the position is regarded as a political – 
they normally appointed directors from a ruling party.  And I am there in 
this position and I said I am just me.  So that part it kind of really took 
the sense of the implication and I was stuck with the reality of how I 
10 
reached there.  It was difficult but I never saw an alternative.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair would this be an appropriate time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we should adjourn. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes if we could? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja we will adjourn and return at twenty five to twelve.  
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let us continue. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Khuba were you during 
the course of these disciplinary proceedings asked to sign an affidavit? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct.  The first … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Do you say in the course of these 
proceedings? 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 73 of 194 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Disciplinary proceedings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Disciplinary proceedings.  Okay.  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I was before the settlement 
agreement the first thing which I was requested to do was to sign a 
statement acknowledging that I lied.  I altered the report.  That was 
done by Advocate Mokhari.  I refused. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I said no I cannot do that and 
that is when the issue of the settlement agreement kicked in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that on the first day of the disciplinary hearing? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was on the first day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Where we had … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is now before he went out to get and then your 
lawyer - and asked to come so that they could discuss or was it later 
than that? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He had already went out with the 
lawyer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Then later on he asked you to sign an affidavit? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That part I refused. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I indicated that I cannot really 
do that because I will be lying. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 74 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Did they want you to say anything about 
Mr McBride or Mr Sesoko in that affidavit? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes.  They wanted me to say 
that they forced me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They wanted you to say in the affidavit that 
Mr McBride and Mr - Mr Sesoko to do what? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  To alter the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To alter the report? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The first report? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So you saw the affidavit.  You read it or did not 
even see it but you knew what it was saying? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No I did not see the affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but they told you what it was saying? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They were saying that we need 
you to - to do an affidavit where you say that Mr McBride and 
Mr Sesoko forced you to change that report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and you refused? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Khuba after signing the 
settlement agreement did you go and see Mr Sesoko? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 75 of 194 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Can you just explain what happened? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I went to Mr Sesoko.  I found 
him at the hospital. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would this have been on the first - same day that you 
signed the settlement agreement or would it have been a few days 
later? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The same day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The same day, okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I - I went to the hospital and I 
told him what transpired but he had already known the details because 
10 
I kept him abreast telephonically … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  In terms of these developments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  When I was meeting with him he 
was - he - he was not really in supportive of what I did but he was more 
relaxed.  We - we could talk about and I said no rest assured I did not 
implicate you there … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you have a copy of the agreement with you at the 
time or not really? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I cannot remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, you cannot remember. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I think it was with my lawyer. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 76 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I think it was with my lawyer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you assured him that you had not implicated him. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Then I went back to Polokwane.  
Suddenly the - I do not know whether it was on television or on 
newspaper but there - there was an issue of saying IPID investigator 
has now spilled it all.  He implicated McBride and Mr Sesoko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that in the media? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was in the media.  There was 
some talk about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now I received a call from 
Mr Sesoko and he wanted to know whether I implicated him and I was - 
I was very angry.  I was very angry because number one I knew that 
that agreement my lawyer would not really leak it to the media.  So I 
started to have doubts because the other copy - my understanding was 
given to the employer.  Who then leaked this thing and also they are 
distorting.  They are not putting the way it happened.  So I said to 
20 
Mr Sesoko I said you know what we had a discussion and an agreement 
that I can even testify in support of your - your disciplinary hearing … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And I said I am going to do a 
confirmatory - confirmatory affidavit. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 77 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I did not waste time.  I went - 
drafted.  I went to the police station … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And after - I think I did an 
assent to him or something … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But I finally signed it at the 
station. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Then I give it to - to him.  I do 
not know what he did with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was the affidavit saying in essence? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The affidavit explained what had 
happened … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And also indicating … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  In fact it is in line with other 
affidavits like the confirmatory affidavit that I deposed in support of 
20 
McBride earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes.  Yes.  So - so it was - it was consistent 
with what you understood to be the true facts? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 78 of 194 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Could you have regard to page 2-9-2?  Is that 
the confirmatory affidavit that you gave to Mr Sesoko? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Just a little - ja.  That is - that is 
the one.  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And if you can have a look at page 2-9-5 
paragraph 15 you say: 
“I wish to state categorically except for what I have 
stated above that neither McBride nor Sesoko 
instructed me to either make any specific changes 
in the report or to exonerate any person in the 
10 
report.” 
Is that correct? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct and if I want to 
add it is also in line with what is in - in Werksmans Report.  There is a 
paragraph they talk about the interview and says Mr Khuba indicated 
that he never received any instruction … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  To exonerate anyone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm.  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then at page 2-9-6 paragraphs 20 and 21 
20 
you say: 
“In respect of my plea to the charges that I was 
facing I do not in any way given the manner in 
which the charge/s are phrased implicate or intend 
to implicate or in any manner suggest that 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 79 of 194 
 
Mr Sesoko is also guilty of the charge that he is 
facing.  In fact in my plea bargain with my employer 
it was also agreed though same is not included as a 
term in the settlement agreement that I am free to 
testify for Mr Sesoko should he find it necessary to 
call me as a witness.” 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct and also in - as 
part of that my lawyer deposed a confirmatory affidavit in terms of what 
happened during that process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now did your employer know that you had 
deposed to this affidavit? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
I 
reported 
on 
duty 
on 
28 September.  That was the Monday because it was concluded I think 
it was around Friday.  Early in the morning while I was having a 
meeting with my staff telling them that I am back and I wanted to check 
how they were doing in terms of the work.  I received a call - telephonic 
call from Mr Kgamanyane.  He asked me why did you depose to this 
statement.  I told him that it is because it is the truth and then after 
that we had some discussions but on the 29 t h that is when I received a 
20 
letter to state reasons in writing why I should not be dismissed.  Those 
- that letter was delivered.  It was delivered late. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the 28 t h? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  On the 29 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The 29 t h? 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 80 of 194 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I think it was the 29 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The 29 t h would that have been a Monday - a Tuesday? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I think it was on Tuesday if I am 
not mistaken. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because Monday was the 28 t h - the 28 t h I think you 
said. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Was the 28 t h … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And then he indicated to me in 
that letter … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  To say I must not - I must tell 
him why he must not replace the final written warning … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  With dismissal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He gave some background on 
the top to say … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  You concluded this agreement. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now you deposed a statement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And when I got that I still 
remember I could not continue.  I had to leave the office.  I went and 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 81 of 194 
 
consulted with the doctor because I was really depressed.  I could start 
to see where it was going. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I guess especially after what you were told at the 
disciplinary hearing which led to the agreement.  Namely whatever you 
say if you continue - if the hearing continues you will be fired. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And my expectation there was 
that if anyway they wanted to discipline me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The first process had already 
been concluded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They were supposed probably to 
initiate a new process … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And use that agreement as an 
aggravation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The way I know the … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The Labour Relation processes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now I did not involve the lawyer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 82 of 194 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I drafted my own response. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I indicated in my response … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That I do not know who leaked 
that - the information about the agreement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And that I think that agreement 
was done in bad faith … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And I stated that I was ready 
that the agreement can be withdrawn … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
And 
face 
the 
disciplinary 
hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I was ready for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I indicated in the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  You had reached that point? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I - I have reached that point … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because I have realised that it 
seems as if there was threat which was used. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 83 of 194 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now let me go and really face 
this … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Hearing … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And then give all I had … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  In order to prove my innocence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now I - I sent that letter … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I cannot remember the exact 
time when I emailed it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But in the afternoon … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  There was a person from Head 
Office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That day I did not go to work 
20 
because when I consulted with the doctor the doctor had given me the 
medication.  So I decided to be at home and say I will not be able to go 
to work.  Now I - I was told that there is somebody on the way 
delivering a letter. 
Now I was so - so surprised but I felt this letter is the letter 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 84 of 194 
 
of dismissal.  I went to the gate. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
This 
was 
now 
after 
you 
had 
sent 
your 
representations? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your explanation? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Then I went to the gate because 
it is an estate setup and I went to collect the letter and I got the letter.  
It meant you are dismissed with immediate effect. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No hearing nothing? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I remember very well how I 
reached the gate but I do not remember how I reached the - the house. 
CHAIRPERSON:  After getting the letter? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was your state of mind after getting the letter 
20 
that makes you not to remember how you reached the house? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The biggest problem is that it 
seemed as my mind was separated from my body. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I was with my son but when I 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 85 of 194 
 
went back I do not remember whether he was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh, hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now - and I was walking 
barefoot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I collected.  I went back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I could not remember what 
happened but I remember while I was in the house … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Then it started to sink in … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That I am now dismissed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  From the employment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Which is the thing you had sought to avoid when 
you agreed to this settlement agreement even though you were not 
happy with page 1? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is what I was seeking avoid 
… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But I want to say Chairperson 
that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I somehow got the consolation 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 86 of 194 
 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Later very late. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The consolation was when I 
heard in the news … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That Mr Sesoko was fired when 
he was admitted in hospital  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Without leading any evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I realised that what I did was 
simply to cross the bridge early … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But anyway I had to cross. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  You - you become more convinced that what had 
been told to your lawyer that you were going to be fired anyway you 
were going to be fired if the disciplinary hearing proceeded must have 
been true? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Khuba who hand delivered this letter of 
dismissal to you? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was - it was a gentleman 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 87 of 194 
 
called Mosie but I remember the time there was my Deputy Provincial 
Head came at the gate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So he was used to hand deliver 
that letter to me and I accepted the letter …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And he then went back … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But from Head Office it was a 
gentleman who was - it was - he was from Gauteng. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I cannot remember the name 
now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm and the letter was signed by Mr Kgamanyane? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So did somebody from Head Office in Pretoria 
again have to drive to Limpopo to hand deliver this letter to you? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And if you can look at the timing between 
20 
sending your representations in response to the letter you have 
received 
on 
29 September 2015. 
 
Is 
it 
possible 
that 
those 
representations could have been considered before leaving Pretoria 
with this letter? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I - I think the way it happened 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 88 of 194 
 
looking at when the - the report was - was sent.  Even though I cannot 
remember vividly the times.  I got this sense that the person was 
already dispatched before they could even entertain what I have written 
because my understanding is that when you have a representation if 
you are an Executive Director you will apply your mind and request 
maybe to have a meeting with your Legal Services or Labour Relations 
and consider the reason - evaluate them and then decide on the 
decision but the way it happened so quick when I sent it in the morning 
or around nine. 
I do not know whether it was nine or 10 and you have in the 
10 
afternoon a person there.  It really shows that it was just what they 
requested me to do was just a formality. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you email your - your explanation? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I think I emailed Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now please will you have regard to the 
document at page 298.  It is a document addressed to you by 
Mr Kgamanyane dated 29 September 2015.  Is that the notice of 
20 
dismissal essentially? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  That was sent to you? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And if we have regard to paragraph 3 it says: 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 89 of 194 
 
“The settlement agreement containing your guilty 
and the sanction was read out to the Chairperson in 
the inquiry who then made a ruling in which he 
confirmed its contents and pronounced you guilty of 
the charge.  The inquiry then terminated on that day 
23 September 2015.  A copy of the settlement 
agreement and Annexure A the charge sheet is 
attached.  On Friday 25 September 2015 in breach 
of your guilty plea and the agreement for a lenient 
sanction short of dismissal as contained in the 
10 
settlement agreement …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not - you are not going to read the whole 
letter, hm? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I think just go to what is important because  
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  “…without my knowledge or consent 
deposed 
to 
an 
affidavit 
in 
Polokwane 
which 
contradicted the terms of your guilty plea as 
contained in the settlement agree.” 
So - and then he in paragraph 6 says: 
20 
“I am of the view that your conduct as explained 
above was a perpetration of a dishonest act and the 
defeating of the ends of justice and you have 
already pleaded guilty to and a serious breach of 
the leniency of the sanction that I gave you with the 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 90 of 194 
 
final written warning.” 
So he uses as you say the fact that you proposed to the 
affidavit.  Now your response is contained on page 3-0-2.  Is that 
correct? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And that refers to you saying that there was 
no condition in the agreement that you could not depose to the affidavit 
and you regard the agreement as being invalid and you are going to go 
to court if need be to set it aside. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Then the next document on page 3-0-5 dated 
30 September 2015 is that the letter of your summary dismissal? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see when I look at this letter that Mr Kgamanyane 
wrote to you asking you to - inviting you - you to make representations 
why it is - ja.  That in terms of that letter what he was seeking to do - 
to - is to in effect do away with the final written warning that had been 
agreed to as part of the settlement in respect of the charges that you - 
you had that been preferred against you and he was seeking to replace 
that with dismissal.  So he was seeking to unbundle the settlement 
20 
agreement? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He - he was seeking to charge you with misconduct in 
regard to you deposing to an affidavit.  He was seeking you to give a 
penalty - a sanction for the charges that you had faced at the 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 91 of 194 
 
disciplinary inquiry. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is quite strange because it looks like on the 
one hand he was seeking to do away with the - with the settlement 
agreement but on the other hand he also wanted to use it because your 
plea of guilty was part of the settlement agreement.  If the agreement 
is put aside that means there is no plea of guilty. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct and Chairperson 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And therefore there should be an inquiry? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the inquiry that had been scheduled from the 
beginning should then proceed? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he - he wanted to retain the part of the settlement 
agreement where you had pleaded guilty but to discard the part of the 
settlement agreement that related to a final written warning and to then 
put in a different - a different sanction that had - that had not been part 
of the settlement agreement. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  Mr Khuba I am now dealing with 
paragraph 103 on page 31 of your statement. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It is 100? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  103 page 31. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Okay.  I am - I am there. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 92 of 194 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Please could tell the Chair what happened on 
3 October 2015 which was three days after your dismissal? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Wentzel.  I may have missed this while 
I was focusing on this letter from Mr Kgamanyane at page 3 - the 
earlier letter at page 3-0-1 or is it the one ending at page 300.  I see 
Mr Khuba that in your representations to Mr Kgamanyane among other 
things or in the last paragraph you say: 
“You have - you had approached the PSA for an 
urgent 
High 
Court 
application 
to 
have 
the 
agreement set aside based on a number of reasons 
10 
to allow you to go through the process of a hearing.  
If you decide to serve me with a letter of dismissal 
please use the same address that appears on your 
letter.  I have been booked off sick due to my ill 
health and will only be back on 08/10/2015.” 
You had a sense that dismissal was going to follow.  Is that right? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you - you made it clear here that you were 
quite happy to actually go through to - to resume the disciplinary 
process and go through a disciplinary process? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And if - if you can perhaps have regard also 
to page 3-0-2.  Sorry.  I can see you already closed it. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Okay.  3-0-2.  Okay. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 93 of 194 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And then one, two, three - the - the last 
paragraph on that page.  You say: 
“The agreement does not have any condition or 
terms which require me to depose or not depose to 
statement regarding this matter or testify in favour 
or against Mr Sesoko.” 
Your paragraph 4 states that: 
“My conduct of deposing an affidavit after the 
settlement contradicted the terms of the guilty plea.  
The agreement does not have terms with regard to 
10 
this issue.  If the employer made an offer for a 
settlement 
agreement 
with 
ulterior 
motive 
unfortunately I fail to read such during the 
acceptance of the offer.  I concluded the agreement 
in good faith putting the interest of my family first.” 
That is in line with what you testified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the - three is a paragraph which is I think 
important also on the last - second page of your letter.  Namely page 
3-0-3.  You say to Mr Kgamanyane: 
“Your paragraphs 6 and seven states that I should 
20 
explain why you should not revoke the final written 
warning and replace it with dismissal.  The same 
plea agreement which was signed by the employer 
does not have a clause that allows the position of 
dismissal without a hearing on the so called new 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 94 of 194 
 
misconduct or any contravention if really there was 
such.  This clearly shows that this agreement is 
used as an instrument of victimisation by the 
employer.  With this threat of dismissal I am not 
convinced that the employer made such an offer - I 
am convinced that the employer made such an offer 
in bad faith.  It is clear that with this amount of 
victimisation the so called six months in which the 
sanction would be active is going to be a nightmare 
for me.” 
10 
That is what you said. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  Okay now Mr Sesoko can 
you tell the Chair what happened on the 3 r d of October 2015 three days 
after your dismissal, where you deal with it in paragraph 103 of your 
statement. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I received a visitation from 
Brigadier 
Ramela 
and 
Colonel 
Mahlangu 
of 
the 
Hawks 
and…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m sorry excuse me Miss Wentzel I think you did 
20 
refer to the letter of dismissal but I actually didn’t go there, what page 
is it again? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It’s page 305 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that in the letter of dismissal he says, that is Mr 
Kgamanyane,  
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 95 of 194 
 
 
“Due to the seriousness of this transgression and the 
 
seniority position you hold in IPID as the Provincial Head, I 
 
find that I’m unable to trust you anymore an as such the trust 
 
relationship has been irreparably broken down.  The position 
 
you occupy is one of trust and the person who occupies it, 
 
must be a person with integrity.  You have demonstrated 
 
through your dishonest conduct that you lack integrity and 
 
cannot be trusted by the employer, I therefore dismiss you 
 
from your employment with immediate effect”. 
 
Does this in any way go back to a point you made earlier on 
10 
with regard to why they would want to keep you as part of the 
settlement if you were guilty of such serious misconduct as dishonesty 
and defeating the ends of justice. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
That’s 
correct 
Chairperson 
because my understanding is that if then what he was saying was true 
why did he stomach the first one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He would not have negotiated to 
have that settlement agreement because we talk about dishonest but 
the truth of the matter is, they were using me to say, how can they get 
20 
me to turn me against McBride and Mr Sesoko and when it backfired 
now they play this strict employer, why are you – why did you depose 
this statement? 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes and – okay let me ask this question, how was 
your relationship with Mr Kgamanyane before this – before the 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 96 of 194 
 
disciplinary hearing? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Mr Kgamanyane was one of my 
best friends in the department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before he became acting Executive Director. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Before he became acting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  To such an extent that we used 
to call each other even over the weekend, we were very, very close and 
when we were attending either strategic planning, when we would go to 
eat we would eat [indistinct] sit together because our offices – our 
10 
provinces were regarded as the best performing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He being Provincial Head in Free State? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Provincial Head. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you being in Limpopo? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  While me being in Limpopo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Normally they wouldn’t find staff 
with us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And it’s just that he was not 
20 
utilised in the investigation of high profile cases or setting up offices. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Then when this thing happened 
it really gave me a shock but somehow I just understood it this way, 
some people are so ambitious to such an extent that when they are 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 97 of 194 
 
looking for a bigger position, integrity no longer matters, so I just felt 
that way and really it was like – and I just want to put this part so that 
Chairperson can understand because after my dismissal when I was 
struggling with how am I going to run my life I realised that I have put 
in petrol claim of the travelling that I did while I was doing this 
hearings.  That petrol claim was supposed to pay me R8 000, I phoned 
head office -  I think it was paid maybe eight months or sometime.  I 
phoned head office, our policy says they pay the claim within 30 days.  
Now when I checked and I kept on phoning, phoning then one of the 
employees told me, we were told not to process your claim because if 
10 
we pay you this money you’re going to pay the lawyer and try to fight 
back, they want you to suffer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that so? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct, so what I did I 
went to another lawyer in Polokwane, not Mr Phooko I was using, we 
wrote numerous letters saying we would have to go to Court you have 
to pay me the thing and they ended up not paying, they paid way after. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say after eight months or so? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  After I had gone to the Labour 
Court to – it was way after. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now Mr Sesoko testified that when Mr Kgamanyane, I 
think his suspension letter if I’m not mistaken, he basically, I think 
asked him a question which kind of required Mr Kgamanyane to say why 
he was doing this because Mr Sesoko said I think the two of them also 
had – they had a very good relationship before Mr Kgamanyane became 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 98 of 194 
 
acting Executive Director of IPID.  He said he had even helped him, I 
think, when he was setting up in the Free State, setting up offices and 
so on and he said Mr Kgamanyane responded and I think there’s a 
transcript for it by saying something along the lines that when you join 
the police before they confirm you or confirm  your appointment and 
they instruct you to go and arrest your  father, you have to go and 
arrest your father, which Mr Sesoko understood as a way of saying, I’ve 
been instructed to do this.  So in other words it’s not me, I’ve been 
instructed to do this.  You did not have any such situation in your 
interactions with Mr Kgamanyane? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No I did not on the basis that 
because I was far from Pretoria I could not have engagement with him 
and I avoided him to make any call to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So he would use someone to 
serve me so I think with Mr Sesoko it was easier because he resides 
around there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay – yes okay thank you, you may continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    Thank you Chair.  Mr Khuba could you 
please now tell the Chair what happened on the 3 r d of October it’s dealt 
20 
with at paragraph 103 of your statement? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  On the 3 r d of October 2015 it 
was approximately three days after my dismissal I received a visitation 
from Brigadier Ramela and Colonel Mahlangu of the Hawks.   When 
they were there, I did not even -  I was not aware because when you 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 99 of 194 
 
enter through the gate you need to get approval the security, they will 
telephone the house but I was just surprised when they were there, I 
don’t know how did they get access.  So they entered the house and 
then we – before they could sit down they were like moving in the 
sitting room, so my garage it’s facing the sitting room, they could see 
the car parked there and they could see – they checked the house and 
they were saying you have such a big house, it might be expensive on a 
monthly basis?  You have a beautiful car, now because you’re not 
working it might be really, really difficult and I was surprised because 
they were saying these things before we could even start to – they were 
10 
just doing like this, ah the house is nice but how are you going to pay 
for this house because now you are not working?  Then when I told 
them we can sit, they said, Mr Khuba we have a solution for 
you…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is even before they could sit down? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:    Before they could even sit 
down, they said they had a solution for me, they’re having something 
good for me, then we sat down.  They were having a docket and 
fortunately that docket, I was able to check because while I was seated 
you know, I just become suspicious why there is a docket when these 
20 
people are visiting me.  So that docket, I wrote the case number down, 
not while I was with them, after they had left and now the – what they 
did was to explain to me, they were very direct, but I need to indicate 
the person who was talking was the junior Colonel, because they 
introduced themselves, the Senior Brigadier Ramela was always – just 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 100 of 194 
 
quiet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was quiet? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He was quiet, not talking much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
The 
person 
who 
was 
a 
spokesperson was…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mahlangu. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Mahlangu and that is when he 
said we want you to make a statement that will implicate Dramat – not 
Dramat, Mr Sesoko and McBride and then you are going to 
10 
be…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Sesoko and Mr McBride? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja so that you can be reinstated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say he was very direct that’s how he put it? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No they were very direct with me 
there, they never duck and dive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now I refused, I said no I can’t, 
why should I make that statement and I saw a charge…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did they say in what way they wanted you to implicate 
20 
them, to implicate Mr McBride and Mr Sesoko? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They indicated…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What did they say? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because they said they forced 
you to do – to alter the report isn’t it, then I said no, they didn’t force 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 101 of 194 
 
me.  Now I’d already seen the charge there in the docket so I just 
started to talk to them and say, no, no they persuaded, persuaded, 
persuaded, came with tricks, you know it’s going to be difficult to 
sustain yourself, how are you going to pay this and what he was 
talking, he was really playing with my emotions, he was really playing 
with my emotions.  Somewhere somehow I felt to say, really why this 
guy is saying this thing because it was – you know when you have just 
gone through a traumatic situation pictures are not far fetched, 
immediately a person mentioned a word it just comes.  So he was 
telling me what I – I even asked myself how I’m going to pay and he 
10 
says, no we’re going to help you Ntlemeza sent us here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What did they say? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They said General Ntlemeza 
sent us here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes and they were from the Hawks and at that 
time he was already acting head of the Hawks. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The Hawks yes, and he said he’s 
going to make everything in his power that you go back to work.  Now I 
knew once bitten twice shy but I wouldn’t have done a statement but I 
realised this is coming again, it’s coming again and after that, after we 
20 
had a discussion then they…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before – after you had, had a discussion tell us 
how the discussion ended? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The discussion ended when they 
were saying they will come the following day, they wanted me to think 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 102 of 194 
 
about it and if it’s possible you can consult with your lawyer, any 
person, this is good for you.  They were just indicating how, you know it 
will really assist me.  Then the following day, I’m not recollecting 
completely 
what 
happened 
but 
it 
seems 
as 
they 
came 
again…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The following day? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The following day and we could 
not understand each other…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This was February 2016? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No that was October. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I’m sorry October 2015? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  2015 Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Then they left again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So on the second day, what did they say, I want that 
discussion? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They wanted to know from me 
whether I thought about it and they were like playing like my friends, 
please we are going to help you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were being nice to you? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:    Very, very nice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and this time was it just the two of them again or 
was there different…[intervenes]. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I think it was the two of them I 
don’t remember any person coming there, now…[intervenes]. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 103 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they – I want the discussion between the two of 
you, just tell me more this time now? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No the discussion was whether 
you have spoken with your lawyer, what happened what is the decision 
that you have taken, I said, no I can’t. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They still insisted to say we 
want to help you if you have a problem just give us a call and they were 
saying they were leaving and then they left but at that time I was under 
a medication, I think I used it for almost a week. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And it made me to kind of really 
sleep, I would sleep sometimes from 9 o’clock until 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  9AM to 4PM. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  4PM and again in the evening I 
would just sleep. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You’d just sleep? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But I only use it for – I think for 
a week and then while I was just – I think I was in my sleep, I think – ja 
I was in my sleep or just woken up, I got a call from Mahlangu, that is 
20 
the call that was recorded, it was recorded because I had an app on my 
phone that would record every call but I will just choose which one I 
want to save. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now – then that is when they 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 104 of 194 
 
said to me, but he was a little bit diplomatic in the call. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the phone ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But he was reiterating what he 
said, to say that, you know your enemies, if you make this Ntlemeza, 
you know Ntlemeza will reinstate you, I just felt that he was a little bit 
cautious unlike when he was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When he was in the house. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   In the house then…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But tell me on that conversation on the phone, just 
tell me in full what he said and what you said back as far as you are 
10 
able to remember? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  What I remember is that he said 
make a statement against your enemy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that how he put it? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja put it, because he was 
indicating this people, Mr Sesoko and Mr McBride are my enemies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  My close friend is General 
Ntlemeza because I’ve been interacting with him for quite some time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:    So – and he said they would 
want me to make a statement.  So I was – I was like dizzy I just okay I 
never engaged with them and even the first part, it indicated that there 
was something wrong with me because I even thought it was Phooko, I 
said Mr Phooko because I thought it was my lawyer but it was later that 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 105 of 194 
 
I realised that it was Colonel Mahlangu because he was there in the 
house but I also want to add that even from that call I realised that the 
medication was not really doing me any good, I still remember  my wife 
saying, let’s put this in the dustbin you go and see how you look for a 
job outside, even if you pick up papers as long as our kids eat and that 
was the last time I…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh she was saying maybe just forget the IPID issue. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just look for another job. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Recover. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So it was the issue of that just 
step down and make whatever you can make. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja make peace with and put it behind you. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but the conversation on the telephone or with 
Colonel Mahlangu ended on the basis that he said make a statement 
against your enemies and you said – or something like that? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes and including that you will 
be reinstated. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that you will then be reinstated? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay and then what happened – oh I’m sorry Ms 
Wentzel you may continue, do we have that – a transcript of that 
telephone conversation? 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 106 of 194 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let’s go to it. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    The transcript is Annexure 24 and it starts at 
page 308, the actual wording at 310.  Now…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes page 310. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So you’ll see, I don’t know you would like to 
read it or are you happy for me to read it Mr Khuba? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe read it yourself Miss Wentzel, I think it 
will be quicker. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    That’s fine he says…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  We don’t need to read the whole thing, just the 
important features. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  He says, 
 
“No I’m not at home down at the bottom paragraph 20, yet but 
I’m at a elder’s house, where – okay, okay.  In the rural areas here I am 
home, no one stays here so I decided to come and open the windows 
for some fresh air.  Oh that’s good yes.  Then he says, you say no man 
thanks I will talk to Brigadier maybe tomorrow to finalise the 
appointment on Monday.  Yes…[intervenes}. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think just say Khuba, Mahlangu so that… 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:    I apologise yes, 
 
“Khuba, no man thanks I will talk to Brigadier maybe 
 
tomorrow to finalise the appointment on Monday. Colonel 
 
Mahlangu, yes, yes I forgot to show you something, then 
 
Khuba, okay, Colonel Mahlangu, yes I forgot to show you 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 107 of 194 
 
 
something just so that you know that everything that you do 
 
for good for yourself.  Khuba, okay.  Mahlangu, General, 
 
General remember General is your friend.  Khuba, Yes.  
 
Mahlangu remember General Ntlemeza is your friend.  Khuba, 
 
yes I know he is my friend.  Colonel Mahlangu, you must  
 
understand that whatever you do well for yourself.  Khuba, 
 
yes.  Colonel Mahlangu, not to support your enemies.  Khuba 
 
yes.  Mahlangu, we will make him we will make him and we 
 
will empower him to ensure that you restore your job that is 
 
what you must do.  Khuba, okay.  Mahlangu, that you must 
10 
 
know whatever everything of good you do for yourself.  
 
Khuba, okay.  Mahlangu, and you are not in line with your 
 
enemy.  Khuba, yes, yes yes.  Mahlangu, as soon as 
 
everything is finalised General is the one who will do good for 
 
you.  Khuba, okay okay.  Mahlangu, as a friend, as a person 
 
you know.  Khuba, yes.  Mahlangu, I do not think he will dump 
 
you, I do not think he will throw you in the mud the only thing 
 
you must do is be honest to yourself, fix everything, do not 
 
take wrong ideas and advices and then we will tell General 
 
the NPA will deal with whatever they deal with but we will 
20 
 
inform General that since this guy has pushed for us to reach 
 
where we are.  Khuba, yes.  Mahlangu, as a witness.  Khuba, 
 
yes.  Mahlangu, then he is acquitted.  Khuba, okay.  
 
Mahlangu, and something has to be done, he has to be 
 
restored next to his position or to his [indistinct].  Khuba, 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 108 of 194 
 
 
okay.  Mahlangu, yes please you must underline it, you must 
 
put NB behind it and underline it do not do it.  Khuba, Okay 
 
and then the response, do not highlight it with a highlighter 
 
you must write it with a red pen underneath it is the best 
 
statement to you, you must empower yourself”. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you, that transcript of course she hasn’t 
read everything on the transcript, that transcript of that telephone call, 
does it reflect substantially the conversation you had on the phone with 
Colonel Mahlangu? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That’s correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Khuba if we can then go to paragraph 107 
on page 32 of your statement an if you could please the Chair what 
happened on Wednesday the 24 t h of February 2016? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before we go there, did Colonel Mahlangu 
follow-up on the issue that the two of you discussed on the telephone 
at a later stage? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No what happened, I am the one 
who gave him a call, it was on Monday because he was supposed to 
come on Monday. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And that is when I said I was in 
Pretoria and I said I won’t be available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would that have been a few days after the day on 
which the telephone call took place? 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 109 of 194 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You called him. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja just to say I am not going to 
available at home. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the – was he going to come home 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He was going to come again on 
Monday because he wanted to see whether I have changed my mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now on the – on the – on the transcript of the 
telephone conversation I did not pick up anything in terms of which he 
was going to come home.  Did he call after – afterwards to say I would 
10 
like to come home or is it in the conversation? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I think if we check… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I might not have picked it because I did not read 
everything.  But that is your understanding?  In the telephone 
conversation… 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Let me go to the – just to refresh 
my mind.  Telephone conversation.  The transcript where is it? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It is on page 3 – well it starts – you can look 
at page 310 onwards. 
CHAIRPERSON:  3? 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  310. 
CHAIRPERSON:  310? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  310.  Okay.  Okay there it says – 
“No man thanks I will talk to Brigadier maybe 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 110 of 194 
 
tomorrow to finalise the appointment on Monday.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is  
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so that. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was going to talk to the Brigadier. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With a view to make an appointment for either him or 
them to see you on Monday. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And then you phoned him before they could 
come? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you had said to him you are not at home? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what else did you say in that telephone 
conversation? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was very, very short.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I do not remember having said 
20 
anything further than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And he just said okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and there was no further arrangement made? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 111 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and nothing actually… 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I do not remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They did not pursue the issue? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No there was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja they did not. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  I think then you can continue. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  So just so we can get the timeline.  This first 
visit that you had from Colonel Moukangwe was the 3 r d October 2015. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Okay. 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Then I am not going to deal with the – the 
Labour Court application yet.  Then the following year on Wednesday 
the 24 t h February 2016 is it correct that you were again visited by 
members of the Hawks?  If you have a look at paragraph 107 of your 
statement page 32. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Please could you tell the Chair what 
happened? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry I think – I think we should say for what it 
is worth Ms Wentzel.  You – Mr Khuba you did in October 2015 you 
20 
lodged an application in the Labour Court challenging your dismissal, is 
that right? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you have attached your founding affidavit and 
loss of motion as Annexure HIK25? 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 112 of 194 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Wentzel will not go to that now but just for the 
sequence let us do – I wanted us to record the sequence. And then that 
it seems was decided in April 2017. She will deal with that later.  In the 
meantime then she wants to talk to you about what is in 107.  Okay.  
Then you can continue Ms Wentzel. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair.  So if you can have a look at 
paragraph 107 of your statement. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I received a visitation again from 
members of the Hawks it was on the 24 t h February 2016. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You should not ask him to look at it unless he says he 
wants to refresh his memory.  You just ask him a question and then he 
can tell the story. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  No I intended him to do that I just 
wanted him to understand where – you know what it is what – just for 
the dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What happened in February 2016?  Did you have any 
meeting or visit by members of the Hawks? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tell me more.  Tell me about that visit?  Who visited 
20 
you?  Where it was?  And what was discussed. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was Brigadier Xaba.  It was 
Sewela I do not remember the rank. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can refresh your memory if you want to look at 
the names that is fine. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 113 of 194 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Okay.  And Colonel Maluleke. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And those three when they 
came. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes did they make an appointment before or not? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I cannot remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I cannot remember whether 
there was any appointment made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  They came to your house? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And that is when they told me 
about the case of defeating. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Defeating the ends of justice. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ends of justice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And fraud.  But when they 
showed me the case number I realised that it is the same case number 
that I have already quoted it in my Labour Court papers long time ago 
20 
during the initial visit in… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of Colonel Mahlangu and … 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja in October. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes which you saw… 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 114 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which they – had with them. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But this time the charge had 
changed.  It is no longer perjuries now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Fraud and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Defeating the ends of justice. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Defeating the ends of justice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes.  And they told me that they 
were investigating – they wanted my warning statement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the Hawks of course at that time were under 
General Ntlemeza? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Your friend. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes.  The one who according to Mr Mahlangu 
was going to re – have you reinstated if you – if you signed and – 
statement implicating Mr McBride and Mr Sesoko. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct.  Yes continue. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So I then agreed that I will 
20 
submit a statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what did they say to you and what did you say to 
them?  I want that conversation. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They told me about the charges 
and they gave me questions.  They were questions I think they were up 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 115 of 194 
 
to I think it was 21 or cannot remember vividly now.  But those 
questions were written down to say did you do a report with Colonel 
Moukangwe?  Did you sub – those type of things? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And what I did… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was there a purpose – was the purpose of their visit 
to give you those questions or was the purpose to serve you with a 
charge sheet or summons or what was their purpose?  The purpose of 
their visit? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  There were no not – they… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  They did not say what the purpose was? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  No they just indicated that there 
is this case of alteration of report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  We want to obtain a warning 
statement from you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh they wanted to get a warning statement from you? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Then I took the questions and I 
20 
said I am going to submit a warning statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Of which I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But I think I need to put this in 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 116 of 194 
 
context.  Because that was for the first time that I told myself that now 
here I am going to say it all.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm in your statement? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  In my statement.  At that time I 
had not yet even told McBride about the visitation I got from… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Colonel Mahlangu. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ntlemeza, Mdluli and that one 
was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Sorry Ntlemeza. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Telling me about being seen 
by… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Dramat. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  General Mdluli. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Those parts – those details… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had not shared them with Mr McBride and Mr 
Sesoko. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Even Mr Sesoko did not know. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now I felt that this time let me 
open the lid and I was doing it out of the feeling that I held the secret 
which if I do not say it out it will never be known.  So I then did the 
statement.  When I did the statement at the bottom there when I 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 117 of 194 
 
finalised the statement then I started to respond to those questions.  I 
think my warning statement were almost eleven pages then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And then two or three or one 
page – let us say around two pages might have been the response to 
the questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now I took the warning 
statement and went to the office of Brigadier Xaba.  He had hired or 
requested somebody to give him an office in Polokwane. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  So it directed me where I had to 
submit that statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes otherwise were these people from Gauteng or 
were they Limpopo people? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  From – I think they were from 
Gauteng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Then what happened there I 
gave him the statement.  I was accompanied with a lawyer whom I 
20 
requested from Limpopo.  The one who assisted me to write those 
letters demanding for R8 000.00. Now this lawyer was that he read the 
statement – we sat there.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Just before you get there.  If you have got those 
letters please give them – copies to the legal team where you were 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 118 of 194 
 
writing to the head office of IPID asking them to pay your claim and 
they were not doing that. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I will check that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay continue. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Then the – we handed – I 
handed over the statement.  Before I could sign because there are 
some processes that need to be followed when you are take – you are 
obtaining a warning statement.  It is not simply an issue of signing and 
– he read it and pre – he prepared something that entails the rights of 
the person so that one could understand as a suspect that whatever he 
10 
says is going to be used in the court of law.  Now when he read it he 
said to me – in the middle he just stopped. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was that now? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your attorney or? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Brigadier Xaba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Brigadier Xaba ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he read it while you were there. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I was there I was seated there 
20 
because I wanted to sign. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He read it and he took my 
warning statement somewhere in the middle he put it on the table.  
[Indistinct] Mr Khuba was he this necessary to say? That is what he 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 119 of 194 
 
asked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I said to him for me it was 
necessary but my lawyer was quick to say you cannot really tell what 
the suspect needs to say.  It is his right.  So he then took and he was 
no longer willing. I could see that he took the page where I was just 
had to sign. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But he was not really … 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was not happy with your statement. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He was not happy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He was not happy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Then after that I signed and I 
requested a copy which I got.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  If you have a look at page 351 of the bundle it 
is Annexure 27. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not say 251? 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  351. 
CHAIRPERSON:  351. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Is this the statement that you are referring to 
where you said you are now going to set the truth out? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The warning statement. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 120 of 194 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  The warning statement? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And as you testified you set out everything 
that had occurred and it was only in the last part of the statement from 
page 361 that you say you will respond to the remaining questions. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Do you know what it was in the statement that 
the General had problem with or the Brigadier had a problem with? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I could not see what he was 
reading but somewhere somehow while he was reading – he took a bit 
10 
of time but he reach a part where he seems as he could not continue 
and then he said:  “Was it necessary Mr Khuba to put this thing in?” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And is it correct that this statement is 
substantially in line with what you have testified here today? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Mr Khuba were you later arrested? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  And please could you tell … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that on the 16 March 2016? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Please could you tell the Chair the 
circumstances of your arrest? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  We firstly went to the so called 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 121 of 194 
 
CATS office that the office of a unit headed by Brigadier Xaba which 
was responsible for crimes against the state.  We had a meeting saying 
that we are going to be appearing on this date.  We had a discussion of 
the bail – bail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At this stage when you were being – when you were 
arrested your case in the Labour Court was still pending?  It had not 
been dealt with – decided yet? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Chairperson I would want to 
cover that part because there is also a bargaining council. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Which I want to talk to.  If you 
allow me I can start with it? 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And just indicate what happened 
before I come to the issue of the arrest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If in terms of the sequence of events  
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It happened later that is fine but otherwise if it is not 
going to disorganise your plan you can deal with the arrest and then 
deal with – with that.  Which one is – would it make – enable you to tell 
20 
your story better? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I can deal with the Labour issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Later. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now Okay. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 122 of 194 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And just finalise so that – 
because the arrest took place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay deal with the labour issue. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The labour issue as I indicated 
to – in my letter to Mr Kgamanyane which of course he did disregard 
was that I was going to make an application at the high court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To – yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  To request … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The setting aside of the settlement agreement. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Setting aside of the settlement 
agreement.  I had already spoken to a person working at the labour – at 
the union – the PSA and already indicated that you need to come and 
see me so that we can discuss this issue.  Now I then had a 
subsequent meeting with him and he said the urgent application PSA 
will not be able to cover.  And that is when I then turned to another 
lawyer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh your application to the Labour Court was an 
urgent application. 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was an urgent application. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because I wanted them to set 
aside.  When I had a discussion with my lawyer not Mr Poko the new 
one now.   
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 123 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And who was the – was that the one who helped 
you with the letters or was that somebody else? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was somebody else.  It was 
the one who was helping Mr Sesoko.  It was Mr Mathibe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mathibe okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja.  And I requested – then he 
advised that when you challenge  
CHAIRPERSON:  A dismissal. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  A dismissal you do not have to 
challenge per se the agreement because these are labour matters. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  You need to go through to the 
labour court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now I followed the advised it is 
correct and then we started to work.  He gave me the bill I accepted it 
in the – I did not have money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the bill. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You said we will see it later. 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  We will see it later I just want 
the thing to be sorted out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  We were given the date of – 
when was that – that was the 15 t h I cannot remember very well but it 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 124 of 194 
 
was shortly after the – they were very quick.  They give us the date.  
And the advocate was helping me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Was a junior advocate and he 
said no he is confident that we are going to really make it.  But when 
we went there I think the argument of the employer was that this matter 
is not urgent.  They did not dwell on the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the merits. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  On the merits on the subject.  
Now after that it means that I had to wait for the bargaining council. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – ja the dispute about the dismissal. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was referred to the bargaining council. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now Mr Poko had prepared 
papers and then we were given a date for the conciliation part.  And I 
still remember the employer representative was there.  I went there I 
was also represented by Mr Poko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  When we – we had a discussion 
because they wanted us to state the case and then the employer rep 
also stated 
the case. 
 
During 
your discussion 
the 
employer 
representative indicated that we were given mandates not to settle or 
entertain this. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 125 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the employer’s representative? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja  yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now she wanted to know the 
facts what happened and there and there she indicated that you are not 
going to succeed here.  Why did you not have a hearing – they were 
talking and they were just really… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They know we were told to come 
and do this. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And then after that we left.  That 
is the first time that I had a meaningful smile.  That somebody coming 
from an institution has already gathered these facts.  And then after 
that we waited now for arbitration.  It took for quite some time.  Then 
we were told – and they decided that because there was no hearing we 
are not going to lead any evidence.  We are going to prepare 
arguments.  And I still remember we – they did a research – there was 
also a similar case like mine and they say an employer cannot replace 
any sanction by a chairperson.  When the chairperson decide you 
20 
cannot do anything.  Because you have appointed that chairperson to 
represent you as an employer and his decision about the matter it is 
what closes the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That case may have been the case of BMW in the 
Labour Appeal Court a number of years ago? 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 126 of 194 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I think you are correct 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That I happen to know. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes continue. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And then we did our submission.  
I was very, very, very confident.  Now after that I was told that within 
fourteen days I am going to get the award.  It might have taken more 
than 30 or 35 days.  Now there was this person whom I was – I got his 
number – he was the person who was dealing with.  Because when I 
10 
phoned the bargaining council they told me that if you want award you 
deal with this person.  So I was dealing with that person.  Now when it 
come to the 21 s t I could not take it anymore and I said – can you tell 
me what is happening?  And he says – no, no, no I will come back to 
you they are busy dealing with this issue.  And I was phoning him daily.  
I would not mind that I called him the previous day I will keep on calling 
him.  Now this other day – that was the day before he sent a report.  He 
mentioned something that I felt there is something going on.  And – but 
I down played because you desire certain results you kind of really 
shun your mind from the negatives.  And then he says: the process here 
20 
– he was trying to explain the delay.  He says the process here it takes 
14 days to give an award but there is a panel that sits because the 
presiding officers of this arbitration are not the employees they get 
them from outside.  He said this person if you right – he did not 
indicate or – this person is the one that he said – if you give a report 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 127 of 194 
 
and a finding which the panel does not agree with it they will engage 
you and write back to you.  But if you says it is my report I will stick 
with the – they will never change it.  It is up to you.  That is why it had 
to take long.  And when I got this report now – arbitration award I was 
just seated on the bed and I was checking on the – on the email. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it came through? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And it came through that is the 
following day.  When it came through I read the report.  I could not 
believe the finding.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What was the finding? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The finding was that my position 
was so senior that it did not require that hearing.  That Mr Kgamanyane 
later requesting me to explain why I did not – why I depose a statement 
amount to affording me with an opportunity similar to a hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He said the dismissal was both 
fair and he indicated another word which I cannot remember now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Valid and fair or something like that or fair and 
equitable. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Something like that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But I looked at this report and I 
had to call my lawyer.  And one time after these presentations were 
served my lawyer said to me the chairperson of the hearing is the 
gentleman I work with because I am sometimes requested by the 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 128 of 194 
 
bargaining council to – he knows him very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To arbitrate. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He knows him very well.  Now I 
was not really settled on the basis that they – on the basis that the 
know each other.  I was settled on the basis that my case is strong.  He 
is going to be objective.  And then after that when I got this I phoned 
my lawyer and my lawyer said to me Mr Khuba you can just suspect 
what happened.  This case involves big people politician and he 
dropped the phone.  And that part I realised that I was dealing with 
bigger monster than what I thought.  I then – at the time I had not yet 
10 
claimed my patience.  I was just working.  You know I started something 
putting in boards that I can clean carpets going to houses.  And now I 
was doing that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to earn a living in the meantime. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  To earn a living.  Then I said to 
my wife I said I do not want to stop that job.  But let me claim my 
pension so that when I have deficit I will just take probably a little bit of 
interest and drop into the deficit so that I can be able to break even.  
And she agreed.  Because I really realised there that the journey was 
going to be long.  I realised the journey was going to be long.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Having heard that to get your 
case finally heard by Labour Court it will take nearly two years.  So I 
realised that the journey was going to be long and then I started to – 
the reality started to sink in at that time. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 129 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then did you then launch a review application 
in the Labour Court or what happened? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  To set aside that – that aware and to – to try 
and get reinstated? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct.  And when the 
PSA studied the report I still remember I met with the head now not 
with the person who was assisting me initially.  The head of PSA at a 
Provincial level and he just said I cannot believe these findings.  And 
what he did then was to say I will motivate that they approve the review 
10 
of this and that is what he did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And then there was a review application in the 
Labour Court? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  There was a review application 
and I got – there was a final judgment which was made I think it was 
April 2017 
CHAIRPERSON:  17. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  17.  It was almost a year and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I think there is a reference to 2017.  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  2017.  It was a year and seven 
20 
months or … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and what was the out - the order that was made 
there? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The order was made that the 
dismissal was both - was unfair. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 130 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was a contrary of what … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The person said, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you - you were reinstated? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I was reinstated and also the 
order was like very - somehow I felt that it was a little bit … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Unfair? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Not unfair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because the department was 
given only five days to pay … 
CHAIRPERSON:  A lot of money? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  To pay back - I mean … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your back pay? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  My back pay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  You - you - oh.  Oh.  You - you thought- you 
thought they should have been given more time? 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But finally what - of course the 
one which I was really interested I was really happy about … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the job? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was going back to work. Even 
if they had said they will take another year to pay. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 131 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you … 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I never had a problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As long as you got your job back? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is why when the employer 
approached me they said there is this order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  We have a problem that we 
cannot just implement it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The space is very short.  We 
requested that you give us some more time.  I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And but that time the - the Executive Director was 
back? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He was already back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr McBride? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He was already back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So basically it was his decision now? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And then I - I came back to the 
department … 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 132 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you paid ultimately for the whole time that you 
had not been working? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct including all the 
benefits. 
CHAIRPERSON:  All the benefits, ja. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you.  I am sure you were very happy and 
the family was very happy. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  You see Chairperson sometimes 
I was happy … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But sometimes we normally gain 
more than what - we normally gain less than what we lost. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because to go … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I understand this yes. 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And start rebuilding the pension 
again is another issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  When I went back to SARS to 
say I want to - to pension fund. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 133 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I want to deposit back my 
money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They told it is such a big penalty 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And I realised that it is going to 
be very … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a difficulty.  Yes. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Difficult. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in any event whatever pain you went through just 
because later on you get an order reinstating you in your job does not 
mean you did not go through that pain. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You still went through that pain.  The job comes later 
and the back pay but you - you and the family went through the - that 
pain. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, thank you.  I think Ms Wentzel we are close to 
20 
finishing with him. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us finish before and then we take the lunch break. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  No.  We - we are virtually finished. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the arbitration award and the Labour Court 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 134 of 194 
 
judgment … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are they both here? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No, but I will make them available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, put them in so that we have a complete picture. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  We will.  I am afraid now that we 
have dealt with the - a happy result can we go back and remember your 
arrest. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  We go back to pain and suffering. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja.  I was arrested on the 16 t h 
and … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  The 16 t h of what? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was - let me just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page - paragraph 1-1-1. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes). 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I was arrested on 16 March 2016 
20 
for defeating the ends of justice and I think just - to just give a little bit 
is that I thought probably we are just going to go there and appear.  
They are going serve us with J175 but we were arrested.  We went 
through the cells and it was - it was very traumatic for me because we - 
we went through - we had a group of other people who were going for 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 135 of 194 
 
court. 
We were put in a big hall where there were other suspects or 
criminals or - but I think what - what was happening was everybody was 
staring at us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  On the basis that we were the 
only people wearing suits (indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And they were requested - they 
requested a belt.  I still remember I took out mine.  Fortunately the 
10 
trouser was - trouser was very tight.  I could not hold it by my hand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I then - we then went for 
fingerprints.  We then joined others again and after that they decided to 
give us our belts back … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And I think there was mention 
one officer indicated because Mr McBride had a problem with the issue 
of the belts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He said why would you need 
these belts … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exactly. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And then they said - he said 
what if you hang yourself and Mr McBride says … 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 136 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean were you prisoners already? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Mr McBride indicated that he 
had been in the (indistinct) for some time … 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the gallows? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Waiting to be hanged and never 
decided to die.  Why would he hang himself by this thing that does not 
have any - it does not have a head and a tail and then - that is when he 
decided to give us our belts back.  They gave us a small cell.  We went 
and sat there and then we went to court. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Just one final question.  Mr Sesoko testified 
that recently there has been a Public Protector’s Report implicating 
him. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Are you also implicated in that report? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
I 
am 
also 
implicated 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  What report is that? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You remember Mr Sesoko testified that there 
20 
is a recent report by the Public Protector.  It had come out I think in the 
- the last week - in the week that he was testifying or in the previous 
week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, but have you finished on the arrested and 
prosecution? 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 137 of 194 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Issue? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Your right.  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think finish on the … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  On the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the prosecution. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  What ultimately happened to your - your 
criminal case? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  We had three court appearances 
if I remember well and then they were just being postponed and we 
realised that the state was just buying time.  They will refuse to give us 
a certain part of the docket that we have right over and they indicated 
that no, no, no that is sensitive information. 
So we ended up saying no, no, no you can keep whatever you 
keep.  What you are giving us we are going to use that and that is when 
we appeared on 1 November 2016 and I was ready with my statement in 
order to plea to say I plead not guilty and that is when the prosecutor 
refused to continue with the case. 
20 
We pressurised him saying we want to continue.  He said no 
this case is not winnable.  There is a Constitutional Court judgment.  
You people were doing your work.  There were a lot of just explanation 
juggling around. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This was the prosecutor saying this to you? 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 138 of 194 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So effectively saying the state has no case? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He was saying that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He also said that now the 
witnesses do not want to come forward and testify and we were 
surprised because there is a - a remedy for that.  You subpoena a 
witness … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But they said no they - they 
10 
cannot do that until they said no they are withdrawing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ever understand who those witnesses were 
supposed to be or - or were that they were talking about? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  They - they spoke about - the 
witness whom they were speaking about was the person who 
accompanied me to take a docket and anyone will know that that person 
did not participate in … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He only filed the docket … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  and he indicated that no I 
accompanied him … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 139 of 194 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And I said I accompanied him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He accompanied me.  What was 
that?  What was that?  What was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Of evidential material … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  In his statement? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But they say because McBride is 
10 
back he may not want to testify but I just realised that no, no that was 
just an excuse. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So you - you - other than that person were you 
ever told who else was - was understood by the state to be state 
witnesses? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
It 
was 
Sandile July 
of 
Werksmans … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because they indicated that he 
was not ready when he was ready to go to court … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  In order to challenge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was refusing to testify? 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 140 of 194 
 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  He was refusing to testify … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But I could not understand if 
then Mr July can sub - submit a report and recommend criminal 
charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Recommend that you be charged. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And now he turns around and 
says no, no I rather to go to court and challenge you to say I do not 
want to go and testify. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That was strange indeed. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was strange. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it was like he was not prepared to stand in court 
and - and show why his conclusions were - were justified? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct and - and my - 
my assessment there was that I do not think these things were intended 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  To have ultimate result of 
serving justice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It was simply to have quick wins 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Because you can charge me.  
That is process … 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 141 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But when you have to prove 
there … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  In front of the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The Judge. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Hm.MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
It 
is 
another story.  So they did not want to reach that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes and then - and then the charges were 
withdrawn? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Just finally if you could deal with the recent 
Public Protector’s Report. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The Public Protector’s Report is 
challenging.  I am just going to give a quick indication of what really 
happened. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA: 
 
The 
Public 
Protector 
recommended … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That a number of people within 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 142 of 194 
 
IPID be charged … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But for some reasons … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I am also … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The charge - disciplinary? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Disciplinary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I am also part of that because of 
an appointment of a specialist who deals with cellphone analysis but 
10 
what happened is that the post was advertised and they did short 
listing.  I was not there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I think they did.  They did the 
advert even - before I even arrived in I - I was reinstated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now the other day because I 
was given a responsibility to head the task team - all task teams in the 
IPID. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Now I was working in Head 
Office and then I wanted to go to the lift and then I was told that there 
is an interview and one of the panel members was not there.  They 
requested me to assist and I indicated to them that when you assist in 
the panel you need to be appointed. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 143 of 194 
 
So I said because I am only participating in the - in the 
interview I request that you get permission.  They got the approval of 
the - the ED.  Then I sat in the panel.  We recommended but what I 
want to say is that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That - the role that I play … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I played it is governing in terms 
of Provision 11 of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The procurement … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Sorry.  Of - for the Recruitment 
Policy … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But that policy on that provision 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  It specifically say what is 
expected of a person … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Who it is - who it is interviewing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The consistency with posing 
questions … 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 144 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  And all - all the things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  The - the Public Protector never 
made a finding on that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  But they made a finding that I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I want - I am sorry.  I wanted to ask Ms Wentzel 
why - why must I hear about the Public Protector’s Report that was 
issued recently? 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Because if you remember Mr Sesoko’s 
testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It is his view that this is still part of a fight 
back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But - but have you - has the Commission investigated 
that in relation to the conduct of the Public Protector? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Well not in relation to the conduct of the 
Public Protector but only from their perspective that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No.  What I am asking is if they say the Public 
20 
Protector is doing this - what the Public Protector is doing is part of the 
fight back.  Has that being … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It is being … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Tested by the Commission?  Was that being 
investigated? 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 145 of 194 
 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  It is being investigated.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Why do we not wait until … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That has happened? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, because it is not in the statement. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  No.  We will not deal with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a recent thing. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If - if they say it is part of whether you call it fight 
10 
back or whatever you need to get statements from them.  Hear what the 
substantiation is.  How they substantiate that and then if necessary 
then we - we can - can come back … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I do not think we should … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes that is - that is about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Deal with it … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before there is proper investigation. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You understand that - you understand that 
Mr Khuba? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I understand that but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That what I am - what I am saying is and - and it is 
just that I - I - when Mr Sesoko gave evidence I think it was dealt with 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 146 of 194 
 
very superficially.  What I am saying is it may be that it is something 
that should be add here but it should not be add before the 
investigators of the Commission and the legal team take statements 
and look at it properly.  You understand that? 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  I understand that and I think we 
can deal with it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, it can … 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Later if it needs to be dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja that is right. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So because otherwise we are dealing with something 
that has not been properly investigated … 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it should not be like that. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  I understand that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Chair I do not have any … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Further questions for the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you very much Mr Khuba for coming to 
20 
give evidence and to share with the Commission your experiences and 
what you know.  You probably will come back because there is still 
some further - an affidavit that you are going to put together and so 
arrangements will be made in due course for you to come back so that 
you can deal with the Werksmans Report but be in touch with the legal 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 147 of 194 
 
team. 
If at all possible depending on your situation I think I would 
like - I would be glad if the preparation of that affidavit can happen 
without delay.  I do not know what - what the chances are that by end 
of this - of this coming week it could be done but if not at least it 
should not delay for more than two weeks. 
I would like to - those affidavits to be available.  Your one, 
Mr McBride’s one and Mr Sesoko’s one and the legal team must be in 
touch with them but I know you would share the information with them 
as well.  Am I right Mr Khuba? 
10 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja and then we will take it from there but 
otherwise thank you very much for - for coming to give evidence but for 
now you are excused. 
MR HUMBULANI INNOCENT KHUBA:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  We are going to take the lunch 
adjournment now.  The time is 26 passed.  We will - pass one - we will 
resume at 20 - we will resume at half past two.   
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when we resume we will then start with the 
20 
evidence of Colonel Naidoo. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 148 of 194 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready Ms Wentzel? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes I am. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we are now going to hear the evidence of Colonel 
Naidoo to whom Colonel Roelofse referred in his evidence. In 
accordance with the order that I made yesterday he is not present here 
in this hearing room but he was – he will be heard here and when he is 
asked questions he will hear the questions and be able to give an 
answer.  He has already been sworn so the oath has been administered 
to him but when we start I will just get him to confirm that the oath has 
10 
been administered to him, but before we get there Ms Wentzel is there 
anything you want to say before we start? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   No, not at this stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you not want to explain how he will deal with the 
question of identities of some of the implicated persons so that 
everybody knows so that when you get to that stage people don’t 
wonder what is happening. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes Chair I was going to deal with it with 
Colonel Naidoo so that he could also understand why we’re doing what 
we’re doing but I can just as well ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think just say it for the public and then you can 
repeat it with him later. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes in Colonel Naidoo’s statement because 
he was involved in Crime Intelligence a good number of the people 
referred to in his statement either are or were or may have been agents 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 149 of 194 
 
of Crime Intelligence, or also informers.   Because of this a letter was 
addressed to Crime Intelligence asking them to state who are the actual 
agents involved in covert operations because it was Colonel Naidoo’s 
view that the vast majority of people who were placed into the agent 
program were placed into that program as a result of nepotism. 
 
However General Jacobs of Crime Intelligence has responded 
to the request but in view of the fact that the – it is not a 100% clear 
from the response as to who in fact are agents or whose safety may be 
compromised should their identity be revealed.  As a matter of caution 
we have taken a decision that we will nevertheless redact the names of 
10 
all the people who could possibly be an agent and we will only refer to 
them by reference to a number, which will be FN1, FN2, FN3 etcetera. 
 
DCJ we have provided you with those names in a sealed 
envelope which – so that for our purposes you will know the names but 
during the course of the testimony these people will only be referred to 
by number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course you will make further efforts to obtain 
clarity on the persons who were agents or informers or are still agents 
and informers among the people that he implicates or the group in 
respect of which you were requested, you previously requested clarity 
20 
because it was not clear exactly who falls under what, so it may well 
be, or what is contemplated is that once clarity is obtained then certain 
names would be or could be revealed if those people were not or are 
not agents or informers and in which case if during Colonel Naidoo’s 
evidence he has referred to them as FN1 or FN2 or FN3 it would be 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 150 of 194 
 
indicated what acronym or number was used for that person in due 
course but to try and not compromise the identity of people who might 
be involved in sensitive intelligence work we will use the numbers.  Will 
they all start with FN? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  FN and then a number? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay alright, no that’s fine then. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, are we now connected, Colonel Naidoo can you 
10 
hear me? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Yes I can. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can.  Good afternoon to you. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Good afternoon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much for availing yourself to give 
evidence in proceedings of this Commission.   We appreciate it very 
much that you have availed yourself.   Various measures have been 
taken in accordance with an order that I issued to try and ensure that 
your situation is protected as somebody who is in the witness 
protection program, but before we start I just want you to confirm that 
20 
you are the Colonel Naidoo who was referred to by Colonel Roelofse in 
his evidence before the Commission. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.   Do you confirm that you have taken 
an oath to speak the truth, the whole truth and nothing else but the 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 151 of 194 
 
truth when you are giving evidence in the Commission? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   I do confirm Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that you have indicated that you consider the 
oath binding on your conscience? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Yes I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you very much.   Ms Wentzel will then ask 
you questions to lead your evidence.  Ms Wentzel? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   (duly sworn, states) 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Thank you Chair.  Colonel Naidoo what are 
your full names? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Dhanajaya Gangulu 
Naidoo. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And is it correct that you were approached by 
investigators from the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture and 
requested to give evidence in these hearings? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And that the request resulted from certain 
disclosures that you made to Colonel Roelofse from the Hawks during 
criminal investigations undertaken by him into certain fraudulent 
activities involving the Secret Services account at Crime Intelligence? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Do you understand that in testifying at this 
Commission you may potentially incriminate yourself? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   I do. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And this evidence is given freely and 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 152 of 194 
 
voluntarily? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Colonel Naidoo have you been offered a 
Section 204 indemnity to testify in any of the criminal cases to be 
prosecuted by Colonel Roelofse and the State Prosecuting Authority in 
any of the criminal matters that you have described in your affidavit? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Yes I am in fact a 
Section 204 witness with regards to the criminal cases that are still 
pending. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And can you tell the Chair whether this offer 
10 
was made to you before you informed Colonel Roelofse of the nature of 
the fraud and corruption perpetrated by members at Crime Intelligence 
or after this? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   After the information 
that I have given to Colonel Roelofse. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Could you just briefly at this stage detail the 
circumstances, if you could just detail those events, how that 
happened? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Chair if I may with your 
permission and before we start. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   There is an incident that 
I would like to bring or place on record before the Commission, it 
actually happened on Wednesday this week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 153 of 194 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   I got word that one of 
my close relatives their home was broken into, this might just be a 
random act of criminality. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Or a direct result as to 
maybe to send me a message to intimidate me or to deter me from 
testifying at this Commission Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   So I just wanted to place 
that on record. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  What happened to ...[intervenes]  
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   There was a break-in, 
there was a home invasion Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh there was a break-in? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that did you say it was at the house of a relative 
of yours? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   A close relative of mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A close  
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh but you say you – it could be just normal 
criminality or it could be connected with attempts to intimidate you? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Chair it is due to the 
close proximity of my testifying at this Commission, I cannot rule out 
that it is maybe a concerted effort to intimidate or deter me from 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 154 of 194 
 
testifying at this hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Okay thank you very much.   Has the 
matter been reported to the relevant authorities already or not? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Chair at this stage I – 
the information that I have is very limited. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   But with your permission 
Chair if I may suggest that the investigations into this matter be 
escalated to the Hawks so they can see if there is in fact a link to the 
robbery itself and to me testifying at this hearing. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, Ms Wentzel just make sure that you get in 
touch with the Hawks or somebody in the legal team, get in touch with 
the Hawks so that they can look into the matter urgently. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes Chair I will do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that will be done Colonel Naidoo. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Thank you Chair, I 
appreciate it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  Let me take this opportunity to 
check that everybody in the room can hear everybody?   Okay, thank 
you, alright, let’s continue. 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Colonel Naidoo I am assuming that you have 
a bundle in front of you that is marked Exhibit KK1.1 and KK1.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is a lever arch file hey? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have you got a lever arch file Colonel Naidoo that is 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 155 of 194 
 
marked on the spine Exhibit KK1.2 and Exhibit KK1.1? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And Colonel Naidoo if you have a look at the 
numbers on the top right hand side you will see your initials DGN and 
then it says in red 001.  Those are the page numbers, so when I refer 
you to a page it will be 1, 2, I am not going to say DGM-001, I will just 
say one, two, three or whatever, do you understand that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And the document that the bundle that is in 
10 
front of you is this the affidavit that you have given to the Commission 
which appears from pages 1 to 70? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   That is correct. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   And is it correct that you have also deposed 
to an affidavit which is Exhibit KK1.2 and that is a supplementary 
affidavit to support your application in camera and that appears at 
pages 141 to 153, is that correct? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   That is correct yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Chair if I might place exhibits into evidence, 
marked KK1.1 and KK1.2. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The lever arch file containing – you see I think where 
you have a supplementary affidavit there was no need to give it a 
separate exhibit number because that causes confusion. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   It causes confusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because all the lever arch files you just have one, so 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 156 of 194 
 
once you say inside the same lever arch file there is exhibit – there are 
Exhibit KK1.1 and Exhibit KK1.2 it causes confusion especially because 
they can all go into one file, but we now have to be careful if you are 
not going to – is the numbering in terms of the red numbers, sequential 
from page 1 up to the end or does it change somewhere and start from 
one again? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   No it is sequential. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because if that is so we can actually delete any 
reference to Exhibit KK1.2 and simply say the lever arch file and its 
contents are Exhibit KK1.1 and it starts from page 1 up to whatever and 
10 
as long as you bear in mind where the supplementary affidavit is that 
should be enough, is that fine? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes, that is perfectly fine, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, alright.  So the lever arch file containing 
the statement of Dhanajaya Gangulu Naidoo will be marked as Exhibit 
KK1.1.  So what will remain is that we just change this so that is no 
reference to KK1.2. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, so Colonel Naidoo if we talk about 
Exhibit KK1.1 it will be the lever arch file in front of you and its 
20 
contents. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   I follow Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Chair if I might just mention one thing to you 
before we start leading the evidence, is at page 70 you will notice that 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 157 of 194 
 
the place and identity of the Commissioner has been redacted, Chair 
you will have a complete version but this was done in order to conceal 
the place where the affidavit was attested to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there is an affidavit which has got everything. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because the one I have in front of me doesn’t have 
that as well. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   I understood it and I apologise Chair, I will 
make sure that you will have the one that has everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Yes continue 
10 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:   Colonel Naidoo could you explain the 
sequence of events from when you first consulted Colonel Roelofse and 
when you first requested Section 204 immunity from prosecution? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Chair if I may with your 
permission there is in this timeframe of the 18 t h or rather September 
when I was initially interviewed by Colonel Roelofse that was just a 
once-off interview and then I go to the 18 t h of October 2011 to the 21 s t 
of October 2011, within those days there are pockets of incidents that 
happened during this timeframe, if I can just ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja if you can start with them. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   The timeline for the 
record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no that is fine, you can start with them. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Chair this is just an 
overview. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 158 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   I was employed in the 
SAPS as a member stationed at CI, Head Office, as a clerk.  During my 
service myself and various other members were involved in the looting 
of the funds from the Secret Service account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   This we did on 
instruction of mainly General Lazarus, together with General Mdluli, 
Colonel Hein Barnard.  Chair in September I was approached via 
General, Commissioner Henkel, General Henkel sorry. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I’m sorry Colonel Naidoo just remind me again 
you did give the timeframe from when to when what period are we 
talking about in 2011 when these incidents happened?   I just want to 
be reminded of that. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Well it starts on the 18 t h 
of October 2011, up to the 21 s t of October 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Chair before I go there I 
just want to go to September 2011, this is when I was first approached 
by the Hawks, more especially Colonel Roelofse, via General Henkel, 
20 
he wanted and interviewed me to explain certain aspects of Crime 
Intelligence.  I cannot remember the exact date Chair, it was probably 
around the latter part of September 2011.  This interview was 
conducted at Crime Intelligence Head office, myself, Colonel Roelofse 
and General Henkel was present.  It was not a very long interview 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 159 of 194 
 
Chair, it was just more administrative to explain agent files etcetera, 
probably an hour or so and our meeting was done. 
 
Subsequent to that Chair in the 18 t h ...[indistinct]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Or do you want to, is there anything you want to tell 
me about the content of the discussions on that hour long interview 
more or less? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Chair that was more or 
less to explain the agent files.   At that stage I was  handling seven 
agents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   It was basically 
administrative – I had to explain how I got to handling these agents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, how you operate? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Not really how the 
operations of it Chair, it was just more administrative because at that 
stage I had to explain their salaries, their medical aid payments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   So that was done in that 
hour long interview. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay, yes? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   And subsequently I was 
asked again to meet with Colonel Roelofse, again via General Henkel, 
this was on the 18 t h and 19 t h of October 2011.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Chair on the 18 t h of 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 160 of 194 
 
October I met with Colonel Roelofse and Lt Colonel Piet Viljoen of the 
Hawks at their offices in Pretoria at Silverton.  It was regarding Crime 
Intelligence and the alleged looting of the account Chair.   
 
On the first date Chair I was quite reluctant or hesitant to – 
not as to not to cooperate with the investigation but I had quite a lot of 
information that I needed to speak about, and I did not know if I could 
trust them at that stage Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that stage had they officially asked you if you 
could tell them certain information or not yet, they were just having 
discussions with you without necessarily asking you to give them 
10 
sensitive information? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Chair if I can remember 
correctly on the 18 t h there were certain questions put to me by Colonel 
Roelofse and Lt Col Piet Viljoen which I answered honestly, I did not lie 
to them about anything, like I said I so much information that I did not 
know if I could trust them, that was the first day of the 18 t h.   
 
However on the 20 t h, sorry the next day which is the 19 t h 
Chair, out of my own accord I decided to take them into my confidence 
and explain all of the allegations, or made numerous allegations to 
them regarding the looting of the secret service account. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The secret service account, the looting of the secret 
service account. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   At large Crime 
Intelligence Chair but it was more the Secret Service Account because 
this is situated within Crime Intelligence. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 161 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so this would have been on the 19 t h of October 
2011. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  So that was Colonel Roelofse and Henkel, 
did you say Colonel Henkel? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   It was no Chair it was 
Colonel Roelofse and Colonel Piet Viljoen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Piet Viljoen? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, continue. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   This  had disclosed on 
the 19 t h of October to the various allegations of the looting of the 
account, including myself, by members of Crime Intelligence, including 
myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   On the same day 19 t h 
October 2011, sorry Chair I am just trying to get my dates in order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your dates, okay, yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Going back to the 18 t h, 
after my interview with – on the first day, I went back to my office and 
20 
General Lazarus wanted to know what the Hawks were questioning me 
about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The 18 t h of October, that interview on the 18 t h of 
October is that the one that you said was about an hour long? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   No, that was in 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 162 of 194 
 
September Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that was in September. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   September of the same 
year, 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the 18 t h October one was the second interview 
with them. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With Colonel Roelofse. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And whoever he was with. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, yes.   So you say after the interview of 
the 18 t h of October 2011 General Lazarus spoke to you. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, continue. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   During the 18 t h, I will 
call it the first day, although it is not the first day but because 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   ...of the timeframe. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   If I can remember 
correctly there was a question put to me by the investigating team if 
any members of Crime Intelligence had their premises rented by Crime 
Intelligence and I answered honestly I explained to Colonel Roelofse 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 163 of 194 
 
that General Mdluli and General Lalla their premises were being rented 
by CI when – I am going back to the afternoon when I went back to my 
office and I explained to General Lazarus that I did concede or confirm 
that I have – confirmed with the Hawks that this was indeed the case, 
in terms of the rental of the premises for the two Generals, he was 
quite furious with me and asked me ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry may I just interrupt you. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to get certain things straight.  The first interview 
with the Hawks – your first interview with the Hawks was sometime in 
10 
September 2011. That is the interview which you say related to 
administrative issues, is that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair 
regarding agents that I was handling at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. And then the second interview is the one that 
happened on the 18 October 2011, is that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair.  
That was almost a day long – almost entire day Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now is that the one where you say you had 
decided to tell them many of the things that you knew which were – 
20 
which related to corruption and looting of the Secret Service Account? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or is that on the 19 t h? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  On the 18 t h – this was on 
the 18 t h October. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 164 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Where certain questions 
were put to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Regarding certain 
aspects of criminality within CI which I indeed answered honestly and 
correctly or I would say honestly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay but – but with regard to the 18 t h – so with 
regard to the 18 t h you were simply answering questions that … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That were put to me 
10 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That they were putting to you. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is the – that is the day where in respect of 
which you say you were not sure whether you could trust them or not at 
that stage? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you knew you had knowledge of a lot of things that 
were happening but you were not sure whether you could trust them.  
But insofar as the questions that they put to you you say you answered 
20 
those questions honestly? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say that interview took the whole day? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the 18 t h? 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 165 of 194 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then after the Hawks were gone General Lazarus 
called you and asked you about their visit to you? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No Chair.  When my 
interview concluded for the day I am referring to the 18 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  There was quite a few 
missed calls on my phone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And I am not sure who it 
10 
was but there was a few but General Lazarus was looking for me.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Or rather wanted to 
speak to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  To see how the interview 
went with the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he knew that you were going to be having an 
interview with the Hawks? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair.  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I conceded that I 
admitted that the two generals whom I refer to as General Mdluli and 
General Lala that their premises were being rented by CI and like I 
explained he was – was not happy.  He was quite – he was quite upset. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 166 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is General Lazarus? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  General Lazarus.  Yes 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to just you know remind us what position 
General Lazarus held at Crime Intelligence at the time? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair General Lazarus 
was the Head of the Secret Service Account at Crime Intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And who was the head of the Crime Intelligence 
at the time? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  At that stage I am not 
10 
sure – I am not sure because General Mdluli was suspended by then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if he was suspended it means he was – he was 
Head of the Crime Intelligence. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But there would have been somebody acting in his – 
in the position? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That would be – that 
would be correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he – so General Mdluli was the Head of Crime 
Intelligence but he was on suspension? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember who was acting in his position? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I am not sure Chair I am 
not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And General Lazarus would he have been like 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 167 of 194 
 
number 2 in Crime Intelligence or not? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I would not… 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of the hierarchy in Crime Intelligence? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I would not say number 
2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But he would be quite – 
he was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Quite close to – his position was it like one grade 
below that of General Mdluli or is that something you do not know? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  You could say that Chair 
he was a rank below General Mdluli he was the CFO of the Secret 
Service Account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So yes you correct in 
saying that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  Okay if you may then continue with 
your – to tell us about the discussion that you were having with General 
Lazarus.  You said he was upset when… 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  He was very upset with 
20 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That I conceded in giving 
that information to the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 168 of 194 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I explained to him Chair 
that it was a direct question that was put to me and I could not lie to 
them.  It was an official investigation and I could not lie to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Nevertheless that was – 
that conversation ended there.  I cannot really remember exactly what 
transpired thereafter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How did he show his – I think you said earlier he was 
furious and then later you said he was upset.  How did he show it? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it was not – it was 
10 
not any physical attributes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But in how he said what 
he said to me that made me believe that he was upset with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  In the manner in which 
he said it to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the manner in which he spoke to you after you 
told him what you had told the Hawks? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay continue. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I am going back or 
rather not back I am going to the 19 t h which is the next day – 19 t h 
October 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 169 of 194 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair on this day I made 
a decision that on my own accord I am going to reveal to the Hawks all 
of the allegations of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  All of the things you knew relating to corruption and 
crime and the looting of the Secret Service Account? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair the 
abuse of the account by various members as most of which were senior 
members of Crime Intelligence including myself Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Did you have an arrangement to meet 
with Colonel Roelofse on the 19 t h or there was no arrangement as such 
10 
you – but once you made this decision you were going to contact him? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair there was an 
arrangement that I would meet them over those two days which was the 
18 t h.  Like I said I concluded on the 18 t h and there was regiment that I 
meet the next day as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Yes and what happened on the 10 t h then? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair on the 19 t h – on 
the 19 t h October again I had to give General Lazarus feedback on how 
my interview went with the Hawks.  Like I said Chair at this stage I had 
explained or confided in them.  Going back to General Lazarus I gave 
20 
him a very watered… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I gave him a watered 
down version of what really transpired. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am sorry I am interrupting you again Colonel 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 170 of 194 
 
Naidoo.  Let us deal first with your interview with the Hawks on the 19 t h 
October before we go to your meeting or discussion with General 
Lazarus after the interview. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What happened at the interview – at your interview 
with the Hawks on the 19 t h October?  Did you tell them everything that 
you knew? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair.  At 
that stage what I could – because there were so many incidents of 
corruption Chair.  On the 19 t h what I could remember I conceded and 
10 
given them that information. But all of that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Information that I have 
given to them on the 19 t h Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And a little bit of the 18 t h 
is contained in an affidavit that I deposed to Colonel – Lieutenant 
Colonel Piet Viljoen on the 24 t h October 2011. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay no that is fine. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Most of that information 
20 
that came out of the interview over these two days was contained in 
that initial investigation.  If I can call it the “blanket investigation” sorry 
Chair pardon me.  If I can call it the “Blanket Affidavit” that I deposed 
to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think Ms Wentzel then can take it from there. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 171 of 194 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Thank you. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Thank you.  By the stage that you depose to 
this “Blanket Affidavit” on the 25 t h October 2011 had you been placed 
into the witness protection program? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Pardon me.  Can I get 
the date again? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You said you deposed to an affidavit on the 
25 t h October 2011 which you call your “Blanket Affidavit” which 
confirmed what you had told Colonel Roelofse on the 18 t h and the 19 t h 
October, is that correct? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes that is correct I was 
already in the witness protection program by then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry Ms Wentzel.  Let us finish first what he touched 
on earlier on and I stopped him.  He said after his interview with the 
Hawks on the 19 t h he had a discussion with General Lazarus. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I stopped him before he could tell us exactly what 
transpired. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In that discussion.  Let us hear about that part? 
20 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.  Colonel Naidoo did you hear the Chair?  
Could you explain what happened on the 19 t h October 2011 after your 
interview with the Hawks? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes yes.  As per the 
previous day I had to again give General Lazarus feedback as to how 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 172 of 194 
 
the interview went with the Hawks.  Like I explained I gave him at this 
stage on the 19 t h I had given them all the information that I knew at 
that stage.  I gave General Lazarus a watered down version of what 
really transpired just to get him off my back.   
CHAIRPERSON:  The – was there an arrangement between the two of 
you namely yourself and General Lazarus that after the interview – your 
interview with the Hawks on the 19 t h you should come back to him and 
tell him what you discussed with them? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair not really but I fell 
within the Secret Service Account so he was indirectly my boss.  I 
10 
actually reported to Colonel Barnard who reported to General Lazarus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so you – you went – you went to tell him on your 
own not because he had asked you to come and tell him? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I cannot remember the 
details Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But I do remember 
having this conversation with him on the 19 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And you say you gave him what you call a 
watered version – a watered down version of what you had disclosed to 
20 
the Hawks, is that right? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair.  Like I 
mentioned on the 19 t h I decided on my own accord to give the Hawks all 
the information that I knew at that stage which was quite substantial 
many incidents that I referred to. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 173 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So I did not give him all 
the details – I am referring to General Lazarus my conversation with 
him that I had with him on the afternoon of the 19 t h I gave him a 
watered down version of what really transpired with my interview with 
the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was your motivation for giving him a watered 
down version of what you had disclosed to the Hawks? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair the previous day I 
had only told him about one incident regarding the safe premises and 
10 
he was quite upset with me.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And on the 19 t h I gave 
them a whole lot of information and I do not think he would have taken 
kindly to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And he was one of the people who were 
implicated in what you had disclosed to the Hawks? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  So how did that meeting end – that 
discussion between the two of you? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair it is some time 
ago. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It just accepted… 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It is almost seven years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Accepted what you said and that is – it ended there? 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 174 of 194 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I would say so Chair I 
cannot remember the details. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember.  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Ms Wentzel you can proceed. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Now you said that before you gave this 
“Blanket Statement/Affidavit” to the Hawks on the 25 t h October 2011. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Ja. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You were placed in the witness protection 
program and I think perhaps we should deal with that now at this stage.  
10 
If you could have regard to page 63 of your statement that you have 
given to the commission could you please tell the Chair being careful 
not to refer to names and have regard to the list of names that have 
been provided to you with this abbreviation which will be FM1, 2 or 
etcetera could you please tell the Chair the circumstances under which 
you ended up being placed in the witness protection program? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Sure.  Chair if I can just 
go back to the overview and I will get to 63 in a moment? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Like I said on the 19 t h I 
20 
had this discussion with General Lazarus.  I dropped him off at his 
residence and I went to my home.  The next day I picked him up as I 
would normally do because he travelled with me to work – to his office.  
I dropped him off at his office and I explained to him that I was quite 
tired mentally having been interviewed by the Hawks for the previous 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 175 of 194 
 
two days and I informed him that I would want – like to go home to rest.  
He agreed Chair.  After I dropped him off at his office I decided – I am 
talking about the 20 t h Chair the Thursday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I decided to confide in 
one of my colleagues namely Colonel Barnard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And I confided in him 
Chair and I told him about the interview that I had with the Hawks.  And 
also informed him that I also informed the Hawks that I had also 
10 
conceded that I put in claims to the value of R100 000.00 – false 
claims.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that please?  You told him that you had 
told the Hawks that you had put in false claims to the value of 
R100 000.00. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Continue. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair during this – during 
this confession that I made to Colonel Barnard another member of 
Crime Intelligence that was present there I am not sure if I can mention 
20 
his name? 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  No it would be better if you can just refer to 
the list. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Oh pardon me sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just have a look at the list that you have.  If it is 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 176 of 194 
 
somebody who is supposed to be referred to by way FM and a number 
just mention the number.  The FM and the number.  But I take it Ms 
Wentzel that anybody that is not mentioned here that is not in the list 
and that he does not know to be an agent or informer he could mention 
but those are people in the statement. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes Colonel Naidoo do you understand that? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  There was another 
10 
Colonel who … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if the person that you were wondering whether you 
can mention you would have to look if you find then you mention FM 
and the number.  But if it looks like it takes you some time we can see 
what to do but it is not a list that is terribly long.  It is one page I think.  
It is one page.  Okay do you want to check there or is the name not 
there? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I do have the number 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I would refer to this 
Colonel as FM40. 
CHAIRPERSON:  FM40? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  40? 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 177 of 194 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  He was also present 
when I confided in Colonel Barnard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  With my admissions to 
the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair at that stage I was 
– I was – I – or rather I had the impression that they were genuinely 
10 
concerned about my wellbeing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is now the two of them? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Initially they were quite 
shocked though with my admissions regarding the R100 000.00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now do you think what was shocking them was that 
you had disclosed that to the Hawks or what was shocking them was 
that you had put in claims for that kind of amount? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was more the amount 
20 
that I put in Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it was more the amount. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And the – or rather I 
would the admissions Chair not so much the amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the admissions okay. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 178 of 194 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The admissions that I 
had made to the Hawks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Regarding the amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And I genuinely believed 
Chair that they were concerned about my wellbeing and they said that I 
must take care of myself I must go home and have a rest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is still on the 19 t h October 2011? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this is on the 20 t h 
10 
October. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh on the 20 t h October yes okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair which I did.  I was 
quite tired.  I was exhausted mentally because remember I was 
interviewed quite extensively the previous two days so I went home. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And I think I had a sleep 
for a few hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the interview of the 20 t h also was like a daylong 
interview?  Took more or less the whole day? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Pardon me Chair I did 
not hear that part? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The interview of the 20 t h October – oh I am sorry – ja 
the interview of the 19 t h October did it last the whole day? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair it did. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 179 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  More or less? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  More or less because it 
was quite extensive in terms of what I disclosed to Colonel Roelofse 
and Colonel Viljoen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  So the two of them were 
concerned and asked – and suggested that you go and rest? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this is on the 20 t h now? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then what happened? 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I am still referring 
to the 20 t h.  The evening of the 20 t h probably between 6 or 9 I cannot 
be sure or more or less during that time my wife and I decided to go for 
a walk because like I said I was quite stressed out and also mentally 
tired from the previous two days.  My eldest son was at home.  He was 
asleep Chair.  It was my wife and I and my youngest son he was on his 
bicycle we went – decided to go for a walk around the block around my 
house.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And this was around what time of the day? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This was in the evening 
20 
Chair of the 20 t h probably between six and seven. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes continue. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  We went around the 
block Chair.  There is a park opposite my house.  We walked around 
the park and as I was getting closer to my house I saw two of my 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 180 of 194 
 
colleagues Colonel FM08. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Colonel FM08 yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Sorry Chair I – it is just… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are looking for the other one. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I am just looking for 
the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Number – ja no that is fine just have a look.  It was 
FM08 Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And FM09. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh FM08 and FM09? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I cannot remember 
exactly which one of them but one of them – I refer to both of them in 
this incident but one of them and like I said I do not know which one I 
cannot remember exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I saw them jumping over 
the gate of my house the driveway gate. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you saw them for the first time were they in a 
car or were they walking? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair there was a car 
that was parked in front of my driveway gate which I recognised as one 
of the vehicles that I previously drove at CI as a covert vehicle. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 181 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was subsequently 
handed to one of my colleagues FM08 at that stage was driving that 
particular vehicle.  So I recognised it to be the vehicle that he was 
driving. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So when you saw the car and you saw one of 
them I think you said climbing over the fence.  Was it when you, your 
wife and your son were coming back home from the walk? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair.  
Around the block, around the park and we were on our way back 
10 
nearing the house. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And I noticed one of 
them jumping over the fence or rather the driveway gate Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the car was outside the gate? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  In front of the gate Chair 
that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In front of the gate. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct.  On the 
outside of the gate. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And you say one of them was jumping over the 
fence? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair 
from within the property jumping over the gate back outside. So 
obviously they were… 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 182 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh he was coming from inside the premises? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes continue. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair  
CHAIRPERSON:  Who had you left at home?  Was there – were there 
children that you had left at home or anybody? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  It was my eldest son he 
was asleep Chair at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And my youngest son 
10 
accompanied us on his bicycle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  My wife walked and he 
came on his bicycle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair like I said as I was 
nearing the premises I noticed this – one of my colleagues jump over 
the fence and they got into the vehicle Chair that was parked in front of 
the driveway gate and they started the car – sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And they started to drive 
in my direction which was not very far off from my house. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  As the car approached or 
came nearby I noticed General Lazarus sitting in the front seat. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 183 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The car stopped and he 
told me I am a very hard man to get hold of.   
CHAIRPERSON:  That is – who was saying that to you now? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  General Lazarus. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   And I explained to him I 
just went for a walk around the block.  So he asked me to jump into the 
car. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  He offered my wife a lift 
home and I explained to him that it was just around the corner so I 
gave her the house key and she continued together with my son they 
went back home.  I jumped into the car Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you not ask why at that stage? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  No.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:   He basically instructed 
me to jump into the car. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And – yes.  This was after hours hey? 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This was between 6 and 
7 in the evening Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So your – your wife and your son proceeded to 
walk home. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 184 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you jumped into this car? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Continue., 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Like I said General 
Lazarus was in the front passenger seat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who was driving do you remember whether it was 
FM08 or FM09? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  FM08 was driving the car 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  FM09 was sitting in the 
backseat on the left side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And I jumped into the 
right side of that – behind the driver’s seat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And when I jumped in 
FM08 who was driving the vehicle started to drive around the block.  If 
I can remember correctly General Lazarus enquired from me if I was 
okay and I said no I was indeed okay.  He subsequently asked me if 
20 
there is anything I want to tell him.  I said no.  I think if I can remember 
correctly he asked me the question again.  And I said no.  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair if – just bear with 
me Chair I… 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172

CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Sorry it is a few years 
now I am just trying to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  To remember. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  [Indistinct] my thoughts 
together. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Colonel Naidoo. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  Just so that you can refresh your memory you 
10 
are dealing with events that are dealt with on page 63 and 64 onwards 
of your statement.  If you just want to have a look there that will also 
help you with the – the FM names of the agents so you do not have to 
always look them up. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes okay that is fine.  
Chair I am also trying to just remember the events but I will – I will 
refer to the different pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Just to refresh my 
memory as well. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  In the meantime Ms Wentzel I just see that 
some of the copies here are very bad. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I apologise Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So please make arrangements I always say to the 
legal team in advance of bundles coming to me once you have 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172

too of poor quality arrangements should be made if at all possible so 
that we have copies that are legible. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I apologise Chair.

better pages. 
ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  I apologise Chair.  I unfortunately was in

ADV SUSAN WENTZEL:  You can continue Colonel Naidoo. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Yes Chair.  Like I said 
General Lazarus there asked me you do not want to tell me anything. 
That was his exact words to me.  If I can remember or according to my 
statement and I said that I did not.  General Lazarus then said he heard 
that I had made some admissions to the Hawks. 
Chair I said that he - he got it wrong and then he asked me 
then why is Colonel Barnard saying that you are - you - you admitted to 
20 
putting in false claims to the value of R100 000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair at that stage I 
admitted to - to speaking to - to - I am talking about General Lazarus 
now.  I admitted to him that I or rather I - I said that I - I admitted to - 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 187 of 194 
 
to speaking to Colonel Barnard but the night that I - I told 
Colonel Barnard that I put in false claims or admitted to him putting in 
false claims. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Thereafter 
Chair 
General Lazarus then told me that he had spoken to a certain pastor - 
Pastor Jonathan.  Chair this pastor was an associate of Mr Marimuthu 
which I will deal with further or later in my statement or (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Marimuthu? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Mr Panganathan - to me - 
10 
Marimuthu. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And that this whole thing 
would be over soon and I must be strong.  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he - I am sorry.  So General Lazarus said he had 
spoken to a certain pastor. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Pastor Jonathan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Pastor Jonathan … 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he said everything will be over soon?

Page 188 of 194 
 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So what I understood 
from this - from what General Lazarus told me is when he said that I 
understood that I must be strong through this investigation.  That it will 
be over soon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So did it - did it appear like to you he accepted 
that you might not have told Colonel Barnard that you had put in a false 
- false claims amounting to R100 000,00? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair, I - I managed or I 
- I think I managed to stay calm and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I - I was convinced that I 
had convinced him that I did not speak or I did not make any such 
admissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  So while this whole 
conversation was taking place we had circled the block around the park 
near my house and we came to close my house again and FM08 drove 
into the driveway. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair before I could get 
20 
out of the car General Lazarus told him to reverse and to carry on 
driving … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 And 
from 
there 
we 
proceeded to General Lazarus’ house in Isandovale in Edenvale which 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 189 of 194 
 
is not very far from - from my own house. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair as we were all 
getting out of the car and I am referring to all.  It is myself, 
General Lazarus, FM …

braai area of the house. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the braai area in General Lazarus’ house? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair at this stage there 
20 
was just general conversation.  I cannot remember the details of it but I 
like I say it was general conversation.  Up to a stage that FM10 made a 
statement that his contact at the Hawks had informed him that I had 
made certain admissions to them and that I am now on the side of the 
Hawks. 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 190 of 194 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I again had to go 
into defence mode.  I again denied what was being said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair and at this stage I 
started to feel uncomfortable … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  As more questions were 
being directed to me regarding my involvement in the admission of 
putting in false claims to the Hawks. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Nevertheless Chair I still 
managed to stay calm … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But although - although 
still remaining calm I was uncomfortable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair - pardon me Chair.  
Like I said there was general conversation up to a point where 
Westville Air Travels - Air Travel Tickets were discussed … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And Colonel FM08 said 
that General Hankel had requested certain documentation from him 
regarding air tickets.  Colonel FM10 then told Colonel FM08 that he 
must speak to his contact.  Contact referring to the contact at Westville

not sure what is his surname Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  And that they must 
destroy the evidence of the air tickets. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now - okay.  Who was giving the instruction that the 
evidence of air tickets should be destroyed? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair, F - FM08 said that 
General Hankel was making certain inquiries regarding air tickets … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.

COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
From 
this 
particular 
service provider namely Westville Air Travel.

COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  FM10 told FM08 that he 
must speak to his contact at the travel agent and that they must destroy 
all of the - the invoices or related matters … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Regarding the travel.  
More especially to - to Crime Intelligence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Huh-uh. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair, I forgot to mention 
or I did mention FM09 was also part of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You did mention FM09. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
when 
this 
suggestion was made by FM - FM10 to FM08 all - all who were present 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 192 of 194 
 
at the braai area was agreement - was in agreement with the 
suggestion.  No one disagreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
Chair 
what 
I 
can 
remember next FM08 said that he will speak to his contact whom I 
referred to previously as Mahesh.  He worked off a laptop. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to spell Mahesh? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I think it is 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it …? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  I think it would be M-A-
10 
H-E-S-H Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Like I say I am - I am not 
too sure what his surname was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  FM08 said that he would 
speak to Mahesh as he worked off a laptop and he would speak to him 
to ensure that the laptop was either destroyed or damaged so the 
evidence would be lost. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I was later given to 
understand this was apparently not done in time as - I am not sure.  
Pardon me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair this was apparently 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 193 of 194 
 
not done in time because I was later informed that the investigators did 
manage to - to obtain certain records from - from Mahesh prior to - to 
him destroying … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The records? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  The records. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay; and how did this gathering at the braai area of 
General Lazarus’ house end? 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair if I may just go to 
the next incident that is still happened at the braai area. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.

COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO: 
 
After 
this 
- 
this 
conversation took place regarding the - the destruction of the evidence 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Relating to the air tickets 
FM09 asked General Lazarus if he should spin a story. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  General Lazarus did not 
say anything but he nodded his head. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
20 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  This made me believe 
that he had agreed with what FM09 had suggested. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  Chair I cannot remember 
the details thereafter.  I am taking about the braai area.  If there was 
27 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 172 
 
Page 194 of 194 
 
any more talk or it was just general conversation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  But what I can say is 
after - after we had finished at General Lazarus’ house … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
COLONEL DHANAJAYA GANGULU NAIDOO:  FM09 suggested that he, 
FM08 and I go for a drink. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  I think I would like us to stop there for the 
day and then when we resume on Monday you can then take us from
