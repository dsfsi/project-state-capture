PROCEEDINGS HELD ON 27 MAY 2019  
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Good morning DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair.  Chair the witness to 
be called today is a Mr Van Der Westhuizen.  He is a former employee 
– Transnet.  He resigned in December 2014.  At that time he was 
responsible for amongst other things procurement in relation to 
information, communications, technology in other words the computer 
network and communications systems in the whole of Transnet.  He was 
10 
the business owner of that particular function.  His evidence is not 
original in the sense that he will tell you a complete and new story.  
You will have heard evidence about the matters to which he is to testify 
from a number of witnesses and will be detailed.  So his evidence is 
really supplementary.  It is explanatory and to an extent  corroborated.  
But it fills in gaps that are necessary to fill in to begin to raise 
questions and answer questions of a broader nature.  So he will build 
on previous evidence and he will compliment evidence that has been 
given previously to enable the Chair to consider a totality of evidence 
which will hopefully paint a more comprehensive picture than just 
20 
simply the acts, the regular acts which have been testified to to date.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So to the extent that there might be what might 
appear to be repetition of evidence already given I should not be 
concerned it would be to compliment or corroborate?  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 3 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the purpose for this for 
example you heard in previous tr anches of testimony from Ms Chetty 
and Mr Mahomedy and others.  You heard of decisions taken by the 
former Group Chief Executive Transnet where he overruled certain 
procurement decisions and that that was irregular or prima facie 
irregular.  Now it is one thing to say that Chair but what arises from 
that is why was that decision made?  Who else was involved in the 
making of that decision?  Was it an individual decision or was it part of 
a decision involving a group of people?  What were the reasons for 
10 
those decisions?  Who benefited importantly from those decisions?  
And so that will begin to answer the question that we posed right in the 
beginning last year Chair was this just a series of random or ad -hoc 
acts of irregularity or was there something bigger at play?  Or was 
there an organised project?  And although these questions will not be 
answered by Mr Van Der Westhuizen in their totality they will give 
important evidence that will enable us later together with other 
evidence to begin to examine those questions.  So it will enable us 
really to piece together this evidence with other evidence to tell a story 
that will explain the causes and the effects of the irregular acts.  So for 
20 
example you heard Chair that there was a parallel system from Doctor 
Molefe and Mr Mahomedy operating in Transnet that made it possible 
for certain individuals to extract monies, large sums of monies from the 
Transnet coffers.  And how this worked is a question that the legal team 
and the investigators will have to piece togethe r evidence in relation to 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 4 of 176 
 
this question.  Especially in relation to one of the elements of this 
witness’ evidence and that is the entity called Homix which was related 
to a Mr Salim Essa a well-known associate of the Gupta family.  And so 
what this witness will testify to is elements of the answer to the 
question as to how the project came to be organised?  How it was 
explained?  Who was involved and where the money went?  And in 
particular Mr Van Der Westhuizen has knowledge and experience from 
this employment with Transnet to test the apparent reasons given for 
many of the decisions made and to say these were baseless and 
obviously then the conclusion maybe that you will make that there was 
10 
some other motive other than a business rationale for the decision s 
that were made.  Chair may the witness then be sworn?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  My 
full names Gerhardus Johannes Jacobus Van Der Westhuizen.

ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Oh I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes of course.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I take it… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   I was attending to other 
matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I take it it means that you address the Chair you 
are a hundred percent attentive to the Chair.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you for getting me off the 
hook there Chair.  Mr Van Der  Westhuizen you have submitted a 
10 
statement? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It appears at pages 1 to 22 of 
Exhibit BB7[a], is that correct?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Would you look please at page 
22. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  I 
20 
am there Advocate. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Whose signature is that?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHU IZEN:  
That is mine. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And is the statement from pages 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 7 of 176 
 
1 to 25 your statement?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  1 to 
22 yes Advocate. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  1 to 22 rather your statement?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And are you satisfied that apart 
from what is referred to in your supplementary affidavit its contents are 
true and correct? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
10 
Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What are your qualifications Mr 
Van Der Westhuizen? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  I 
am a chartered accountant. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And how many years’ experience 
do you have as a chartered accou ntant? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  I 
have approximately 15 years based article experience.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I think the first question was more about your 
academic qualifications than about t he profession.  So maybe you want 
to deal with that – your academic qualifications?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair my academic qualifications is that I am a chartered accountant so 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 8 of 176 
 
I have got a BCom Accounting Degree, Honour s, CTA and Examination 
from SAICA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And how many – for how many 
years have you practised as a chartered accountant?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  As I 
completed my articles in 2004 if I recall Advocate. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And your experience?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  My 
experience spans finance needless to say being a chartered accountant 
10 
and then I also have some experience in technology, vendor 
management, process improvement mostly ja Chair.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And procurement? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair yes I do have procurement experience which I – for the most part 
gained at Transnet as – well through my experience as the head of 
Process Improvement and Group Head of Internal Control at some 
point.  And then obviously the last portion of my career at Transnet 
where I was responsible for the centres, ICT Procurement like the 
Advocate stated. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you have experience it 
appears from your statement and financial management and reporting?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  You also mention 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 9 of 176 
 
information technology audits.  What would that experience involve?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair so during my I – I had a short stint at KPMG which – during which 
period I was in the information risk management department which 
included audits of IT systems it was called ITGC’s or IT General Control 
Audits where you would audit systems and access and things like that.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  When did you join Transnet?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
2007 Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And when did you resign from 
10 
Transnet? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Advocate it is in the statement I think it was 31 September 2014 but I 
eventually left the organisation in December 2014.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And would you tell the Chair 
please during that period 2007 to 2014 when you were employed by 
Transnet what functions did you perform in the organisation and to 
whom did you report? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So 
Chair when I started off my employment at Transnet I was a manager in 
20 
the 
internal 
control 
department 
and 
I 
looked 
after 
process 
improvements as a result of internal control deficiencies identified by 
both internal audit as well as items identified internally.  S o that was 
for approximately two years 2007 to 2009.  After that I was promoted to 
the Group Head of Internal Control.   
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 10 of 176 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just before you go on would that 
function that you performed between 2007 and 2009 have involved the 
implementation and auditing or checking of processes within Transnet?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So 
Advocate it would have.  Not so much the audit, the internal audit 
function was out sourced to Ernst & Young at the time so they would 
have performed the audits but I would have had oversight and sight of 
all the reports and I would have had to come up and agree with a team 
of theirs what rectification actions we should take for various items.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So you concentrated on 
10 
compliance with internal processes?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  And 
improvements yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes okay.  The second period 
that you refer to is 2009 to 2012 mid-2012 what were your functions 
then? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair so during that period I was the Group Head of Internal Control so 
I provided oversight of that outsourced internal audit contract as well 
as the process improvement function and it had some foren sic elements 
20 
but we had another manager looking after the forensic function.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then after – who did you 
report to during that period?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So 
during that period Chair I reported to Anoj Singh. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 11 of 176 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and what was his position 
at that time? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair at the time he was General Manager Group Finance and Acting 
Group Chief Financial Officer and he was also made permanent during 
that period if I recall. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then the third period from 
mid-2012 to April 2013? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair so I was still in the – I still reported into finance or into the 
10 
internal control department to Mr Singh but we had an information 
security incident which we were quite concerned about and because I 
had both finance and technology back – or experience and skills Mr 
Singh asked me to sort or spearhead or address that iss ue and see if 
we can get it resolved. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And at that time did you 
have to work with and become involved with particular suppliers to 
Transnet? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair I had to absolutely.  At the time our data centre was outsourced 
20 
to T-Systems and our network was outsourced to Neotel so I was 
heavily engaged with those two vendors.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right – we will deal with that in 
more detail by way of introduction in a mom ent.   
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 12 of 176 
 
Sure. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then from April 2013 to 
December 2014 what was your function?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair so after that period I joined the ICT it is also referred to as the 
Enterprise Information Management Services Department and my role 
was Officer of the CIO which was predominantly to support the CIO and 
look at – or overseeing ICT procurement, vendor management, look at 
the finances of IT with some other elements vendor management I think 
mentioned.  It think those are the most important ones in that role.  
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And your evidence will concern 
issues related to ICT or Information Communication Technology 
Procurerment? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the management of the 
processes that were involved?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right what was your title at that 
20 
time? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair it was Office or Executive Manager Office of the CIO but like I 
said it was also referred to as Enterprise Information Services.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And to whom did you report in 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 13 of 176 
 
this capacity? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair initially we had an acting CIO; a gentleman by the name of Ken 
Jarvis so initially I reported to him.  We then appointed Doctor Mantsika 
Matooane who I reported to after – after that.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now before going into the 
substance of your statement it is necessary as we discussed this 
weekend to provide the Chair with some background otherwise the 
functions and the procurement in relation to Neot el and IT-Systems can 
become confusing.  Terms like centralisation for example can become 
10 
or concentration can become confusing unless one understands the 
background.  Before Ms Ramos became Chief Executive Officer who 
Chair she was Chief Executive Officer, is that right? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is right. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of Transnet and during the 
period she held office in the Transnet stable were a number of entities 
and as I understand the position and it is not controversial it was 
decided in Transnet to dispose of non-core assets so that it could 
concentrate on being a freight logistics business, am I correct?  
20 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now two entities that existed 
within the Transnet stable are relevant to your evidence. The first is 
Arivia.com, is that correct?  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 14 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That was disposed of? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  What was Arivia.com or 
what did – function did it perform within the Transnet stable?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair so Arivia.com was the owner of our data centre which included all 
of our servers and information and data assets.  So they were 
10 
responsible for the assets and the services linked to those assets.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So Arivia.com a separate entity 
within the stable was owned and operated all the can we term it for 
want of a better word hardware on which all the data of Transnet was 
kept? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Hardware and software I would say Advocate.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Hardware and software but that 
is all the computer based information, the electronic based information 
used or necess – which was necessary for the operation of Transnet 
20 
were centralised under the auspices of Arivia.com.  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBU S VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Both assets and operation?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 15 of 176 
 
Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then Transtel? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Transtel Chair was the network services provider.   So they were 
responsible and or owned all of our fibre assets, copper assets, routers 
and switches that enabled all of our applications and individuals to talk 
to each other to [indistinct]. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So you have the data in 
the data centre that is Arivia.com?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
10 
Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But now this data has to spread 
between the various operations and entities within  the Transnet stable? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The communication network in 
other words. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Cabling.  Would you give the 
20 
Chair an idea of the amount of cabling that Transnet ultimately had to 
deal with. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Sure.  Sure Advocate.  I think it is just important to distinguish there 
were fibre rings in the  – in the Metropoles as you can call it.  Then 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 16 of 176 
 
Regional lines so from Johannesburg to Durban, Cape Town that kind of 
thing and then you had significant fibre and copper assets within what 
we refer to as Transnet campuses those would be ports, rails and 
although we do not have a – an exact number and we also did not have 
perfect designs the number quoted was between 8 and 9000 kilometres 
of fibre in the Sandton campuses ag in the Transnet campuses sorry.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So electronic communica tions 
within Transnet involved substantial infrastructure?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Absolutely. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Substantial assets including the 
switches and routers necessary for this electronic communication to 
take place and buried as I understand from you buried under the tarmac 
and the ports and in other places was 9000 kilometres approximately of 
cabling? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now as I understand your 
evidence a decision was made and this again is not controversial to 
dispose of both businesses on the basis that they were not core to the 
20 
operations of Transnet, is that correct?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  What happened then 
pursuant to that decision?  Were they disposed of?  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 17 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair they were disposed of yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And was that through an 
organised process? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair yes although I was not intricately involved it was competitive 
processes from what I recall so we went to market and T-Systems was 
the successful bidder for the data centre or Arivia.com piece and the 
newly formed Neotel was the successful bidder for the network.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So Neotel which is a PTY 
10 
Limited company as I understand it.  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Purchased Transtel? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So Neotel then purchased both 
the business and assets of Transtel which was as you have just 
described the network – communication network, right?   
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
20 
That is right. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you say T-Systems 
purchased the business and assets of Arivia.com?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct Advocate. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 18 of 176 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So at a stage after this disposal 
of assets and disposal of entities you have Neotel operating the 
network previously operated by Transtel and it now owns the relevant 
assets, am I correct? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And T-Systems took over the 
business of Arivia.com that is the data – the central data base, the hard 
drive and software containing all Transnet information, am I co rrect?  I 
am simplifying but it helps. 
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Sure.  That is correct Advocate. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And it now operated and owned 
what Arivia previously had operated and owned?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOC OBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  And this – around what 
time did this transfer of business occur?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair if I recall they were roughly a year apart and if memory serves it 
20 
was 2008 and 2009 the two transactions.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just bear with me a moment 
Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So you say the two transactions occurred in 
2008/2009? 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 19 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That kind of time.  That is the purchase of Arivia.com 
by T-Systems and the purchase of Transtel by Neotel Pty Limited?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us move to paragraph 6 then 
of your statement if we may?  There you talk of the period 2007 
January to December 2014.  That is the period which is covered by your 
10 
evidence, am I correct?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTH UIZEN:  
That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And three contracts or – well at 
least three contracts we will discover are relevant for your evidence 
during this period.  What are those contracts?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHU IZEN:  
Chair the three relevant contracts are the 2007 Master Services 
Agreement between Transnet and Neotel.  The second transaction was 
the procurement of Cisco equipment and lastly the 2004 Master 
20 
Services Agreement between Transnet and Neotel and linke d to that the 
asset buy back agreement. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Now we need to 
understand then how Cisco becomes relevant.  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 20 of 176 
 
Sure. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we need to understand wh at 
Master Services Agreements you referring to.  Remember you have just 
told the Chair that these business were transferred from Arivia and…  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Transtel. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Transtel.  I think you mentioned 
2009 but in 6.1 we talking about a 2007 Master Network Services 
Agreement. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  Ja 
10 
then I am probably mistaken.  I know it expired on 2000 – 31 March 
2013 if I recall and so it is probably correct the n Chair I beg your 
pardon it is 2007 there or there about it appears yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So we may have to 
correct that? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Yes.  I will – I can double check the date. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The precise date for the 
agreement in 2007 or 2009.  In paragraph 6.1.  But what Master 
Services Agreement was that?  
20 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So 
Chair as part of the sale agreement of the network assets to Neotel 
there was a five year Master Services Agreement which enabled Neotel 
to provide services to Transnet, network services to…  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry just before you go on that 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 21 of 176 
 
Neotel purchasing Transtel?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WES THUIZEN:  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The network? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  Just go on please. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So 
the link to that sale agreement was a five year Master Services 
Agreement which allowed Neotel to provide services back to Transnet 
10 
at obviously a cost just to sweeten the deal then to make it worthwhile.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So the business of Transtel goes 
to Neotel. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Plus the assets? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But Neotel must now con tinue 
providing the services and using these assets for the benefit of 
20 
Transnet? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And those obligations or the 
obligations relevant to that particular transac tion are contained in the 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 22 of 176 
 
Master Service – Master Network Services Agreement referred to in 
paragraph 8.1, am I correct?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct Advocate. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then the Cisco equipment.  Now 
we are going to have to take a step back here because Cisco becomes 
important in your evidence.  At a stage it must have been contemplated 
prior to the Master Services Agreement being entered into that you 
refer to in paragraph 6.1 that the life of Tra nstel is going to come to an 
end and Neotel is going to step into its shoes, is that correct?  
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It was also contemplated that a 
business would go to T-Systems? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Advocate are you referring to the 2014 agreement or the 2007 
agreement? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now I am talking about the 2007 
agreement.  I just want to introduce Cisco.   
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES J OCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
20 
Chair I think that was more linked to the 2014 agreement.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well… 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  Or 
the expiration of the 2007 if that is – if I am understanding you 
correctly. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 23 of 176 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  So at a time the contract 
between Transnet and Neotel that had been entered into in 2007 or 
2009 would expire? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That was the Master Services 
Agreement you refer to in 6.1?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and at the time the Chair 
10 
has been told and will learn again that it was contemplated under the 
management really or series of decisions made by amongst others 
Mr Brian Molefe that that whole business would go to T-Systems? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and of course the assets 
underlying that business all the cables and the switches you have 
talked about and the routers they would have to then go to T-Systems 
in order for the business of Transnet to continue.  Am I correct?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
20 
That is correct Chair.  They need assets to provide the service.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you have already told the 
Chair that all those assets had been bought five years earlier by 
Neotel? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 24 of 176 
 
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  They belong to Neotel? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But there were problems.  What 
was the essential issue?  Was Neotel willing simply to hand these over 
to the new incumbent? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair no they – they were not. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  T-Systems. 
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  We 
did engage with Neotel and they formally advised me that these asse ts 
were securitised or they have – their lenders – they could not sell these 
assets because they have borrowed money and these assets were 
securitised. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In other words belonged to the 
bank? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Pledged to the bank? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Pledged or under what – ceded 
or whatever contract that was but they could not  be sold to Transnet or 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 25 of 176 
 
to T-Systems because the bank had them?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
(intervenes). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In simple terms? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  Yes 
Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright and there was a – an 
exclusivity clause in the arrangement – the 2007 or 2009 Master 
Service Agreement between Transnet and Neotel.  What was that?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
10 
Chair so what that exclusivity clau se basically forced Transnet to do is 
any network equipment that we would need to buy whether it be routers 
which is fibre we have to buy from Neotel.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Transnet would …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am – I am sorry Mr Pretorius.  I take it that it follows 
from that – that decision that even if there was somebody else who had 
what you were looking for if Neotel had it then you were bound or 
Transnet was bound to get it from Neotel?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But Neotel was not the supplier.  
The original equipment manufacturer of the relevant equipment now 
needed by Transnet and now needed to be used by T-Systems.  
Perhaps you should just explain to the Chair the vulnerability that was 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 26 of 176 
 
experienced by Transnet because remember under the 2007 MSA – 
Master Services Agreement – all its infrastructure from an electronic 
communications point of view was now owned by a service provider?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct Chair.  So due to the decision to award the business to 
T-Systems that you have heard about that would have entailed a 
network transition from Neotel to T-Systems.  I think like the advocate 
has articulated all those assets were owned by Neotel and they were 
not willing to sell them.  So it was almost impossible for any other 
service provider to provide the services unless they lease or buy those 
10 
assets from Neotel or if we replace the assets.  T he effort and cost to 
replace those assets would have been astronomical and was almost not 
an option.  So – and we also had a fairly short period of time to 
transition the network from Neotel to T-Systems.  So we were being 
proactive and we in discussions with Cisco and Neotel T-Systems 
realised that a lot of the equipment was approaching end of life and 
end of software support.  So we decided to buy that equipment through 
Neotel at that point due to the exclusivity clause and to start installing 
that equipment to pull the transition forward or to make it slightly 
possible to transition the network from Neotel to T-Systems. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now the supplier of this 
necessary equipment for the business of Transnet to continue from an 
electronic communications point of view who was that supplier?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  It 
was Cisco Chair. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 27 of 176 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So Cisco had to supply the 
equipment but it had to go via Neotel to Transnet?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Because as I understand your 
evidence Transnet decided no longer must a supplier or a service 
provider own our equipment.  We must own it?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That – that is … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That is what Transnet decided.  
10 
Is that not so? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That – that is correct advocate. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So Transnet had to buy it but via 
Neotel from Cisco? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And there were various pricing 
arrangements relevant to these transactions about which you are going 
to testify? 
20 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps you can explain one 
thing to the Chair.  It seems rather bizarre.  You talk about 9  000 
kilometres of cabling – network cabling – buried beneath the tarmacs in 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 28 of 176 
 
the ports for example.  This cabling is owned or was for a period owned 
by the service provider Neotel.  Did that make sense?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  In 
my opinion Chair it did not make sense.  I thought it exposed Transnet 
to significant risk. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Could Transnet just not 
say there is the cabling under my tarmacs and my ports we are just 
going to use it? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair well it is not that easy because Neotel can switch off our n etwork 
10 
effectively, block IP addresses and technical things like that to prohibit 
us from using that infrastructure.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So in other words you were 
extremely vulnerable? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  We 
were a captive client – extremely vulnerable. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You were a captive client?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct advocate. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And your bargaining position in 
20 
relation to any change of this arrangement was that strong, weak?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  It 
was particularly weak. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how long was the period during which this – this 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 29 of 176 
 
network was owned by Neotel? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair so they owned it for five years as part of that first Master 
Services Agreement …  
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes). 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  And 
we will get to it a bit later but we then – there was an agreement for us 
to buy back … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
10 
Relevant portions of those assets.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So that is the agreement you 
refer to in paragraph 6.2 – Procurement of Cisco Equipment – the Cisco 
transaction.  Correct? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we have described how that 
came about and given some background to enable  us to understand the 
evidence you give in relation to that later.  Is that correct?  
20 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us just do the same exercise 
briefly in relation to 6.3.  That is th e 2014 Master Network Services and 
Asset Buyback Agreement. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 30 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair so like I mentioned there was a five year agreement referred to 
as the 2007 Master Services Agreement between Transnet and Neotel.  
That was reaching expiration date and we had to go through a process 
to on-board a whether it is the new or a different or with the same 
supplier for another period of three to five years.  So it was really a 
new contract for the ICT Network Services.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright but now as the Chair has 
been told by previous witnesses and you will repeat it and give some 
detail as to what happened in these transactions and 2014 for a period 
10 
of time at least Neotel was to lose this contract.  Is it corre ct? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the contract was to go to 
T-Systems? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Now quite apart from 
what would happen to all the assets and infrastructure between Neotel 
and T-Systems we can park that for the moment but T-Systems at a 
20 
time fell out of the picture.  Correct?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Neotel came – comes back 
on-board.  This is in 2014 but as you say at this time Transnet is aware 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 31 of 176 
 
of its extreme vulnerability if it does not own the infrastructure and the 
assets which Neotel now is going to operate or cont inue to operate? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct advocate. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Correct.  So what does it decide 
to do? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  So I 
think advocate if I understand you correctly so the strategy for Transnet 
was to repurchase whether from Neotel or new all the assets in what we 
refer to the Transnet Campuses to alleviate that risk.  
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So now Neotel is going to come 
back on-board.  It is going to continue to provide the services but 
Transnet says look we are too vulnerable if you Neotel continue to own 
the assets.  We want to own the assets.  We want to buy back the 
assets which we sold to you in 2009 or around that time?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct.  So that we will not …  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Continually be a captive client. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that is the buyback that you 
going to refer to in your – in your evidence? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct advocate. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay and that buyback was 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 32 of 176 
 
related to a 2014 Master Network Services Agreement?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You were integrally involved in 
the negotiation of that agreement?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  Yes 
I was. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that much of your evidence 
is going to speak to the conclusion of and the negotiations preceding 
that agreement? 
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Alright so let us then – 
we can then go through your – by way of background there may be 
some repetition but Chair I think it was important to deal with that 
background.  Let us go to paragraph 7.  In fact I am told by my junior 
that the date December 2007 is indeed correct.  So what do you say to 
paragraph 7 of your state ment? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  So 
Chair what I am effectively saying in paragraph 7 is that the agreement 
20 
was 
concluded 
in 
December  2007 
but 
effective 
1 April 
to 
31 March 2013. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So from effective 1 April 2008 
until 31 March 2013 a five year agreement Neotel having taken over 
from Transtel as you have told the Chair is now bound by a five year 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 33 of 176 
 
agreement? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Signed in December 2007? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But it now owns all the assets 
and it is performing the functions?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Good and that you say in 
paragraph 8 and you make the point which you have already made to 
the Chair that after the sale of Transtel to Neotel in 2007 Transnet 
found itself in the unenviable position where its IT Network upon which 
it relied completely for the conduct of its business was owned and 
managed by Neotel as an external service provider/  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct advocate. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That – that evidence you have 
given by way of background to the Chair. 
20 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Advocate and if I can just make one correction there.  You will see I 
have mentioned before in that paragraph these two processes ran 
concurrently - the sale of the assets as well as the five year Master 
Services Agreement. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 34 of 176 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Were they contained in separate 
agreements? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
From what I can recall they were. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay but they would have 
obviously have run – run parallel because the one clearly depended on 
the other.  You could not have a services agreement without owning the 
assets … 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Correct. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Or without access to the assets 
at least? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Good.  Alright and then at 
paragraph 9 you again - it is not central to your evidence but it may 
come up later so it is as well to place on record now – that Transnet 
knew that the 2007 Master Services Agreement was due to expire in 
March 2013.  That is the Neotel Agreement.  Is that correct?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
20 
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And so what did it do? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  So 
Chair we acquired the services of a company called Detecon to assist 
us with a strategy to – as to how we should go whether we should go to 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 35 of 176 
 
market and how we should approach it taking into consideration some 
of these complexities and the asset ownership.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and was a strategy 
developed? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  It 
was advocate. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Was it approved by the Board?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  It 
was … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Transnet Board? 
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  It 
was approved by the Board Acquisition and Disposals Committee - from 
what I recall. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Were the services of 
another consulting firm employed at the time?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  Yes 
advocate.  We employed Gartner who assisted us throughout the tender 
process and the conclusion of the MSA.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Just a small formality.  
You can address the Chair rather than …  
20 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Sure Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  When you answer the ques tion.  
So what was the intention of Transnet given the pending expiring of the 
2007 Master Services Agreement?  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 36 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair so the options open to us was either to extend that contract or go 
to market to find whether it be the same or a different service provider 
but ultimately to get a new five year or three to five year agreement in 
place. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and the processes talked 
about in paragraph 9 with the two consulting entities were the se rapid 
processes quickly finalised?  Did they take time?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair the Detecon process was reasonably rapid.  Where – like I said – 
10 
the Gartner process extended all the way from assisting us with the 
RFP documents going to market, negotiation of the Master Services 
Agreement.  So that was a multi project.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And what did this necessitate – 
this delay? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  So 
… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Because the Neotel Contract is 
about to expire remember?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  Ja. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So what had to happen? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  So 
we had to agree on a strategy whether we want to renew that Neotel 
Contract or whether we want to go to market and – so that was – and 
we also had to do the documentation for the – the RFP. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 37 of 176 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes but in the meanwhile whilst 
all this decision making is taking place the contract is about to expire?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So was that – what happened to 
that contract in the interim period?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  So 
Chair that necessitated multiple extensions of that original five year 
Master Services Agreement with Neotel.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The first extension was for how 
10 
long? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair the first extension was from 1 April 2013 to 30 August 2013 a five 
month extension. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Second extension? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  The 
second extension was from 1  September 2013 to 31 October 2013. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the third extension?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  And 
the third extension was from 1  November 2013 to 31 October 2014. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The first extension you say in 
paragraph 10 was approved by the Board althou gh a longer extension 
had been asked for? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct Chair. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 38 of 176 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The second and third extensions 
did those come much later down the line?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
They did Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Were they also approved by the 
Board at a later stage?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  All 
the extensions were approved by the relevant authority whether it was 
the Board or the Board Acquisitions and Disposals Committee yes.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Just if you would have 
10 
regard to the contents of paragraph 11 of your statement and if you feel 
it necessary tell the Chair about the contents of that statement – in that 
paragraph. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair the ICT Management Team were extremely concerned around the 
proposed short term extension of this contract because we knew if we 
had to go to market that process is normally a six mon th process if you 
are lucky.  If we then conclude with a new bidder a transition – well 
firstly we will need to enter into a new Master Services Agreement and 
all the items attached to that which - that again is probably a six month 
20 
process and you would then have to go through a transition from the 
current provider to the next provider.  So we recommended a 21 month 
extension to the Board Acquisitions and Disposals – well to our 
Executive Committee at the time.  They then only proposed a 15 month 
extension to the Board Acquisitions and Disposals Committee who only 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 39 of 176 
 
suggested a five month extension to the Board.  So we were very 
concerned about that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Ultimately however to 
the extent necessary other witnesses may testif y to that we have just 
flagged that issue for the moment.  We need not go any further.  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In paragraph 12 to paragraph 17 
of your statement you traverse evidenc e already given by principally 
Ms Sharla Chetty or Sharla Pillay.  That evidence was given last week.  
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is not necessary therefore to 
repeat that evidence in any detail but for the purpose of now placing 
your evidence in context can we just go through very quickly the steps 
taken on the expiry of the 2007 MSA between Transnet and Neotel and 
the appointment of T-Systems to take over that business.  Now y our 
evidence is substantial in relation to the events surrounding the award 
to T-Systems and how that arose but to put it in context what do you 
say in paragraph 12?  What happened in 2013?  Now remember the 
20 
MSA is coming to an end, right.  So there is a d ecision to issue a 
request for proposals and RFP to initiate a tender process to bring 
on-board a new service provider.  Correct?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 40 of 176 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and that authority appears 
in a memorandum from Mr  Anoj Singh and Mr Garry Pita to the Group 
Chief Executive Brian Molefe or at least the request for that authority 
… 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
The 
background 
to 
that 
authority? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct Chair. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
Right 
and 
at 
that 
time 
Mr Garry Pita was the Head of Group Strategic Sourcing and he 
reported to Mr Anoj Singh in the latter’s capacity  as Group Chief 
Financial Officer.  Correct?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that request to initiate a 
procurement process to replace or reemploy Neotel was approved by 
Mr Brian Molefe.  Am I correct? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
20 
That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What capacity did he hold at that 
stage when he approved it?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Mr Molefe was the Group Chief Executive at the time. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 41 of 176 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And what powers did he have in 
relation to procurement because we have learnt about the BADC – the 
Board Acquisitions and Disposals Committee?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair so we had delegation of authority with various levels.  So the 
GCE would have had authority to – to approve transactions up to a 
certain point.  Thereafter it would need to go to the Board Acquisitions 
and Disposals Committee and for higher value ite ms it would need to go 
to the Board of Transnet. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair - may we take a short 
10 
adjournment and may I see you in chambers please?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  How much time do you think?  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Should we just take the tea break. 
DV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I am not sure.  If we could take 
the tea break now please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let us – let us say 15 minutes up to 10 past.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The tea might not be ready.  We will take the tea 
break until 10 past 11.  Adjourn. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we are grateful Ms September that you were 
here so you can take over.  Mr Pretorius is not well and has  had to be 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 42 of 176 
 
released but Ms September is familiar with the matter and she will take 
over.  Ms September are you ready?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes I am Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  Mr van der Westhuizen 
before the short adjournment we were at page four of your statement 
and in particular it was placed on record that the evidence that you’ve 
recorded from paragraph 12 to paragraph 17 has in fact already been 
dealt with by a previous witness, that being Ms Sharla Pill ay, who is 
now Chetty, is that correct?  
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That’s correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   Is it also correct that it was in fact 
Ms Chetty, Mrs Chetty sorry, who had in fact approved the award in her 
acting capacity as General Chief Executive at that particular point in 
time? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That’s correct.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   If we can then go to paragraph 18 of 
your statement, it is understood that T-Systems, at the time filed its 
20 
bid, not independently but instead as a joint venture.  Can you please 
give the Chair details in relation to the constitution of such joint 
venture?   
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Sure, Chair so the bid by T-systems was a joint bid between 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 43 of 176 
 
themselves, T-Systems as well as a company called Broadband Infraco 
also known as BBI which was a State-owned company at the time. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     And at that – and in regard to 
Broadband Infraco what were the assertions m ade that Broadband 
Infraco could benefit the transaction by pairing up with T-Systems? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :      
Well Chair, T-Systems didn’t own a significant at the time so they would 
need additional infrastructure assets whi ch is why they partnered, I 
believe with Broadband Infraco. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Chair Broadband Infraco is in fact 
10 
an entity which will feature prominently when all the evidence is, in 
fact, placed before you.  Salim Essa, in particular was a Non -Executive 
Board member of Broadband Infraco and he was appointed as such by 
the then Minister Malusi Gigaba.  If you can now turn to page six of 
your statement, paragraphs 19, 20 and 21 is also evidence that was 
placed before this Commission by Ms Sharla C hetty. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :     
That’s correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     In the context of Ms Sharla Chetty 
having signed off the memorandum, which duly approved the issuance 
20 
of the letter of intent, to award the Network Se rvices contract to Neotel, 
was her signature necessary to complete the procurement process at 
all? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :     
Chair, so at the time the Board Acquisition and Disposal Committee 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 44 of 176 
 
delegated its authority to the Group  Chief Executive to conclude the 
transaction which, in this specific scenario, was Sharla Pillay, now 
Chetty, so yes it was. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     So where was the Group Chief 
Executive at that time?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Chair my understanding is that Mr Molefe was abroad at the time.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     So, then it’s correct to say that her 
signature, in fact, completed the procurement process in this regard?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
10 
Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     So, to put this into context in 
relation to the 2007 MSA agreement which was due to expire in 2013, it 
is understood that when Ms Chetty – Mrs Chetty sorry, had in fact 
approved the awarding of the bid, letters of inten t and letters of award 
needed to have been sent out?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
That’s correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     What exactly happened once Mrs 
Chetty had made that approval to award the Network Services contract 
20 
to Neotel? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Chair, so we were quite eager to get the documents back from Sharla at 
the time because our contract expired on 31 October 2013, I think it 
was the second extension and any expenditure post that da te, we would 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 45 of 176 
 
be out of contract and in terms of the Public Finance Management Act it 
could be irregular expenditure.  So Sharla sent the mail back to us, I 
can’t remember exactly who, but I remember that I had sight of it, with 
all the signed documents and I then followed up with procurement who 
oversaw and managed the process to confirm that they will send this to 
the relevant parties so that we are not out of contract from the next 
day.  I then received a phone call, if I recall, from Mr Pita or an email 
stating that he’s been instructed not to issue the documents 
…(intervention). 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     And is that Mr Gary Pita?  
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
That’s correct, that’s Mr Gary Pita.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     And he held the position of what at 
that time? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Gary was the Group Chief Supply Chain Officer at the time.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Thank you, please proceed. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUI ZEN:    
Sure, and the feedback that he gave me Chair, is that, Mr Singh 
requested that he does not issue those documents on request from Mr 
20 
Molefe whose abroad and he would like to review the documents 
personally. 
CHAIRPERSON:     So, you got this call and  from what you were told by 
Mr Gary Pita, Mr Brian Molefe had given this instruction whilst still 
abroad, as you understood the position?  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 46 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     So is it then correct that the proper 
procurement process was followed up and until the stage of Mrs Chetty 
appending her signature to award the contract to Neotel?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   And it is also then correct, based on 
your evidence that pursuant to that process the letters of intent in 
10 
alignment with that process were not sent on the instruction of Mr Brian 
Molefe.   
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
That’s correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     What then happened during 
November 2013, following the occurrence of these events?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Chair we were called to a meeting subsequent to Mr Molefe’s return 
and we were called to the 49 t h floor which is the floor which his offices 
were at and…(intervention). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:     And who was we – who were we? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Apologies Chair, so we were, myself, Mr Anoj Singh, Mr Edward 
Thomas who was in Supply Chain at the time and the Chief Information 
Officer, Dr Matsika Matawane, there could have been others Chair, but I 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 47 of 176 
 
recall those individuals were at the session.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     And if I may, is this the meeting 
you referred to that happened in November of 2013, paragraph 23 of 
your statement? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :   It 
is.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Thank you. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair we arrived at Mr Molefe’s office  and we, from what I recall, were 
greeted by his personal assistant to ask us to leave our cell phones at 
10 
her desk, which I find peculiar because I have met in his office before 
and I wasn’t requested to leave my cell phone at his personal 
assistant’s desk but regardless so we all handed it in and we went into 
his office and we had a meeting.  Upon us all sitting down around Mr 
Molefe’s table, I remember he was quite relaxed and he – if I recall his 
words correctly he said we can’t give this thing to Neotel  there’s too 
much concentration risk.  I then…(intervention).   
CHAIRPERSON:     Sorry Before you do that – before you proceed you 
have mentioned some of the people whose names you can remember 
who attended that meeting, apart from those people, from Mr Mo lefe’s 
20 
side, was he alone? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    He 
was alone Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay thank you. So he said there’s too much 
concentration we can’t give this to Neotel, ja.  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 48 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZE N:    
Chair upon that statement I then enquired, from what I recall, well 
exactly who he would like to give it to then because if you look at the 
process and the tier report that you’ve seen that we’ve recommended 
Dimension Data was the second preferred – or the second-best bidder 
and T-Systems and Broadband Infraco was the third bidder.  Mr Molefe 
was then of the view that the 240million, which again, I believe you’ve 
seen but happy to elaborate on it if I need to, we should include in the 
process which would then imply that T-Systems, Broadband Infraco 
would be the second best bidder and due to this concentration risk that 
10 
Mr Molefe articulated that the tender should then go to the second -best 
bidder, which in  his mind was T-Systems and Broadband Infraco. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     What exactly is concentration risk?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Chair, so concentration risk from my understanding of what Mr Molefe 
articulated was the fact that Transnet was Neotel’s largest client a nd if 
something should go wrong with Neotel for whatever reason, that 
Transnet would be exposed to quite a big risk.  
CHAIRPERSON:     So in other words, did you understand the concern 
he was expressing as meaning that the – this tender should be given to 
20 
somebody else so as to bring in some diversification?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Chair I understood his concern but I thought the argument was a logical 
fallacy, it was irrelevant. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes okay. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 49 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES J ACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
The reason I state that Chair, is because, like advocate Pretorius took 
us through earlier, the Data Centre that Transnet used was outsourced 
to T-Systems. So, by giving T-Systems the Data Centre and now you 
bundle your network with that, in my mind would increase the 
concentration risk not mitigate the risk, so that’s why I didn’t quite 
understand that and I provided that feedback to Mr Molefe.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Oh you expressed your view?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:    
Absolutely Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:     And what was his response?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    He 
didn’t respond Chair, he looked up and I could note that his polite, 
relaxed demeanour was starting to change.  He then pro ceeded to his 
second point Chair, which was…(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:     Sorry let me get that last bit, did you say he had 
been polite to you but that seemed to change?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    It 
was very informal and relaxed when we started the meeting Chair and 
after I now …(intervention).    
20 
CHAIRPERSON:     Expressed a different view. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    I 
could see that he was becoming less relaxed so to speak.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes Okay, alright thank you. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    He 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 50 of 176 
 
then mentioned to us that he had received a letter, I think it was Nexus 
which was one of the Neotel BBBEE subsidiaries or affiliates and that 
they expressed a view that Neotel was busy diluting their shareholding 
and they were particularly concerned about this.  I can’t recall that I’ve 
seen that letter or heard anything about it at the time, so again I 
articulated that it may or may not be a real issue but I suggest that we 
investigate that issue and at least give Neotel the opportunity to 
respond, should it be a real risk and to pose their side of the story, 
Chair.  Again, Mr Molefe did not take kindly to the objections, he again 
did not respond, from what I recall and he just lo oked up at me with a 
10 
glare in his eyes which made me realise at that point, if I continue with 
this objections it was not going to end well for me Chair. So, at that 
point…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     So you got the impression that he was not, to say 
the least, happy with these views you kept on expressing.  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
That’s my view Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
So, upon that realisation I decided to get back in my box, so to speak, 
20 
and not object to any further items.  Mr Molefe did then raise a couple 
of other items, from what I recall, and its all captured in that 
memorandum around information security and CCTV issues that we 
experienced at the time, th at is the crux of that meeting Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:     What about the other people that were in the room, 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 51 of 176 
 
did they express any views did anybody support the views you 
expressed that you have articulated now?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Chair I can’t recall that anyone had the same level of objection that I 
had, they were reasonably quiet from what I can recall, so I did feel a 
bit isolated in the session. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes, and in respect of other issues other than those 
on which you expressed views, did other people in the room express 
views, either in support of whatever Mr Brian Molefe was saying or 
against? 
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Chair I can’t recall that they either disputed or objected nor suppo rted 
Mr Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Oh okay, alright, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     In summary then, you took issue 
with – you raised objection rather to the three main reasons that Mr 
Molefe advanced to not award the contract to Neotel.  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
That’s correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     The first…(intervention). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m sorry maybe, I don’t know, it’s up to you two to 
answer yes or no or whatever way, I’m not sure whether you were 
objecting as opposed to simply expressing your own view which 
happened to be different from Mr Brian Molefe’s view, there’s a 
distinction between objecting and expressing a different view.  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 52 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    Ja 
Chair so I’m not going to pretend to know exactly what the difference is 
but I definitely expressed a view that was different from Mr Molefe’s.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay I mean if you object it’s much more – it’s like 
– I think it’s much more stronger whereas you can express a dif ferent 
view without saying you’re objecting particularly the person to whom 
you are talking maybe had the final authority to decide one way or 
another, you might say, well here is my view, what do you make of – 
what you do with it is your own decision but this is my view another 
approach is to say, I do object, you know, irrespective of what you 
10 
might say I am objecting.  So, I’m just mentioning that so that you 
appreciate that there can be a difference, sometimes the difference 
might not be important but…(intervention). 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Chair so based on that explanation, I expressed my view because Mr 
Molefe had the final decision, so whether I objected or not was not 
going to carry any weight so. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Thank you Chair.  In regard to the 
three main reasons then, the one reason which Mr Molefe had 
20 
advanced concerned the 248million discount that was offered by T -
Systems, can you just unpack this particular discount for  the benefit of 
the Commission and in particular the timing of considering this 
discount? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 53 of 176 
 
Sure, Chair, so I was present in most if not all the RFP sessions and I 
pretty much led all of them and I recall,  during the process that I made 
it extremely clear that our best and final offer was on the Thursday 
before – a particular Thursday, and we can check the dates Chair, so I 
recalled mentioning it over and over and over and checking that all the 
bidders understood it, which I’m sure they did. Post to receiving all the 
pricing back from the bidders there were – some included mobilisation 
fee and some did not so we just wanted to clarify that.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Can you just clarify what is 
mobilisation fee please? 
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Yes, Chair it was referred to as mobilisation or transition fees, so as 
part of the 2007 Master Services Agreement there were certain service 
level agreements or SLA’s linked to that agree ment.  Subsequently the 
world has changed and Transnet wanted stricter Service Level 
Agreements to give you an example we wanted redundancy so that if a 
network line goes down that there is another line and the port isn’t 
down from a network perspective, things like that.  So, in order for 
Neotel to transition or whoever the bidder would have been from Neotel 
to transition two, that level of service, there would have to be an 
20 
investment, additional fibre lines, additional networks, switches and 
routers and those kinds of things. So that’s what I refer to as the 
transition cost or – ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     So, to not over simplify 
mobilisation fee, it’s essentially the cost of hand -over from one service 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 54 of 176 
 
provider to another? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACO BUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
And increased service levels should it – should the current income at 
Neotel remain the service provider, yes.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Thank you, coming back to the 
discount of 248million, was it an appropriate time in the p rocess for 
this discount to be considered at consideration for the award of the 
bid? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Absolutely not in my opinion Chair, like I said, I made it very clear that 
10 
the best and final offers had to be submitt ed on a certain date, which 
they were, subsequently there was a clarification session with T-
Systems and Broadband Infraco, there was a – it was multiple people 
present at this meeting.  There was a gentleman, however, that 
represented Broadband Infraco, I can’t recall his names though, it 
wasn’t Mr Essa though, that I know as a fact.  He then indicated to us 
that due to the short timeline they couldn’t meet with their minister or 
their shareholder which is the DPE shareholder, in time, and they 
managed to meet with the shareholder over the weekend and the 
shareholder that they would be willing to invest an additional amount of 
20 
248million rand into this process.  I then clarified and said, okay so 
what does that mean, does that mean that we can reduce your p rice 
with 248million, absolutely they said but it was post the best and final 
offers.  So, if we should have even considered including that, which we 
did not, my view is that we should have at least given the other bidders 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 55 of 176 
 
a similar platform to give us a view if they were happy with their 
pricing, because effectively now there’s a second best and final offer 
but that opportunity, from what I recall, was only to T-Systems and 
Broadband Infraco. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     And the other bidders were not 
afforded opportunity? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Not that I can recall, Chair, no. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     Did Mr Brian Molefe have the 
authority to change the process that was being followed?  
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DE R WESTHUIZEN:    
Chair, so I think this enjoyed some attention last week from a few legal 
minds, I think including Mr Volmink.  In the memorandum that we’ve 
attached it does appear that there are certain leniencies and that, 
potentially, Mr Molefe could disagree based on risk but there was a 
certain process to be followed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     And what was that process please?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Chair from what I recall from the documents, and we can go there if we 
need to, the GCE had to revert back to the Committee that you 
20 
recommended that the bidder, to re -submit and re-assess.  Like I said 
we had a meeting but in my mind that was certainly not a consultation 
nor a request for us to go back and reconsider, it was  pretty much an 
instruction.  So, I don’t believe, in my opinion, that, that process was 
followed. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 56 of 176 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   Do you understand…(intervention).   
CHAIRPERSON:    Well I’m sorry in relation to that aspect and that part 
of the, I think manual, the witness who gave evidence, I think, on 
Friday I asked her whether that procedure in terms of which the 
decision maker is supposed to go back to, I think, what are called 
recommending officials or officers, I asked her whether that procedure 
applies before a decision is made, so in other words when there are 
only recommendations from a lower structure before the person who 
has the power to make the decision, makes the decision, if he or she 
thinks, I see this recommendation that I should award this ten der to A 
10 
but I actually think it should go to B or C or I don’t think it should be 
awarded to A, whether that’s the process – that’s when this procedure 
applies or whether it does apply when a decision has already been 
taken.  Now when I asked her that question, she said, if I recall 
correctly,  it applies before a decision is taken but much earlier in her 
evidence I had also asked her the question, whether, where a decision 
has already been taken, the person who took the decision or  the 
person occupying that position can later on seek to change it and my 
understanding is that she said, yes in certain circumstances it could be 
done and she, I think said, if, for example something has arisen that 
20 
was not foreseen or something like that. So that was as I reca ll the sum 
total of her evidence on this aspect, so I don’t know what your own 
understanding is. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Chair so I would concur with Mrs Chetty’s view, so the question then is, 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 57 of 176 
 
was this – so she approved the pr ocess, I think, like we’ve confirmed 
before.  To what extent Mr Molefe shared that view because of the 
documents were not distributed I don’t know but nothing in my mind 
happened post the approval from Mrs Chetty to the turnaround, if you 
will, from Mr Molefe.  I mean if Neotel went into liquidation or 
something like that, I could understand that something material has 
happened that will impact their ability to deliver the services and like I 
said nothing to that happened in my mind.  So, number one, he 
probably couldn’t have or nothing like that occurred and if something 
did occur, again he would have to revert back to the Committee that 
10 
you referred to or the recommending officers which, again, in my mind 
did not happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:     So, would you say that there is a procedure in 
terms of which the decision maker may go back to the recommending 
committee or officials where he or she thinks – he or she doesn’t agree 
with their recommendation but that there is also provision or – there’s 
also provision for an award to be changed if there are certain 
circumstances such as the one you have cited, namely liquidation and 
so on? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
20 
Chair in my opinion yes, there would be a procedure like that for 
examples like I’ve noted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For both situations, in other words, both procedures 
exist as far as you understood the position namely the procedure 
before a decision is taken, if the decision maker thinks he or she 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 58 of 176 
 
doesn’t agree with the recommendation from th e recommending officials 
he or she is required to go back to them and raise his or her concerns 
before making the decision but apart from that situation too, if a 
decision has been made and certain circumstances arise that were not 
foreseen, the decision maker can re-look at the whole thing.   
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     That’s what you’re saying, okay thank you.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     In that regard then can I take you 
to Exhibit Bundle BB7(b) on p age 331. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    The divider is number what?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     It is Annexure K2 and it begins on 
page 331. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, thank you, yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Do you recognise this – do you 
recognise this document?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    I 
do Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     For the record it is a memorandum 
that has been – that is from Brian Molefe, Group CE to Anoj Singh 
20 
Group Chief Financial Officer, Matsika Matawane, Chief Information 
Officer and Gary Pita, Group Chief Supply Chain Officer.  It is dated 20 
November 2013 and the subject relates to the provision of network 
services as it’s amplified in the title.  How were you aware of this 
document, what is your knowledge of the compilat ion of this document? 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 59 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
So, Chair I compiled most of this document, post the session with Mr 
Molefe. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     And when did you compile this 
document? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN D ER WESTHUIZEN:    
Chair I can’t recall exactly but I think I compiled it shortly after, pretty 
much the same day from what I recall.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     The same day as? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    As 
10 
the meeting, from what I recall. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And on whose instruction did you 
prepare this document? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So 
post the meeting with Mr Molefe Mr Singh and I had a brief 
conversation and he instructed me to compile this  memorandum with 
the relevant input from supply chain sourcing and so on – or Group 
Supply Chain and so forth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us go back to that meeting and round off because 
I do not think we did round off.  What was the outcome of that meeting 
20 
in Mr Brian Molefe’s office? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So 
Chair the outcome was that he was of the view that we need to award 
this tender to T-Systems and Broadband Infraco. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And other than the different view that – views that you 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 60 of 176 
 
had expressed you cannot recall that anybody expressed any view 
different from his view on any of the – on that issue? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  Not 
to my recollection Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay alright. Thank you.  You may proceed Ms 
September. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  Based on the objections 
or rather what is the – the crux of this memorandum in relation to the 
award of the tender? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So 
10 
Chair effectively what this memorandum does is it reverses the decision 
or the recommendation from the recommending officers to award the 
business to Neotel and it takes into account firstly the R248 million and 
based on certain perceived risks by Mr Molefe it awards the tender  to 
T-Systems or a letter of intent. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  More accurately stated on page 337 
of this document Mr Brian Molefe seeks approval for what you have just 
given evidence about, is that correct?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So I 
do not think Mr Molefe wanted approval he was giving an instruction 
20 
yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  I am, sorry my mistake.  Apologies.  
If we could then just go back to page 331.  You have mentioned that 
you were integral in the preparation of this  document.  If you had such 
strong views about why the recommendation of Mr Brian Molefe was…  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 61 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am just thinking whether – whether he said 
anything about those views being strong.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Oh.  Okay.  Let me rephrase. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it may be that they were strong I am just wanting 
to make sure. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  To make sure. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  Let 
me help I was in violent disagreement with what Mr Molefe said.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  I 
10 
said just to help I was in violent disagreement with what Mr Molefe 
said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Well then in violent disagreement 
with what Mr Molefe said … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is very strong.  Yes – so – so no that is what – I 
just wanted to make sure that we do not have a situation where the 
record might reflect something that he might not have intended but if 
that – if that is a correct description of his vie ws how he expressed 
them that is okay. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you for the correction Chair.  
Mr Van Der Westhuizen in violent disagreement of Mr Molefe’s views 
how and why you would author a document that is contrary to views 
that you hold so strong. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 62 of 176 
 
Chair so my views at the time were if I do not put this document or 
compile or author this document that my career at Transnet would be 
short lived and in no way was I going to sign this document.  Jus t to 
add to my emotions at the time I recalled distributing or updating and 
distributing my CV from what I recall on that same day because I just 
saw affidavit written all over this to be honest.  So I do not think that I 
had much of a choice and I thought that my employment would be 
ended and someone else would have compiled the memorandum.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me put this and this is not to say change what you 
say.  I just want you to appreciate and be able to say this is the 
10 
position or that is the position .  There are two possibilities.  The one 
possibility is that if what you did at the meeting was you regarded it as 
something necessary or your duty to express your views to say these 
are my views but I know that it is not necessary my views that need to 
prevail but these are my views.  If you get persuaded that is now Mr 
Molefe if you are persuaded and you agree with me then that is fine but 
if you do not agree and you insist that this be done I will have 
expressed by view and if I am asked or instructed to  have a role in 
carrying out what you as the person who has the power to decide want 
to be done I will do that.  That does not change that I do not agree but I 
20 
will do it because you – you are the one who has to decide.  That is 
one way.  Another way is to  say well if I had it my way I would not even 
compile it for him but I did because I felt that I would be risking my job. 
So the one – the one situation is where you did it because you felt that 
you did not have a choice.  Another way would be where you di d it not 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 63 of 176 
 
necessarily because you did not feel you had a choice but because you 
appreciated that is the one who must make a decision right or wrong 
and yours is to express your views and let him decide.  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So 
Chair ultimately he was the decision maker in this regard.  I expressed 
my views to me and I still disagreed with it but like you said ultimately 
he had the delegation to make the decision.  He was appointed in that 
role as my superior by the Department of  Public Enterprises and I had 
to respect that and therefore I drafted the document.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  At paragraph 28 of your statement 
10 
you and I will quote you say that:  
“Your objections would be tantamount to professional 
suicide.” 
In – follow to the question raised to you by the Chair what informed 
your decision or your view rather that this was the ultimate outcome of 
professional suicide to quote you if you did not do what you were told 
to do? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair like I said in that meeting Mr Molefe’s relaxed demeanour 
changed very quickly and I could see in his eye and maybe I misread 
20 
the situation I doubt it though but I could see clearly that if I say 
another word security is going to escort me out of the  building today.  
That was my …  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay.  If we can then go back to this 
particular memorandum that you were – that you assisted in preparing.  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 64 of 176 
 
Paragraphs 4 and further deals with the procurement process that is to 
be followed in relation … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe – maybe we might be leaving something 
hanging that should be dealt with.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  No problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe the part of your statement that Ms September 
just referred to maybe puts your situation more in l ine with fearing 
losing your job if you did not cooperate then then position that you had 
expressed your view and you left it to him to do – to decide and not 
necessarily that you are fearing losing your job, what do you say?  
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair so I firmly believe that if I did not draft this memorandum.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That I would have been side lined and let go over time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES J OCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is where the professional suicide came from.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That you would have been victimised in one way or 
another? 
20 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So from paragraph 4 on the 
procurement process is in fact dealt with and in particular from 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 65 of 176 
 
paragraph 5 the role of the acquisition council is documented.  If I 
could ask you to go to page 333 of the same bundle.  At sub -paragraph 
20.5 which is titled Disagreement Regarding Award Of Business  and I 
shall read paragraph 20.5.1 says: 
“Should a dispute arise between the recommending 
officers and the AC being the Acquisitions Council 
regarding a submission after the AC has referred the 
matter back to the recommending officer for re-
motivation?  The matter must be escalated to the 
entity’s CEO for a final decision.”  
10 
Do you have any comment in relation to the application of this process 
to the circumstances that you have explained now relating to Mr Mol efe 
recommending that the award be given to Neotel?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So 
Chair I think as we have sort of discussed if…  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Sorry to T-Systems. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  Ja 
so.  So as we discussed if one could argue that something catastrophic 
or material happened and therefore Mr Molefe needs to overturn the 
decision by Mr Pillay my reading of this would be that he needs to refer 
20 
the matter back to the recommending officers for  re-motivation.  Not 
that I am a lawyer but that is my reading of it and that did not happen.  
Like I said we did not have a consultation we had an instruction 
meeting. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  So there was no re-motivation? 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 66 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  No. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  There was no referral back?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  No. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  To the Acquisitions Council?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  No 
to the recommending officers which were the signatories to the Tier 
Report yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was 20.5.  20.5.1 talks about a situation where 
there is a dispute that has arisen between the recommending officers 
10 
and the AC regarding a submission after the AC has referred the matter 
back to the recommending officer for re-motivation.  Am I right to think 
that that is a situation what that clause deals with is a situation where 
the 
recommending 
committee 
or 
officer 
/ 
official 
sends  
a 
recommendation to me and I am the one who must make a decision and 
they say they recommend that the tender be given to A and I look at 
their motivation for that and I look at everything that I am supposed to 
look at and I do not agree.  That then I must  send it back to them and 
say what about this, what about that, what about that?  Because it 
seems to me that the tender should be given to B and then I give them 
20 
an opportunity to deal with my concerns and then if they revert to me 
after looking at the issues I have raised with them and they still stick to 
their recommendation and I still stick to the view that they are wrong 
that is when this clause applies.  Is that in line with your 
understanding? 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 67 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is in line with my understanding Chair yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And then with regard to – okay before I proceed 
because then in that situation a dispute has arisen between the one 
who 
must 
make 
the 
decision 
and 
the 
ones 
who 
made 
the 
recommendation as to who should get the award.  Then – then in that 
event the power to make the final decision goes to the entity’s CEO 
according to this, is that right?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is – that is my understanding of it as well.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is your understanding as well?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair so where I am – where I am differing slightly is that the matter 
must be referred back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  To 
the recommending officers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  And 
in my mind that did not happen.  Like I said we have – we had a 
20 
meeting where Mr Molefe expressed his concerns.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  I 
raised my – or gave him my views. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 68 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  But 
at no point were we asked to re-motivate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So I 
suppose it depends on your interpretation of whether that meeting 
constitutes the re-motivation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  Or 
not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I was just – I am going to go to 20.5.2 just now 
10 
but I think you are saying that the scenario that I have put to you falls 
under 20.5.1? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  In 
my ,,, 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN : In 
my understanding Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is your understanding.  So in that event it would 
be the CEO of the entity who makes a final decision and not the person 
who otherwise would have made the decision because there is 
20 
disagreement. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now 20.5.2 says: 
“Where the recommendation of the evaluation team 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 69 of 176 
 
are seeing that now they are not talking about a 
recommending officer where the recommendation of 
the evaluation team conflicts with your opinion of the 
end user the matter mus t be referred to the AC for a 
ruling.” 
So this – that is a different stage – a different scenario, is that right?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is my understanding Chair.  So if you go – if you look at 20.5.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  To 
10 
try and explain it even – my understanding of this is that if the 
evaluation team had – make a recommendation and Group ICT in this 
scenario of the Technology Team had a different view.  So let us say 
they came up with the scenario and said it should be T-Systems and we 
said guys they – T-Systems cannot for whatever reason deliver it so 
prior to it going to the final decision maker we already have a 
difference of opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is my mind is – 20.5.2 would apply to that scenario.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Where in this case we – there was not a difference between what the 
recommending 
officers 
and 
business 
or 
the 
end 
user 
were 
recommending.  We were all in agreement that based on the process 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 70 of 176 
 
followed including all the technicalities Neotel was the preferred bidder.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  But – but we agree that the scenarios are 
different for the two? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  I 
agree Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Clauses ja. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in regard to the – to clause 20.5.1 that – that 
does not seem to have been applicable  because a decision had already 
10 
been taken by Ms Chetty in this case so by the time Mr Brian Molefe 
got involved a decision had already been taken.  So clause 20.5.1 does 
not appear to have been applicable, is that your understanding as well?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  I 
would concur with that view Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Unless something catastrophic or material happened.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WE STHUIZEN:  
20 
Where we needed to relook at the situation and like I said..  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  In 
my view nothing did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But I think that probably is dealt with by another 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 71 of 176 
 
provision. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Sure okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then it also 20.5.2 was also not applicable in this 
case? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  I 
agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  Thank you.  So as far as you know 
there was nothing in the policies of Transnet which justified that Mr 
Molefe should re-visit a decision that had already been taken by 
10 
somebody who was – who had the power to make that decision when 
she – when he was not around?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOB US VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  Not 
aware of any such. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair.  If we could then 
turn to page 335 of the same document.  Is it correct that paragraph 7 
documents your specific concerns in relation to the r ecommendation 
that was advanced to you by Mr Brian Molefe?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So 
20 
Chair these highlights the concerns raised by Mr Molefe in the session.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay and just for record then it 
would read: 
“That I have the following specific concerns with your 
recommendation and responses to me including the 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 72 of 176 
 
responses to me in the various meetings held with the 
recommending 
officers 
for 
re -motivation 
which 
is 
discussed further in this document.  
a. Counterparty risk and alienation of state assets.  
b. Concentration risk as Net – Transnet is Neotel’s 
largest client. 
c. BBBEE partners which is your Broad Based Black 
Economic Empowerment partners. 
d. Information security incident and  
e. CCTV, camera, exposures.”  
10 
This paragraph talks specifically to a re-motivation.  Are you aware of 
any re-motivation that took place?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  No 
I am not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the meeting in Mr Brian Molefe’s office at the 
meeting that you talked about where you expressed certain views when 
he said that he thought that the R240 million should be taken into 
account you did express your view about that as well and did tell him 
how this issue had been dealt with before?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
20 
Chair I cannot recall if I specifically mentioned it in the meeting but the 
Tier Report that we signed was very clear on the R248 million and why 
we think we should and cannot include it in {indistinct}.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Is it possible that the – he raised the issue of 
the R240 million after you had expressed your views I think on two 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 73 of 176 
 
aspects and you got the impression that he was not very receptive to 
different views.  Could it be that he raised it after and after that and 
you felt look I am not going to be saying anything now?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair I think it was raised …  
CHAIRPERSON:  At the beginning. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Sort of at the beginning.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  The 
10 
reason I am saying that is the – I would not have counter argued or 
expressed a view that it increases the concentration risk if we gave the 
tender to T-Systems.  If we gave it to Dimension Data as an example  
who was the second best bidder if for whatever reason you felt you 
wanted to exclude Neotel that would not necessarily increase it would 
probably mitigate the concentration risk to some extent because they 
were a large organisation with far more clients.  So we had to have 
discussed the R248 to get from bidder 1 to bidder 3 which is now bidder 
2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Throughout the communication 
exchanged with Mr Brian Molefe and the memorandum that you 
prepared which was  eventually signed – signed off.  What was Anoj 
Singh’s views on the change of the – of decision? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 74 of 176 
 
Chair I cannot recall if Mr Singh had a specific view or whether he 
supported or was in disagreement with the view it was pretty much just 
we need to get it done and therefore the instruction on the 
memorandum.  But I cannot recall that Mr Singh was either in 
disagreement or support of the overturning if you will of the 
recommendation. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay.  Who was respon – ultimately 
responsible for the overall procurement of this particular contract?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So 
Chair at that stage if I recall correctly Group Chief Supply Chain Officer 
10 
was Garry Pita but that function reported into the Group Chief Financial 
Officer being Anoj Singh at the time so in my mind Mr Singh would have 
been overall responsible for procurement.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  An absent raise – an absent Mr Singh 
raising any contrary views to  the position taken by Mr Brian Molefe.  Is 
there any reason for you to believe that he did not agree with the 
approach adopted by Mr Brian Molefe?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  Ja 
Chair like I said I cannot recall if he had any object ions but in the 
absence of that like you state Advocate it probably means that he was 
20 
likely supportive. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And then lastly based on the 
evidence that you have given in relation to this change of decision is it 
to be understood that the decision – the change of decision to grant the 
award to T-Systems was independently done by Mr Brian Molefe?  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 75 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  Is 
in my opinion Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Are you aware as to whether or not 
you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry what was the answer?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  I 
said in my opinion yes Chair.  It was Mr Molefe unilaterally made this 
decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay well she said independently and I am not sure 
what you have in mind Ms September? 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  That the witness has actually just 
answered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So she asked whether you – you thought that Mr 
Molefe made the decision independently.  Are you saying yes he made 
it independently whatever – if you are – if you are not sure what that 
means you can ask for clarification?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So 
Advocate Ja 
maybe just help 
me 
with 
what you 
mean 
with 
independently in this scenario?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Was it a unilateral decision by Mr 
20 
Brian Molefe to change the decision from awarding the tender to Neotel 
– from Neotel to T-Systems? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  In 
my opinion yes it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  I guess unilateral in the sense that those wh o 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 76 of 176 
 
were – who had been involved in working on the matter were as far as 
you are concerned were – well certainly not – or did not agree to it?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But are you able to say that he did no t consult them?  
You know unilaterally can mean without consulting?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair so …  
CHAIRPERSON:  It may can mean without agreement from somebody 
else just on your own. 
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WES THUIZEN:  Ja.  
Chair so the only session that I am aware of.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  And 
that I was present at was that particular meeting where he raised his 
views. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOB US VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  We 
expect – or expressed a different view and the decision was made 
pretty much at that meeting. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
From what I understood.  I do not believe there were other 
consultations but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. Ja.  But you would also not know everyone he 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 77 of 176 
 
may have talked to about it?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  Who had to manage this 
contract going forward?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  I 
10 
was. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  So were you the business owner if 
that is correctly stated?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So 
ultimately the Group Chief Information Officer would be the business 
owner but I was the representative in this scenario because obviously 
she could not attend all meetings so it would have been me indirectly 
yes.  And also I was the head of vendor management for Transnet ICT 
so this would have been one contract that yes the team would have 
managed. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And despite the views that you raised 
your views were ignored?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JO COBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  I 
believe so Chair yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  So the decision is taken by Mr 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 78 of 176 
 
Molefe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms September I do not know whether you intend – 
ignored … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I am saying this just so that the witness when he 
agrees or does not agree he should appreciate what he is agreeing to 
or not agreeing to.  Some people say somebody’s views have been 
ignored when they actually mean that those views were not agreed to.  
But their views might not have been agreed to but they may have been 
taken into account and that means they were not ignored.  You know 
10 
you can express your views, you can make yourself submissions the 
fact that I do not agree with your submissions does not mean I have 
ignored them.  I may take into account but do not agree with them and 
therefore I go ahead and make my own decision.  But I have taken them 
into account so therefore I have not ignored them.  So – so I am just 
saying I am not sure … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  I will rephrase. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether you meant ignored or what you meant?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Let me rephrase. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because Mr Molefe may have taken it into account – 
20 
taken the views into account but just did not agree with them.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  You rephrase then.  Mr Van Der 
Westhuizen you were the business owner, is that correct?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Yes. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 79 of 176 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  It is also correct that you have given 
evidence that you were the one that was responsible to manage this 
contract going forward?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  You then important and particularly 
your views were important in the process of the award of the tender?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  I 
believe so. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Despite the views that you raised 
10 
which were important to the process it was not considered persuasive 
enough to alter the decision that had been taken to re -award the tender 
from Neotel to T-Systems? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is much better.  Ja.  The decision was made to 
change Ms Chetty’s decision notwithstanding the views you had 
expressed? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN  DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  What then happened once the 
decision was changed by Mr Molefe?  What was the process that was 
then followed? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 80 of 176 
 
Chair so post that decision and the relevant documents being signed T-
Systems would have received a letter of intent and all the other bidders 
would have received a letter of regret.  What would then have pursued 
is that we would have started negotiations with T-Systems in order to 
conclude a three to five year master services agreement as per the 
RFP process. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did Neotel raise any concerns with 
Transnet following receipt of a letter of regret?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair they did.  I can recall that Mr Sunil Joshi who was the CEO or 
10 
Managing Director at the time of Neotel wrote to us formally to the GCE 
- Mr Brian Molefe – requiring or requesting some clarity on the reasons 
we posed in the letter of regret which stated from what I recall business 
risk was the reason why it was not awarded to Neotel and Mr  Joshi then 
also asked or stated that he and the team could not recall that that was 
a prequalification criteria or mentioned anywhere in the request for 
proposals. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  We are now at page 10 of your 
statement paragraph 35.  If I could ask you to go to the Bundle BB7.  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
20 
Sorry advocate just say … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  B … 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  The 
page number again please. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So if you could go to page 414 of the 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 81 of 176 
 
second bundle which is EXHIBIT BB7B.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I thought you said we are going back to the 
statement. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Oh no sorry. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  So 
did I. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what you heard also?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  Yes 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I am confusing myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think she said page 10.  Okay.  So what page must 
we go to now? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Page 411. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Do you recognise this document 
Mr van der Westhuizen? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN: 
 
I 
do.  I do Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please identify it. 
20 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair so this appears to be the response to Mr Sunil Joshi based on the 
letter that he wrote to Transnet. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And if I can take you to page 413 
which concludes at paragraph 13.  It reads:  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 82 of 176 
 
“Due to the above business risk considerations 
Transnet has made a decision not to award a three 
year network contract to Neotel.  This network is 
the heart of Transnet business and awarding the 
business 
to 
Neotel 
will 
expose 
Transnet 
to 
unnecessary risk.” 
And this is the letter that you had referred to earlier?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  Yes 
Chair.  I just do not know if this was the final letter that we e ventually 
sent.  There could have been slight changes to it because I see this is 
10 
the unsigned one but yes I think this was the crux of it.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you for that clarity. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
How 
would 
you 
describe 
the 
relationship between Transnet and Neotel following the sending of the 
letter of regret to Neotel?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair it would be like the relationship was extremely strained a fter that 
because I do think – I mean taking into consideration the history that 
Neotel took over Transtel a lot of employees through a Section 197 
20 
moved to Transtel.  A lot of those individuals still have – had contacts 
with a lot of people at Transnet.  So I have no doubt – to be honest – 
that the – some of the information must have gotten out regarding this 
turnaround of the – of the tender and I think they were flabbergasted 
that they lost this.  They could not lose it.  The current income that 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 83 of 176 
 
they can provide the services likely the cheapest and quite frankly no 
one else can without them.  So it was – the relationship was extremely 
strained post that letter of regret.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And what were you concerns around 
this now strained relationship with Neotel in view of the 2007 MSA?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair well of particular concern there was a number of concerns.  One 
was service delivery because they do not really have an incentive to 
meet the Service Level Agreements at that point.  I do not think the 
service credits were adequate to – to mitigate that risk.  The second 
10 
concern that I had is pricing.  So prior to us concluding the process we 
signed an extension with Neotel and I think it was a two or three m onth 
extension.  We can check from October – 31 October.  So 1 November 
to 31 December and in that extension we managed to get Neotel to 
commit that should there be further extensions that the price would 
reduce.  The price at that point Chair – if memory services – was R42.3 
million a month.  Post this letter of regret that was issued to Neotel 
they wrote back to us stating that the fee going forward will be R58 
million a month.  So it increased with – well – R15/16-odd million 
immediately.  We then met wi th Neotel and managed to – well – 
20 
convince them that that is madness and we eventually settled with no 
negotiating power on 50 million.  So the price went from 42.3 – if I 
recall correctly – to 50 million within a month for the remainder of the 
contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I get the impression that you did not think that there 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 84 of 176 
 
was justification for this increase?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Absolutely not Chair.  It was exactly the same services they were 
providing.  They were cross because they lost this tender. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and Transnet did not have much of a choice as 
you saw the position?  In other words you did not think Transnet could 
say well we are not paying one cent more than what we have been 
paying you? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair we could.  The risk is that they switch off our network and …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is what I am saying that …  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You would run the risk of something much – much 
more … 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  And 
Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you were in a corner?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  We 
were absolutely in a corner Chair and I think just for context Transnet 
20 
at that point in time – if I am not mistaken – was a billion Rand a week 
organisation.  So if you switch off the network your rails or your trains, 
your ports are heavily impacted as well as safety and a number of other 
things.  So it is really not a position y ou wanted to be in.  So we had no 
negotiating power. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 85 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so in a way even if they had not come down from 
58 million you might have had to just pay.  Is that – is that how bad the 
situation was? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is how bad it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How vulnerable Transnet?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Absolutely Chair and we will talk about it …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN: 
 A 
10 
little bit later when we get to the asset buyback as well.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay thank you.  You were just lucky that they 
were able to come down about half …  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the increase they had demanded?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN: 
 
I 
think the team still had good relationships at a lower level Chair.  So I 
think we managed to …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
20 
Negotiate it down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Just to put it into context can you 
give some more detail as to what exactly it would mean for Transnet’s 
operations if Neotel decided to pull the plug?  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 86 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair so like I tried to explain the ports would be heavily impacted.  
They - from what I recall Transnet portal terminals had a system called 
NAVIS which was heavily reliant on the – the low latency network  from 
what I recall.  The trains would be – the communication systems 
although Transnet Freight Rail still had a sort of a separate system.  
The trail operations would have been heavily impacted as well from 
what I understood from the operations and more technical people.  So it 
would have been catastrophic dare I say.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So Transnet would not have been 
10 
able to deliver the service that it does if Neotel pulled the plug?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Absolutely not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But this vulnerable position in which Transnet found 
itself now at that time when it had – it agreed to effecting an increase 
and putting the amount at R50 million or so per month.  It was per 
month hey? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN: 
 
I 
beg your pardon Chair.  It was?  
CHAIRPERSON:  The increase of the price it went up to 50 million?  
20 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that was per month? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 87 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  That was a – a result really in – in the final 
analysis to Transnet having sold its network to – to Neotel? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That was a result of that decision Chair yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It put itself in a very vulnerable position?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did you raise your concerns with the 
current state of play or the then current state of play in relation to the 
10 
Neotel having this hold over Transnet in context of the MSA coming to 
an end? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair I think even before we went to market the ICT Management Team 
raised our concerns that we were in an impossible negotiating position 
and that is why we recommended in one of our first recommendations 
that we potentially not go to market but we extend this contract with 
Neotel because we were of the view that that would give us the ability 
to potentially buyback these assets should we commit more revenue to 
them over a period of time.  I think the Board did not necessarily agree 
20 
with that positon and then that is why we went to market and I think 
this turnaround of the decision then again exacerbated that problem 
because now you had your – Neotel’s back against the wall and they – 
they were - ja – angry. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At page 11 of your statement 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 88 of 176 
 
paragraph 38 you were informed that it was pursuant to discussions 
between Anoj Singh and Sunil Joshi who was Neotel’s CEO at the time.  
Neotel agreed to continue with its s ervices.  Is that correct/ 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct Chair.  So upon the – if I recall the timing here was the 
– we were informed at this point that we were not going to issue the 
letter of intent to T-Systems and the letter – I beg your pardon – the 
letter of intent to Neotel and/or the letter of regret.  So this was really 
the – the – let me just pause for a second.  This was when procurement 
informed me that they were not issuing those letters as approved by 
10 
Ms Chetty and like I said that was 31  October 2013 – if memory serves 
– which meant that from tomorrow we are out of contract.  Any 
expenditure would potentially be irregular and we have a proper service 
delivery risk.  I then raised it with Messieurs  Pita and Singh after he 
communicated to me that Mr  Molefe would like to review the documents 
upon his return to which Mr Singh replied saying that he has personally 
discussed it with Mr  Joshi and that Neotel will continue delivering 
service to Transnet. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  At paragraph 9 you 
document a series of events. 
20 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Paragraph 39 page 11 of your 
statement.  Can you take the Chair through these particular series of 
events which occurred during December 2013? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 89 of 176 
 
Sure advocate.  Chair so what occurred is that we provided Neotel with 
a 12 month extension.  I think I mentioned and covered the price 
increase from 42.3 to 58 a nd then negotiated down to R50 million and 
in that acceptance letter from Neotel they indicated that there was 
quite a lot of equipment that was end of life and should that equipment 
fail they cannot guarantee our Service Level Agreements anymore.  So 
attached to correspondence they requested that we pretty much procure 
– if I recall – R69 million worth of Cisco equipment then and there in 
order for them to accept the 12 month extension which was issued in 
December. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So is it correctly understood that 
Neotel then had two holds over Transnet?  On the one it was in relation 
to the MSA that was about to reach an end in terms of which they also 
then held ownership of assets that was coming to an end but they could 
not then guarantee the service unless you had negotiated terms and 
conditions in relation to that. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is – that is – that is factual Chair and you could argue that they 
were in a strong legal position should they wanted to tak e us to court 
over this decision as well. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  You mentioned Cisco equipment.  Is 
this then – this may then be an appropriate time for you to unpack the 
involvement of Cisco …?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Sure. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 90 of 176 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And its engagements with Transnet 
for the new – new equipment? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  Ja.  
So Chair Transnet’s network that the tech involves much more technical 
person or people will explain to you that you introduce unnecessary risk 
into your network if you have multiple OEM providers due to 
compatibility.  So Cisco was the preferred provider for – for Transnet on 
the Transnet network but like we mentioned before any Cisco 
equipment had to be procured v ia Neotel and I think we did also touch 
on it but due to the fact that we have overturned – we – Mr Molefe has 
10 
overturned the tender from Neotel to Transnet – ag – to T-Systems that 
meant that we had to pull the transition – well we were going through a 
transition now and we had to try and meet the timeline and we then had 
a meeting with all the parties being Cisco, T-Systems, Neotel and 
Transnet management and said well okay so we have got to pull the 
trigger on this transition.  How do we go about doing i t?  Neotel then 
raised with us that apart from this equipment that we procured – the 69-
odd million and we can just check the value – that we procure it as part 
of that 12 month extension.  A lot of other equipment in the ports or in 
the campuses were also reaching end of life and support and that is 
20 
why we decided to acquire that equipment through Neotel but again like 
I mentioned earlier that that equipment would be owned by Transnet 
because our concerns were the campuses and all this equipment was in 
the campuses. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  But it is – is it correct that there 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 91 of 176 
 
were two Cisco equipment purchases/  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The one during 2013 and the one 
during 2014? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  Yes 
it is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And the one you speak of now is 
which one? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN: 
 
I 
10 
actually spoke of both.  So the 2013 one was an invoice attached to the  
12 month extension in which Neotel had a number of terms including 
the R50 million monthly fee and they also accepted the outcome of the 
tender which they signed.  Linked to that was an invoice saying please 
sign the – place the following order with us in  an order for us to – to 
guarantee your service levels.  That was the first purchase.  
Subsequent to that when we started negotiating with T-Systems we 
realised this transition was a problem from a timing perspective and 
they then informed us that there is  significant other equipment that we 
need to replace in a period of time due to the transition and the 
20 
ownership discussion we wanted to pull that forward and decided to buy 
it pretty much then and there. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  We will unpack the Cisco 
transaction a bit later as it is set out in your statement.  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 92 of 176 
 
Sure. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Is it correct that Neotel finally 
accepted the outcome of the tender process and the award of the 
tender to T-Systems? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  It is 
correct.  In the same letter that I was just referring to.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If you could now look at page 12 of 
your statement.  Chair paragraphs 41 to 44 on page 13 is evidence  that 
has already been placed before this Commission by Mr  Volmink.  He 
talks specifically to the reversal of the decision to award the tender to 
10 
T-Systems and in view of this evidence already been placed before the 
Commission we do not intend to deal with  much detail in relation to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine.  The part which I think was not 
said before which may have some significance in the context of – of 
Mr Singh’s role or alleged role is that in paragraph 41 it is said that if 
Mr van der Westhuizen remembers well Mr  Singh did request that an 
opinion be obtained on the process and reversal of the award by 
Mr Molefe from senior counsel. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we – I did hear that a legal opinion was 
20 
obtained but I do not remember that I heard that – that initiative may 
have come from Mr Singh. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  No problem Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Mr van der Westhuizen …  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 93 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I – I take note that you say as far as you recall?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN: 
 
I 
was – my recollection I think … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN: 
 
I 
cannot recall if it was an email or a discussion but I seem to recall that 
Mr Singh requested … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That we get the opinion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In paragraph 45 you address your 
resignation that you submit to Transnet on 30  September 2014.  Can 
you please extrapolate the events leading up to this resignation and the 
resignation itself? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Sure.  I think like I mentioned before post that meeting I decided to put 
20 
my CV in the market so to speak.  I was then approached by a – a 
company in South Africa and went through multiple interviews etcetera 
and they offered me employment if I recall somewher e in September.  
So I then formally resigned from the 30 t h – from Transnet on 
30 September 2014.  Subsequent to – and maybe just some context as 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 94 of 176 
 
well.  During that period there was quite a lot of Transnet ICT 
resources of the management who resigned.  I th ink there were three of 
us in the matter of a two week span and the one crucial one was 
Mr Yusuf Loonat who was our Head of Infrastructure and he was very  
involved in the technical scheme stream of these negotiations.  I think 
Mr Singh and Dr Motwani then had – I do not know if they had a 
conversation – but they – we had a conversation whether I would be 
willing to stay on at Transnet until the end of the year and see this 
contract through.  I then engaged with my new employer who did not 
have a particular problem.  My concern however was that I was going to 
10 
earn more at my new employer and the remuneration structure was also 
much better so I then indicated to Dr  Motwani and Mr Singh that I would 
be willing.  I thought it was just fair to be honest that we w ere three 
months from concluding this agreement and there was not anyone else 
left and Neotel was very opportunistic when it came to negotiations.  So 
I thought – I felt obliged to see this through as long as they remunerate 
me accordingly to my new employer. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Was it necessary for you to receive 
more money to stay? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  It 
20 
probably was not but they did not necessarily know that.  I would have 
seen it through to be honest without addition al remuneration. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They needed you? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
They (intervenes). 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 95 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  They needed you? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN: 
 
I 
knew very well about vulnerability.  I learnt it throu gh this process 
Chair.  So absolutely they needed me like we needed Neotel.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did you receive any payment of a 
bonus … 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  I … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  As part of your agreement to stay?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN: 
 
I 
10 
did. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Please give details in relation to 
that. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Sure.  I cannot recall the exact amount Cha ir.  I think it was R350  000 
paid through the Transnet payroll and tax deducted ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And why was this bonus paid to you?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN: 
 
I 
think partially - like the Chair stated – because they needed me and 
also Transnet’s incentive structure – so you had something called an 
20 
LTI or a Long Term Incentive that would normally pay out.  From what I 
recall roughly in June which was not Transnet – Transnet’s year end 
was March – if I recall.  So they wo uld pay that out in June – because I 
was leaving earlier and now I would not get that Long Term Incentive 
and I would lose incentive from my new employer because I joined 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 96 of 176 
 
later.  So that was what I put forward to them.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If we can then move on to the 2014 
MSA negotiations and the Asset Buyback Agreement which begins at 
page 13 of your statement.  It is understood that there were two 
streams of negotiation teams that were involved in the 2014 MSA 
negotiations and Asset Buyback Agreeme nt.  Please provide the detail 
of how these negotiation teams were constituted and engaged with 
each other. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Sure.  Chair I think just to settle the timeline sort of.  I think we 
10 
referred to the evidence by  Mr Volmink which included that the decision 
was now changed back to Neotel.  So now we have started negotiations 
with Neotel and T-Systems was no longer the preferred bidder which 
was evidenced before like you mentioned by Mr  Volmink, right?  So now 
we are negotiating with Neotel and it was structured.  There were quite 
a few people involved.  There were two streams – a commercial stream 
that mainly looked after the Master Services Agreement or the MSA as 
well as all the terms and conditions linked to that  and there was a 
technical stream that looked at all the service towers, voice services, 
WAN or Wide Area Network, Local Area Network or LAN and so on and 
20 
so forth. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Can I ask you to please slow down?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  I … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  I am struggling to follow you. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 97 of 176 
 
Apologies advocate apologies Chair.  So the two streams were 
structured like that and we met at a lawyer’s office in Sandto n for quite 
a few months in which we fleshed out this Master Services Agreement.  
The … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Which team is – you say that there 
were two teams – a commercial team and a technical team.  Which 
team were you involved in and what was role  in that team? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  So 
Chair I led the commercial stream and there were - involvement was 
from Transnet Procurement who provided oversight of the process.  
10 
Transnet Supplier Development – we had an external leg al, we had 
Gartner in the session and then obviously a lot of people from Neotel.  
I think we had an internal legal representative as well and the technical 
stream was led by Yusuf Loonat if I recall correctly again with various 
subject matters experts included in that – in that stream. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did the commercial team and the 
technical team engage with each other in the process of the MSA 
development? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  We 
– we did Chair because we had to pu ll the requirements together with 
20 
the pricing and make sure that the terms of the MSA supports the – the 
services and the service styles were attached to the Master Services 
Agreement.  So yes we had to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  Thank you.  Yes we may proceed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you.  So notwithstanding the 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 98 of 176 
 
fact that you were involved in the – you were leading the commercial 
stream you were quite familiar as to what was happening in the 
technical 
stream 
as 
well 
based 
on 
your 
engagement 
with 
Mr Yusuf Loonat? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  At a 
high level Chair yes.  The technicalities and the detail I was not that 
closed to but at a high lever we knew what the progress was and what 
some of the stumbling blocks were.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  How exactly would you describe your 
involvement in this particular process?  
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair I was extremely involved because whenever anyone from 
Transnet needed feedback as an example Mr  Singh on the process or 
Dr Motwani it would most likely have been me that they contacted or 
potentially Yusuf Loonat but mostly me.  So I was heavily involved and 
knew what was happening in this process.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Did you attend all meetings in 
relation to this process? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Probably not all Chair but absolutely most of them.  
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Were you – were you aware of the 
key role players and stakeholders involved in this process?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN: 
 
I 
was. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Would it have been possible for you 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 99 of 176 
 
to have not known of any key role player in the process?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN: 
 
I 
cannot see how that would have been possible Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Why? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  So I 
think some factors to consider.  Like I said I was pretty much in every 
single meeting bar maybe a few and the Master Services Agreement 
was managed by our external legal consultant who owned that 
document and ensured that nothing changed in the document that the 
parties did not agree to.  So any changes would have had to go through 
10 
the sessions and through our external legal consultant.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So you would have been aware of all 
of the material terms of the agreement?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  Yes 
I would. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Now just to put it into context based 
on the evidence that you have already given th e background to this 
particular agreement is that Transnet sold its subsidiary Transtel as a 
going concern to Neotel and that was about when the 2007 MSA was 
concluded? 
20 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And this particular sale included 
most of Transnet network equipment and infrastructure?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 100 of 176 
 
That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  It was after the sale that Transnet 
found itself in a difficult situation where its IT Network was owned and 
managed by a service provider – external service provider – being 
Neotel? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And it was in the context of this 
background that it was now of paramount importance that Transnet 
needed to ensure it regained ownership of its IT Network …  
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  that 
is … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And infrastructure? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So during your negotiations with 
Neotel in relation to this 2014 MSA Agreement how would you describe 
the negotiations embarked upon between the parties?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN: 
 
I 
would describe it as extremely difficult I suppose Chair.  Neotel were – 
20 
were tough.  They had a number of negotiators that did not take no for 
an answer and I think like we discussed before we did not have a whole 
lot of aces up our sleeves.  We were playing poker with an open card 
deck.  They knew we could not bluff because they knew exactly what 
cards we had because they owned the network.  So it was extremely 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 101 of 176 
 
difficult. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Did you reach a deadlock at all?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  We 
did. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   If I could take you to page 14 of 
your statement, paragraph 49.4, you document some of the main issues 
that founded the deadlock reached.  Could you take the Chair through 
some of these points please? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair so I don’t want to bore you with all of them, unless you want me 
10 
to but I think the main items were the pricing of the transition or – that 
we touched on earlier as well as the asset b uy-back. So as part of this 
negotiation Neotel indicated that they would now be willing to sell the 
assets that was ceded to the bank before, to Transnet as part – and we 
tried to link the two so that we don’t find ourselves in a similar situation 
so it was crucial to us that we link the transactions and that we don’t 
sign a Masters Services Agreement without the asset buy -back 
agreement.  Those were two of the issues, there were also pair and 
company guarantee, we were still – quite a few more detailed iss ues 
but those were the crux of the deadlock if you will.  
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   Okay not to suggest that your offer 
to not bore the Chair, you still stand by the points documented in 
paragraph 49.4.1 to 49.4.75 is that correct.   
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    I 
do Chair, I do. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 102 of 176 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :    A meeting was held on the 8 t h of 
December 2014 and I’m now referring to paragraph 51 of your 
statement, are you aware of this meeting and how did you become 
aware of this meeting?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Chair I am aware of this meeting in the lead up to this – me being a 
witness and providing evidence the investigator shared information with 
me that I suspect they received from the Neotel servers whic h indicated 
that there appeared to have been a meeting between Mr Singh and Mr 
Francois van der Merwe who was the Account Executive or he was in 
10 
charge of strategic customers for Neotel and it appeared that this 
meeting was held at Umhlanga in December 201 4.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Was it normal protocol for the CFO 
to meet directly with the supplier?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Chair although we don’t have documented protocols in this regard it 
was not normal to me that Mr Singh, not being that involved in the 
process would need to meet with the suppliers’ Account Executive, so it 
wasn’t normal protocol, although not documented, yes.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Are you aware of a meeting that 
20 
happened then on the 11 t h of December 2014 which is about three days 
later? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Yes, I am Chair, I attended that meeting.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Where did this meeting take place?  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 103 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
The meeting occurred at the Slow-Lounge in Sandton. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     And who all was present at this 
meeting? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
The attendees at the meeting was Mr Sunil Joshi the MD of Neotel, Mr 
Francois van der Merwe the Strategic Customer Account Executive in 
Transnet’s case, it was Anoj Singh the Transnet Group CFO and myself.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     So just to clarify how many 
representatives were there from Neotel?  
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:    
Two. 
ADV 
VERUSCHKA 
SEPTEMBER : 
 
 
 
 
That 
being 
Sunil 
Joshi…(intervention)  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
And Francois van der Merwe.    
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Thank you and on Transnet’s side 
your team included how many? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Two, myself and Mr Anoj Singh. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Thank you.  What exactly 
transpired at this meeting?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Chair from what I recall is  we went through the list of items that I 
referred to the page prior and we, sort of, knocked them off the 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 104 of 176 
 
checklist one by one and agreed what would be done around most of 
that.  When it came to the pricing of the transition as well as the asset 
buy-back Mr Singh and Mr Joshi said that they will decide and discuss 
that further so they then – I can’t recall if they went into a Boardroom 
or they came out of a Boardroom but they separated themselves from 
myself and Mr van der Merwe and they discussed the pric ing from what 
I can recall on those two transactions, if you will.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Away from everybody else?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:     Either in an adjacent room or just outside of the 
meeting? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
That’s correct Chair, so it wasn’t the four of us anymore, Francois and 
myself stayed – Mr van der Merwe and myself stayed wherever we 
were, they separated themselves and they had a meeting just between 
the two of them, a private meeting to finalise the pricing.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Was pricing the biggest issue 
between the parties? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    In 
20 
my mind Chair yes it was. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     So, Mr Anoj Singh and Mr Sunil 
Joshi leave the room where you and the other gentleman are in, they 
have a private discussion and they return?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 105 of 176 
 
That’s correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Are you informed about what 
happened in the private discussion?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Chair at some point we must have been although I can’t clearly recall 
the conversation but that was – as the advocate mentioned on the 8 t h of 
December and we subsequently finalised the Master Service Agreement 
with the pricing on – was it the 13 t h of December, so at some point Mr 
Singh needed to give me feedback, that go ahead and get this 
agreement done and this is the pricing that we’ve agreed.  
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     At paragraph 54 of your statement 
you inform that no feedback was provided to you after the meeting 
between Singh and Joshi but at some point during the 11 t h or 12 t h of 
December you must have been instructed to meet on the 13 t h of 
December to finalise the MSA. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
That’s correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Did you in fact, meet on the 13 t h of 
December 2014? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
20 
We did Chair, if I recall correctly, it w as a Saturday and we met at the 
Neotel’s offices to finalise the Master Services Agreement.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     And who was present at that 
meeting? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 106 of 176 
 
Chair multiple people but  Mr Joshi, myself I  think Mr Altaf Qadri who 
was one of the negotiators from Neotel, Mr van der Merwe wasn’t there 
I think he had already left for holiday at that stage and then I think it 
was myself and our external legal consultant who, like I said, owned 
this MSA, you know we couldn’t get any takers on Saturday.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Had you prepared any documents 
for this meeting? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
We didn’t prepare any additional documents, the documents, like I said, 
would have been owned by our external legal consultant and she would 
10 
have had all the documents there on her computer.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Differently stated did you present 
any document at this meeting?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
The MSA, our external legal consultant would have presented there for 
finalisation and printing for signature later.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     So being involved in this entire 
negotiation…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    I’m sorry, did you mean – did you mean to ask 
whether he made any presentation or did you mean whether they gave 
20 
the other people some documents…(intervention).  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   (Indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Which one did you mean? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Presented. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Whether they made a presentation?  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 107 of 176 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay Is your answer valid if that’s the 
understanding if she was asking whether you made a presentation at 
the meeting? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHU IZEN:    
We basically just pulled up the Master Services Agreement and made 
final adjustments to them as agreed in the session between Mr Singh 
and Mr Joshi and myself and Mr van der Merwe, those two sessions.  
CHAIRPERSON:     And talked to the document an d gave them copies 
or not necessarily? 
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Chair if I recall correctly, at that stage it was a day before I was leaving 
Transnet so I think I’ve already handed in my laptop so I think we sent 
the documents to Mr Joshi, if I recall, who then printed a set of 
documents which I presented to Mr Singh on that day for final 
signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     So, the agreement was then in 
final form? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBU S VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
20 
That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     You said that, that was your last 
day of employment at Transnet?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
That’s correct. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 108 of 176 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     And this was on the 13 t h of 
December 2014? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Yes so I – I can’t recall technically I was still employed up until 31 
December but that was the last day I attended and I was on leave 
thereafter, so that was the last line of business if you will, that I 
executed on behalf of Transnet. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Just going back to your 
involvement in this particular process, you mention that you were 
involved in all of the formal negotiations relating to this transaction, 
10 
were you involved in all of the informal discussions on it as well?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    So 
Chair I believe I was a part – well I don’t know what I don’t know but 
the only two informal sessions that I’m aware of that I wasn’t i nvolved 
in was the apparent meeting between Mr van der Merwe and Mr Singh 
in Umhlanga and the separation meeting at the Slow -Lounge where Mr 
Joshi and Mr Singh finalised the pricing, from what I recall.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Okay to summarise, and please 
correct me if I’m wrong, to summarise you led the commercial stream of 
the negotiation team? 
20 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Yusuf Loonat led the technical 
stream of the negotiation team?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 109 of 176 
 
That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     You had your external lawyer who 
was the master of the MSA?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
That’s correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     The commercial stream and the 
technical stream engaged with each other to keep each other abreast of 
the regular updates. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Yes, we did Chair. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     You were aware of all of the 
changes to the MSA? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    I 
believe I had to be Chair since our external legal consultant owned that 
document and would have checked any changes with me.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Would it then be a fair statement to 
say that the negotiations and the detail of those negotiations on paper 
was always present to your mind?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    I 
would say that’s a fair statement Chair.  
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     And so you were fully aware of the 
negotiations and the outcome of those negotiations as documented in 
the final MSA which you presented for signature on the 13 t h of 
December 2014. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :   I 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 110 of 176 
 
believe so yes.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     Now who is Homix? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :    
Chair so the first time I heard the name Homix I think was five or six 
months after I left the employ of Transnet and I read about a company 
called Homix and if I recall it was Amagunganis release in the papers.  
I also had a gentleman, now that I think of it, Mr Stefaans Brummer 
from the Sunday Times phoning me a day or two before that article was 
released asking me if I was willing to talk to him, which I said I was if 
Transnet was willing to release me from confidentiality but that’s the 
10 
first time I heard the name Homix.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     Did you encounter – not to take 
away from your evidence that, that was the first time you heard of the 
name Homix, just for the avoidance of doubt, did you come across the 
name Homix at all during the 2014 MSA and buy -back agreement 
negotiations? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :   I 
did not.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     If I could take you then – before I 
do take you to a paragraph, I’m not sure if my time is correct.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Well we are six minutes to, if we can we can 
exhaust this six minutes and then take the lunch break but if it’s more 
convenient to continue after lunch, that’s fine.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:     Could I beg an indulgence just to 
clarify certain aspects before we get into this detail.  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 111 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja you want to do that after lunch or now.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :     I beg the indulgence to have the 
lunch break – the long adjournment now. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Alright we take it now. That’s fine.  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes I am thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you may proceed. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Mr Van Der Westhuizen before the 
10 
adjournment you were informing the Chair about an entity called Homix.  
It was your evidence that during your time at Transnet you had not 
encountered the entity called Homix at all, is that correct?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I can take you to Exhibit bundle 
BB7[b] and ask you to please turn to page 519.  Before you Mr Van Der 
Westhuizen is a letter on what appears to be a Homix letterhead and 
the letter is dated 12 December 2014.  It is addressed by Mr Khan of 
Homix to Mr Sunil Joshi who is represented as the MD and CEO of 
20 
Neotel PTY LTD.  For the record this particular letter states the 
following in paragraph 1. 
“This letter serves to confirm today’s engagement w ith 
Neotel pertaining to their master services agreement and 
the related asset sale negotiation with Transnet SOC.  The 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 112 of 176 
 
talks have reached an impasse and Neotel wishes to 
engage the services of Homix to analyse both entities 
requirements to find a workable  solution.  The work is to 
be carried out in a pure risk basis and Homix shall not bill 
for any time and material nor any out of pocket expense.  
If successful Neotel shall pay Homix  
1. For the assets sale a full and final once off fee it is 
written actually once of presumably a spelling error 
once off fee of R25 million payable 30 days after 
signature. 
10 
2. For the master services agreement a fee of 2% of the 
value of the contract currently at R1.8 billion.  
3. These fees are excluding VAT.  
These fees are success fee  commissions’ payable because 
of the assistance and expertise provided by Homix 
enabling Neotel to close these two deals that are currently 
agreed to be lost business as confirmed by both Neotel 
and Transnet.” 
And the last paragraph: 
“Please concur the above together with the success 
20 
fee structure where the latter shall become binding 
on Neotel.” 
Is it correct that this particular letter deals with the very 2014 MSA and 
buy back agreement that you were integrally involved in?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  It 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 113 of 176 
 
does Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And by the date of this letter which is 
12 December 2014 how does that date compare to the meeting that you 
had at the Neotel offices at which the final MSA agreement was 
presented for signature?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair so this letter was issued it appears the day before we finalised 
the Master Services Agreement and I supplied that document to Mr 
Singh.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And notwithstanding what is stated  in 
10 
this letter did you have any engagement with a company called Homix 
on – in relation to Neotel? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
None whatsoever Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether anybody from Transnet engage 
– was in any way engaged with or this entity?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  Not 
to my knowledge Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Around that time? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  No 
20 
not to my knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  What are the chanc es that you would 
have known if there had been anybody of significance in terms of 
position who would have been engaged?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 114 of 176 
 
Chair I think the chances would have been fairly good since I led this 
process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  And 
there is a couple of items that is peculiar in this document.  Like I said 
number 1 the date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is the day before.  So I question what value they could have added 
in a day? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  The 
second item is that they mentioned that the talks reached an impasse 
and further in the document they state both parties c onfirmed lost 
business.  I mean I think we have gone through the detail.  There is 
absolutely no way that Transnet would not have signed this Master 
Services Agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Because we did not have an alternative. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So 
– and I question who at Transnet would have given that message that 
we have reached an impasse and we cannot go any further to that I 
also find quite peculiar. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 115 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  Ja 
and then the fees I – for a day’s worth of work I – is quite exorbitant 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Can I then ask you to turn to page 
494 of the same bundle please?  Do you have any personal knowledge 
of this document? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  I 
did not Chair until the investigators supplied me with the document.  
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Please identify this document – the 
nature of this document? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair it appears to be a contract between Neotel and Homix for the 
supply of certain consulting services.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUI ZEN:  And 
.. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I can ask you to turn to the next 
page which is page 495.  Is it correct that at paragraph 1.2.4 the 
20 
commencement date which would be the commencement date of this 
particular agreement means 12 December 2014?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And is it correct that that is the same 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 116 of 176 
 
date of the document we have just previously referred to which was the 
Homix letter to Mr Sunil Joshi?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct it is the same date.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I can then ask you to turn to page 
496 at which paragraph 4 documents consultancy services.  As a short 
paragraph the 4.1 reads: 
“That the consultant underta kes to facilitate the 
successful conclusion of the assets sale referred to 
in the Master Services Agreement concluded between 
10 
Neotel and Transnet SOC Limited.”  
4.2 
“For the purposes of this agreement customer means 
Transnet SOC Limited project means the su ccessful 
conclusion and signature of the assets sale forming 
part of the MSA concluded between Neotel and 
Transnet SOC Limited.”  
And on the next page: 
“Neotel representative means Francois Van Der 
Merwe.” 
20 
Do you have any observation that you can make in re lation to the 
services that were contracted in this agreement?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  The 
agreement seems to be a repetition pretty much of that letter.  So my 
commentary would be very similar Chair that an agreement signed 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 117 of 176 
 
between the parties on 12 December to get to Transnet and Neotel to 
agree to a R1.8 billion contract that we have been negotiating for 
months on end.  I fail to understand what value Homix could possibly 
have added. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  The word asset sale in paragraph 4.1 
on page 496 of this document in your understanding what would asset 
sale refer to? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair my understanding it would refer to the buyback of assets that we 
have discussed at length this morning as well.   
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And that is the very buyback – the 
asset buyback sorry which forms part of the 2014 MSA agreement that 
you were involved in negotiating?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can then take you to page 497 
paragraph 6.  Paragraph 6.1 documents the detail of – not 6.1 sorry.  
Paragraph 6 documents the detail of fees that would be payable in 
relation to the services that are contracted under this agreement.  To 
understand the depth of the consequence of this agreement it is 
20 
necessary that we deal with the detail of fees that were in fact 
contracted under this agreement.  At paragraph 6.1.1 it records:  
“That for the successful implementation and finalisation o f an 
operational agreement relating to the future maintenance, insurance 
and operating of the assets bought by Transnet from Neotel a full and 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 118 of 176 
 
once off fee – once of fee of R25 million payable 30 days after 
signature of the operational agreement between Ne otel and Transnet 
SOC Limited currently anticipated for 18 March 2015 or any other later 
date agreed by the Neotel and Transnet SOC Limited.  The fees 
contemplated in 6.1 above are excluding VAT.”  
If we can pause there for a second?  Are you aware of what operational 
agreement between Neotel and Transnet is referred to in paragraph – in 
the paragraph that has just been read?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair my only assumption could be that it has to be the Master 
10 
Services Agreement between Transnet and Neotel. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And the R25 million that is the once 
off fee in once again consistent with the letter of Homix sent to Mr 
Sunil Joshi dated 12 December 2014, is that correct?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTH UIZEN:  It 
appears that way Chair yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  At paragraph 6.3 on page 498 the 
agreement according to this contract continues to record that clause 6 
is a – at – pardon me – towards the – let me just read the full one. 
“Notably the fees referred to above in this clause 6 
20 
is success fee commission payable because of the 
assistance and expertise provided by consultant 
enabling Neotel to successfully close the project 
which project is currently agreed to be lost business 
as confirmed by both Neotel and Transnet SOC 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 119 of 176 
 
Limited.” 
Can you please…  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am trying to look where you are reading at page 
498. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  At paragraph 6.3 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Do you have any comment to that Mr 
Van Der Westhuizen? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair again I would like to understand who from Transnet they would 
10 
have engaged because they do state that we concurred that this was 
lost business and like I have stated befor e Transnet did not have an 
option but to contract with Neotel at this stage.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But did you already say that to the extent that they 
and now I am talking about Homix talk about a business that was lost 
that this was a lost business as confirmed  by both Neotel and Transnet 
SOC Limited.   
1. What is your comment on the concept of a lost business number 
1. 
2. And the question of whether this had been confirmed to be the 
20 
position by Transnet as well?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair so it appears that these documents relate to the Master Services 
Agreement and the asset buyback between Transnet and Neotel.  Now I 
mean lost business in my mind would imply that the parties are not able 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 120 of 176 
 
to reach agreement and both parties have confirme d we are not going 
to get there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  We 
are going to walk away. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is lost business. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  At 
10 
least my interpretation thereof. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Like I have articulated before that was not an option for Transnet.  We 
could not.  We were fully dependent.  We w ere a captive client. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So 
that is why it is also strange I think they have taken a bit of poetic 
licence here to be blunt in stating that this was confirmed by both 
Neotel and Transnet.  Like I said it would have been nonsensical for 
20 
anyone from Transnet to confirm that this is lost business.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So is your evidence that: 
1. You never had any engagement with Homix and therefore never 
said to them this was lost business?  
2. You do not believe anybody from Transnet could genuinely have 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 121 of 176 
 
said this was a lost business in the light of what you have 
already said namely Transnet could not afford not to reach 
agreement with Neotel on this issue.  As I understand your 
evidence because of the co nsequences that would follow. 
3. Even if there was somebody from Transnet who unbeknown to 
you said to Homix this is lost business do you say that they could 
not have believed that to be true?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair I would say correct on all three points yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Important to the date that is 
mentioned in the next sub-paragraph 6.4 reads: 
“That for the avoidance for doubt whatsoever 
satisfactory performance of a consultancy services 
shall be evidenced by the following:”  
6.4.1 
“Successful 
conclusion 
and 
signature 
of 
an 
agreement given effect to the sale of assets as 
contemplated in the Master Services Agreement 
concluded between Neotel and Transnet SOC on or 
20 
before 19 December 2014” 
And 6.4.2 
“Confirmation and agreement of related asset sale 
and the conclusion of an operational agreement in 
this regard by no later than 18 March 2015.”  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 122 of 176 
 
Are you aware of when the MSA was finally signed?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DE R WESTHUIZEN:  I 
am Chair.  The final Master Services Agreement was signed by 
Transnet on the 15 December 2014 and counter signed by Neotel on the 
19 December 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it 15 December 2014 for Transnet and 19 for 
Neotel – 19 December 2014? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  In effect the successful conclusion is 
relative to the date of the MSA which was in fact finally signed on the 
19 December 2014? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And if I could then ask you …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I am looking for Transnet’s signature?  I 
see Neotel’s one at 504 is that the right page for that?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  No Chair 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is not. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  This is an agreement between Neotel 
and Homix. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ja but I am having mine both.  This agreement 
relates to the one that he is talking about?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 123 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so the other one was signed on different dates 
by Transnet and Neotel.  Transnet 14 December 2014, Neotel 19 
December 2014.  Then that is what you will still be coming to in due 
course, this one?  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Now may be a prudent time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  To hand up the …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  MSA that was concluded.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But the one that for Transnet and Neotel is – are you 
10 
going to that one or have we dealt with that one?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Between … 
CHAIRPERSON:  For Transnet and Neotel?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  That is the agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The agreement?  That is what you are coming to?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  I am wanting to hand up now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  In fact Chair this is actually a 
supplementary statement which accounts for different errors in the 
original statement.  But importantly it attaches a copy of the 2014 MSA 
20 
agreement that this witness is now referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The lever arch file containing the supplementary 
statement of Mr Van Der Westhuizen the witness currently on the 
witness stand will be marked Exhibit BB7[c].  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  As it pleases Chair. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 124 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  In answer to your question Chair if 
we could turn to page 78 of the bundle and a copy will be handed to the 
witness now.   
CHAIRPERSON:  170? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  178. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Mr Van Der Westhuizen through you 
this is in fact the signature page for the 2014 SMA and buyback 
agreement. 
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And are these the dates that you 
informed in your evidence which was that Transnet signed this 
agreement on the 15 December 2014 and the 19 December 2014 this 
agreement was signed by Neotel?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think when I was clarifying the dates with you I said 
14 December.  I see here it is 15 December so…  
20 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  No 
it is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might not have heard that I got the date wrong.  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  Ja I 
thought you said 15 December Chair.  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 125 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  Yes 
it is the 15h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The correct date is 15?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  If we can then whilst still in this 
supplementary bundle if I could ask you to go to page 56.  Paragraph 
25.  Is it correct that this agreement regulates at least the asset take 
10 
back which we have been referring to as t he asset buyback? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  It 
does Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And so in effect on the very day that 
the MSA was signed by the contracting parties of Transnet and Neotel 
this very agreement between Homix and N eotel was similarly signed?  
No I am getting my dates wrong. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  Yes 
so Chair I think one of the success factors.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Sorry it is 2015. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN  DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Refers to the same date yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Sorry I am getting my dates wrong.  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 126 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you want to say is it correct that on the day on 
which one of the parties or rather Neotel signed the Maste r Services 
Agreement with Transnet namely the 19 December is the same day on 
which it signed an agreement with Homix?  If you look at the other 
agreement. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair I think…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Of Homix and – or did I mix something – did I mix up 
something as well?  Did not Homix  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Did Homix not and Neotel or 
rather – ja did one of the parties between Homix and Neotel not sign 
the agreement between Homix and Neotel on the 19 December 2014?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair no so the correspondence between them, the letter and the 
document if I am not mistaken was on the 12 December the day before 
we finalised the Master Serv ices Agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  It is 
peculiar that the success factor in this document between them refers 
20 
exactly to the date when the MSA was actually signed.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES J OCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  And 
I think we will get to it in a second but this document was actually 
signed – the contract between Neotel and Homix was actually signed in 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 127 of 176 
 
February of 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  A 
month or two after the conclusion of the MSA but the commencement 
date in the agreement is 12 December 2014.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja take it further. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  So in the – in the result the very 
agreement between Homix and Neotel was signed long after the MSA 
10 
that that agreement sought to regulate was in fact signed?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to make sure.  That I have got this – now 
the agreement between Homix and Neotel is at 494 is that right?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  The first agreement Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  The first agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The first – well that is … 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  We will still get to the next one.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is 19 February not 19 December.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is the – about two months later?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WE STHUIZEN:  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 128 of 176 
 
That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is the point you were making?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  Yes 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For some reason I thought that it was 19 December.  
And then if you go back to that letter of 12 December – or before we go 
there is there a clause that they put in in this agreement between 
Neotel and Homix to the – okay let me see.  Oh ja this is the date – this 
is what I am looking for.  I think you did refer to it earlier on namely 
clause 1.2.4 the commencement date. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which says the commencement date is 12 December 
2014 notwithstanding the date that this agreement is signed by the 
parties signing last in time. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so they are effectively saying we may not have 
had an agreement on the 12 December but as long as there is a 
signature of the agreement that happens later you must treat us as if 
we did have an agreement on the 12 December.  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
20 
That is what is appears like Chair yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  And that letter of the 12 December what – 
where was it again? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  That is page 159.  
CHAIRPERSON:  159.   
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 129 of 176 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  I mean sorry 519 sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  519.  I just want to – Ja okay.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  If we could then look at same bundle 
which is BB7[b] and turn to page 507.  Are you there Mr Van Der 
Westhuizen? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WEST HUIZEN:  I 
am, I am Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  This – this – this document appears 
to be another business – new business consultancy agreement between 
Neotel PTY LTD and Homix PTY LTD, is that correct?  
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Do you once again have any personal 
knowledge of this document?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair the first time I became aware of this document was when the 
investigator shared it with me. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can ask you to turn to page 517 
of the same bundle.  It is the signature page.  Whilst there is no date 
for the signature of Homix the date that appears for the signature of 
20 
Neotel is once again 19  February 2015.  Is that correct? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then if I could ask you to go to 
page 508 and once again at paragraph 1.2.4 the commencement date of 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 130 of 176 
 
this agreement is recorded as 12  December 2014 which is no different 
to the previous agreement. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did the first agreement between Neotel and Homix 
have the signature of Homix?  What page was it again?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Page 504.  Homix certainly signed 
the agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Both parties signed? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair but Homix did not inform of 
10 
the date of signature. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The date was not included.  So in both agreements 
there was no date of signature …  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But are – are the two documents different?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay but do they have the same date for Neotel 
for signature? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  There were two agreements that 
appear to have been signed …  
CHAIRPERSON:  On the … 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On exactly the same date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Same day ja. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 131 of 176 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  At least by Neotel … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that was 19 February 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The services however contracted was 
somewhat different. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The services? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so to that end if I could ask you 
10 
to go to page 509 please Mr  van der Westhuizen at paragraph 4 the 
consultancy services are recorded to be that:  
“The consultant agrees to undertake to analyse the 
requirements of both Neotel and Transnet SOC to 
find 
a 
workable 
solution 
to 
the 
impasse 
in 
negotiations between Neotel and Transnet SOC in 
regard to their Master Services Agreement.”  
What were your observations in relation to the difference between the 
consultancy services contracted under this agreement and the previous 
agreement that we just referred to earlier between Homix and Neotel?  
20 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair it appears as if the first contract that we looked at earlier rel ates 
to consulting services for the asset buyback.  Whereas it appears the 
second agreement relates to the conclusion of the Master Services 
Agreement between Transnet and Neotel.  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 132 of 176 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And to that end on page 510 project 
is defined at paragraph B at the very top of the page to mean:  
“The successful conclusion and signature of the 
asset sale forming part of the MSA concluded 
between Neotel and Transnet SOC Limited.”  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
The 
– 
the 
other 
fundamental 
difference is that which relates to fees.  To this end can I ask you to go 
to page 511 paragraph 6?  It is recorded at paragraph 6.1 that:  
10 
“For satisfactory performance of the consultancy 
services 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
terms 
and 
conditions of the agreement Neotel shall pay to the 
consultant the fees as follows:  6.1.1, for the 
successful conclusion and signature of the Master 
Services Agreement a fee of 2 percent of the value 
of the contract which is curren tly at R1.8 billion.  
6.1.2, the fees contemplated in 6.1 above are 
excluding VAT.” 
6.2 reads that: 
20 
“The work is to be carried on a pure risk basis and 
the consultant shall not bill for any time and 
material nor any out of pocket expenses.”  
What is highlighted of note in italics is at paragraph 6.3 which informs 
that: 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 133 of 176 
 
“Notably the fees referred to above in Clause 6 is 
success fee commission payable because of the 
assistance and expertise provided by consultant 
enabling Neotel to successfully close the Maste r 
Services Agreement currently agreed to be lost 
business as confirmed by both Neotel and Transnet 
SOC Limited for the avoidance of any doubt 
whatsoever 
satisfactory 
performance 
of 
the 
consultancy services shall be evidenced in the 
successful conclusion an d signature of the Master 
10 
Services Agreement between Neotel and Transnet 
SOC.” 
How many Master Services Agreements were concluded between Neotel 
and Transnet? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  Just 
the one Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So is reference to Master Services 
Agreement in this paragraph any different to the Master Services 
Agreement that may have been contemplated under the first Homix 
Agreement? 
20 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  It 
does not appear that way Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you are able to say that without any shade of 
doubt anybody who says there was a stalemate reached or deadlock 
between Neotel and Transnet with regard to in the negotiations relating 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 134 of 176 
 
to this agreement cannot be talking the truth?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair yes we - we had a stalemate where we disagreed on certain 
terms … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  But 
not to the extent that I believe either party would have walked away 
from this agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
10 
Neotel was reliant on the revenue from Transnet …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  And 
Transnet was reliant on Neotel becau se they owned our assets. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but what you are able to say for sure is that one, 
you were not contacted in anyway and you did not have any 
communication of any kind with Homix?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  Yes 
Chair I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and from the people who you knew at Transnet 
20 
to be involved in these negotiations there is not a single person who 
you know - you know to have been contacted by Homix or to have had 
any contact with them.  Not to say that you are  sure that nobody was in 
contact with them but you do not have any such knowledge?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 135 of 176 
 
That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it would be strange as far as you are concerned 
if somebody within Transnet who w as in the negotiation team had had 
such contact with Homix without you being aware or being informed in 
the light of the role you were playing in the negotiations?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
Is 
it 
correct 
then 
Mr van der Westhuizen that according to paragraph B on page 510 this 
10 
particular agreement includes both the asset buyback and the MSA?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  It 
does appear that way Chair yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  Do you know what 2 percent 
of 1.8 billion calculates to?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN: 
 
I 
believe it calculates to R36 million Chair.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  To that end could I ask you to then 
turn to page 505 of the same bundle?  What appears before you 
Mr van der Westhuizen is what appears to be a tax invoice by Homix to 
20 
Neotel dated 2 January 2015 and the description for this – for this 
invoice is for Master Services Agreement successful conc lusion 
success fee.  The total being R36 million which together with VAT of 
5 040 000 million totals R41  040 000 million.  Is that correct?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 136 of 176 
 
That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  You said that the 2 percent of 1.8 
billion calculates to what figure?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN: 
 
I 
think it is R36 million Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so that figure would accord with 
this amount that has been invoiced?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Importantly it is highlighted that the 
10 
date of this invoice is 2  January 2015.  Is that correct?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And so the date of invoice precedes 
the date of the conclusion or rather the signature of the Homix – of 
both Homix agreements? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct.  Those dates were 19 November 2015. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So to summarise you have a meeting 
or rather you attend a meeting on 13  December 2014 at which you 
20 
present the final draft of the 2014 MSA and Buyback Agreement for 
signature? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And that is a meeting that is held at 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 137 of 176 
 
Neotel’s Offices? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Unbeknown to you there is a letter 
dated 12 December 2014 by Homix to Neotel which informs that they 
are going to assist in finalising the very process that you were involved 
in to finalise on presentation of a final MSA the day after?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  According to the date sequence it 
10 
was also then that on 12  December 2014 the very agreements that were 
signed on 19 February 2015 between Homix and Neotel was agreed to 
come into effect that being the day before you have this agreement to – 
at which you present the final MSA Agreement for signature?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On 15 December 2014 Transnet signs 
the 2014 MSA and Buyback Agreement which is then countersigned by 
Neotel on 19 December 2014? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
20 
Correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  On 2 February 2015 an invoice is 
issued by Homix to Neotel for the sum of R36 million which is in line 
with a letter that is dated 12  December and a subsequen t agreement 
that was concluded on 19  February 2015 between Homix and Neotel?  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 138 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  Just 
on correction advocate.  I think you said 2  February.  I think it is 
2 January you met. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Oops. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  But, 
correct in everything else. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you for the correction. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Sure. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  2 January. 
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And then it was only more than a 
month later on 19 February 2015 that these agreements between Homix 
and Neotel the one which appears to regulate just the asset buyback.  
The other which appears to r egulate both the MSA and the asset 
buyback are signed off by both Neotel and Homix?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is incorrect Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who – who was in your – in the Transnet negotiatin g 
team that you were leading?  I take it you were the leader of the 
negotiating team? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  Yes 
Chair.  So there were multiple people included in that team.  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 139 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Transnet Procurement, Transnet Supply and Development, external 
legal, internal legal …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want the names as well if you are able to 
remember. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Sure.  There are quite a few people Chair.  It was more than 10 from 
what I recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, is that so? 
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you can remember some names and not others?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Yes, yes, yes Chair ja.  So I can remember … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mention those that – that you remember in 
their positions if you are able to.  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Okay.  So Chair you just want to double check.  You are specifi cally 
referring to the commercial stream and who was part of those 
20 
negotiations? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The negotiations relating to this agreement.  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 140 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  So 
there were two teams – the commercial team …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  And 
the technical team.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  So 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you were on the commercial team one?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
10 
That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  So 
it was myself.  It was a gentleman by the name of Macdonald  Maluleke 
in charge of Procurement.  Belfie (?) from – I cannot – his surname 
escapes me – Belfie from Supply Development.  The external legal was 
Basetsana Molebatsi.  The internal legal – his name escapes me now 
as well.  There was an external consultant Bruce  McLaren.  There was 
Jack Matthews from Gartner.  There was – I think – Clara from Neotel 
their legal representative.  There was a gentleman by the name of 
20 
(indistinct) from Neotel again.  François  van der Merwe from Neotel.  
Chair and that is who I can reme mber. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, ja okay.  No that is fine.  Thank you.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay.  Just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And all - and you confirm that all those who you have 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 141 of 176 
 
mentioned and those whose names you cannot remember no one of 
them ever mentioned to you have – having had any contact with Homix?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN: 
 
I 
can confirm that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Just to close the timeline sequence 
to the extent that R36 million was paid for se rvices contracted on 
12 February in relation to services that you finalised on 13  December – 
sorry – for services contracted from Homix on 12  December 2014 to the 
date on which you delivered the final MSA for signature would it be 
10 
correct to say that R36 million would relate to but one day of work?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  It 
does appear that way Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you make even a more important point as I 
understand it that certainly as far as you know there was no work 
involving Homix and Transnet …  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As far as you are aware and none of the people that 
were in your negotiating team ever mentioned having had any contact 
with Homix? 
20 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Ja, based on your experience what is 
– is there any commercial sense of these agreements and payments 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 142 of 176 
 
made? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair it does not make any sense to me.  I fail to understand what 
value Homix could have added nor who they engage with at Transnet 
and how they could have possibly earned R36 million with – for a day’s 
worth of work.  So it does not make sense.  
CHAIRPERSON:  For no work at all …  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  For no work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As far as you are concerned. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  Yes 
10 
that is correct Chair.  No work at all.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  But 
allegedly some work. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now they were to get that money from Neotel.  
Is it not? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That appears the way they were paid yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Would this mean that Neotel in reaching an 
agreement with – in reaching an agreement with Transnet may have 
20 
taken into account the fact that they might have to pay a certain 
amount of money to somebody else?  In other words taking from their 
own money and money that would come to them anyway.  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair it is possible yes that they could have.  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 143 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So – so the – the fact of the matter is simply 
that Transnet paid – paid – you know – all the money that it was 
supposed to pay to Neotel and then Neotel  may have then taken part of 
that and paid it to – to Homix? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  It 
does appear that way Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  To the extent that – to the extent that Transnet 
may have been satisfied that the amount agreed to between yourself 
and Neotel was commensurate and appropriate for what the agreement 
related to.  Transnet cannot complain, can it – could not complain, 
10 
could it? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair so we were not entirely over the moon with the asset buyback 
price nor the transition …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  Fee 
price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  But 
like I have tried to articulate before w e were in a position where to be 
20 
frank if Neotel charges R250 million for the assets instead of 200 
million we probably would have still paid it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  So I 
cannot comment on whether Neotel inf lated their price …  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 144 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  And 
then use that money to pay Homix …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  For 
this alleged service. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Well obviously if the amount that Neotel 
insisted Transnet should pay to the extent that that was an appropriate 
amount having regard to what was supposed to be done in terms of the 
agreement then whatever portion of that amount they may have given to 
10 
Homix that is their business.  Is it not?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If one proceeds from the premise that the amount 
agreed to between Transnet and Neotel was an appropriate amount.  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So like if I sell you – you know – a car and I say it is 
R100 000.  If it is worth selling that amount and you buy it for that 
amount but you then give part of that to somebody else then that is – 
20 
that is your business with the other person.  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the problem would arise if I have inflated the 
price that I have said you must pay because I now have to pay 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 145 of 176 
 
somebody else. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is what you say you do not know anything 
about? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Correct Chair because of the technicalities …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  And 
the position Transnet was in …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  We 
felt the prices were excessive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Whether they were inflated to pay Homix I …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  I do 
not know and I cannot comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you felt they were excessive?  
20 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you were in a vulnerable position.  You could not 
afford the consequences of not reaching an agreement with Neotel?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 146 of 176 
 
Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is – that was your difficulty?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if you had an alternative you could have resisted 
the – this – the amount that Neotel wanted?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN: 
 
I 
believe so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair – Chair may recall that 
10 
evidence has been led before this Commission by Mr  Ian Sinton and it 
was in that evidence that it was shown that Homix was a shelf company 
nominated by Mr Salim Essa to receive so called facilitation fe es and 
that these fees were in fact derived from contracts awarded by Transnet 
to various companies.  Chair …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair one additional point to mention 
is that we will indeed be presenting at a later stage evidence  on cash 
flows and particularly the analysis of that cash flow which would also 
talk to the flow of funds through Homix as an entity …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Which was not really an operational 
company of any sort. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja but apart from that if, if your evidence is 
correct that there was really no stalemate in the sense that business as 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 147 of 176 
 
the agreement says was lost.  If – if one accepts that that never 
happened and if one accepts that Homix never facilitated any 
agreement between Transnet and Neotel then the question would arise 
why even if this was Homix’s money why would it pay so much money to 
somebody else who did not do – facilitate any agreement.  Is it not?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Absolutely Chair.  It is peculiar. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And of course if the position is that this was just a 
shell company then there are more questions.  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  Yes 
10 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you do not expect somebody to pay  
somebody such a lot of money for doing nothing and in terms of the 
agreement Homix is supposed to have become entitled to that money by 
virtue of having successfully facilitated the conclusion of the agreement 
and you in effect say but they could not have  facilitated that agreement 
without talking to Transnet …  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is what they state. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – and if they talk to Transnet they would have to 
20 
talk to the negotiators and they never talked to the l eader of at least 
the commercial part of the delegation.  Is that right?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 148 of 176 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair.  Page 18 of your 
statement starts the nex t transaction that your evidence deals with and 
that is the 2014 Cisco equipment transaction.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So – I am sorry – just to round off.  So really your 
evidence in regard to this is let us somebody come here and tell us 
what they did.  How they did the facilitation of this agreement without 
talking to one of the parties actually the party that was supposed to pay 
the money – you know – to Neotel.  Of course Neotel would pay to 
Homix but to facilitate an agreement between two parties you have got 
to talk to both parties. 
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I may have missed something.  With regard to the 
other part – you were on the commercial team. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Stream. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The other – the other team do you know if they talked 
to them? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair again I cannot state as fact.  I have not asked everyone 
20 
necessarily. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That I can tell you that they have not discussed or they did not engage.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 149 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Whoever they are with Yusuf Loonat … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Who was the technical lead. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But they would not have – that is Homix – would not 
have succeeded by talking to one team from Transnet and not to both.  
Would they? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Well Chair they needed the Master Services Agreement signed …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  And 
the technical team – technical stream was not in charge of that.  The 
commercial stream was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, your team was in charge of signing that? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had the authority? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  So I 
had the authority to get it to finalisation.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  To 
get it to Mr Molefe for signing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For signing, ja. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 150 of 176 
 
Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in terms of finalising the negotiations you had the 
authority? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  Yes 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Once they were finalised and they were – there was 
an agreement that was ready to be signed you would then take it to 
Mr Molefe and if he was satisfied with it he would then sign?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, thank you and it would make sense to – to 
facilitate or try and secure the agreement of people who do not have 
the authority to conclude the negotiations?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER: 
 
The 
2014 
Cisco 
equipment 
transaction please explain the background to this particular transaction 
to the Chair? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
20 
Chair so we have – we have briefly touched on it but in essence after 
the decision by Mr Molefe to overturn the recommendation to award the 
network services tender to Neotel and him …  
CHAIRPERSON:  The decision hey not the recommendation is it?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 151 of 176 
 
Yes.  To – to the recommendation.  I beg your pardon Chair.  Ja, so 
when the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Decision? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  Ja, 
so … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one by Ms Chetty or no or it is another one ? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  No 
it is the same one.  It is the same one Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  So 
10 
when Mr Molefe decided to overturn that decision …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Correctly by Ms Chetty that meant that we would need a neutral 
transition and that meant that – well – so effectively we met with Cisco, 
Neotel, T-Systems and Transnet Management or ITC Management and 
we came to the realisation that we would have to procure certain 
equipment that Neotel informed us was approaching end of life and end 
of support and T-Systems as part of their tender would have included it.  
So we engaged with T-Systems who removed it from their t ender and 
20 
the pricing as well because of that exclusivity contract with Neotel.  
Confirmed the pricing with Gartner that the pricing seemed fair and 
followed the governance Chair to get those assets acquired which 
Transnet would then own which was effectiv ely a portion of the 
switches and routers in the campuses.  So we just fast tracked that 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 152 of 176 
 
transaction effectively to transition the services in essence.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  What was the value of equipment 
that you need to procure - that Transnet needed to procure? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair if I recall correctly it is R302-odd million. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  If I can ask you to go to Bundle BB7B 
page 5256.  It is Annexure W2. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Huh-uh. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Do you recognise …?  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 525? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  525.  Do you recognise this 
memorandum dated 21 February 2014? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  I do 
Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Who is the author of this document?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN: 
 
I 
was the author Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  In paragraph 1 is it correct that the 
correct amount which was the value of the equipment to be procured 
20 
was 305 million? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
Chair I think at that point we were still finalising negotiations but – so it 
refers to a maximum value of R305 …  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Okay. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 153 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN:  
R305million yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you for the clarity.  Please 
continue to outline the background in relation to this particular 
transaction. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair I think I captured it in the disc ussion earlier that we had an 
exclusivity clause with Neotel and as a result we had to procure this 
equipment through them, we felt that it was absolutely necessary to buy 
it well quickly to get the transition done in a short time of space.    
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Okay and at page 529 of that same 
bundle is it correct that your signature is dated 21/2/2014 as – and it’s 
exactly the same for the other signatories to this document which was 
recommended by Mr Yusuf Loonat, Mr Gary Peter and approved by M r 
Anoj Singh on the 21 s t of February 2014? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That’s correct, I think Mr Singh wrote – it’s a dash if not a 114, that’s 
correct, 21 February 2014 by the parties.  
CHAIRPERSON:  He seems to have indicated that he signed it on the 
21 s t of February, 114.  Okay alright yes.   
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   Did you seek advice from any 
external service provider in relation to this transaction?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :   I 
did Chair, so I approac hed Gartner to check the logic of what we were 
planning, whether it made sense to them as a technical expert, we also 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 154 of 176 
 
checked the pricing with them to see they normally have data bases 
with pricing just to check the relevance and how good or bad the 
pricing was.  I think like I mentioned I also checked with T-Systems that 
should we buy these assets through Neotel that they will remove it from 
their tender pricing so that we would not have to pay for these assets 
twice. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :    Thank you, and so at page 20 of 
your statement, at paragraph 64, from 64.1 to 64.3 you record the 
advice that you were in fact given by Gartner in order to further this 
particular transaction.  
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That’s correct.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   What steps did you then take 
following receipt of such advice?   
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair from what I can recall I engaged further, Gartner was of the view 
that we could potentially get a slightly bet ter price although subsequent 
to me sending the information to Gartner we’ve already reduced the 
price.  I further engaged directly with Cisco to see if we can get that 
price down even further, which we could slightly and I then when we 
20 
placed the order, I placed the order as you will see later Chair I 
requested Neotel to pass that further discount that I negotiated with 
Cisco on to Transnet.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   And so your engagement was only 
with Neotel and Cisco?  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 155 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN : 
That’s correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I can ask you to turn then to page 
544 of ...(intervention)      
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  Just 
to be 100% accurate, and T-Systems to ensure that they reduce their 
pricing Chair, but yes.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   Thank you, so again Bundle BB7B, 
page 544 which is the second last page of this bundle.  There’s an 
email that appears in the middle of this page on 21 February 2014, it 
10 
appears that you had sent an email t o Francois, who is Francois?   
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair Francois van der Merwe was the Account Executive from Neotel 
responsible for the Transnet account.    
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And what exactly is the purpose of 
this email? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair the focus of the email is to confirm that Transnet would like to 
place the order for that equipment to the value of R302.7million, there 
was some slight amendments made to some technicalities that Mr 
20 
Loonat requested so I just made sure that they included that and then I 
also in the email asked Mr van der Merwe to make sure that the further 
discount I negotiated be included in the final pricing, passed on to 
Transnet.    
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   Thank you.  Page 539 of the same 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 156 of 176 
 
bundle there’s an email from Homix to Francois van der Merwe at 
Neotel, titled Project at Transnet dated February 21, February 2014, 
11:46, are you familiar with this document?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WEST HUIZEN:  
Chair I am, it was shared with me by the investigators.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   And what are your comments in 
relation to this document. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Well Chair it seems quite strange to me again that Homix  engaged with 
Neotel on the day that we placed the order, so they appear to be quite 
10 
good negotiators and they get things done quickly because they engage 
with Neotel on the 21 s t, which is the same day I placed the order with 
Neotel, so again I fail to und erstand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that date, the date of that email is 21 Feb 2014.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   Yes Chair. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So 
Chair it’s the same date that the memorandum by the four or 
recommended and approved by the four signatures, mine included and 
it’s the same date I placed the order with Neotel.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  If I can then ask you to turn to the 
new supplementary bundle, the second last page which is page 179, 
there appears to be ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  79? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  179, it’s the second last page of the 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 157 of 176 
 
supplementary bundle Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mine goes, oh okay, I found it.  Yes?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   That appears to be an email from 
again Francois van der Merwe at Neotel on Saturday the 22 n d of 
February 2014, and it is sent to Howicks SA with the subject title 
“Neotel Acceptance letter”, are you familiar with this document?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  I 
am, the investigators shared it with me Chair ja. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   And attached to this document at 
page 180 there appears to be an acceptance letter from Mr Shaneel 
10 
Joshe of Neotel to Mr T Kahn of Homix, the letter reads, in the second 
paragraph: 
“We hereby confirm our acceptance in principle of the proposal 
on the conditions stipulated by you in paragraph 5 of the 
proposal, that the parties enter into a detailed written 
agreement pursuant to the proposal which detailed agreement 
will contain the terms of the proposal and incorporate other 
commercial terms pertinent to transactions of this nature.  The 
parties shall conclude such detailed agreement within fourteen 
days of the date of the letter.  The enclosing email talks 
20 
specifically to an opportunity to work toget her, regarding an 
opportunity uncovered by yourselves at Transnet SOC.”  
What are you observations in relation to this email and the attachment, 
in context? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 158 of 176 
 
Chair the observation again is it’s odd that, I c an’t understand how 
Homix could have identified this opportunity at Transnet, Neotel had an 
exclusivity clause in their agreement so I can only buy from Neotel, so I 
mean they were in a perfect position so I’m not sure why or how this 
Homix identified the opportunity and how Neotel would have benefitted.  
They could just sit back and wait, if we have to buy it we have to buy it 
from them, so it’s unclear what value Homix would have added, number 
one, and number two Chair is the date of this email is the 22 n d of 
February 2014, you would recall all the correspondence we discussed 
before was dated the 21 s t of February, but in this letter or in this email 
10 
Neotel states please find attached the acceptance letter and we trust 
we will close the business soon, when in fact the day before I have 
already placed the order with Neotel, so I find that strange.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Okay, if I can then ask you to turn to 
page – what’s this now, Bundle BB7B, page 541.  This appears to be a 
letter on a Homix letterhead authored by Mr T Khan dated 6 January 
2014.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   This letter reads at paragraph one, 
by Mr T Khan to Neotel, once again for the attention of Mr Francois van 
20 
der Merwe, titled subject Opportunity at Transnet.  The  first two 
paragraphs read: 
“Following our discussions we are pleased to confirm that we 
are in a position to deliver on an opportunity at Transnet that 
we have been working on for some time. The opportunity 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 159 of 176 
 
involves replacement of network equipment for a value of 
approximately R315million, excluding VAT.  The full details of 
the opportunity will be disclosed to you after we have agreed 
on the conditions of the deal as listed below.”  
Please help us to understand the involvement of Homix in the 2014 
Cisco Equipment agreement? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair again I together with Yusuf Loonat led those negotiations, and we 
engaged like I mentioned before with T-Systems, Neotel and Cisco.  
Nowhere was Homix ever mentioned, no one was – anyone ever 
10 
introduced as being from Homix and again I fail to understand how they 
could have identified opportunities without walking the floor so to 
speak, being at Transnet, identifying it and again the exclusivity 
clause, it doesn’t really make sense.   
 
It also mentions risk factors undertaken by us in the entire 
project which I fail to understand what risk they would have 
encountered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was no risk? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  No, 
and there was no service. 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  At paragraph, at page 21 of your 
statement, paragraph 69 you effectively summarise your evidence as 
follows.  You say you did not ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  What page?    
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Page 21 of the statement which is 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 160 of 176 
 
EXHIBIT BB7A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  You effectively summarise your 
evidence in relation to this transaction, and Homix’s involvement in that 
when you state that you had not met any person or representative from 
Homix.  It remains unclear to you how Homix would have identified the 
opportunity and they had no interaction with anyone from Transnet and 
that was at least during the time period that you were there.    
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Correct. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  The MSA between Transnet and 
Neotel 
included 
an exclusivity clause 
which 
presented certain 
restrictions, and that you were the one that in fact placed the order on 
the 21 s t of February 2014 to the value of R302.7million, yet there’s 
correspondence which details communiqué in relation to that same 
transaction after the placement of that order.  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN : 
That’s  correct Chair.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:   Can I be given just a second or two?  
I have been requested to ask for an indulgence of five to ten minutes to 
20 
address this particular aspect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that’s fine, let’s go back to the Master Service 
Agreement and it looks like whatever one says about it and Homix 
involvement and payment of mo ney applies to the Cisco transaction as 
well, equipment transaction is that right more or less?  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 161 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That’s  more or less correct Chair yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  The Master Service Agreement if it were to be found 
as a fact that Homix – or let me put it this way, if the position is that 
Homix in order to perform in terms of its agreement with Neotel had to 
be in touch with somebody  or some people at Transnet that person or 
those people, that person would either be you  or those people would 
include you, you would be one of those that they would have to talk to, 
because you were the lead negotiator, is that right?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
10 
That’s my understanding yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s your understanding of what your role was?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN : Yes, 
absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without you saying okay we have no reached an 
agreement that I am happy to take to Mr Molefe nothing would happen?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JAC OBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN : 
Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so it wouldn’t have made much sense for them to 
talk to anybody at Transnet for purposes of facilitating the negotiations 
20 
other than talking to at least you and if they spoke to anybody higher 
than you, like Mr Brian Molefe, Mr Molefe would have had to talk to you 
and say I understand that there’s a stalemate or deadlock between you 
and Neotel, tell me about what’s happening and then maybe overrule 
you on some points and say no go ahead and sign or go ahe ad and 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 162 of 176 
 
prepare the agreement?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN : 
Correct, I suspect that would have or should have happened.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It couldn’t have worked any other way if it involved 
Homix facilitating the conclusion of an agreemen t between Transnet 
and Neotel, you had to be involved in one way or another?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  I 
would support that Chair, it would have had to be me or someone senior 
to me giving me an instruction to change the Master Se rvices 
Agreement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, but even somebody senior to you wouldn’t 
have, there wouldn’t have been facilitation of the conclusion of the 
agreement from Transnet side without that senior person talking to 
you? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VA N DER WESTHUIZEN:  
That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say nobody talked to you along those lines?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  No 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so if – and that must be an indication to say the 
20 
least, apart from anything else, that certainly there was no facilitation 
that was carried out by Homix insofar as Transnet is concerned?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And if there was no facilitation that was ca rried 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 163 of 176 
 
out by Homix on Transnet’s side then Neotel must have known that 
there was no facilitation that took, that was carried out on Transnet’s 
side. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  I 
would suspect so Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because unless maybe Homix went to them and told 
some untruths about what Transnet might have said, but it can’t be 
because the only position that Neotel had, the only positions that 
Neotel knew to be Transnet’s position were those that you conveyed to 
them? 
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN : 
Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There’s no other position that they could have known?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN : Not 
to my knowledge Chair, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if Neotel knew that one there was never any 
stalemate which was such that there would be no further negotiations 
or which could result in anybody describing the business has lost 
business, if the knew that and if they knew that there was no 
facilitation that was carried out by Homix on the part of Transnet then 
20 
in all probability there was no facilitation that Homix would have or 
could have carried out on the side of Neotel, actually Transnet would 
have been the party on whom Homix would have to work in order to 
facilitate, because the party that would have to agree to a certain 
apprise required by Neotel was Transnet?  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 164 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you never asked them, you never asked 
Homix to go and negotiate on your behalf  for a lower price with Neotel?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN : No 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the only facilitation that could have happened at 
the request of Neotel could have been a facilitation involving Homix 
asking or seeking to persuad e Transnet to go up in terms of whatever 
price and that never happened. 
10 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And therefore there could not have been any 
facilitation, and Homix must have known that there was no fa cilitation.  
Is your own analysis along the same lines?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  It’s 
along the same lines Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and if Homix knew that there was no facilitation 
and still entered into an agreement with Homi x in terms of which they 
said there was facilitation and were going to pay R36million plus VAT 
20 
for that facilitation then they were misrepresenting the situation  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  In 
my opinion Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It couldn’t have been, it’s difficult to see it any other 
way because if they knew that there was no facilitation but they signed 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 165 of 176 
 
an agreement that said there was a facilitation and they paid R86million 
plus VAT on the basis that Homix facilitated that must h ave been a 
deliberate misrepresentation of facts if this analysis is correct?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  I 
believe so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if they knew all of these things and nevertheless 
were prepared to pay it’s highly unlikely that they would have wanted to 
pay so much money out of an amount that was not inflated.  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  It is 
unlikely that they would have wanted to pay it out of their margins 
10 
Chair yes, they would have have likely passed that price onto 
Transnet? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, well maybe they will come and they will explain 
all of these things and they will show us that there is something we 
don’t understand. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JACOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN : 
Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :   Chair I am informed by our 
investigation team that Homix in fact received about R34million 
20 
payment out of the 2014 Cisco equipment transaction.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And that is evidence to be d ealt, to 
be led at a later stage through the cash flow analysis.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, that’s fine.  You asked for five minutes or so 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99

to just request this witness to confirm his supplementary statement?  
CHAIRPERSON:  To confirm? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  His supplementary statement which I 
ought to have dealt with earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  So Exhibit BB7[c] page 1 do you 
recognise this document?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  Yes 
20 
I do. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  I do not know if your microphone is 
on. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WEST HUIZEN:  I 
do. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 167 of 176 
 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  And on page 2 is that 
signature that appears?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  It is 
Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And that was in fact signed today on 
the 27 May 2019? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Is it correct that this statement 
merely corrects typographical errors in your original statement in 
10 
addition to attaching a copy of the signed 2014 MSA agreement?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  And 
an email Chair yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you for that addition.  In that 
regard then can I ask you to turn to page 170 of this bundle.  And this 
is a document which in fact starts on page 3 as the Mast er Services 
Agreement between Transnet SOC Limited and Neotel PTY LTD which 
was ultimately signed on the 15 December 2014 and finally signed – 
countersigned on the 19 December 2014.  At page 170 can I ask you to 
read paragraph 65.6 into the record please?  
20 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Sure.  Chair paragraph 65.6 states:  
“The service provider warrants to Transnet to the 
best of its knowledge and belief neither the service 
provider not any of its affiliates nor any employee of 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 168 of 176 
 
either has paid or agreed to pay any person any fee, 
commission, percentage, brokerage fee, gift or any 
other consideration that is contingent upon or 
resulting from the award or execution of this 
agreement save for such remuneration as is paid to 
bona fide employees working solely for the service 
provider or such affiliates or any of the service 
provider sub- contractors.” 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you.  And is it correct that 
when you turn to page 8 of this agreement or rather of this bundle – 
10 
page 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that another point or you are still on …  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Just closing off this point quickly.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Connected with this.  Okay.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  On page 8 it is correct that Neotel 
PTY LTD is in fact the service provid er that you just – in the paragraph 
that you just referred to?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
That is correct Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Was Neotel then contractually 
20 
entitled to pay any monies to any third party pursuant to this 
transaction according to the agreement itself?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Just repeat please Advocate I missed the first portion?  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Was Neotel contractually entitled to 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 169 of 176 
 
pay any monies of any nature as listed in paragraph 65.6? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  Not 
in my understanding of that at all.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  In relation to this transaction?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  Not 
according to my understanding of that clause Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  So any payment then would have 
been in breach of this agreement?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  In 
my reading of it yes. 
10 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  The second point relates to Mr 
Francois Van Der Merwe.  How close – Mr Francois Van Der Merwe as 
we understand it was…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I am sorry before you move to another point if you 
have regard to this clause 65.6.  As of the dates of that agreement 
which are 15 December 2014 and 19 December 2 014 I guess the date 
of the agreement is the later one of the two 19 December 2014.  As at 
that date had Neotel as you understand the position reached agreement 
with Homix? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
20 
Chair I do not believe so.  Thos e two agreements were signed 19 
February 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So 
that would have been post the signature of this agreement.  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 170 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – so technically they may not have 
misrepresented anything in 65.6 to the extent that they were saying as 
at the date of this agreement they had – Neotel had not agreed to pay 
anybody any fee or commission or brokerage fee or any consideration 
that is contingent upon or resulting from the award or execution o f this 
agreement.  To the extent that that did not say we will not pay, we will 
not agree in the future to the extent that it was saying as at that time 
they had not agreed to pay anybody?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So 
Chair it does not really capture the timeline.  It does state that it is 
10 
contingent upon or resulting from the award or execution of this 
agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but look at the third line.  Does it not say – well 
you have to start from the beginning.  Does it not  say Neotel that is the 
service provider warrants to Transnet that bla, bla, bla. Neither it nor 
any of its affiliates or any employee has paid or has agreed to pay any 
person.  So in other words that seems to be they are talking – they are 
saying as of now we can warrant – we can assure you that we have not 
agreed to pay anybody.   
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So 
20 
if… 
CHAIRPERSON:  For any commission about the success of this 
agreement. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So 
if that is the understanding Chair if you are I think far more eloquent in 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 171 of 176 
 
law than I am so…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So 
it does look like it is at a point in time a date of signature.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  So 
it does appear at this stage yes that they did not breach this contract.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes of course it would not be easy for the part to say 
promise that in the future you will not agree either beca use you would 
not think that somebody would agree to pay somebody for the 
10 
[indistinct] conclusion of an agreement after it has been concluded.  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  It 
has already been… - correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Chair to – in that regard can I ask 
you Mr Van Der Westhuizen to turn to Exhibit BB7[b] page 519.   
CHAIRPERSON:  509? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  519.  To follow on from the Chairs 
point this particular document is dated the 12 December 2014 in terms 
of which Homix writes to Sunil Joshi which is the very same 
20 
representative – or not representative of Neotel which is the same 
entity that contracts with Transnet and in terms of this letter they reach 
and in principle agreement i n relation to services to be rendered on the 
MSA transaction and the fees to be paid for such services.  Is it correct 
that the date of this letter precedes the MSA agreement?  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 172 of 176 
 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  It is 
correct. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  And would it also be correct that this 
particular document informs the agreement that was signed on the 19 
February 2015 between Homix and Neotel?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  I 
believe so Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And so in that context the prohibition 
contained in the Master Services Agreement which you read into the 
record would in fact apply to the extent that there was an agreement to 
10 
pay monies to a third party pursuant to the MSA transaction.  Would 
that be a fair statement to make?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Chair I do not know if I am adequately skilled to answer that question 
because this is an intent clearly from Homix to Neotel stating that it 
serves to confirm today’s engagement bu t it is not necessarily 
confirmation from Neotel at this stage yet.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Absolutely. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  But 
the agreement subsequently is aligned to this letter yes.  
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You probably need something from Neotel that 
reacted to this letter that indicates they accepted at least even if the 
formal agreement may have signed later.  You do not have something 
that was a response to this because at the end they say please concur 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 173 of 176 
 
the above together with the success fee structure where the latter shall 
become binding on Neotel.  So is that concurrence that – that – I mean 
it is – the – from this you can see that the – that Neotel was engaged in 
discussions that were aimed at concluding an agreement with Homix 
but until you have that last bit to say how did they respond to this there 
might just be some technicality.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  I am informed that the investigators 
will certainly follow it up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  They may or may not have 
10 
something. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  But to the extent that they find 
anything it will certainly be submitted in future evidence.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no that is fine, that is fine.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Thank you. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  On the second point if I may Chair 
Francois Van Der Merwe was working for Neotel during the time that 
you were at Transnet.  Did you work very closely with him?  
20 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN : I did 
Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And how would you describe the 
working relationship between you and Mr Van Der Merwe?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 174 of 176 
 
Chair I would say that we had a very  good relationship.  Strained at 
times and especially when that tender was overturned but we had a 
good relationship I think it is important.  I also had a good relationship 
with a client executive from T-Systems I think it is important in things 
like the 58 million and enabling you to negotiate things like that down 
to 50 that you do have a good relationship with your suppliers.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  You will recall from the various 
documents that we referred to in the transaction with Homix and Neotel  
that Francois Van Der Merwe’s name occurred on several occasions.  
Did Mr Van Der Merwe inform you at any stage about the involvement of 
10 
Homix or any third party for that matter?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  He 
did not Chair. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Involved in the transaction?  
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  He 
did not. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  And then finally do you have any 
closing remarks? 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  I do 
not Chair.  I think we have…  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do not invite them.  We do not invite close 
agreements.  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  I have no further questions for this 
witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Mr Van Der Westhuizen for 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 175 of 176 
 
coming to give evidence.  If a need a rises for you to be asked to come 
back you will be asked to come back and I have no doubt that you will 
happily come back to assist. 
MR GERHARDUS JOHANNES JOCOBUS VAN DER WESTHUIZEN :  
Sure Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  You are excused. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Chair – Chair just one point.  
Following the evidence of this particular witness it will the a question to 
be raised and to be considered whether or not in line with the evidence 
of other witnesses like Mr Molefe, Mr Mahomedy as to whether or not a 
10 
parallel system was indeed at play at the time that these transactions 
took place.  A parallel system which was augmented by the higher 
echelons of the organisation to corroborate or an outside particularly of 
the procurement process to facilitate these transactions.  That is a 
question that is yet to be answered.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  You are excused.   
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Is it Ms Sello who will be leading 
evidence tomorrow or dealing with reports?  Did you know what it will 
be? 
20 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Correct Chair.  Advocate Mahlape 
Sello will be dealing with the evidence of M&S and that is to commence 
tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The evidence of? 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  M&S. 
27 MAY 2019 – DAY 99 
 
Page 176 of 176 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  M&S or …  
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay alright.  Okay well then we did not make 
arrangements about whether we should start early or not so we will 
start at ten.  We will adjourn for the day and tomorrow we will start at 
ten o’clock in the morning. 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  As it pleases. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 28 MAY 2019
