PROCEEDINGS HELD ON 23 MAY 2019  
CHAIRPERSON:  Good Morning Ms Sello, good morning everybody. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Good morning Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair before we continue with the testimony 
of Mr Callard. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second Ms Sello.  Ms Zonica could you tell 
them to make sure that the chair that I normally use is here by – yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank – thank you Chair.  Chair before we 
continue with the testimony of Mr Callard this morning I would like to 
10 
refer the Chair to Exhibit BB4[c] I called it the black folder.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And I would like to point out certain things in 
respect of that folder.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The Chair will recall that when we parted on 
Monday that folder had BB4[c] and BB4[d].  In dealing with BB4[d] and 
at page – from pages 26 Mr Callard referred to three different 
responses by CNR to the – as regards the question of impact of TE on 
their price.  The Chair then re – wanted to find out if the request from 
20 
Transnet for clarification was included in the bundle and Mr Callard’s 
response was that it was not in his bundle.  Over  the two days Mr 
Callard has located the request, has filed a further supplementary affi – 
a statement in order to introduce this request and that Chair now has 
been tendered in as BB4[e].   
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 3 of 206 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then Mr Callard if we may continue we are 
under time pressures today we are encroaching on Mr Mokoena’s time 
so the less we can inconvenience him and the witness and the Chair of 
course the better.  Thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Understood. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Just to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the bottom line is you must still be able to give 
10 
your evidence properly.  Okay.  So yes there is that factor but make 
sure that you are able to give you r evidence properly and do not – so 
do not be under too much pressure.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do not feel under too much pressure.  Okay.  Just 
make sure that we – we – I hear everything that is important that you 
need to tell me. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  When we parted according 
20 
to my records Mr Callard we were at page 49 or your statement and you 
had taken the Chair through the inconsistenci es regarding the 
interpretation of BAFO across the diesel bidders. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We rose before you dealt with your paragraph 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 4 of 206 
 
190 which is actually the conclusion of that chapter.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So if we can pick it up from there and then 
overleaf you start on a different issue which is analysing the BAFO 
price itself and its reflection of the real cost of the acquisition of the 
locomotive. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is correct yes correct so. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then if you can take us through that.  Yes we 
are now at your 190 at page 49. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you counsel. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Or perhaps you might want to summarise from 
188 because I – just to make – place things in proper context. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the last thing I said when we – just before we 
adjourned was that this morning he would need to recap on the last 
point he was making. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we adjourned. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I think that is where we should start.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And Chair on my notes we had dealt with 
20 
paragraphs 181.  He had started on the inconsistent interpretation of 
BAFO across the diesel locomotives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Just to make sure I am on the same page with 
the Chair. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 5 of 206 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Unfortunately I did not make point – I did not note the 
point that there was a point he was making which I had not understood 
or he might not have finished to deal with properly and that is why I 
said please when we resume – start from there refresh our memory 
because I had not heard it properly.  So I did not make a note what the 
point was.  Mr Callard do you remember what the point was?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  If I may recap very briefly going 
back to 182. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Of my statement.  This was a 
request on the 20 December 2013 to CNR and other diesel bidder 
requesting an explanation of the cost per the Annexure E.  And I 
outlined in 182 the breakdown of the Annexure E costs for CNR and 
their response.  Noting that – and without referring to the bundle but 
just looking at the table on – under paragraph 182 that on the fourth 
line – sorry fourth – third line in that table, the third element in that 
table, admin, overheads, mark-up, marketing, insurance, financing, 
20 
interest etcetera and that amounts to some 5.2 bi llion which they quote 
in their Annexure E.  In briefly in summary then on the 4 January 20 - 
CNR replied to this on the 22 December and that is in there and they 
just give a further exposition of that.  I do not think it is necessary to 
go back to that but the point that we were – that I was seeking to make 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 6 of 206 
 
was that on the 4 January the diesel bidders were invited to submit 
their best and final offers.  There was a letter to CNR the response was 
the due on the 10 January CNR replied in the meantime with tw o letters 
requesting a fourteen day extension and then a 21 day extension but on 
the 10 January they replied and here I am referring to paragraph 187 
on 49 and I am quoting from that point – from sub-paragraph 187.1. 
“We have reduced our base price in the total cost of 
ownership as referred to in your [as referred to in 
your letter of 4 January 2014] from 39 million 
rounded or 39.7 million rounded to 27.3 million 
10 
rounded. 
 
This price 
relates 
to 
the 
cost 
of 
manufacture and does not include training costs, 
logistics, 
royalties, 
technical 
support, 
service 
charge, finance costs and contingencies etcetera.”  
And the point which I wish to make is that I believe this qualification 
does not constitute a comparative best and final offer price with that 
which we heard from GE.  In support of this contention belief it should 
be noted that the reduction of 12.3 million per locomotive rounded if 
one multiplies that by the 465 diesel locomotives for which they bid this 
exceeds the amount of the 5. – this amounts to some 5.7  billion which 
20 
exceeds the entire amount in their Annexure E from the RFP and I take 
one back there to the page – to the paragraph 182 from which I was 
quoting previously.  In essence what the BAFO purports to be is this 
significant reduction of over R12 m illion per locomotive that reduction 
negates all the elements in their Annexure E.  And why I believe this 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 7 of 206 
 
now to be problematic is if we could please just pick this up in 
Annexure A 66. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  A66? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  A66 which is at page 583.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that Chair will be in BB4[b]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  The page is 586 and the divider is?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The – it is the Annexure 66 that is divider 66.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Annexure 6…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which starts at 583. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  3. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you specifically want to take us to page?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I would like to take us to page 
please 589.  589… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now for the record Chair it is 66A, 589 is 6A. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  A. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You recall 66 is in two parts. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  66 is in two parts. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  66A is the legible copy. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   We are there. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   Thank you.  Thank you Counsel.  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 8 of 206 
 
Chair the point is – I wish to make is that this qualified BAFO does not 
include all these items, contingencies and the word etcetera.  If we 
look at page 589 which is now this legible copy and at the bottom just 
above the note we have the last line is forex due to the difference.  
They explain the difference between the first and  the second BAFO’s 
and we will see there the difference is made up of the words used are 
discount on price.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  So this qualified BAFO with all 
these qualifications is taken forward into this evaluation d ocuments as 
10 
a discount.  It is my belief and contention that a qualification like this 
cannot be presented or should not be presented as an unqualified 
discount is the point I wish to make on this one.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Callard I do not know if you ar e able to 
assist.  In reading Annexure 98 which is CNR’s response of the 10 June 
2014 indicating a drop in price from 39 to 27 at – that is your paragraph 
187 you have quoted it there. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Would our reading be correct if we conclude 
that to the extent that that is a response to the letter – the invitation by 
20 
Transnet as per para – as per Annexure 95 you will with this is 184.  
That response went beyond what Transnet required of the bidders to 
do? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Indeed yes that is correct.  It is a 
response to the annexure in  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 9 of 206 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  95. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The letter in Annexure 95 and I 
would also agree that it goes beyond – the response is beyond what 
was requested in the base – in the letter of Annexure – in the letter of 
the 4 January. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The 4 January. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now looking at the response and what CNR 
claims to have been deducted to reduce the price to 27 mil lion based 
on your knowledge and experience are those costs relevant to 
10 
determining the costs that are deducted are they relevant to 
determining the total costs to be incurred by Transnet for the 
acquisition of the locomotive or are these options that can be ignored? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  These are not options in the sense 
that we would normally understand the word options as applied to the 
locomotive of making it fit for purpose.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  These are elements of a price to 
provide a locomotive if I may call it free onsiding.  There is the 
locomotive free – or ex works. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ready for delivery.  I highlighted 
the point on my paragraph 182. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That we have now taken out all of 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 10 of 206 
 
the manpower costs, factory overheads, admin overheads and if the 
wording is to be believed may I use that phrase, overheads and mark -
up which would imply that well thank you I have sacrifi ced my entire 
mark-up by taking this out.  What I – I cannot explain the 
inconsistencies I only see the inconsistencies and the use of the word 
etcetera as I highlighted earlier is – does not constitute a BAFO it is a 
qualified price which cannot be taken into a discount. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Transnet then receives this Annexure 
98 which is CNR’s response. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To the request for clarification as regards the 
hedging and escalations, what then transpires ? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I not this because and it struck me 
as being unusual.  I do not say it is incorrect I only say it was unusual 
that following this response then on the 14 January and that correct – 
on paragraph 188 that correction is noted that Mr Molefe writes to CNR. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Under his signature that the 10 
January response inter alia did not indicate the foreign currency 
amount per individual currency and amount bold and underlined.  In 
20 
essence highlighting that CNR did not fully respond to their letter.  CNR 
responds on the 14 January on the same day referring back to their 
tender proposal of the 30 April that this was – that there appears to 
have been considerable pressure on this because on the  15 January 
2014 the and I am reading paragraph 190.  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 11 of 206 
 
“The cross function and evaluation team finance submit the results of 
their best and final offer responses to the Locomotive Steering 
Committee.” 
And this is on – this is Annexure 66. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Mr Molefe’s letter may be found at 
Annexure 99 which is paragraph – page 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Annexure 7. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  788. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  His letter of the 14 January  to CNR 
requesting and it goes out under his personal signature.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  How – if one has regard to the response of 
the 10 January which states that the price has now reduced to 27 
million per locomotive. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then… 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Or sorry by 27 million. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No reduced to 27 million, 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Oh sorry to 27 million. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes, sorry, sorry, apolog ies. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And at the same time in response to a further 
letter from Transnet to CNR indicating that it did not indicate the 
following currency amount per individual currency and amount when 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 12 of 206 
 
CNR refers Transnet back to their tender proposal o f 30 April 2013 as 
you state in your 189. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Are we then not talking about two different 
purchase prices?  Did the 30 April 2013 tender proposal also propose a 
price of 27 million?  I am trying to reconcil e that response to what is 
stated in their letter of 10 January reducing the purchase price by 14 
million – by 12 million? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No the base price I would go back 
to 187.1. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Their wording we have reduced our 
base price in the TCO model as referred to in your letter from 39,7  
million rounded down to 27.3.  So 39.7 million refers I do not want to 
say exactly at the moment we can check that up to their offer of the 
April 2013. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  2013. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So when they – the refer Transnet back to 
that offer when the 39 has reduced to 27 does that address the query 
20 
contained in your paragraph 188?  Because we are now talking two 
different prices.  We started at 39 which is what was in their proposal 
in April 2013 what eight months later they say that price has reduced to 
27 million?  On 14 January when it is indicated that they do not 
indicate the foreign currency amount per individual c urrency and 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 13 of 206 
 
amount they refer you back to their original proposal.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct.  When a – sorry. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  No my question is can you assist us in 
reconciling all these documents?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  When a locomotive bid is 
submitted one is asked for an effectively a rand price.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  One is asked for the local content.  
One asks the bidders to specify their local content.  One asks the 
bidders to specify what is the imported content of the locomotive in – 
10 
and in the foreign currency and it may be in one or more foreign 
currencies.  There were – in the 1064 it was generally in dollar but 
there was also a bid which had both dollar and euros.  One also asks – 
the bidders are also asked to state the date on which they have applied 
that currencies in determining their final locomotive price.  So the – for 
CNR the dollar component of their locomotive price which was asked 
for in the – in the letter if I may be correct there they just refer back to 
their original bid. So notwithstanding having reduced the or given a 
qualified if I may use the qualified BAFO price of now some 27.3 million 
per locomotive they say that the dollar component of the locomotive, 
20 
the imported component has not changed.  By implication of this by 
using inverse logic it would seem that the total amount which they have 
then discounted would have been a South African Rand by implication, 
by inverse logic. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Yes.  That clarification I wanted to get 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 14 of 206 
 
thank you.  And you do indicate that the next day then what is referred 
to as the best and final offer responses are then submitted to the cross 
function evaluation team?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes also by the CFET.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that is the figure that finds its way into 
page 589 Annexure B of 589?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Yes may I say while I – look that 
up. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The table 66A. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Table 6A.  And that is the figure 
10 
which finds its way into 589. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is also the figure which finds its 
way into page 584 which is the table on the opening page of the 
memorandum. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    The memorandum yes.  Okay then I think 
Chair we then have clarified the issues that Mr Callard wanted to deal 
with or dealt with and unless there are any clarities required that will 
bring… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no you may proceed. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  May I just make one comment. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Absolutely. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Please Mr – Counsel just to be 
quite sure.  The table on page 589  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 15 of 206 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Describes how the difference is 
made up and it attributes that 12.3 million as a discount.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As a discount? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  As a – made – the table on page 
11 the make-up at that price which incorporates that 12.3 is to be found 
on page 589 so… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  What do you mean table at page 11? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct the table on page 84. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes okay. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry it has an eleven on it. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Oh okay.  The table at 584?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  584. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That figures discounted by 12 million.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Million the composition…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is what now appears…  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And makeup of that is outlined on 
page 589. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  And now it is that figure that goes into 
the memorandum from the CFET?  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay at 584? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  You – you proceed to then 
express a view that the very  BAFO prices which are now set out in – we 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 16 of 206 
 
know in the memorandum at page 584 do not reflect the real cost of the 
locomotive? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Can you explain why you so conclude?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The estimated total cost of a 
business case or of a memorandum like this would be so that the 
organisation could have an understanding effectively of the – what it is 
going to cost them and of the cash flow.  The memorandum which have 
submitted are not a reflection of the real cost of the locomotives.  The 
– to illustrate this the make-up of a real cost of a locomotive is set out 
10 
in pages 40 and 47 of Annexures 83 and 84 respectively.  May I just 
refer to that briefly/ 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Let us use one of them page 80 – 
Annexure 83 page 40. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That would start at page 639 of BB4[a].  
Apologies BB4[e] my apologies. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  BB4[b]. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  BB4[b] yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  Apologies Chair. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are at BB4[b] and locating Annexure 83.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Annexure 83 that final  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which starts at page 639.  83 Chair.  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 17 of 206 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is where I was and you said sorry and then …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is where you were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it is because I got corrected from the side 
so when I checked my files I got – she misheard – she thought I had 
said a?  So Chair apologies.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We were right – in the right file [b]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Annexure 83. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  Yes Mr Callard we are there.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you.  If I could take you 
through to page 40 which – sorry to page 40. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Typed 40? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The annexure which is page 679. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  679.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What Annexure, w hat page? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Annexure 83 am I correct?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Annexure 83  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And at that annexure you would like us to turn 
to page 679? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  79 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Try and just be consistent and use the number 
– page numbers at the top right hand corner.  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 18 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  My apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The other numbers will confuse us.  Number 679.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  679. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN C ALLARD:  A clear copy of that page because 
it is relatively indistinct can be found in the supplementary on page 23 
of the supplementary Annexure 83.  That has a clear copy of that page.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At what page of the supplement ary? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Page 23 of the supplementary.  
10 
Annexure 80. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is Exhibit BB4  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  [c] 
CHAIRPERSON:  [e]. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  [c] Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [c]? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  [c].  Supplementary BB4[c]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Mr Callard. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Without going through the detail 
Chair I just wish to highlight that the table at the top of that page 
indicates the elements which make up a locomotive price.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 19 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  And we will – if I then may take 
you to again on that page to the second last line and we have covered 
this but I wish to restate the point I will take it forward in a m oment.  
On the second last line from the bottom we have the impact of not 
using TE as a main sub-contractor and will see it is subtracted from 
that because the line below that is the price used for evaluation.   So if 
that is the price used for evaluation I  would now like to – with this 
impact of TE being excluded from this price one cannot use this price 
for evaluation now as a determination well how much does this 
locomotive cost because I have excluded an element of the price?  So 
10 
with these prices making  their way into the memorandum as we have 
seen from the CFET going forward which we have just spoken about the 
price given forward and taken forward into the organisation is not the 
true cost of the locomotive.  The reason or in support of this is and we 
will show later that this TE component price the impact of TE is later 
added back to this cost when they come to determine the actual cost to 
the locomotive.  So by not taking this forward whichever hierarchy 
these memorandums are playing through they are n ot indicative of the 
real cost of a locomotive and that was the key point which I make here.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And I would go back to this point 
was quite a deep one because I refer in 193 that even analysis which I 
did earlier these figures were taken at …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that now 193 of what?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of your … 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 20 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  193 of my …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph 193 of your statement. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Paragraph 193 of the statemen t. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I had also on the first reading this 
assumed this price going forward is a real cost of a locomotive.  It was 
not a real cost of a locomotive.  Calculations I performed on a real cost 
of a locomotive were not on the real cost of a locomotive.  When one 
unpacks this one sees that in fact it was quite different but equally the 
point was made the locomotives are then evaluated not on their real 
10 
cost but on the impact of TE.  We have covered that.  I have subm itted 
that the impact of TE was not part of the evaluation process or should 
not have been part of the evaluation process.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Where you are able to do address the question of 
whether you think some of these things were done deliberately because 
for purposes of the Commission if certain things were not done right but 
it was just genuine mistakes it might not be important if you know what 
is important is when schemes are devised in order to achieve wrong 
objectives.  So just bear that in mind – you know.  They can make lots 
of mistakes and so on and that is not good but that maybe somebody 
20 
else – else’s job to deal with in term - in terms of any competence and 
so on.  So our focus is really on things that may have been done 
deliberately or to deceiv e in order to achieve certain illegal objectives.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Mr Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I accept that you might not always be able to – to say 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 21 of 206 
 
but I just want to remind you that where you are able to say that on a 
properly analysis of certain documents and the facts this must have 
been deliberately done for certain unacceptable objectives but where 
you are not able to say I know that you – you might not be able to say 
in all the cases. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Chair if I may answer you by 
referring to page 156 of my statement – sorry – to paragraph 156 of my 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Through a lengthy process …  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At page 37. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Page 37. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I said: 
“I will cover the following to support my contention 
that the evaluation process was flawed.  First 
prescribing the role of TE as a subcontractor when 
it 
was 
not 
supported 
by 
the 
documentation.  
Secondly, using the prescription of TE as a 
mechanism to adjust the price for evaluation.  The 
20 
third 
element, 
inconsistently 
applying 
the 
prescription of TE across the bidders.”  
In answer to your question those three elements in my opinion 
demonstrate a pattern of events which favoured certain bidders.  I do 
not believe that they can be characterised as mistakes.  For me – to me 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 22 of 206 
 
and in my opinion they demonstrated a pattern of events.  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And before we leave that topic I interpret from 
what you have stated that what is presented in the memo is a 
misrepresentation of the actual cost of the acquisition of the 
locomotive? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And that is point four that I made 
in that one: 
“As a consequence of the above the BAF O prices 
presented 
to 
the 
1 064 
Locomotive 
Steering 
10 
Committee and by extension we have seen how they 
have been taken forward but the – the various were 
not a true reflection of the real cost of the 
locomotive.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the element that is d educted from the 
cost whether in the BAFO or in the original bid to present a misstated 
BAFO will only in the future or in time creep back into the cost for the 
real cost of the locomotive?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  On the electric locomotives what 
was removed as the BAFO – as the impact of TE is later added back 
20 
into the evaluation – into the cost structure of the locomotive.  That is 
the case for the electric locomotives.  I do not see the same patter for 
the diesel locomotives. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Noted.  Thank you.  Have you covered 
everything you – you wanted to tell the Chair about as regards the 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 23 of 206 
 
BAFO not reflecting the true cost?  Is there anything outstanding?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You have? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I am comfortable, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Because you now jump to 2018 this is after 
2014. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before we get to 2018 after your – after this 
process and the submission of the BAFO and before Janu ary 2018 did 
you have anything further to do with this process of acquisition?  Were 
10 
you engaged in the process of acquisition in any form or manner?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As you indicated your paragraph 193 you 
performed a financial analysis in January  2018? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you explain what information you had at 
your disposal at the time and the assumptions you had made?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You deal with then from 195 the January  2018 
price validation and firstly is that flowing from the financial analysis 
you had performed? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No, no.  I was asked to perform a 
financial analysis in January 2018. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 24 of 206 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And in that process I uncovered – 
as I said – pertinent and anonymous information relating to the final 
contract on price and the inconsistencies in the make -up of the 
locomotive price. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now what I want to understand is there is a – 
you have told that you performed a financial analysis.  What – when 
you have a heading “January 2018 Price Validation” we are – we are 
basically talking about information you uncovered in the process of the 
financial analysis? 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  May I take you through that 
process which really starts then at 196?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before you get to 196. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You used to concentre.  You said you conduct 
a financial analysis at 193?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  At just before 195 you have a heading 
“January 2018 Price Validation”.  Those are not two independent 
processes.  It is the same process? 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is the same process. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You just give it a different name?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The same process. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry – they have a different 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 25 of 206 
 
name. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then – then you may take us through what 
you did in that price – that financial analysis and what you uncovered.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And I am taking you through m y 
report from paragraph 196 this is on page 51.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Heading “January 2018” I was 
approached Ms Nomfuyo Galeni and Mr Garry Pita to insist – to assist 
10 
in reconciling the 38.6 billion which was deposited by t he business 
case to the 49.55 billion which excluded options and contingencies 
which was finally contracted for the 1  064 locomotives and this was 
shortly after the publication of the Werksmans Report and Transnet as I 
understood it wanted to develop a for mal response.  I think it is - being 
recorded elsewhere many times.  The Werksmans Report was 
considered inconclusive. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And there were two points to that.  
I was – well I was part of a team that primarily compromised 
20 
Messieurs Yousuf Laher and Mohammed Moola an Executive Manager 
Finance and others participated in a secondary role.  Effectively our 
brief was twofold to show conclusively that forex hedging and 
escalation were included in the business case a nd reconcile – 
secondly, reconcile the 38.6 billion of the business case to the contract 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 26 of 206 
 
amount of 49.5.  The first task of showing that forex and hedging were 
included in the business case was easily completely and we have 
covered that at some length.  Re ferences to the numerous instances 
where it is mentioned and incorporated in the financial models.  I just 
comment it was a personal observation that the business case may 
have been better served if we had clearly indicated in the business 
case that the assumptions around forex and hedging had been clearly 
identified rather than requiring a detailed reading of the business case 
but that is purely a personal observation.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I – I make note that the prices  
used in the locomotives of – I describe the process which I followed 
and I do not know that I need describe the whole thing in the record.  If 
I may just to them – really to the conclusions. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before you do so …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  (Intervenes). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  With your reference to your 196 for the record 
you make reference to the contract finally – the 49.5 billion finally 
contracted for the 1 064 locomotives.  You confirm that that contract 
was concluded in 2014 – March 2014? 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That was the March 2014. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the business case had stated 38.6 billion 
as a total cost – estimated total cost? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is an ETC yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The contracts are concluded at 49.5 billion? 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 27 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
Excluding 
options 
and 
contingencies. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Excluding options and contingencies?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then you – you undertake this exercise to 
determine whether the increase of 49.5 billion was justified in the 
circumstances? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  How could we reconcile it?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Please go ahead. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We – before … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you do that. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I just ask whether the 38 – the 38 billion do you 
move from the premise that that was in order itself before there was an 
increase or is that something you di d not look into? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  What we wish to demonstrate 
Chair or analyse what were the factors which could cause the 38.6 to 
move to a higher price whether it reached – whatever price it reached 
20 
and there were a number of factors which we  considered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, I understand that. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but before you get there I just want to know 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 28 of 206 
 
whether even the 38 billion from where the amount moved up …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether you have done an exercise whether that 
would have been a reasonable price?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The 38.6 was a figure which 
McKinsey developed from their m odel which was in the – put forward in 
the April 2013 business case.  I had seen that model.  I had commented 
on that model and was comfortable with that price.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were comfortable with that?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It had followed very much the 
same figures … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Which we had submitted a - a year 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In (indistinct) or so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is – that is – that is fine. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I was comfortable at that level.  I 
20 
had no reason to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  To dispute that model figure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and what was the period that had lapsed between 
the time when that was the price that was giv en and this 49 billion – 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 29 of 206 
 
over what period.  I just want to have an idea what may have changed 
during that interval. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly.  Two significant time 
lapses Chair.  The one time lapse was the business case was approved 
in April 2013.  It was awarded in March  2017 so that – sorry – 
March 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About a year later? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  About a year later. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  There were significant foreign 
exchange fluctuations …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Over that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  However the request for proposal 
had gone out – if I recall the date correctly - was in July 2013 with a 
closure date in April 2000 - sorry – I forget when the closure date is.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The business case went out in 
July 2013.  May of the bidders put their base price around August  2013 
which was even six months previous prior to the business case.  So 
when we talk of escalation up to award and forex change up to award 
from the bidders perspective it was not from the time which we – the 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 30 of 206 
 
business case was approved but from the time which they did their 
initial calculations.  So which takes it back even slightly further than 
the year of the business case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And while we are on that just so we remind 
ourselves the 38.6 billion that was deposited in the business ca se and 
as you confirmed by McKinsey in their assessment excluded only 
borrowing costs? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Excluded only borrowing costs.  It 
included forex and hedging. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  Alright please proceed.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The process which we followed 
was first to take the original business case.  We created a model which 
replicated the McKinsey model with a high degree of correlation 
because the McKinsey model did not lend itself to this incremental 
analysis.  We created a new model.  Went through stages of 
incremental analysis of here is the business case.  Let us delay the 
business case for a year because it was delayed.  See what the impact 
of the forex on that was.  Having delayed it for a year we then said let 
us then shorten the delivery period because from the initial seven year 
20 
delivery period deposited by the business case it came to three years – 
shorten the delivery period.  Then we changed it to what were the real 
prices used by – tendered by the locomotives.  Then we changed the 
local content not to reflect the 60/40 which was used in the business 
case but to the actual local content as stipulated by the bidders to try 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 31 of 206 
 
and arrive at a figure but long story short on this in retrospect – and I 
make this point – those calculations were flawed because as a going in 
position I used the figures which were presented in the BAFO – in these 
memorandums and have just indicated that those were not the real 
prices of the locomotives.  That was the information which we  had 
available at the time.  So those calculations of January  2018 were 
flawed but in that at that time I became aware of two spreadsheets.  I 
call them the March 2017 negotiation spreadsheets.  One deals with 
diesel.  One deals with electric locomotives.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now before …  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before we get to the spreadsheets …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And I – the Chair has noted that at the time 
you did this financial analysis you worked on the BAFO?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But notwithstanding on your calculation 
insofar as electric locomotives are concerned the ETC taking into 
consideration forex movement in the period between submission of bid  
and conclusion of the tender – of the contract the electric ETC had 
20 
moved to 40.45 billion?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  40.45 that was the total electrical 
and diesel. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Against a 49.5 billion? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 32 of 206 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Contract amount? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes, yes and I make the further 
point in 204.1 bottom of page 52 …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That I had used the same prices 
for diesel and electric locomotives when I corrected this the ETC 
reduced to 39.497 but I stressed that those were wrong prices used in 
this BAFO and we had some debate at the time on the impact of TE and 
my interpretation to the team at that time was the way this was 
presented.  A TE price shoul d not make an impact of the – I was 
10 
unaware of the detail which I had - subsequently I covered to see that 
the TE price should make an impact.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Which leads then to the 205 that 
this initial analysis however as commented earlier does not include the 
premium TE as the BAFO prices used were not the true base price of 
the locomotive. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  Okay, you wanted now to turn to the 
spreadsheets? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  During a big presentation I became 
20 
aware of these two spreadsheets.  I was told …  
CHAIRPERSON:  And where are they? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I think Mr Callard is now at his paragraph 206 
page 53 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 33 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I will highlight the spreadsheets in 
about … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you are still going to go …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To go there? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I will go there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I will go there.  I was told that the 
spreadsheets were restricted and/or confidential and could not gain 
access to them.  I subsequently asked the Freight Rail CFO for access 
10 
to the files and (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  You were told that …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  They were …  
CHAIRPERSON:  You were not to have access to them?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh and who told that? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you cannot remember but that is what you were 
told? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No, I can remember. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Mr Yousuf Laher. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes, are you able to tell me?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Well he said they are restricted …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry Mr Callard.  I think the Chair missed the 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 34 of 206 
 
name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, the name. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You provide the name. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Mr Yousuf Laher. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay.  That is the one who had asked you at 
some stage to work on some  memorandum or something?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  He was part of the team working 
on the same memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The team is – as I mentioned – 
essentially compromised Mr  Yousuf Laher, Mr Mohammed Moola and 
myself and there were others in a secondary role.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  But that was the – the core of the 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The three of us formed the core of 
the team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So he said that you may not have access to the 
20 
spreadsheets? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and what was your reaction to that?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
I 
said 
these 
are 
crucial 
spreadsheets.  They – they appear to have the figures relevant to the – 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 35 of 206 
 
the prices and the – the information we need to come to this conclusion 
of what was the – how do we move from 38.6 to the 49 billion or the 54 
however we wish to interpret it and …  
CHAIRPERSON:  This is still at that time?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
This 
is 
in 
January  2018 
– 
January 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  February 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay alright. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja.  This is part – when I was 
10 
called back to do the analysis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay ja, ja.  After the event? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Way after …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Way after the event. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I was called back to do the 
analysis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay alright. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I see these spreadsheets.  I say 
sorry.  I approached the Transnet Chief Financial Officer and said 
please we need these spreadsheets.  After some days I was given the 
20 
spreadsheets.  By that time …  
CHAIRPERSON:  And who was the Chief Financial Officer at the time – 
2018, January? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That was Ms Nomfuyo Galeni. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  So you got the spreadsheets?  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 36 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Got the spreadsheets. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but before you approached the Chief Financial 
Officer what justification did Mr Laher give to you for saying you may 
not have access to the spreadsheets when you were part of the team?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I cannot recall that – what 
justification was given except that they were confidential.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If there was a further justification 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not aware of what it was?  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It escapes me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  When I received the spreadsheets 
and they are put here.  Could I skip 207 please …?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  But go to 208. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are at 208 of your statement, yes.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  208 of my statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  May I backtrack.  Apologies.  I 
have to backtrack to my statement …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And I need to go to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 37 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Could I go to 159 of my statement 
please?  Page 39 paragraph 159. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay and that is page 39. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Page 39 … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Paragraph 159. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I am referring now to these files of 
Excel spreadsheets and they are crucial to an understanding of the 
development of the final locomotive pricing.  One was for electric 
10 
locomotives and the other was for diesel locomotives.  I mov e to 
paragraph 159.2. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before you do so. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You recall when you first made reference to 
the Excel spreadsheets the Chair wanted to know if they are in you r 
file. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  They are in the file. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now can you – can we identify … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I want us to identify them so that …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  They are annexures. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly, certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We do not keep on talking about spreadsheets.  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 38 of 206 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whoever reads the transcripts where – where are 
they? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Fine.  Chair could I take you first 
to the diesel locomotives please .  I will use the diesel ones which are 
Annexure 77 …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In the second bundle and they are 
at page 622. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well is it BB …  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  BB … 
CHAIRPERSON:  4B. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  4B Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not second bundle. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That wil confuse.  So okay.  Did you say Annexure 7?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Can we start at Annexure 77 
please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Is there – I do not seem to have 
Annexure 77B. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I only have 77. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  77. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think he said 77B. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 39 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  67. 
CHAIRPERSON:  67. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  67. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  67. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The – the annexure … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that one of the spreadsheets? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is one of the spreadsheets. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  There are – there are – the diesel 
locomotives are covered under 67 – Annexures 67, 68, 69, 70 and 71 
because they have various  worksheets in the file and the various 
worksheets have a – a significance to them.  If I could take you through 
please first to annexure … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry Mr Callard … 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And again for record pur poses. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now response to the question whether or not 
you have the Excel spreadsheets in your record …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 40 of 206 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You have referred the Chair to Annexure 77 
and you say that it is in respect of the diesel locomotives?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Annexure …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  67 – my apologies. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is in respect of the diesel locomotives?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You then just mentioned other annexures.  
Should we note that they also are spreadsheets – Excel spreadsheets 
and that they relate to the diesel locomotives or what point were you 
10 
seeking to make? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I was going to go through – let us 
record all the spreadsheets first.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay (intervenes). 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Then we have electric - the 
spreadsheets for the electric locomotives which go from Annexure 60 – 
70- sorry 67 to 72. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – but are we done with the spreadsheet for diesel 
locomotives? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    No I was just going to bring them 
20 
all into the record but I wanted to take you through the Annexure, 
through the spreadsheets themselves.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay what I thought you would do is first tell – say 
to us the spreadsheet for diesel locomotives is found from page so and 
so to page so and so if it’s more than one spreadsheet you say they are 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 41 of 206 
 
found – those for diesel locomotives are f ound from that to that and 
then we go to the ones for electric locomotives, is that convenient to 
you or is that inconvenient?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     No very convenient, I will try and 
follow that…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Mr Callard perhaps if I may assist, you have 
done precisely what the Chair requested, your paragraph 1591 if I read 
it correctly at page 39.  You do indicate there that you are attach 
Annexure 67 through to 72 as worksheets for the electric locomotives 
and from Annexure 73 through to 77 for diesel, is that correct?  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay it is there in the statement what – so that one 
– when one goes through the Annexures, maybe one can make a note 
so you can – so one can see them without going to the statement but 
one can find them, it’s okay it’s not a problem.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay so we’ve located which excel 
spreadsheets relates to which acquisition as per you 1591.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     I would also add that I – and 
then turning through to – I added three additional spreadsheets.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay. 
MR 
FRANCIS 
QUENTIN 
CALLARD: 
 
 
 
 
Which 
are 
described…(intervention). 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 42 of 206 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Do you want to refer to your paragraph 207 
that’s where you speak of additional worksheets.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes on paragraph 207 I added 
three further Annexures. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Yes.     
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Because the spreadsheets are 
difficult to interpret one has to page through spreadsheet by 
spreadsheet, I added three further spreadsheets which – where I 
10 
extracted the information from the existing spreadsheets and presented 
it on a side by side basis for easy comparison.  This was Annexure 78, 
Annexure 78 for the diesel locomotives and Annexures 79 for CSR 
locomotives and Annexure 80 for BT sometimes also referred to as 
Bombardier those are used synonymously. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay so for us not to get confused, we 
know 67 and 72 are the actual spreadsheets you received, they are not 
your creation. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes not my creation. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And that is so far as the electrical 
20 
locomotives is concerned, 73 to 77 are the diesel spreadsheets?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     You take both sets of spreadsheets and 
then you create Annexure 78, 79 and 80.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 43 of 206 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And that is just for ease of comparison.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay so those 78.79, 80 are your creation 
whereas the first lot is official Transnet documentation?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     The – yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I may add that on the official 
Transnet documentation you might find some – occasionally some 
arrows which I have pointed to highlight where some figur es go to the 
other but the numbers are unchanged.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay, alright we found our – we’ve got our 
bearings now you may take us through them.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     As an example of the – or for the 
diesel one, and I would like to  start with the diesel first please.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Which is now…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     Are you going to spreadsheets now?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I’m going to the spreadsheet and I 
would like, first just to illustrate why the spreadsheet is important and I 
would like to take us please to – media, media – to Annexure 76.    
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     That’s at BB4(b) page 620. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     And – page 620 and I’d like us to 
turn to page 621 please, it is a A3 page. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     621? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     621. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 44 of 206 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     The left-hand title on the page 
where I say media 17 t h of March that is my creation on the page fo r 
identification purposes, I extracted that to print.  On the left -hand side 
of the page, the print negotiations, diesel 17 t h of March 2014, that is 
also my creation on the page to reference it, to reference the printout 
of the page but immediately below t hat it has awarded 465 diesel 
locomotive contract.  This one is entitled, media, this was what was 
given to the media as the result for the award of the tender.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     You say this one was titled, media, where 
10 
do we see media on that page?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     You’ll see media on the top 
right-hand side…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     You said that’s your addition, that’s what 
you inserted. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     That’s my identification of the 
print page. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     As well as print negotiations, 
diesel is my identification of the print page.  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Now without your additions how is that page 
to be identified? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    It would be identified in the 
worksheet – sorry in the excel spreadsheets and there are multiple 
spreadsheets, it’s simply called media.  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 45 of 206 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Media, okay thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Soft copies are available and it 
was just to identify the page – excel sheets have multiple pages and 
this was to identified the page that was being used.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes, you may proceed. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Thank you, on the left-hand side 
it has, award of the 465 diesel locomotive contract and it details there 
the best and final offer per Board’s submission, we see again the CNR 
23 – 27.3billion rounded, we see the GE amount and then it has, 
adjusted for changes, and there are four lines there which are blank.  It 
10 
has a best and final offer updated to the 17 t h of March then it has 
various adjustment lines which are blank.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Then it has new price including 
TE scope, we have two figures there for cost to fix escalation to end  of 
contract, cost of hedging and we have then a line called the final 
locomotive cost and two further lines, estimated total cost excluding 
hedging and escalation and estimated total cost including hedging and 
escalation.  The totals for the diesels there , including hedging and 
escalation we’ll see is 18.375billion.  That is the component of the 
20 
diesel price that was finally awarded.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     If we could take a step back. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     It starts with a best and final offer entry 
let’s take CNR at 27billion. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 46 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     It then indicates that certain adjustments 
are made as listed thereunder but the detail is not provided.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And it just reflects an interest from the 27 
to 34. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Correct.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay now further adjustments are made to 
incorporate the TE scope. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And the TE scope is then costed at 4.8?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     No that is cost to fix escalation 
to end of contract under that line.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay and what is the TE scope there?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     It is blank in this line. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     It’s blank again. Then after fixing escalation 
and costs of hedging, we get a new price of 42?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     That’s the final locomotive cost?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay, you indicate – then the next line 
suggests that estimated total cost excluding hedging and escalation is 
14, is that so? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     May I take that one step further, 
we have a locomotive cost of 42.875 020 million for 232 locomotives 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 47 of 206 
 
which we’ll see at the top under CNR.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Multiply 232 by the 48 – 
42million point 8 rounded. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     We get 7.888billion. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     With a similar exercise for GE 
those two figures are then added up to the 14billion, if we take that to 
the next line where they include the hedging and escalation, we get t he 
10 
18billion total amount for the diesels.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay – oh thank you Chair.  We – final 
locomotive costs, I’m trying to reconcile the final locomotive cost of 
42billion, is that 42million?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     That is 42million per item. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     My apologies, yes okay. 
MR 
FRANCIS 
QUENTIN 
CALLARD: 
 
 
 
 
42million 
times 
the…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Times the number of locomotives. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Times number of locomotives to 
20 
give us that final cost. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   The reason I bring this – refer to 
this sheet first is that this was the media statement and it reflected how 
the amount was made up, this is what we contracted on.  If I may take 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 48 of 206 
 
us…(intervention).   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     If I may understand, so what was 
communicated to the media is that the total cost of acquisition of the 
diesel locomotives is 9billion is that a correct understanding of 
that…(intervention). 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLAR D:     9billion for CNR. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     That’s what’s communicated to the media?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     That’s what was communicated. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     May I be very specific, I cannot 
10 
state categorically how it was communicated to the media it’s called the 
media sheet but certainly, internally this was how we received the 
makeup. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     If I may then go back one 
Annexure to Annexure 75. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Still in BB4(b).  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Still in BB4(b). 
CHAIRPERSON:     What page again? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     616 Chair, that’s where 75 starts.  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     And go to page 617. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay and before you deal with the content 
are we correct to say to right-hand corner the word negotiations is 
inserted by you to assist in identifying the name of the file?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 49 of 206 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And equally so the pr ice print negotiation 
diesel 17 March is also your addition for purposes of identification?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay and can I accept that in the actual 
excel spreadsheets, that particular file is called, negotia tion? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay, will do thank you, you may proceed.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     If we may look at the table at the 
bottom right-hand – bottom left-hand corner it is called, latest offers, 
and you will see it has a line called BAFO and we have various lines 
10 
going down there right to the very last line, coloured in green, and it 
has a price there under CSR of 42.875 020 which agrees with the figure 
which was in the media file which we have just r eferred to. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     And similarly for the General 
Electric locomotive. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay the 36,174 also. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     What is now apparent from this 
20 
or what comes from this, is we now have an indication of the breakdown 
of the prices. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Those elements that were 
missing from the media statement are now on this sheet where they talk 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 50 of 206 
 
to, and I read from the top, 
 
“1) we have BAFO, 2) the exchange rate impact on the loco, 
 
escalation up to signature date.  Warranty/SD bond cost 
 
removal is the third line, fixed cost Forex adjustment on the 
 
other items and batch pricing adjustment”. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Recall – we’ll go into the batch 
pricing in a moment we then get a new price, then we add cost of new 
TE scope so we have another addition of TE scope here.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     A discount, price to fix the TE 
scope including escalation and hedging going forward and then cost to 
fix escalation going forward. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    This sheet now gives us a 
breakdown of how the various elements of the price and would explain 
the makeup of the price.  The – if I may just draw some attention to 
some apparent anomalies on …(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:     Before you do that Mr Callard please don’t f orget 
the point you wanted to say at some stage – I don’t want to forget this, 
20 
at some stage tell me whether, after you had seen the contents of the 
spreadsheets, whether you were able to deuce what the reason was 
why Mr Leher said you should not have acce ss to it or that it was 
confidential, you don’t have to deal with it now if it’s not convenient, as 
long as at some stage you deal with it.  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 51 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I’m happy to deal with it now Mr 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CA LLARD:     From what we have here, there 
is one point I will make now.  This gives us an indication of the 
breakdown of the prices which is what in fact we were tasked to 
achieve, how did we arrive at these final prices.  I will jump to a final 
point in my statement that I was disappointed that Mr Leher did not 
share this because with this information, why did we have to go through 
an exercise but from perusal of these spreadsheets and particularly 
10 
here one picks up a number of anomalies and I would take on e through 
those anomalies and perhaps those anomalies are problematic.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay well I was  - I’m interested in hearing whether 
the conclusion you are able to make or the conclusion you are able to 
make is that the reason why he may have not w anted you to see the 
spreadsheets was some illegitimate reason because the spreadsheet 
would give you information that he didn’t want you to know.  So – but 
as I say you can deal with it later if that’s convenient but if you want to 
deal with it now it’s fine. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     Your question, Mr Chair, I would 
20 
not like to say what was in his mind as to why he did not want to give it 
to me, what I can certainly…(intervention).  
CHAIRPESON:    That’s fine yes.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   What I can certainly say is that 
the information contained in these spreadsheets…(intervention).   
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 52 of 206 
 
CHAIRPERSON:     Is highly relevant. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     Is highly relevant and the 
workings that we deduce from the spreadsheets – I’ve been working 
back from what was negotiations – sorry from the media statement to 
negotiations, there are earlier statements of the diesels excluding TE 
and the base cost and if one traces the path through those 
spreadsheets they demonstrate a pattern of numbers which a re cause 
for concern, they show in the spreadsheets, elements or unexplained 
variations in the foreign exchange amounts which show that those 
unexplained variations in foreign exchange amounts influence the 
10 
prices which have been reflected, equally in the final price of this 
negotiation – of which we have seen here, if we were to accept the 
foreign exchange amounts which they have here then  the local content 
– the award does not meet the local content, if the foreign exchange 
amounts are reflected here but there are – one can see how, in areas, 
the foreign exchange amounts have been brought into these final 
escalations. 
CHAIRPRERSON:     Thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    And if I may just…(intervention).  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Mr Callard? 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Before you go into the detail of that 
spreadsheet if I may follow -up on the Chair’s question and perhaps ask 
this question, having had access to the spreadsheets and being able to 
analyse them and understa nd them, are you of the view that you were 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 53 of 206 
 
originally denied access thereto because there was an intention to 
conceal precisely that which you subsequently established?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     That is my interpretation yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   Thank you.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     That is my interpretation. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     You want to take us to the detail of the 
table then? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     If I may just…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     I’m sorry, you wouldn’t know woul d you whether 
that you shouldn’t have access to these spreadsheets was simply Mr 
10 
Leher’s decision or whether he was just carrying out somebody else’s 
instruction that certain people mustn’t see – certain people including 
you, mustn’t see these spreadsheets ? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I cannot say whether it was his 
decision or an instruction, I can’t say Mr Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Thank you Mr Callard.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     If I may, just on page 61 – may I 
refer to the diesels where we put them all together and take you please 
to the diesel ones as a relevant and that is the…(intervention).  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Paragraph 207, is that 207.1, you want to 
take us through that spreadsheet where you do a co mparison. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    The spreadsheet where I do the 
comparison.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Please consider your 207.1 paragraph, is 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 54 of 206 
 
that the Annexure you are looking for?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     207.1 of the diesel locomotives, 
Annexure 78. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay and that is BB42(b) at page 624.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    624?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    And I’m looking at page 625.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay you go overleaf to 625. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     The first – this spreadsheet is 
my 
compilation, 
I 
have 
taken 
the 
figures 
from 
the 
previous 
10 
spreadsheets and put them on a basis of side by side for purposes of 
comparison.  This spreadsheet has both CNR and GE the first three 
columns relate to CNR the columns 4 to 6 relate to GE on the right -
hand side.  I’d like to take us through the CNR  columns first please 
and there are three columns.  The first one is headed, base 
price…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Are we at 625 or 626? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Page 625. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Well the first column would it not be the big one 
which doesn’t have best base price and then – or you’d say the first of 
20 
the smaller columns? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     The first of the smaller columns 
on 625. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, alright.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Perhaps it might help to identify it this way, 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 55 of 206 
 
the first main column list all the items taken into consideration, 
numbered 1 to 27. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay so all that will be applicable across 
the spreadsheet. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Across the spreadsheet, correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Then when you speak of first column it’s 
this – actually physically the second column.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Or first small column. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     First small column yes, headed base price, 
10 
that’s your first column. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     The first small column is headed 
base price, bidder one, CNR. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes we have found that. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     The second small column is 
headed base price excluding TE, bidder one, CNR.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     And the third column is headed, 
negotiations, bidder one, CNR. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELL O:     Okay. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     You’ll see the spreadsheet has 
various colours and some of them are the cells – worksheet cells are in 
yellow. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes, now before you go further you have 
base price, bidder one, CNR and it’s in different colours, grey, blue, 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 56 of 206 
 
yellow. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     But after each column you have a clear and 
coloured column for a better – if I may use that term, the white one.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     The white one. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     The clear white column which doesn’t have 
a heading, it seems to follow, it comes after each column.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     We’ve got base one, bidder one, CNR.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And it is populated right through per item.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Immediately next to it is a white column that 
has…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh are those columns as well I thought they were 
spaces (indistinct).  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     If they’re spaces in-between column. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Call them spaces. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:     They are spaces (indistinct). 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And then to understand, how do we relate 
the columns to the spaces. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Yes.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     How do we relate that? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     Well we relate the columns to 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 57 of 206 
 
the spaces and that they generally are – show some information in that 
for example between the first small column and the second small 
column in that white space that first amount we have there is a minus   
12 375 831 which relates to the discount which we have been talking 
about earlier from CNR and it shows a change from the – may I take 
you through that – we had that line called one, base price as per 
technical specification. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     On the extreme left-hand side, 
take that through the base price was initially given as 39.7million 
10 
rounded. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     We have been through the 
reduction which is – and the BAFO price and we’ve seen the – 
approximately 12million reduction there and the new figure is in there 
of 27.3million rounded.  The differenc e I have highlighted in that white 
space in-between. 
ADV 
MAHLAPE 
SELLO: 
 
 
 
 
So 
you 
inserted 
that 
difference…(intervention)  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I inserted that difference. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay in the white columns. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes I did. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     So my question was,  can we follow the 
same pattern, the information in the white columns for lack of a better 
term are – is what is introduced by you?  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 58 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct, correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay, in comparing the various main 
columns? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay, now then if we deal with – just so we 
don’t lose it tomorrow, that base price of 39million and then the base 
price excluding TE of 27million that information at least we can glean 
from the response by TNR which indicated that it had reduced its price 
from 39 to 27, those are the two figures.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     The figure that you have in-between the two 
columns of 12million rounded, that is the difference between the two?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Thank you, you may proceed. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Thank you, I spoke of anomalist 
variations in the foreign exchange component. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Could we go down on the 
extreme left-hand side we have the lines 19 and 20, import content, 
foreign value first rate and import content foreign value second rate.  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Let’s deal with line 19 first 
please, import content foreign value, first rate.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Under the base price which is 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 59 of 206 
 
now the first column, that is given as US Dollars and I would round it 
484 000 rounded. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   In the second column it is yellow 
and it is now given as 493  000 dollars rounded.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Small change, small increase and 
I’m not questioning that increase but if we now go to the third column.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Which is called, negotiations, we 
10 
will see that the US Dollar component as in this s preadsheet jumps to 
918 000 dollars effectively – virtually doubling the imported content in 
US Dollar terms. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    If we go to the second line which 
is the import content foreign value second rate, line  20.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Under bidder price – under the 
base price for bidder 1 that is the first small column it is 993  000 euros 
rounded.  In the second column…  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  When it comes to base cost 
excluding TE that euro decreases to 325  000.  That is a drop of 
668 000 euros. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 60 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  That is substantial.    Yet when we 
go to the negotiations column the euros now increase to 774.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  I just draw the back to the letter 
from – sorry.  The letter from CNR which said that their foreign 
exchange component remains the same as in their April 2013 offer and 
yet we see this variation across the foreign components here. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  These foreign components by 
multiplying the – them by the exchange rates of the day could I take 
10 
you to like 26 please? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Line 26 in the first small column in 
2.7 million rounded. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And just for record purpose line 26 is headed 
Additional cost to add to base price.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Add to base price. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That 2.7 million is a function of the 
United States Dollar rate times the exchange rate of the day which we 
20 
see up there as first exchange rate used by bidder line 14.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Added to the import – the line 20 
the import content foreign value the euro value times the euro 
exchange rate applicable which was in line 15 second exchange rate 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 61 of 206 
 
used by bidder euro. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Effectively one takes United States 
Dollars times it by the exchange rate, the euros times it by the 
exchange rate add the two together and that gives us the additional 
cost to add to the base price. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And what line 14 tells us is that the rate, the 
US exchange rate at the time and for bidder 1 used a 9 to the dollar 
exchange rate? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct and that is… 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And at line 15 it gives you the exchange rate 
for the euro at 11.86? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And then it changes to 12 and 12. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then it changes during base cost 
including TE to 9 the US exchange remains the same, the EU exchange 
rate changes to 12? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is lines 14 and 15. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where – where in those columns the currency is not 
written what must we take it to be?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where – where the figures do not indicate the 
currency.  You see some of the figures you have got US Dollar and so 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 62 of 206 
 
on but other figures do not – some of the – and then you have got Euro 
and then others you do not have the currency.  Which currency should 
we be… 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Other figures are in rand Mr Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Right in rand? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In rand yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.  So the purpose of this was to 
take the imported content and convert it to the change in the imported 
content and convert it to rand . 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  So the 2.7 million and I would just 
like to correct the impression I gave earlier.  Is taking the – made of 
the 484 000 US Dollars times the difference in the exchange rate.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Similarly for the Euro it is the 
difference between the two exchange rates.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And that gives us 2. – the 2.7 
million. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the 2.7 at line 16 the additional cos t is 
the rand equivalent of the foreign exchange?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Quoted okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The impact of the foreign 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 63 of 206 
 
exchange. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Taking forward.  If we then take 
that to base cost excluding TE. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Which is now the second column 
and we see that the US Dollar remains the same but the Euro has been 
significantly reduced. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The bottom line around this is that 
10 
the additional cost to add to the base price has changed from not 
adding 2.7 million. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  But we now add 1.3. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  1.3 million. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At line 26? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I would show later how I believe 
20 
this figure is in fact taken into the evaluation calculations per se.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  But going to lie – column 3 where 
we now see this significant increase in the foreign exchange 
components.  We have seen the US Dollar go to 918  000 and the Euros 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 64 of 206 
 
go to 774 000. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The additional cost to add to the 
base price now increases to 3.7 million.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  You will see there is an arrow 
touching on the 3.7 million. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now before you get to that arrow let us look 
at the additional cost as reflected in line 26?  Base price is 2.7 and we 
take that base price to be as at the date of submission of the bid?  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No that is now the first base price 
is – was normalised to the 11 February.  The…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  11 February what date?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  2013. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  This is 11 February 2013. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is the green column. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  2013. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If you look at the – that movement under base 
cost excluding TE and what period was the – TE being excluded?  Was 
20 
that in… 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That one would have been January 
– the January 2014. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  January 2014. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  January 2014. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 65 of 206 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then the negotiations column?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The negotiations column should 
correctly be around the time the negotiations March 2014.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  You wanted to deal with the 3.765 
130 item 26 under negotiations?  
 MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If we turn over to page 626. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  626 is the same worksheet I had 
10 
printed over two pages. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And we will see…  
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not forget the point you wanted to make about 
the arrow? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ah – yes the point – it is an 
observation Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That where we have columns in 
yellow highlighted in yellow. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  My analysis of this is that the 
columns in yellow need to be scrutinised very carefu lly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 66 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  And I will show where this comes 
through now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In fact this is part of that exercise.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You – before we dated or we provided dates 
to these various columns you had indicted there is an arrow that leads 
to that 3.3,65 odd at line 26. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Under Negotiations. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the Chair was just reminding that you are 
moving on to that point now. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You have not forgotten it please?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think – I think he has just dealt with it.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was back – it was the arrow at page 625. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  625. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and he says where there is y ellow in the columns it 
means that those figures need a lot of scrutiny.  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 67 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In depth interrogation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In depth interrogation and what we are doing is part 
of that exercise. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  I hope the Chair and Mr Callard are not 
talking past one another but it shall become clarified soon.  I have a 
sneaky suspicion that they are but…  
CHAIRPERSON:  No no do not. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I think we are  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we understand each other.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We understand. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No as long as you understand each other 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we do not want to leave you behind.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I will try and catch up Chair.  I will play catch -
up.  Mr Callard. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Okay.  So to recap. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  On page 625. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  At the – near the bottom of the 
20 
page we have additional cost to add to base price.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  With the top of that arrow 3.765 
million. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 68 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If we turn over to page 626. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  There are two columns there one 
is headed CNR and the other headed GE. The CNR one is in the centre 
of the page. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  The CNR column again gives the 
same break down of the price as we have seen earlier in negotiations 
and the media as set out in the total cost at the bottom we have 42  875 
million for a CNR Locomotive. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  At the top of that column we see 
that arrow coming down again. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And it comes up to 3765. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And if we look to the left hand side 
we will see that is the exchange rate impact on locomotives.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  That is the exchange rate impact 
20 
on the locomotive up to the time of award.  If that is – exchange rate 
impact of the locomotive at 375 million up to time of the award and it is 
now included this total make -up of the price and we turn back over the 
page and I have highlighted what I believ e to be unexplained variations 
in the foreign content.  This brings to me this 375 into question.   
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 69 of 206 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Mr Chair as I use this as one 
example because I find this type of inconsistency across many of the 
spread sheets but I highlight this as one key example of this.  May I 
then return back to page 626?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And by way of illustration if we 
were to assume that the GENC and our locomotives are relatively 
similar.  They are both diesel locomotives with equivalent power and 
output.  On page 626 you will see cells marked in beige, a deep beige, 
10 
a light brown. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And I have put – highlighted that 
as a percentage of BAFO.  And I make the comment ‘there is a wide 
variation in percentage increases on the BAFO prices which is 
unusual’.  We compare a base GE price of 24 million rounded with a 
base CNR price of 27 million rounded and we have seen that.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yet one would on the reasonable 
assumption that the local content or the foreign content of the 
20 
locomotive may vary by one or two percent.  Not to say that everybody 
will be exactly the same.  But the exchange rate impact on  the BAFO of 
CNR is of that 3.7 million we have been talking about.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is 13.8% of the BAFO price.  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 70 of 206 
 
Similarly for General Electric it is 8.23%.  That is I contend – and that 
is quite a variation.  If we look at the escalation up to signature date.  
Now escalation is the South African escalation with – with the imported 
escalation.  But given the imported escalation as we have mentioned in 
the business case and elsewhere that is pretty stable and flat a nd we 
have said 2%.  The escalation up to signature date for CNR of that 3.4 
million is 12.8%.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  By comparison the GE escalation 
as recorded here and please I am making no assumptions these figures 
10 
are correct.  I am purely saying what is recorded and what is shown as 
– makes up the price.  The GE escalation is 1. – is 2% effectively that 
difference is significant. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You – you said you make no assumption I thought you 
actually do make the assumption that they are correct?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  They… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise you cannot – you cannot do this exercise. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The figures are what are reflected 
into the final prices because these final – these are the final prices. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but what you mean is you have not gone behind 
that to check if they are correct?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I have not gone behind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you actually assume that they are correct?  You 
said you do not assume if they are correct. You said you make no 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 71 of 206 
 
assumption that they are correct. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I have not – 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Mr Chair we have not been able to 
get behind these figures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes so you assume that they are correct?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or am I misunderstanding you?  If you have not 
checked whether they are correct you – but you work on the basis that 
they are correct we would say you assume that th ey are correct, is it 
10 
not or am I missing something in what you said?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Let me just say this Mr Chairman.  
The figures as presented. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Show significant variations and 
unexplained variations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is the point I would …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes, yes you make a conclusion on the basis of 
20 
the figures as they are presented.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Are presented yes . 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether they are correct or not you do not know but 
you – what you can justify if your conclusion?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 72 of 206 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then if…  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think we understand each other Mr Callard.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  When we deal – when you deal with that page 
the two columns and I take it now we understand the two columns are 
there.  One headed CNR and the other headed GE on the right?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLAR D:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Those columns and the…  
CHAIRPERSON:  And the white space in between Ms Sello.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The white spaces does not count – no Chair.  
This time it is not a column I can tell.  The information contained in the 
respective columns is derived from the documentation.  You have 
uplifted it as it is? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  This is as it comes from the 
spreadsheet. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  What I have added to this is…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The comment in the centre? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The comment in the centre. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Where you express a view that you find the 
increase is unusual? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  What you also have added are the beige 
portions on either side of the column?  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 73 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which is a calculation of the percentage 
adjustment that each figure represents relative to the BAFO?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  But whether or not the actual figures 
inputted there are correct you have not done that calculation, that 
determination? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And… 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I have to add this because it 
cannot find the – the logic that would support some of these figures.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We have not found the logic that 
would support some of these – many of these figures.  That – I use that 
to show the inconsistency in the diesels.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  And before you more off that entry 3 
escalation up to signature date you have 3498 odd for CNR, right?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  3… 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  An escalation up to signature date?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Escalation up to sig – yes 349. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that is what the escalation would be for 
CNR? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 74 of 206 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  For GE under the same item you have 484 ? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is what is shown on the piece 
of paper? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Absolutely. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I accept. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I do not want the word you there. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No, no.  Alright it – 484 is reflected? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As an escalation up to signature date?  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Regard being heard to the – before I say – 
your analysis of that is that for GE the escalation would represent 
1.99% of BAFO?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Of BAFO price yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  For CNR it would represent 12.8%? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now regard being had to the fact that the 
closing date was the same. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The bids came in more or less on the same 
dates? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that signature date would have been the 
same? 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 75 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Can you explain why the impact of escalation 
for the one would be 1.99% and for the other would be 12.8%.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I cannot explain it. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Oh okay.  Thank you.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And that is why I described 
elements of these figures as being anomalous and deserving of further 
interrogation and investigation.  I believe these figures cannot be 
explained or I certainly cannot explain the [indistinct] of these figures.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  And CNR and GE were competitors for – 
10 
in this bid? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Another glaring one correct me if I am wrong 
is item 6 batch pricing adjustment.  For CNR it is 1%, for GE oh no they 
have reverse roles it is now 12.98%.  Now and I take it you cannot 
explain that as well? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Cannot explain it. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If you were to guide the Chair who must be 
turn to for an explanation?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I make the point later in my 
20 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that other than GE and CNR?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Other than GE and CNR it is – they – those 
who inputted these figures into the excel spreadsheets to try and 
explain to us why this anomaly.  To whom would you suggest we turn? 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 76 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  May I refer to paragraph 2.11.1 of 
my statement. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Say the number again please?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  2.11.1  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Top of page 56. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We at 56 at the top paragraph. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry I – let me go to 2.11.  2.11 
please bottom of page 55. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Mr Jooste Laher is the primary 
author of these two excel spre adsheets.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry first you said 2.11.1?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  2.11. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then we back tracked a bit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Bottom of the page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Bottom to 2.11. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Chair you asked me who should we 
turn to? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sorry Counsel you asked me who 
should we turn to?  I say that Mr Laher is the primary author of  these 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 77 of 206 
 
two excel spreadsheets.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  He was also a signatory to the 
BAFO evaluation of the 15 January 2014 and he was furthermore a 
member of the negotiation team for the 1064 locomotives comprising 
inter alia Mr Molefe, Mr Singh, Mr Gama, Mr Pita, Mr Giani, Ms 
Mdletshe and Mr Ndiphiwe Silinga who was the general manager Group 
Legal Services. But with knowledge of this spreadsheets and viewpoint 
and this was – I turn over to page 56.  I was disappointed that  the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry turn over to?  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  To page 56. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  2.11.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but you – have you just made the point in 
regard to paragraph 2.11 that it is Mr Laher as the author of the two 
spreadsheets that we should tend to?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  For the detailed explanation yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I see at that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Is Mr Laher still with Transnet or is he 
20 
[indistinct]? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes he is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is still there? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 78 of 206 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is he one of the witnesses coming or not?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The engagements have…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Not in the list. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Have been had with Mr Laher. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will address the Chair as to how…  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  When and – to present Mr Laher before you 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  In my paragraph 2.11.1. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  At the top of page 56.  With this 
knowledge which I have gleaned from the spreadsheet and similar 
through the electrics I was disappointed that the exercise undertaken in 
January 18 in good faith to determine the increases.  It was undertaken 
20 
in good faith but Mr Laher with full knowledge of the pricing, detail and 
negotiations chose not to share this knowledge including the 
spreadsheets and evaluation reports with the members of the team to 
arrive at an honest and accurate assessment of the increase in the ETC 
from 38.6 billion to around 49.55 billion or 54 billion if the options are 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 79 of 206 
 
included.  That is…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We could explore further the 
electrics and the like but I make the point in the diesels.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  [Mumbling}. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am sorry I am trying to understand the 
reference to in good faith in the second line.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I was contracted in … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  He was acting in …  
CHAIRPERSON:  What you mean is the exercise in which yo u were 
10 
involved. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The exercise in January 2018  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was in good faith that exercise?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I came there in good faith to 
conduct this exercise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We had this team of which Mr 
Muller and Mr Laher were part of the team.  He had full knowledge of 
the spreadsheet and I indicated that he …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Did not wish to share this 
spreadsheet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  When I eventually gained access 
to the spreadsheet. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 80 of 206 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And was able to undertake this 
exercise and see what was happening.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I was disappointed that the 
spreadsheet was not shared. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Had not.  Yes, no, no that is fine.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is the point I was making Mr 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
10 
ADV 
MAHLAPE 
SELLO: 
 
So 
if 
we 
understand 
correctly 
the 
spreadsheets do demonstrate how the price moves from 38 billion to 49 
billion? 
 MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which is what you were trying to establish?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is why you cannot understand why he did not 
20 
share the spreadsheets with you?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mine is slightly different Chair is if the 
spreadsheets. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 81 of 206 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Established precisely that point what was the 
point of undertaking the exercise because it just takes reference by Mr 
Laher to the very spreadsheets at his disposal and he will have a key 
understanding of how 49 billion is arrived at, is that not the case? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That should have been the case 
yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So there is – there are – there is no further 
investigation or calculation you had to do to explain the jump from 38 
to 49 billion?  All that informa tion is in the spreadsheets already?  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  With the… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  May I paraphrase?  Can I – I would like to 
rephrase that please? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If Mr Laher had regard to the spreadsheets at 
his disposal would he have had a clear understanding of how the ETC 
moves from 38 to 49 billion which is the question he had posed to you?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I – if I may answer in a slightly 
convoluted manner. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The elements of the price 
movement or makeup from 39 to 49 or 54 whichever figure you want…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Are set out in here. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 82 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I made the point earlier that there 
are anomalies here that I cannot explain and I believe it very difficult to 
explain.  It is possible that Mr Laher did not share the spreadsheet 
because he did not wish to explain the anomaly or did not wish to be 
questioned on the anomaly and that is possibly why the spreadsheet 
was restricted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to remind me he was the one that – was he the 
one that asked that the exercise be done?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No it was Mr Garry Pita and Mr 
Nomfuyo Galeni who asked that the exercise be done. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And do you know whether they were aware of 
the existence of these spreadsheets at the time that you were asking to 
see the spreadsheets? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:   I do not know if they were aware.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I do not – it is my impression and 
recollection from the interactions we had that they were not aware.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Because my recollection is that in 
my engagement with Mr Nomfuyo Galeni for access to the spreadsheet 
20 
she was not aware – she gave the – I was under the impression from 
my interaction she was not aware of the existence of this particular 
spreadsheet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean even the Chief Financial Officer was not 
aware? 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 83 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the impression you got?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That is the impression I got yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Be … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes just to go back to Ms  Sello’s question.  As I 
understand it I think what she wanted to find out but if – if he is not the 
one that asked that the – the exercise be done maybe that is …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The explanation to her question is …  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that it was somebody else that asked that the 
question – the exercise be done but maybe to follow up on that 
question if Mr Laher understood the spreadsheets the way you 
understood them after you have had access to them then except for th e 
issue of confidentiality that I understand he raised then his response 
when he heard that this exercise was being done should have been – 
there is a spreadsheet that explains and share it with everybody.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So except for the fact that he might not have wanted 
20 
you and maybe the others to know about the spreadsheets that is what 
– that is the reaction one would have expected if he was aware of these 
and he understood the contents of the spreadsheets the way you  
understand them.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And that was the essence of my 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 84 of 206 
 
point in 2011.1 Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But Mr Callard I think it goes further than that 
if I may.  At 197 having been requested by Galeni and Pita to do this 
through reconciliation at your paragraph 196 …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You state at 197 and I quote: 
“I was part of a team that primarily comprised 
10 
Yousuf Laher and Mohammed Moola …” 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
 
“…Executive 
Manager 
Finance 
Freight …” 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  “…and the purpose was to show 
conclusively that forex hedging and escalation were 
included in the business case.”  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And in order to undertake that exercise 
20 
reference is then had to the spreadsheets which contain that 
information.  So it comes back to the same point.  so although the 
request was not from Mr Laher, Mr Laher participated in a process to 
answer a question that could very well have been answered by 
provision of the … 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 85 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja, the spreadsheets. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Spreadsheets.  Is that a fair summation?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Fair summation. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know of any reason why Mr  Laher despite 
knowing of the existence of these spreadsheets he might not have 
understood the – the spreadsheets.  In other words – I mean - for 
example my question goes to if something really requires numbers if – 
if somebody is an accountant you would – he would know that or she 
would know that quite easily.  Therefore you can exclude lack of 
10 
understanding of those figures but if it is so mebody maybe that 
requires knowledge of numbers and they are not good at numbers you 
might say okay maybe he did have them but did not understand them.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is my understanding Mr Chair 
that Mr Laher is a qualified chartered acco untant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so that explanation can be excluded that he 
might not have understood numbers here.  Okay, thank you.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Your statement then further 
deals with the same – similar exercise done for the electrics ? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it follows the same logic?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It follows the same logic and the 
same (intervenes). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the same anomalies that you have 
identified in respect of diese l you find in electric as well?  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 86 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.  Not every figure is absolutely 
traceable through from the top to the bottom as I – as I have done here 
but they are of such a similarity that they add to that.  I would like to 
add one further point …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes sir. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  To these spreadsheets however. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you add it - and please do not forget the point 
- before you add it after you had had a chance to analyse the 
spreadsheets and realise d that Mr Laher must have known or knew …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – you know – you were engaging in an exercise 
that really was not necessary.  Did you by any chance confront him and 
say why did you not tell us about this and w hy did you allow this 
exercise to happen because otherwise if – if he did not want you to 
know – to know the information in the spreadsheets he could have said 
well I know how the price has changed.  There is no need to do the 
exercise but I cannot share the information with you.  Maybe I will 
share it with whoever has a right to know about it.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.  I would like to …  
CHAIRPERSON:  My question is whether you were able at any stage to 
20 
ask him why – why do you waste our time. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Could I answer that perhaps later 
Mr Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I would just like to cover that. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 87 of 206 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because … 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I will certainly address that point.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  As long as you deal with it.  That is fine ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You wanted to point out one other thing in 
respect of the spreadsheets?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.  I just which to turn up an 
electric spreadsheet. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  According to your 207 that should be – 
my apologies – your 201 I think.  They should start at 67 to 72.  Is that 
– are you looking for that annexure – annexures in that range? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where are we going now? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  He is first trying to locate …  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  If I could take you to – to 
Annexure 70 please “Negotiations”?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  7-0? 
CHAIRPERSON:  7-0? 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Annexure 7-0 page 606. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  We have been asked – the 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 88 of 206 
 
increase in the price of the 1  064 from the 38.6 to the 54 billion and the 
price – increase in the price per locomotive up to 54 billion - million per 
locomotive has already been extensively aired.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
Page 
606 
and 
it 
is 
titled 
“Negotiations” and it is from the Ne gotiations Electrics Sheet 17  March 
… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is a side bar calculation. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And you will see there – there is 
also a price of make-up for locomotives following the similar format to 
what we have seen beforehand - BAFO, new price and final cost. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  On these negotiation sheets I 
would just like to draw the final figures there.  We see a final figure at 
cost after TE scope. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
Bombadier 
60 
million 
per 
locomotive. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  CSR 55 million per locomotive 
moving later on to 59 million per locomotive and 55 million pe r 
locomotive.  It is anomalous that the negotiations per locomotive would 
take us up to that price per locomotive and the logic that would take us 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 89 of 206 
 
to that price is missing. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And for me it – from this it begs 
the question as to how the negotiations were conducted.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So if – if I may.  Let us take the – the first 
table or box.  Is that – what does that box represent?  Is that the price 
as at which point? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I cannot say at which point and I 
cannot interpret those figures 20/7 – those figures above the 
Bombadier box …  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  But you will see that the cost at 
the bottom of that column …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I see it is 60. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  60 million per locomotive. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And as I go into the second box do I interpret 
the – the number against cost after TE scope of 59 as a reduction after 
60? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is there a correlation between the two?  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I cannot talk to any possible 
correlation.  I merely highlight that this a side bar calculation.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Of a cost per locomotive which is  
out of the ordinary to anything which we had been dealing with and it is 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 90 of 206 
 
considerably higher than that which we have – we questioning the price 
up to 54 billion in the price increase per locomotive.  So a side bar 
calculation which has a price of 60 milli on per locomotive or 59 million 
per locomotive I do not understand.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the extent that what you have been able to pick up 
here with regard to the increase of the price from 38 to 50, 49, 50, 54 
to the extent that you have picked up figures that are inexplicable as 
far as you are concerned which may mean that Transnet was put at a 
risk.  Its interests were not properly looked after by people who were 
10 
supposed to pick these things up.  Who ultimately at Transnet should 
have picked up these things and who ultimately – when I say ultimately 
– it might be somebody quite high up.  There may be - but there may be 
others who below that body or that person should have picked these 
things up because part of their job was to check  these things and 
because if it was part of their job to check these things properly and 
pick these things up and they did not do that.  One within the context of 
what we are dealing with it maybe that for some it was gross 
negligence but for maybe others it maybe that it was much more.  It 
was not just negligence.  It was part of a scheme.  So – so it becomes 
20 
important to – to pin down the people who may have been part of the 
scheme and may have put Transnet at risk by allowing and approving 
figures which should not have been approved because they were 
unjustified. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I described to Mr Chair that the 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 91 of 206 
 
process followed two phases.  The first phase was the selection of the 
bidders and I have described why my concerns regarding the sel ection 
of the bidders.  The second phase was the negotiation phase with the 
selected OEMs.  The negotiation phase took place or under the 
auspices of a Negotiation Team which the members were mandated with 
signed mandates by Mr  Brian Molefe the Chief Executive.  The 
Negotiation Team collectively – individually and collectively did the 
negotiations.  I cannot talk to the role that each one played individually 
within the Negotiation Team but …  
CHAIRPERSON:  But the leader of the Negotiation Team was …?  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is my understanding that it was – 
I think the leader – the – I know one of the joint Chairs.  I know 
Mr Jiyane was a joint Chair of the Negotiation Team.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I cannot say who the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who the other. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I cannot recall who the leader was.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay, okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I need a moment or two for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
But 
the 
Negotiation 
Team 
collectively were operating under or should have operated under a 
mandate to achieve the best possible price for Transnet whether they 
did I think it is my – in answer to your question – the Negotiation Team 
should answer for the price increase.  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 92 of 206 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you.  Other than the Negotiation Team 
there would be somebody else probably who had to sign off to say this 
is fine who would not be in the Negotiation Team?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No it – negotiation – letters signed 
by Mr Molefe appointed Mr Singh and Mr Gama as members of the 
Negotiation Team as well although I understand they were not there full 
time … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  But they were part of that 
Negotiation Team.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But in the end Mr Brian Molefe would have been the 
one to say whether a particular price was acceptable.  So in other 
words the Negotiation Team if they thought a price would be – is 
acceptable they would have to report to him?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if he thought the price was not right then he 
would say no but if he thought it was right then he would – he would 
approve? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct.  It is my absolute 
understanding that that is – was the chain of command.  We had a 
20 
Negotiation Team.  The Negotiation Team reported on a fairly regular 
basis.  I believe it was on a daily basis - I believe it was a daily basis 
to Mr Singh.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  How he took it further on a daily 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 93 of 206 
 
basis … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: 
 
But 
the 
end 
result 
of 
the 
negotiations from the Negotiation Team resulted in these prices.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay thank you.  May we take the tea 
adjournment and we will resume at half past 11?  We adjourn.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
10 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you may proceed Ms Sello.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Thank you Chair.  We have dealt with your 
paragraph under analysis of March 17 negotiation spreadsheet, Mr 
Callard and you’ve taken us through your Annexure 78, 79, 80, the 
comparisons you made based on the worksheets you actually received.  
Before we leave that topic, you state at your paragraph 208 .7 at page 
55 that some formulas used in the negotiation worksheets have 
hallmarks of reverse engineering to achieve a desired result, do you 
20 
see that? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:    Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And in the last line of that paragraph you 
state,  
“This particularly applies to the foreign exchange component 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 94 of 206 
 
and cells coloured in yellow”, 
 
Now I need you to explain to the Chair what you mean by 
reverse engineering and for that purpose perhaps it might assist if we 
use an Annexure we’ve already used in the hearing Annexure 78 at 
page 625.  Now with reference to that Annexure could you explain 
exactly what you mean by reverse engineering to achieve a desired 
result and what you – cause of the desired result was?  78 is the 
negotiation spreadsheet for diesels. 
CHAIRPERSON:     I’m sorry from which paragraph Ms Sello did you 
start? 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   I’m reading at 208.7 Chair at page 55, top of 
page 55.   
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At that paragraph Mr Callard introduces a 
concept of reverse engineering to achieve a desired result.    
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And then he does so with reference to the 
cells coloured in yellow.  I then want him to explain what exactly he 
means in that paragraph, by reverse engineer ing, firstly and to explain 
what desired result he said applied and to do so with a reference to an 
20 
Annexure that we’ve worked on already, which is Annexure 78 the 
negotiations worksheet for diesels.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes, thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     The…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Just a second the Chair should – to locate 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 95 of 206 
 
the Annexure, Annexure 78 Chair at page 625.  
CHAIRPERSON:     I’ve got it. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes Mr Callard. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Okay, if I may illustrate the 
concept of reverse engineering by using, perhaps a – an example, if we 
have a – we are given a price of a locomotive and we know the 
escalation going forward, we take CPI going forward for example and 
over a two year period then the final pr ice we would pay is a 
straightforward calculation, from here’s the base price of the 
locomotive, apply the CPI forward and I get the final price of the 
10 
locomotive.  Reverse engineering would apply when I have a base price 
of a locomotive but I for example,  I’m now negotiating on the final 
outcome price, I choose a final outcome price and then I reverse 
engineer to determine the effect of the escalation.  So where is the 
escalation and forward Forex hedging should be derived quantities 
based on known formula that are derived.  Reverse engineering would 
apply when one chooses a final price and then works backwards to 
achieve some figures which would tend to justify that price, that would 
– it’s illustrative of the concept reverse engineering.  
 
 
It is not visible immediately from the spreadsheets here but if 
20 
one examines the excel spreadsheets in their raw format and one looks 
at the formulas on those excel spreadsheets one can see that a number 
of figures have been reverse engineered where a figure you would 
expect to be the outcome of a calculation is given as the result and it is 
used to derive what should have been a given like CPI for example and 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 96 of 206 
 
we have seen escalation figures used here that have been quite high.  
In reference to this sheet and others we’ve  already highlighted the 
variations in the movement of the exchange rate, what I’ve said were 
anomalous movements in the exchange rate across the CNR diesels 
from the US Dollars, we’ve highlighted that already, the first three 
columns where it goes from 48 4 000 to 493 00 then to US Dollars 918 – 
the Euros, apologies if I’m going too fast the Euros are on line 20 go 
from 993 down to 325 up to 374. 
CHAIRPERSON:     774, 374 or 774? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     774. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:     Ja okay I think I heard 374 but maybe I didn’t hear 
correctly. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I’m sorry, possibly I 
was…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     If one wishes to influence the 
price at the bottom of those two columns in yellow.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Then one would choose to use 
those prices to achieve a desired end result price and that is an 
20 
example of what I mean by reverse engineering to achieve a desired 
price.  So if one wanted to achieve, at  the bottom of column 2, 
30.4million rounded then a way of achieving that low price and see 
there is a significant reduction in that price.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 97 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Would be to artificially lower the 
foreign content because that would then result in the lower price and 
that would be an example of reverse engineering.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Can one explain your concept of reverse 
engineering in this way, that you first decide what the final amount is or 
should be that you want to  achieve and then once you know what that 
amount is then you go back to the various components that make up the 
amounts and find one or more components that might be easy to play 
around with and therefore – and then increase one or more of those in 
order to achieve the result that you have already identified?  
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     That is exactly the example I’m 
trying to illustrate Mr Chair, exactly that example.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay alright thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I was trying to illustrate it at a 
single level, you have taken it to the full locomotive price.  
CHAIRPERSON:     No, no that’s fine I was – I wanted to check whether 
I understood it correctly so that one could apply it to any other item if 
need arises to say what’s the general principle or explanation for it, 
okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And Mr Callard you say that this reverse 
20 
engineering is not visible in the PDF format of your Annexures?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     No, no. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     So in order for the Chair to satisfy himself 
that there has been a case of reverse engineering you suggest that we 
look at the actual excel spreadsheets or the spreadsheets that make up 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 98 of 206 
 
the negotiations for diesel and/or locomotive as the case – and electric 
as the case may be. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     If one looks at the actual excel 
files on a computer which then demonstrates how the formulas are 
made up and that is what illustrates the reverse engineering.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     I don’t know if you are able to help us now 
that – you cannot because you don’t have the documents before you, 
once again are you able to advise who we may turn to so the Chair may 
satisfy himself that there is some element of reverse engineering, to 
assist us to work through those sprea dsheets? 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Excuse me are you looking for a 
name of a person or an entity?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes, who may guide us, they won’t show us 
reverse engineering but if we were to pursue your concept who do you 
suggest we sit down with, working through the excel spreadsheets to 
satisfy ourselves that the concept that you now referred to is applicable 
in some or other regard?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     I could show you personally but 
also the actuaries that were engaged by MNS  would also be able to 
demonstrate the same concepts yes.  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:     But the starting point may well be people who put in 
the figures, if they can’t explain to say, what’s your explanation for this 
in the light of your ev idence. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 99 of 206 
 
CHAIRPERSON:     And they may or may not be able to explain it but 
that’s one way or a component of finding out.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Certainly, it would have to be – 
they would have to be asked specifically on this spreadsheet, please 
have a look at this formulae can you explain this formulae, how it was 
derived, what was the makeup of this formulae, where did you get the 
figures please show – get the figures from, please indicated the 
traceability of those figures through whatever documentation to come to 
that figure, that would be the exercise to be followed.  
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes okay.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes thank you very much, we will certainly 
pursue that. 
CHAIRPERSON:     So, it might be a good thing to have a notary as you 
say…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Actuary Chair, sorry actuary you said 
notary. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Oh, see they both end with a “ary”.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:     No thank you, I meant actuary, notary is somebody 
else. One way is to bring in an actuary but it may well – I mean as I 
20 
see it even the actuary might just be able to explain how much it is – 
how much difficult it is to explain the jump from that figure to that 
figure but in the end,  one might just have to make an inference to a 
certain – in regard to a certain component the figures were inflated or 
something like that. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 100 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes I think what one would ask 
an actuary to do would be to please show me the logica l progression 
and change in the prices and demonstrate that they followed a 
reasoned sequence of events and/or traceable documentation to arrive 
at the final price, if that…(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:     Ja I think that it goes to the question of whether  
there’s a logical explanation or whether there’s – if it can be explained 
in any rational way that the jump and what might appear to be 
inconsistency and so on. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:     Ja okay, alright. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Thank you Chair. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     May I just – because we have 
not got it into the record 208.2…(intervention).  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Maybe deal with the entire 208. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Entire 208? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     This is really a summary of what 
I have stated before – what we have covered before. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     But on examination I could not 
credit that the figures in the spreadsheet we re a true reflection of the 
real cost to the locomotives for the following reasons.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     At page 54? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     At page 54. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 101 of 206 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     208.1, “The escalation costs 
were inflated and I could not correlate these with any of the locomotive 
modelling I’d previously done. 
2)  There were unexplained variations in the foreign exchange 
component affecting the locomotive price as a change between 
the worksheets of base cost, base  cost excluding options, 
base costs excluding TE and negotiations”.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But we don’t need to go through that if we’ve already 
covered it, so only that which we might have left out.    
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Only that which we have not 
covered Mr Chair, is 208.6, the diesel price contains – sorry it was the 
local content version that I was looking for, 208.4 if I may.  
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     “The foreign exchange 
components amounts used in the final negotiatio ns spreadsheet would 
cause some locomotives, CSR and Bombardier not to meet the local 
content requirements”. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Please explain. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     The point I’m making here is that 
20 
if the foreign exchange amounts are correc t or if they are correct then 
the local content does not meet requirements.  If I may go back please 
to the – let’s go to the diesels as it’s a familiar one and that would 
be…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Is that Annexure 67?  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 102 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Annexure 62…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     78…(intervention). 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Annexure 78 page 625 please. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, yes.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Annexure 78 page 625, and I’m 
looking immediately to the rig ht of the third small column which is 
negotiations, bidder one, CNR and we’ll see there is some beige 
workings in that white space. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     And if we look there, we will see 
10 
– if we look across from line 19 it has – line 19 – sorry line 18 my 
apologies, total import content percentage per declaration and the 
figure given in the third column there is 38.9 percent.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Across all the variations of 
foreign exchange, that figure of 38.9 percent has not changed, that is 
what was declared.  If we look at the two lines above it we see that 
those figures have changed in – those figures have changed but the 
nature of that change does not appear to reflect the v ariations in the 
foreign exchange amounts. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     In fact, if anything, despite the 
significant 
increase 
in 
the 
foreign 
exchange 
amounts 
in 
the 
negotiation’s column, that is the third column, we will see  that the 
import content per first declaration and second declaration remains the 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 103 of 206 
 
same, now changing the foreign component one would reasonably 
expect by virtue of these formulae to change the foreign component and 
we see there that it does not change.  A side-bar calculation, and tis is 
my calculation in the beige – in the white space using the figures 
presented in the third column the imported content moves up to 64%, 
64.2% which is outside the local content stipulations of the Department 
of Trade and Industries and on that basis should have disqualified 
them. I presented on the base on these figures as presented which 
make up – and we see how they go – feed through to the final elements 
that local – that imported content does not hold, similar arguments h old 
10 
for the electrics as well. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Thank you.  That then brings you to the end 
of the issues you wanted to address regarding the evaluations and the 
BAFO negotiation on both the diesels and electrics.      
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     You proceed then from your paragraph 29 to 
share certain observations and draw conclusions from paragraph 209, 
my apologies Chair, page 55.  You make certain observations and your 
draw conclusions which you list there, you don’t  have to read verbatim 
what is set out in that paragraph but perhaps you might want to 
20 
highlight key observations and what conclusions are to be drawn from 
the evidence you have provided. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Thank you, the essential 
component is that adding back the TE component as we will see was 
done in the – has been done in the electric locomotives we have not 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 104 of 206 
 
demonstrated that here but it’s visible in the spreadsheets, significantly 
increases the base price of the locomotive and we see how it was 
initially taken out. We’ve mentioned earlier that the BAFO prices of the 
15 t h January memorandum from the CFET Finance cannot be used as a 
basis for determining the total estimated cost because of what has 
been – what is omitted. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     And I submit that without the 
detailed knowledge and understanding and in -depth analysis of this, 
that a reader without access to these documents, the average reader 
10 
would interpret the BAFO prices of the 15 t h of January and the memo to 
the loco Steering Committee as a reasonable basis for comparison and 
it’s an open question whether the evaluation – the electric locomotives 
or what the evaluation of the electric locomotives would have been if 
the base price i.e. before the TE adjustment had been used as a basis 
for price evaluation. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Is it possible though to conclude that as a 
bare minimum CSR would have come in at a higher price?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Certainly both CSR and 
Bombardier, on that evaluation would have had a higher price 
20 
comparable to what was subtracted from their price by the impact – 
virtue of the impact of TE. So had that been put in as a basis for 
evaluation on the real cost to the locomotive, the outcome of the 
evaluation may have been different. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 105 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     I’ve already covered the member 
of the negotiation team.  I would just add one other point which is an 
anomaly that when we showed the breakdown of the locomotive pr ices, 
this included the necessary options to develop a locomotive which was 
fit for purpose, ready for use, ex-works but in the ETC increase 
requested by Mr Molefe to the BADC and that was from the 38 to the 
54billion, there was this amount in there of – and I read from 212.1, 
“it included contingencies of 4.9million which would include 
options and he – I quote from that document, electronically 
controlled pneumatic breaking and wire distributed power 
10 
etcetera”.  
 
Now those options were previously included in the negotiations 
– sorry in the evaluation pricing.  One would reasonably have expected 
that those would have been part of the consideration of the final cost of 
the locomotive because that is what makes it fit for purpose.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Now on this construction are you suggesting 
that it would appear that the options were costed twice?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     It is…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     If they constitute part of the 4.9billion as 
part of contingencies and yet were part of the makeup of the original – 
20 
of the actual cost of the locomotive, does that constitute counting the 
options twice or accounting for them twice or would that be too 
simplistic an approach?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Um, I – to answer that one 
specifically I just need to refer back to Mr Molefe’s memorandum but if 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 106 of 206 
 
the – if the base price which is used from the memo while it excluded 
TE  included those options and that we have seen already it included 
those options while it excluded the impact of TE is carried forward, yet 
we have the options counted again, a second time in this – yes that is 
so. The options were definitely in there in the base price which we’ve 
seen on the 15 t h of January. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     The options were in there, while 
it excluded the impact of TE but options were in there yes and we are 
now adding a further amount here for options.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Okay thank you. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     And my point – I go back to 
212.3 inexplicably these required options were omitted during the 
negotiation stage and they were an extensive part of the evaluation 
stage, they were omitted during the negotiation stage and left to be 
added later under contingencies. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Can you explain – well you did say 
inexplicably, ja, I withdraw the question, yes please continue.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     No I think that’s what is for the 
record. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     Alright you then have a following chapter 
headed, Report to Gama and others. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :     Without detailing the whole 
report counsel, when I became aware of the import and content of this 
– these two spreadsheets I contacted Mr Gama, said please could I 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 107 of 206 
 
meet with him, he asked, please send me a report on what I wanted to 
meet about, I explained the nature of my concerns. I prepared a report 
which I sent to him, we met, I met with him and Mr Dipiwe Salinca?, in 
Mr Gama’s offices, I’d sent the report earlier, the email trace of those – 
where I sent those reports is in the file, after the meeting I then 
forwarded the same reports to Mr Salinca, I then jumped back to item in 
my paragraph 217 that Mr Gama undertook to take up this matter with 
the Chair of the Audit Committee, the following day I emailed Mr 
Salinca copies of the memorandum that I’d emailed Mr Gama but I 
heard nothing further from Transnet on the matter it went quiet.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And you reference Annexure 86 and 87, 
these are the reports in respect of the electrics and diesels 
respectively. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:     And in the report do you highlight the issues 
that you are now sharing with the Chair, the anomalies and the fact that 
you cannot justify the jump from the business case estimated tota l cost 
of 38billion to 49billion or 54billion or as the case may be.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:     That was the essence of my 
reports, my reports at the time were crafted and drafted on the basis of 
20 
what I knew then and only from an analysis of the sprea dsheets, I did 
not have access to all the information that I have presented now.  So, 
they are incomplete in some respects in terms of they cannot be 
directly compared to here but they indicate the overall thrust of the 
point that, here the spreadsheets give the full story and there are these 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 108 of 206 
 
unexplained anomalies in the spreadsheets, that was the thrust of my 
reports. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay thank you.  You may proceed.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  To conclude in remarks?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  Well before you get to go – if that was 
all your conversations. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That was… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Or engagements with Mr Gama and others.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I see you reference Mr Gama and 
10 
communication with Mr Silinga – it is a Mr right?  Yes Mr Silinga.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You recall the Chair I think asked you about 
the excel spreadsheets?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You had indicated that Mr Laher had been of 
the view that you cannot have access to them because they are 
confidential but you nonetheless succeeded?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Did you after working on the spreadsheets 
20 
have – ever have occasion to eng age Mr Laher on these spreadsheets?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes I did. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  In what form and what was the outcome of 
that engagement? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  I and others met with Mr Laher at 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 109 of 206 
 
the offices of MNS Attorneys.  I cannot  recall the exact day but it was 
to discuss the spreadsheets in particular.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Give us an estimate of around about when you think it 
was when you met him?  Mid -year, last year or later?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It would have been towards the 
end of last year and my. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2018. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  And my estimate it was about 
October / November of last year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2018 ja. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  2018 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The essence of that conversation 
was that Mr Laher could not explain the anomalies which I had or – 
highlighted here because we discussed the same anomalies on a – that 
I have discussed here and he – ja he could not explain the anomalies 
or could not – would not.  I – did not explain the anomalies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you – did he offer some explanation that you 
found impossible or he just kept quiet?  
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The explanation that he offered 
when we – and we highlighted that he was a member of the negotiation 
team and the explanation that he highlighted was he was just inputting 
the numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was just? 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 110 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Inputting the numbers.  Capturing 
the numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just plucking them from the tree or what?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I – and repeating as close as I can 
to his words, he was just there inputting the numbers, implying that he 
was taking direction on putting the numbers into the spreadsheet.  I 
asked him specifically did you not question the numbers and he said 
no?  The example which I have given on the foreign exchange 
component if I remember – recall correctly and please – this is not 
written he said was – it was not his role to question the local or foreign 
10 
content.  We  
CHAIRPERSON:  Did he – did he – did you ask him and I do not know if 
I am repeating this question, did you ask him why did you say this was 
confidential this spreadsheet – these spreadsheets were confidential 
because this was information that in the exercise we were doing we 
needed to see?  What the basis was or foreseeing.  In other words did 
you ask him the basis for him saying these spreadsheets were 
confidential? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I cannot recall that I asked – we 
asked him that question, why he said that Mr Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  The others did not – I cannot recall 
the others in the party at that meeting.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Knew the detail of that 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 111 of 206 
 
background. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I do not believe I asked him that 
question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Specifically. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you never heard why it was thought the spread 
sheets were confidential?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Confidential. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So even in other words even if you did not ask him 
10 
you did not by any chance hear from anybody what the basis may have 
been for – for him saying that it was confidential – they were 
confidential? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  I – we passed on that I wanted to 
get – we wanted to get an understanding.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  How do you understand the 
spreadsheets and please explain to us and we did not get a satisfactory 
explanation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well Ms Sello may or may not know but it would 
be important to establish his basis for saying they were confidential.  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 112 of 206 
 
Was it because somebody higher up had  said they – certain people 
must not see them even within the – within – people were trying to help 
Transnet or was it his own decision as to – to – as to who should or 
could or could not see them?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly because the if I ma y Mr 
Chair because the spreadsheet do contain the confidential information 
of the bidders in terms of their pricing.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  That would be one explanation that 
could be offered for now wanting to share them.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that is if one is talking about people, outside 
people not to if one is talking about people from within Transnet or 
people asked by Transnet to look into the issues.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  There was – there was a very strict 
wall – fire wall around the information relating to the tenders at that 
time.  In fact consistently.  It was just fortunate that one I could access 
this spreadsheet which brought to light I believe the inconsistencies.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but what I am saying is the – the issue of not 
20 
wanting to expose the pricing as I understand it.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Cannot apply to the group that you were part of that 
was given as I understand the position b y Transnet the task of looking 
at this, could it? 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 113 of 206 
 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  I – while I agree with your 
sentiments. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do feel free to say whatever it is that may lead you to 
explain his conduct if you think there may be room.  I just want to  see if 
– I am keen to understand if the labelling the words – these 
spreadsheets. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As confidential may have been just a genuine thing or 
may have been part of a certain scheme?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Ja.  Any answer to that Mr Chair 
10 
because the spreadsheets contain or contained figures which are 
unexplained I believe it was kept that way because do not want to be 
asked to explain figures which are generally unexplained.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Certainly with the best [indistinct] 
in the world. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Myself and others cannot explain 
the variations in these figures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.    And on the face of it if that was the 
20 
reason it was an illegitimate reason to say the least?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Well yes.  I am hesitant to…  
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just that it does not – you seem reluctant to say 
yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  But yes.  Let me go so far as to 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 114 of 206 
 
agree with you Chair.  I expressed that as saying I was disappointed 
that the spreadsheets were not shared.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  But I – I am perhaps reluctant to 
attribute the root cause to an individual but certainly with the 
inconsistencies and anomalies which the spreadsheets exposed.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I could appreciate some people 
wanting to keep them not make them available to others.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Well we – we are not closing the door to a 
10 
legitimate explanation for the confidentiality.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I do not want…  
CHAIRPERSON:  We leave the door open but to the extent that certain 
reasons might be the reasons we looking at whether they would be 
legitimate reasons or illegitimate reasons.  But if it is other reasons we 
do not know we will hear when the right people come and explain.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I may be wrong in my assessment 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  And I would accept that but I 
20 
present what I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Have seen from this thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and you give your opinion. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 115 of 206 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or based on the analysis you have done.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And if I may just follow up on the Chair ’s 
question then.  You gain access to these documents in January 2018?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  During the financial analysis exercise?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  This was four years after the contracts were 
concluded? 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes contracts concluded March 
20? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  14? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  14. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  So there could not have been any 
potential prejudice to any bidders? There were no longer – there was 
no longer an issue of bidders, the decision had been made?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No, no, this is post – way post 
event yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before we leave that and I know you would 
20 
like to get to your closing remark – concluding remarks.  There is an – 
paragraph we skipped which I think is important and in particular for 
how the commission goes forward on some of the issues you have 
raised at paragraph 214 pag e 56 at the bottom it starts.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.  As soon as I – as I became 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 116 of 206 
 
aware of this – these spreadsheets and I then emailed – we are talking 
of 214 paragraph 214? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  214 yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Yes.  So on 27 February 2018 I 
emailed Ms Nomfuyo Galeni and I copied her on my emails to Mr Gama 
but I also requested that if she can please trace and freeze the laptop 
with the file reconciliation of inflation forex and TE scope 26 February 
2014.xlx.  May I just ex plain that this is one of those files that is 
embedded or not embedded but linked to these excel spreadsheet files 
and I believe it – it would have given an indication of how some of 
10 
those foreign exchange figures and escalation figures were derived at 
and I was trying to trace that file.  So I asked please can you trace and 
freeze the laptop with the file – with this file name.  I believe it should 
form part of the forensic audit.  Someone in Supply Chain Services 
should have this file and it is often refe renced in the two files that the 
lady in finance sent to us. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And the two files referred to were 
in March spreadsheets. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  And later I was ready to – I was 
really disappointed to later hear that the laptop of Ms Mdletshe has 
gone missing. This is reference in the MNS Report.  I believe it 
contained the files referred to above.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Are you not aware of any other file having 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 117 of 206 
 
contained those s preadsheets? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  There may have been other files 
but that was a particular one as I was going through the soft copy of 
the spreadsheets there was a continuous referencing linking data to 
that file and that is why I wanted to trace that file to see what was the 
source material for some of those inflation forex and TE scope numbers 
that we were dealing with here. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes I am posing a slightly different question if 
I may try again?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Sure sorry. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now that the calamity has befallen us and the 
laptop has gone missing that particular file is it your view that it could 
only be located in that laptop and what is the likelihood of it being 
available from another computer or lapto p? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I think remote. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Remote. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  It is my understanding and it was 
common talk that there were six laptops that were stored in 
safekeeping which were the laptops that the negotiations – that the 
evaluation team were working on.  I stress evaluation team.  It is also 
20 
my understanding through what we have heard that all of those laptops 
have gone missing.  The last laptop that was remaining was the one of 
Ms Mdletshe and it is my understanding from the MNS Report that when 
they went to retrieve this laptop that it too was missing which …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Do you know if Transnet has been lucky 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 118 of 206 
 
enough to at least locate any of the six missing laptops?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I do not know. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the other day I heard evidence that about 1000 
laptops or computers disappeared at Transnet and they were never 
traced and it was never traced who – what happened to them and who 
was responsible.  So this is – today I hear of another six and in this 
case we are talking about computers, laptops that were said to have 
information that could help with – help with some investigation into 
some of these things. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD: I believe so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And those two from what you understood were not 
traced? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Ja.  I believe so Mr Chair.  In the 
CFET Report of the 10 January it describes in the introduction to that 
report many of the security measures which they put in place to safe 
guard their information in that report and how they were not allowed to 
take laptops home or it – they describe in full the security measures so 
it was rather as I say disappointing to hear that the laptops had gone 
missing. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Did you ever get to know how any of the 
laptops or Ms Mdletshe’s laptop came up missing?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  No, no. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You did not know the circumstances that led 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 119 of 206 
 
to that? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I do not know the circumstances 
no, no. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We – you are now at from page 58 then you 
deal with your concluding remarks.   
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Than you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  I will paraphrase. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes please. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  What is in here rather than read 
10 
them directly but the programmatic replacement of the general freight 
locomotive fleet was necessary and because the last batch of 
locomotives for General Freight had been b ought in 1992 and the 
greater part of the fleet was way beyond its economic life and we had 
exhausted all the upgrade programmes we needed to get new 
locomotives to keep the fleet running.  And certainly the market demand 
strategy was the catalyst for this  and the change in strategy or 
responding from creating capacity to absorbing demand could have 
worked.  It is unfortunate I can believe that the aggressive market 
demand strategy was not backed up by a rigorous evaluation and 
20 
adjustment as the market dictated.  And this is with particular reference 
to the 100 locomotives Supply Chain Services I believe failed Freight 
Rail in its locomotive procurement process.  With good intention it was 
to create a mechanism separating technical interests from the 
procurement process.  But it failed Freight Rail and that it presumed to 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 120 of 206 
 
be the final arbiter of what Freight Rail needed in its locomotives rather 
than a custodian of due process.  My belief.  It failed to create the 
mechanism in the 1064 locomotives for program matic procurement 
adjusting delivery to changing market conditions.  It did have some 
clauses relevant to that though.  It failed to include essential options in 
the procurement of locomotives as we have seen here that in the final 
award options were not included it was to be added as variation orders 
later.  And for whatever reason it decided on the type of locomotive to 
be procured and this is in the relation to the 100 without technical 
consultation.  I add that I do not know of anyone in Supply Chain 
10 
Services ever read the 1064 locomotive business case.  The aggressive 
procurement and the shortening of delivery from the 7 years to the 3 
years… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course technical consultation refers to consultation 
with the technical team?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  With technical team.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  Yes there was no consultation wih 
the technical team that I was aware of.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
20 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  None of my colleagues were aware 
of – it was a surprise to all of them.  The aggressive procurement of the 
locomotives and the shortening of the delivery from the 7 to the 3 years 
also 
severely 
impacted 
Transnet 
and 
Freight 
Rail. 
 
Transnet 
Engineering was never going to be ready to be or able to deliver t he 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 121 of 206 
 
locomotives in the accelerated time frame which we have described and 
Freight Rail itself did not have the capacity to absorb the accelerated 
delivery and the financial impact was massive with Transnet almost 
transgressing its cash interest cover and ha ving to increase its foreign 
borrowings.  The premise of the business case – of the business case 
that locomotive performance would improve with new more reliable and 
more powerful locomotives that was the premise.  It is my 
understanding that the locomotive performance now as measured in 
terms of gross tonne kilometres is now worse than before the 
acquisition process started.  We shared a vision, my colleagues and I 
10 
of recreating a sustainable, viable locomotive industry supplying 
between 600 – sorry between 60 and 100 locomotives annually to 
Freight Rail.  Sadly that vision was not realised and from where we are 
now it may well be a decade or more before that opportunity may arise 
again.  Thank you for the opportunity to present what I know from time 
and involvement and my thanks and gratitude to my colleagues and co -
workers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Take your time Mr Callard if you need – if you need 
me to adjourn for five minutes?  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Could I have a minute please?  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Five minutes? 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Five minutes please? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us adjourn for five minutes.  
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 122 of 206 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Callard. 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you Mr Chair and my 
apologies for the interruption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine it is understandable.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD :  I would just like to conclude that 
my thanks and gratitude also go to my colleagues and my co -railway 
workers with [indistinct] dust on their shoes and may t hey keep the 
wheels turning.  If I may be permitted a quote from Charles Dickens in 
the Tale of Two Cities?   
10 
“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.  
It was an age of wisdom.  It was the age of 
foolishness.  It was the epoch of belief.  It w as the 
epoch of incredulity.  It was the season of light.  It 
was the season of darkness.  It was the spring of 
hope.  It was the winter of despair.  We had 
everything before us.  We had nothing before us.  We 
were all going direct to heaven.  We were all going 
direct the other way.”  
Thank you. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That concludes? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That would conclude the testimony of…  
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Callard unless the Chair has got any 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 123 of 206 
 
questions for Mr Callard? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no, no we are done.  I am concerned that I do not 
see Mr Molefe for the next witness.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Molefe? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Mokoena? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No Mr Mokoena is just around the corner.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I see Ms Molefe – Ms Molefe is responsible for that 
slip of the tongue. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   He is in the building.  Oh.  Chair as to 
regards Mr Callard we have issued a significant number of 33’s arising 
10 
from his testimony and his statement.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are so far in receipt of one response and I 
am – perhaps it is appropriate I place it on record from Mr Yusaf 
Mohammed.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Yusaf has not applied to cross-examine Mr 
Callard but he seeks to adva nce his version on some aspects of Mr 
Callard’s testimony.  This was received Tuesday and shared with Mr 
Callard yesterday.  He has not had opportunity to correctly – properly 
20 
apply his mind thereto.  We request therefore Chair that I do not close 
the evidence of Mr Callard.  He will come back at a time to be 
determined by the Chair to deal with Mr Mohammed’s version and any 
other that we may in the interim receive.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well we can closing or not closing is neither here nor 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 124 of 206 
 
there.  We can let him go. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He will apply his mind and I take it he would supply 
you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With a statement that deals with ..  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  In response to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To that version and whether he needs to come back to 
deal with that may depend on what his response is.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  If his response is I have no issues with this version or 
I agree with it there might be no need for him to come back.   If there 
are issues then there may be a need. So I think it would just be on the 
basis that he will deal with that and as soon as he has reverted to you 
with his response then if there is a need for him to come and deal with 
it in the witness stand then arrangements will be made. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  May I indicate Chair that in the course of his 
testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Callard expanded on some averments he 
20 
had made which read on their own in the statement did not seem to 
implicate certain persons which he expounded on in oral testing 
[indistinct] and that has resulted in us issuing further 33’s.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So we are still in respect of some implicated 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 125 of 206 
 
persons within the fourteen day period.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will revert in about ten days or so to 
indicate whether we have received any other responses and we will 
take guidance from the Chair on how to deal with it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Mr Callard for coming forward to 
assist.  We appreciate it and chances are that you may be asked to 
come back. 
10 
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Understood. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I have no doubt you will be agreeable to that.  
Thank you very much you are excused.  
MR FRANCIS QUENTIN CALLARD:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Mokoena had requested 
about three, five minutes for a change of the guard. I do not know if the 
Chair wants to sit here while he does so or?  Everybody is ready it is 
just – so I removed my files and then he can step up to the…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I saw that he was not here so I thought he might 
20 
not be ready.  So [indistinct]. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No he is ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  He is ready to proceed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay shall we resume it is twenty to shall we resume 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 126 of 206 
 
at twenty – at quarter to? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Quarter to one? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair I will let him know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will adjourn and resume in five minutes which will 
be quarter to one. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.

INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was nicely surprised Mr  Mokoena to hear that it is 
not that you are not available.  You are around.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I am Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought – I thought maybe you thought we would 
take too long … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With the previous witness. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I am here Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Thank you.  I see that we will take a 
short time and then we will have to adjourn.  It is okay but let us start.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes Chair.  Chair the next witness that 
we are calling is Mr Robert Gonsalves and in leading …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it Robert or Roberto?  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 127 of 206 
 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Roberto, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Roberto. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  That is good Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Roberto Gonsalves and in leading his 
testimony Chair we will be referring to a file which we have taken the 
liberty of marking it as EXHIBIT BB3 – BB5 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, ja.  I was wondering. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It is BB5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  I am having BB3 here because I will be 
referring to it just in passing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And Mr Chair in order to contextualise 
his evidence it may be important for us to remi nd ourselves of the 
testimony of Mr Mahomedy which he testified on the same issues but 
from a perspective of a Transnet witness.  He will be testifying on the 
same issues but being one other minority shareholders of a company 
that benefitted from that similar transaction.  So his testimony becomes 
quite crucial in that – in that regard because the minority shareholders 
20 
opposed and objected to those monies being paid to that entity.  May 
we – Chair I did not even put before you the file of Mr  Mahomedy 
because I just want to – to deal with it in passing so that I can 
contextualise Mr Gonsalves testimony and simply to remind you that on 
page 3 Chair can simply make a note at paragraph 3.1 Mr  Mahomedy 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 128 of 206 
 
informed the Chair in the following terms.  He said that:  
“While the benefit of hindsight and in (indistinct) I 
now understand that there was a system where a 
set of key role players both internal and external 
and Transnet Executives,  Board Members and 
certain companies acted in concert to the detriment 
of Transnet’s best interest causing pecuniary losses 
to the company.” 
And at 3.2 he said: 
“Although much is detailed later in my submission I 
10 
draw the Commission’s attention to the following 
instances of what I consider to be the most succinct 
illustration of the sys tem.” 
Among those Chair is the one of the relocation where at paragraph 
3.2.5 Mr Mohamedy informed the Chair as follows:  
“The Durban relocation process similarly followed a 
process of being approved by individuals within 
Transnet 
without 
any 
Committee 
review 
or 
approving the process.”  
And he then referred us to Annexures 2, three and four where they 
20 
contain a memorandum and demonstrating that an amount of relocation 
to the value of R647 million was actually advanced to the entity which 
Mr Gonsalves will be 
talking about.  That is the context of 
Mr Gonsalves evidence Mr  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes). 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 129 of 206 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  In as far as the Rule 3.3 Notices are 
concerned Chair we have complied with same.  I am informed that there 
is Counsel for the CNR a nd for Mr Wang whom we will allow the 
opportunity to place themselves on record.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, thank you. 
ADV ZIYAAD MINTY:  Thank you very much Chair.  Good afternoon to 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good afternoon. 
ADV ZIYAAD MINTY:  My name is Ziyaad Minty from the Johannesburg 
Bar … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV ZIYAAD MINTY:  On behalf of CNR and Mr  Jeff Wang instructed by 
Thomson Wilks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV ZIYAAD MINTY:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Chair we are then ready to proceed 
with the evidence of Mr  Gonsalves.  May the witness be sworn in?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you.  While the Registrar is proceeding 
there 
I 
say 
this 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
Ms  Molefe 
I 
think 
20 
Mr Mohammed Mohamedy is one of the witnesses who m ay have dealt 
with the issue that – relating to the witness after this witness.  
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Roberto Gonsalves. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed

Page 130 of 206 
 
oath? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  No, I do not. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Yes, I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence that you will give will be 
the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the trut h?  If so please raise 
your right hand and say so help me God.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So help me God. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  (duly sworn, states)  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Mr Gonsalves you will see that there is a 
file that has been placed before you and it  is marked as EXHIBIT BB5.  
If you open the file you will see that it contains a folder and 
immediately after the folder it must be an index and that index will 
assist you to navigate through the various documents that you will be 
canvassing during your ev idence.  Now could you please turn to a 
document immediately after the index and please identify same for the 
Chair. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Is that the statement that you are 
referring to Counsel? 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  You will let me know is that  a 
statement that you find there. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Correct Counsel. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and if you could please turn to page 
17 – 1-7.  Is that your signature appearing there?  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 131 of 206 
 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Yes it is Counsel. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and when was that statement 
signed? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  On 14 April 2019. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And do you confirm the contents of your 
statement to be both true and correct?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Yes, I do. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  May you then proceed to share 
with us your qualifications?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Counsel I am Chartered Accountant.  I – 
10 
if you want some more background about …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Can you also give us background?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Okay.  Chair my name is Roberto 
Gonsalves but I am known as Robbie  Gonsalves throughout the file you 
will see.  I am a Chartered Accountant.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, I am sorry.  Is the spelling correct?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  The spelling is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – but the way you pronounce the surname is you 
20 
do not pronounce the V?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Gonsalves.  No you pronounce it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you pronounce it.  Gonsalves, okay thank you.  
Okay. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair I am a Chartered Accountant.  I 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 132 of 206 
 
joined Cadiz Corporate Solutions in – towards the end of 1998.  Prior to 
that I was with Pricewaterhouse and I left PricewaterhouseCoopers as a 
Partner in 1998.  I have been with – I was with the Cadiz Group for 
over 20 years.  The Managing Director of the Corporate Advisory 
Business called Cadiz Corporate Solutions and then in January this 
year Cadiz Corporate Solutions was acquired by the Mergence Group 
and we are known as Mergence Corporate Soluti ons today but you will 
see throughout the evidence the reference to Cadiz Corporate 
Solutions. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Mr Gonsalves the Chair has heard 
10 
testimony of various witnesses from Transnet who dealt with the 
acquisition of the 1 064 locomotives and from the – your employment 
history it is quite clear that you were never at any stage employed by 
Transnet.  Am I correct?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  That is absolutely correct Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  You will be adducing the evidence 
before the Chair as one of the minority Directors of an entity that 
benefited from Transnet?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now you preface your evidence if 
20 
you may go to page 1 with particular reference to paragr aph 4.  You 
preface your evidence by the events of July  2012 pertaining to this 
acquisition of the locomotives.  Could you please in your own words tell 
the Chair how you were involved or the entity that you belonged to was 
involved in this transaction?  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 133 of 206 
 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Sure.  Chair I think it is well known that 
in July 2012 Transnet issued an open tender for the 1  064 locomotives 
– 1 064 locomotives – and that was split into 465 diesel locomotives 
and 599 electric locomotives.  We formed – Cadiz Corporate Solutions 
formed part of a consortium with China North Railways – CNR.  I must 
just clarify one thing.  CNR and CSR subsequently merge in China and 
are known as CRRC but at that time it was CNR.  So the consortium 
was made up of CNR, Cadiz, Global Rail – another entity – and then 
Endinamix which was the BEE shareholder. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair this is a quite interesting time to 
10 
start with a witness and maybe it is the time when I am saying that it is 
a time to adjourn for lunch as well.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I was wondering whether we should adjourn at 
one or we should just go on maybe until quarter past and then – just so 
that we … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We had (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Pardon. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  With the fresh legs on his food.  We are 
prepared to proceed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, let us go on until quarter past one.  Is that fine 
20 
with you? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Go Chair, proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 134 of 206 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You also outline for the Chair the 
structure of this CNRRSSA.  Could you please proceed doing so from 
paragraph 6 and the following paragraphs?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair perhaps let me start off with the 
shareholding. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So the entity is – was known as CNR 
Rolling Stock South Africa.  It is quite a mouthful – CNRRSSA.  When 
the merger happened between CNR and CSR in China it became known 
as CRRC SA Rolling Stock.  So that was CRRCSARS which is als o 
10 
another mouthful.  I am probably going to refer to it as CRN South 
Africa. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So that we know that that is the local 
entity through which CNR operated in South Africa.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Okay. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  If you look at the shareholding in CNR 
South Africa 66 percent is held by CNR which is now CRRC.  30 
percent held by Endinamix the BEE shareholder, 2 percent by Global 
Railway Africa and the other 2 percent by Cadiz Corporate Solutions.  
20 
In terms of the Board of Directors of that company.  There are seven 
Directors.  Endinamix has one Director and a gentleman by the name of 
Lulamile Xate.  He is a Director on that Board as a Non -Executive 
Director.  Rowlen von Gericke a Non-Executive Director represents 
Global and then I represent Cadiz Corporate Solutions.  The other four 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 135 of 206 
 
Directors are Jeff Wang.  His Chinese is Jun  (?) Wang, but his English 
name is Jeff Wang.  There is another gentleman by the name of Tau Yu.  
Tony Yu is his English name and then Feng Yu and Jun (?) Chow.  
Feng Yu and Gang Chow are based in China.  So they have never ever 
attended meetings.  They have dialled in for all Board Meetings.  
Jeff Wang is the Managing Director and Tony  Yu was the Financial 
Director.  I understand that he is about to be replaced or has been 
replaced. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA 
SC: 
 
Yes. 
 
You 
also 
deal 
with 
the 
shareholding in Endinamix and give us the structure.  
10 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair Endinamix owns 30 percent in 
CNR South Africa.  The sharehold ers in Endinamix are:  Linotando 
owns 
20 
percent, 
Kopano  Ke Matla 
owns 
20 
percent, 
Makana 
Investment Corporation owns 20 percent, Azon Rail owns 13.33 
percent, Lanetta (?) Investments owns 6.67 percent, Global Railway 
Africa owns 10 percent and Cadiz Corporate Solutions owns 10 percent. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Ja.  Now in terms of the day to day 
running of an entity – you know – who was responsible for those 
activities? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair the companies operated through 
20 
Jeff Wang who is a Managing Director and Tony  Yu as a Financial 
Director. 
 
Rowlen von Gericke, 
Lulamile Xate 
and 
myself 
are 
Non-Executive Directors.  So we are not involved in the operations 
whatsoever.  We have - we attend Board Meetings only and maybe have 
done one or two site visits as part – part of that Board Meeting. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 136 of 206 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now from paragraph 11 you start 
now dealing with the events commencing from 9  August 2012 directly 
relevant to the subject at hand.  Can you please proceed to deal with 
same onwards? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Sure.  Chair so on 9 August 2012 the 
CNR Consortium - at that stage it was incorporated.  It was an 
unincorporated joint venture.  It was only incorporated once the tender 
was awarded.  So that was made up of CNR, Global Rail, End inamix 
and Cadiz.  They informed Transnet that they would tender for both the 
electric and the diesel locomotives.  I understand that CNR was 
10 
probably of the four OEMs probably the only party capable of 
manufacturing both the diesel and the electric locomo tives.  Then on 
30 April 2013 Chair CNR Consortium submitted a tender to Transnet for 
both diesel and the electric locomotives and then on – I think – it is 
17 April the tender was actually awarded to – to CNR South Africa for 
232 diesel locomotives.  I th ink in my statement in paragraph 13 that is 
a slight error Chair.  Where it says …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry.  Did you say 17  April just now 
or was it 30 April?  I see 17 March in the statement.  So I am trying to 
see if … 
20 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  I think it is probably 17  March 2014 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Correct, 17 March 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 137 of 206 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  You wanted to effect a minor change on 
paragraph 13? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Yes, (intervenes). 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  (Intervenes)? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Yes.  I just wanted to inform the Chair 
that of the 465 diesel locomotives 232 were awarded to CNR South 
Africa.  The other 233 went to General Electric.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  In paragraph 13 it says Bombardier.  So 
that is an error.  Bombardier was based in Bayhead with CNR.  That is 
10 
where the confusion came in. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So where there is a word Bombardier it 
should be replaced by what?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  General Electric. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  General Electric.  Chair we will affect 
the necessary amendment and make sure that we replace your page 
accordingly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  We do not - I do not know if you were here.  We do 
20 
not know want anything similar to what we had about a few days ago. 
Okay, alright. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to mixing up names. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  We understand Chair. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 138 of 206 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  May I now refer you to folder one Chair - 
and we leave Annexure 1 – it is on page 19.  Are you there?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Could you please identify that document 
for us Mr Gonsalves? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair this the local – Locomotive Supply 
Agreement - the LSA - that was executed on 17 March 2014. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and may I refer you to page 178 and 
if you could please identify for us the respective individuals who 
10 
appended their signatures on that document and also refer to the date 
as to when those signatures were appended?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair the agreement was signed – the 
Locomotive 
Supply 
Agreement 
– 
was 
signed 
by 
Transnet 
on 
17 March 2014 and it was signed by Brian Molefe as the Chief 
Executive Officer and it was signed by CNR by Jeff  Wang/Wang Gang 
on 17 March 2014. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  While we are still dealing with that 
document I know that it will become paramount at a later stage of your 
evidence may I then refer you to page 27?  Now you have a definition 
20 
of a contract facility.  If you can read same into the record and give us 
your understanding of same and why it will be important to the evidence 
that you will be adducing before the Chair.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Sure.  Chair when the price was being 
built up for the – for the tender in respect of the 232 diesel locomotives 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 139 of 206 
 
it has always been done on the basis that the locomotives were going 
to be assembled and manufactured in Koedoespoort in Pretori a and you 
will see the contractor facility definition in the agreement means:  
“The facility at Koedoespoort Gauteng or Bayhead 
Durban as notified in writing by the contractor to 
the company.” 
By the time we had – we signed this on 17 March 2014 CNR knew that 
they were going to be manufacturing in Bayhead Durban.  They had 
already been informed and as a matter of fact there was an amended 
and reinstated Locomotive Supply Agreement.  We never ever saw the 
10 
signed copy of that.  We just saw drafts of it and in the drafts that we 
saw that contractor facility definition was amended to say:  
“It means Bayhead Durban as notified in writing by 
the company to the company.  So by the contractor 
to the company.” 
So the important thing is when this was signed the facility  – the 
contractor facility was Bayhead in Durban.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  May I then refer you to page 3-0 – 
30?  You will see also there that there is a definition of delivery point.  
Can you please also read that into the record and give the Chair  your 
20 
own understanding and significance of that definition?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair I will read it. 
“Delivery point means the delivery point in relation 
to the locomotives, spares, tool or test equipment 
as applicable namely the depot at Koedoespoort  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 140 of 206 
 
Gauteng, the depot at Bayhead Durban or such 
other location in South Africa as maybe agreed 
between the contractor and the company from time 
to time.” 
So Chair my understanding of that is when you deliver completed 
locomotives you have got to deliver it s omewhere that is going to be in 
relation to where the contractor facility was.  So my understanding is 
that because the contractor facility had been moved to Bayhead 
delivery to – of those locomotives was going to take place at Durban as 
well – Bayhead Durban. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now may I refer you back to your 
statement with particular reference to page 4 Mr  Gonsalves?  From 
paragraph 15 you commence addressing a new topic which is the 
proposed relocation to Durban.  You may proceed to deal wit h those 
relevant facts. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair I think I am repeating what I 
say in the Locomotive Supply Agreement – the LSA – stipulated that the 
contractor facility was going to be either Koedoespoort or Bayhead.  
However we knew that when – by the time that the LSA was signed that 
the contractor facility was going to be at Bayhead and I think the 
20 
important thing is that all the calculations had been done on the basis 
initially that the contractor facility was going to be at Koedoespoort.  In 
early March so just a couple of days or two weeks or so even less than 
two weeks before the Locomotive Supply Agreement was signed 
Transnet indicated that we had to give them an impact of manufacturing 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 141 of 206 
 
and assembling in – in Bayhead Durban as opposed to Koed oespoort in 
Pretoria and we obviously sat down with CNR Consortium to calculate 
what the impact was on the price that was submitted for manufacturing 
and assembling in Bayhead Durban as opposed to Koedoespoort 
Pretoria. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now at the time when you were 
approached by Transnet to – for the company to provide them with a 
relocation cost would I be correct that at that time there were no 
physical activities or operations at all in Koedoespoort?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair that is absolutely correct.  I mean 
10 
we were not even at the stage – this is prior to 17 March – we had not 
even signed the tender documents yet.  So the company had not even 
been incorporated.  So there were no physical premises.  We were not 
based in Koedoespoort.  We were not based anywhere.  We were still 
preparing the tender documents. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  In simple terms there was nothing to 
relocate? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Absolutely correct.  Physically there was 
nothing to relocate. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now may I refer you to folder 
20 
number two which you will find from page 180?  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Annexure RG2? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It is Chair and within the two minutes 
that is remaining before the lunch adjournment could you please 
identify that document? 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 142 of 206 
 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair this document is written by the 
CNR 
Consortium 
Unincorporated 
Joint 
Venture 
and 
signed 
by 
Rowlen von Gericke on behalf of the CNR Consortium and it is 
addressed to Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe at the Commodity Manager S upply 
Chain at TFR and in short what it says is that:  
“With reference to the TFR request relating to 
CNR’s response for the cost impact of building the 
locomotives in Durban we would like to point out 
that our original quotation is based upon the 
locomotives in Koedoespoort or Germiston.” 
10 
And it is a request by Rowlen  von Gericke on behalf of the consortium.  
“Can you please reconsider us rather building in 
Koedoespoort as opposed to Bayhead in Durban?”  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So it is quite apparent from r eading this 
annexure that it was the consortium’s view that it is far better to do the 
operations in Koedoespoort rather than to locate it to Durban.  Is that 
my – is that my …?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Correctly Chair.  The offices are here.  A 
lot of the supplies are based up in Johannesburg.  The preference 
would have been Koedoespoort as to – as supposed to Bayhead 
20 
Durban. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Chair would it be the appropriate 
time to adjourn? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let us adjourn.  We will adjourn  until quarter 
past two.  We adjourn. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 143 of 206 
 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Mokoena you may proceed. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Thank you Chair.  Mr Gonsalves just 
before the lunch adjournment you were still informing t he Chair about 
the request which was made to your consortium emanating from 
Transnet, if you can simply summarise what you were informing the 
Chair. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    Yes Chair in summary the CNR 
10 
Consortium made up of CNR, Endinamics, Global and Kay dee’s applied 
or tendered for to manufacture both Diesel and Electric locomotives, 
they were ultimately awarded a contract for 232 diesel locomotives.  
Prior to submitting the final tender price TFR requested that we give 
them an analysis of the increase i n costs for us manufacturing at 
Bayhead in Durban as opposed to Kuduspoort in Pretoria where we had 
originally assumed we were going to be manufacturing assembling and 
based our initial tender prices on.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You gave evidence before lunch to the effect that you 
20 
had advised or your consortium had advised that this relocation should 
not happen because everything would be – it would be better if 
everything was done in Gauteng, is that right?  Am I mixing up 
something? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  No Chair that is correct, the preference 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 144 of 206 
 
on the CNR Consortium was to manufacture at Kuduspoort rather than 
Bayhead in Durban. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and what was the reason given for not accepting 
that suggestion or advice?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    Chair I think that there four OEM’s and 
they wanted to split the manufacturing between two locations, 
Kuduspoort and Durban, so two OEM’s had to get Durban, Bayhead in 
Durban and we were selected as one of the parties, together with 
Bombardier, to manufacture and assemble at Bayhead in Durban and 
the other two CSR and General Electric got Kuduspoort.  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Now fundamentally at that time when 
this request was made was there anything that had to be allocated, 
were there any operations taking place already in Kuduspoort?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    Chair we were at that stage where we 
were just tendering, so we hadn’t commenced operations at all.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   Yes, now let’s proceed to give more 
flesh into that evidence by referring it to RG3, that is folder number 
three Chair, on page 182.  If you may Mr Gonsalves identify that 
document for us and take us through that document.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    Thank you counsel.  Chair page 182 is 
20 
a letter from CNR Consortium si gned by Rowlen von Gericke, this isn’t 
a signed version but it was signed by Rowlen von Gericke, this is just 
printed off an email and it’s addressed to TFR and it’s in connection 
with their request and the introduction to it says:  
“Further to our previous email in this regard following the 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 145 of 206 
 
request from TFR foreseeing our consortium to consider 
Durban facilities for manufacture of locomotives the following 
calculations were made.”  
And there’s a heading “impact of manufacturing in Durban versus 
Johannesburg and in ...(intervention)  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   You don’t have to take us – you can just 
take us to the summary as to what was the amount arrived at.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:   So Chair what we did is we calculated 
the additional cost of manufacturing in Bayhead as opposed to 
Kuduspoort and the total amount was R9.7million, the exact amount is 
10 
R9 755 600, so what we informed TFR the additional cost for the full 
232 locomotives, not per locomotive, would be R9.7million for us having 
to now manufacture and assemble in Bayhead Durban as opposed to 
Kuduspoort, Pretoria. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   May we request the Chair to make a big 
note on that amount of R9.7 because flowing from the evidence of this 
witness that amount changes drastically.   
 
Now of importance Mr Gonsalves is what is being recorded 
immediately after the amount of R9.7, if you can read and comment on 
what is written therein. 
20 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:   Okay Chair it says the above costs only 
relate to the measurable financial implications.  Please  bear in mind 
that there will always be considerable amount of immeasurable 
financial losses that may be – that will be incurred due to the relocation 
to 
Durban. 
 
Furthermore 
it 
will 
be 
very 
inconvenient 
and 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 146 of 206 
 
counterproductive to split our resources between  Johannesburg and 
Durban.  For these reason we request that the manufacturing should be 
done at Kuduspoort, knowing the Kuduspoort facility I was wonder, this 
is Rowlen von Gericke, I was wondering whether it will be possible to 
utilise the old Kuduspoort East Foundry Facility.  The CNR Consortium 
is of the opinion that the project can be better managed and executed 
in the Kuduspoort facility given its proximity to the existing offices.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   And this accord with what you have 
informed the Chair earlier on about the view already taken by the 
Consortium. 
10 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:   That’s correct counsel. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – I’m sorry – was this a second preference to say 
manufacturing should happen in Kudupoor t only, the first one was – oh 
that was the first preference ja, oh, Durban was not the preference, it 
was the Gauteng preference, okay. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    Correct Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:     Yes Chair.  Now even though you have 
said to the Chair there was nothing to be allocated, but we now know 
from having looked at this document that if there was any amount to be 
20 
placed on what is termed the relocation was nothing more than 
R9.7million as reflected in this document?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Now you may proceed, may I refer you 
to back to your statement, page four and begin to please summarise for 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 147 of 206 
 
us the contents of paragraph 8 and what follows thereafter.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    Paragraph 18? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    18 yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    Okay, so we said the calculation 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you going back to the statement?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :     To the statement yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    Ja Chair I think it’s paragraph 18, the 
calculation of the extra cost relating to relocation from Kuduspoort to 
10 
Bayhead was performed by us as the consortium members, that is CNR, 
Endinamics, Global and Kaydees, we took the cost like transportation, 
flights, office and accommodation etcetera into consideration.  The 
revised costs also took into consideration the savings that would arise, 
that is important to Durban and not Pretoria meant less transport costs.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So these would be costs that wo uld be, all of which 
would be saved if the manufacturing happened in Kuduspoort, in 
Gauteng. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:   Chair that’s correct, certain costs would 
be saved so the transportation costs from Durban to Pretoria would be 
20 
saved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, and this is the amount or this is the list that could 
be saved. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:   Chair that 9.7 is the total additional cost 
so there were some additional costs and there’s some savings.  So we 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 148 of 206 
 
took the additional costs, flights, accommodation, etcete ra, etcetera, 
the savings on transportation we deducted from that, to arrive at a net 
increase in cost of 9.7million which we took into account in determining 
our final bid price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Now if we may proceed to deal with a 
new topic, the agreement with BEX and please take us through what is 
stated in your paragraph 19 Chair on page 5.   
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:   Okay, in summary Chair on the 23 r d of 
April 2015 CNR SA, that’s the South African entity, signed a contract 
10 
with a company called BEX and that company, that comes later on as 
Annexure 8, so I don’t know if counsel you want me to go into that 
already. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   No, no we will deal with it in due 
course. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Okay so on 23 r d of April 2015 a signed 
contract with BEX, registration number 2009/028420/07 to act as an 
intermediary to negotiate a claim from Transnet for the relocation from 
Kuduspoort to Bayhead.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Now what I want to know is that at this 
20 
time when now the name of BEX all of a sudden emerges do we know 
whether at the time when your consortium submitted a tender whether 
BEX as an entity was it part of that consortium?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    Chair BEX was not known to us at all 
until April 2015, it was the first time we heard the name.  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 149 of 206 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :     Yes, and at the time when you 
submitted the relocation cost of R9.7 was BEX factored in at all?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    Chair not at all, BEX wasn’t involved 
whatsoever. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:    And do you know whether you know 
your company or the consortium did have any previous dealings with 
BEX prior to them now emerging on the 23 r d of April as stated in your 
statement.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    Chair not whatsoever no. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKO ENA SC:   Yes, now may I refer you to folder 
10 
number six, Chair it will be RRG6, on page 203.  If you can identify the 
document ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    ...and please summarise for us those 
aspects which you believe are paramount to your evidence. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    Sure, Chair so what happened is on the 
– we received an email from the directors of the – the executive 
directors if you like of CNR South Africa with a resolution that they had 
already signed dated 8 t h of April 2015 and that resolution required the 
minority directors, that’s Rowlen von Gericke, Lulamile Xate and myself 
20 
to sign a resolution appointing effectively BEX as an agent for the 
company to negotiate the contract, the relocation claim with Trans net.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Did you support that memorandum or 
what was there to be achieved through that document?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    Chair we absolutely expressed that we 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 150 of 206 
 
were dissenting directors, we haven’t signed the resolution, refused to 
sign the resolution and at countless board meetings we raised the same 
issue and reminded them that we hadn’t approved that resolution to 
appoint BEX as their agent. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :     Yes, but I mean what is surprising 
what was to be discussed at the time if already there was an amount 
arrived at as a relocation fee, what was BEX supposed to do at the 
time? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    So Chair that’s precisely one of the 
reasons why we refused to appoint BEX or sign any resolution because 
10 
in our minds we had already been remunerated or reimbursed for the 
relocation, additional relocation costs involved in manufacturing at 
Bayhead as opposed to Kuduspoort, we couldn’t see any basis for any 
claim from Transnet for a relocation allowance or relocation cl aim. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes Chair back to the statement of the 
witness on page five, from paragraph 22 you set out the pertinent 
background facts in relation to the appointment of BEX, could you 
please summarise those for us. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:   Sorry counsel which paragraph?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Page 5 from paragraph 22. 
20 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  From paragraph 22, ja, sure.  So as I 
mentioned Chair we were emailed a draft BEX agreement which was 
dated the 8 t h of March 2015 and that’s Annexure  5 in the file.  I would 
like to point out Chair that the ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you said 8 March and I see two 8 Aprils, are you 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 151 of 206 
 
sure 8 March is the right date?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair the agreement was 8 t h of March but 
we received it on the 8 t h of April, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes you were just about to refer – you 
wanted to say something about ...(intervention)  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Sure, I think Chair the important thing is 
if you look at Annexure 5 and that draft agreement that is presented to 
us it was with an entity called BEX Structured Products.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Chair that is on page 190. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Would that be correct Mr Gonsalves?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  That is absolutely correct Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes, could you please repeat what you 
wanted to highlight to the Chair in relation to those names.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Sure, so Chair it’s important to note that 
it says Beck Structured Products Pty Limited and it’s got a registration 
number of 2000, we will see later in Annexure 8 that the actual 
agreement signed with another entity, not the same entity, very similar 
name, had a 2009 registration number and we believed that there’s a  
20 
real BEX company that exists and we were given folders and files of 
work that they had done, but the BEX agreement that they actually 
signed was a dormant company which we will cover later on in my 
testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, mmm. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 152 of 206 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes, and let’s go back then to your 
paragraph 22.1 and just summarise what you convey therein.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair when we were presented with 
this you will see why we couldn’t’ support it.  In this agreement with 
BEX there’s a paragraph 7.2  and if I may read it out, the fee that BEX 
requested for providing these services in terms of the agency 
agreement was the company agrees that BEX will be entitled for an 
Agency commission equivalent to the difference between the price 
excluding VAT awarded to the company by TFR and the price 
benchmark of R218million excluding VAT, and this is important:  
10 
“For example [they say] if the price awarded is R650million 
then BEX will be entitled to an agency commission of 
R370million.” 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Sjoe! 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Laughing) I mean that’s about half ...(intervention)  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  More than half. 
CHAIRPERSON:  More than half. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  More than half ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  But even more we know that at the back 
of this information is the already affected amount of R9.7million, now 
20 
we now see what is now being envisaged in the paragraph that you 
have just read to the Chair.  Alright, you may proceed then with what 
you are telling the Chair from paragraph 22.2 on onwards.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So in paragraph 22.2 it’s what I already 
repeated that we received this partially signed Round Robin resolution 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 153 of 206 
 
signed by the CRC directors requesting that we sign it, the minority 
directors sign it and the resolution is “in order to  enter the agency 
agreement in relation to the relocation of the manufacturing facility.”  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  Now what happened after you 
having received this document?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  We we absolutely refused to sign it and 
in a nutshell the company went ahead and signed an agreement with 
BEX on the basis that they had four directors on the Board and 
controlled the Board. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes, may I refer you to RG7, that is 
10 
folder number seven Chair, and if you may go to page 207  that’s where 
you locate it and please identify that document for the Chair.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair what I was attempting to illustrate 
here was that only on the meeting, at the meeting of the 10 t h of April 
2015 but I’ve got extracts of minutes of th e meeting on the 8 t h of 
October 2015 and also on the 6 t h of May 2016, and perhaps I could just 
maybe read out some parts of it to demonstrate how we felt about this.  
From the minutes and that’s on page Chair 209 ...(intervention)  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Is it paragraph 5.2? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  5.2 on page 209. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes, if you may then read for us. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Yes. 
:”GW [that’s Geoff Wang] introduced to the Board the progress 
of Durban relocation, with assistance by BEX to a negotiation 
with TFR, the company finally negotiated for R647million to be 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 154 of 206 
 
paid by TFR.  Half has been received and the other half will be 
received as and when locomotives are delivered to TFR.  BEX 
has been paid a fee of R67million for the services p rovided 
plus VAT.  SW [and SW is Stan Whiting who was the proxy for 
Rowlen von Gericke], RG [that’s myself] and LLX [which 
Lulamile Xate] requested that it be noted that they did not sign 
the resolution for the BEX mandate.  GW, Geoff Wang, to 
provide the Board members with a copy of the variation order 
by TFR.  SW, RG and LLX [that’s Stan Whiting, Robbie 
Gonsalves and Lulamile Xate] reiterated their concerns with 
10 
the BEX contract.  GW provided the relevant documents of 
BEX to the directors ...”  
And we will cover that now and they gave us the CIPC documents and 
BEE certificate, and BEE credential certificate.  Also the estimated cost 
for Durban relocation, the BEX proposal and reason for selecting BEX 
have already been provided to the directors in April.  Th at is Geoff 
Wang saying that he has already provided us with all the information 
that we could possibly have requested so we should be happy.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now this amount that we see here as 
647million one can trace it back from the amount 9.7 which you say it 
20 
was already effected when the company you know conceded to the 
request of the relocation. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair that’s correct, so the amount 9.7 
which we had already received effectively in the pricing for the 
locomotives had now ballooned to 647million and what is quite ironic I 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 155 of 206 
 
think is that that the R647million is very close to the R650million that 
BEX, the first draft BEX agreement referred to as an example for their 
fee where they said R650million minus R280million benchmark gi ves us 
a R370million fee. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And the majority shareholders how did 
they justify receiving this money from Transnet in the light of what you 
actually told the Chair. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Well Chair they just couldn’t give us 
satisfactory answers and neither could Transnet and you will see later 
on why we reported this to the Hawks.  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes now Chair back to the statement of 
the witness, if you may proceed Mr Gonsalves with what you’re stating 
from paragraph 22.5 on page 6, and please summarise for us what 
you’re conveying therein. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Counsel could I just on that point on 
page 2.4 ...(intervention)  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes, yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  I just wanted to refer to the minutes of  
the 6 t h of May 2016 if I may. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Oh yes, yes you may. 
20 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair you will see on page 214 item 9 
which refers to resolution number 8 and the third bullet point it says the 
SA directors requested a copy of the BEX  report submitted to TFR 
made it clear that we as the shareholders have not approved the BEX 
contract so I think the important as well is that even though there was a 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 156 of 206 
 
Board resolution you will see later on we thought as shareholders in the 
company that it required a shareholders resolution as well because it 
was out of the ordinary course of the business as stipulated in the MI 
of the company. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes, yes.  Now I was just about to refer 
you to paragraph 22.5 for you to proceed with the  evidence from that 
paragraph. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So I think Chair I have already covered 
this slightly but the important thing is that despite the objections they 
controlled the board, the SRRC directors, the CNR directors and they 
10 
went ahead and signed the contract with BEX on the 23 r d of April 2015 
and you will note that that BEX entity that they signed, which is 
Annexure 8, is signed with a company called Business Expansion 
Structured Products Pty Limited so it’s not the original entity, the BEX 
Structured Products Pty Limited and the registration of this company is 
a 2009 company registration as opposed to the BEX structured products 
with a 2000 registration number. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that’s the dormant company that you were talking 
about? 
20 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  That’s quite correct Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now will you please turn to RG8, you will 
find it from page 216, before I refer you to the relevant portions of that 
document could you please identify that doc ument? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair this is the actual agreement 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 157 of 206 
 
signed, you will see signed with Business Expansion Structured 
Products which they refer to as BEX and its dated April 25 2015.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes, if you turn over to page 217 you will 
see from the paragraph that says “whereas” if you can read for us point 
A and please comment on the contents of that paragraph.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair you will see that this company 
never operated, it had a turnover of less than R5million, it  was 
effectively a dormant company.  However in this agreement signed 
between BEX and CRSA in the introduction it says BEX a professional 
service advisory business that specialises in business enterprise onto 
10 
optimisation using financial modelling, derivatives and engineering 
techniques with its long subsisting relationships in the territory of 
South Africa and it goes on and on.  Obviously as a dormant company it 
had no activities and had never done anything.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  This was false this was incorrect, this 
was false? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Absolute incorrect Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now if I may refer you to page 222 of the 
same document. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Sorry counsel which page?  
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  222. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  222? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes, are you there? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Yes I am thank you. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  If you can also take the Chair through 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 158 of 206 
 
paragraph 6.2 and 6.3 and comment on what is stated in those 
paragraphs. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair under 6.2 so the initial contract 
had had a benchmark of R280million and the fee was anything above 
R280million, this changed to R580million and I will read it out.  So here 
it says the company agrees that BEX will be entitled to an agency 
commission equivalent to the difference between the price excluding 
VAT awarded to the company by TFR and a project benchmark cost of 
R580million excluding VAT.  For example if the price awarded is 
R680million then BEX will be entitled to an agency commission of 
10 
R100million excluding VAT, that is R680million less R580million.   
 
The next paragraph says the company will be entitled to the 
project benchmark cost of R580million irrespective of whether the total 
project value is negotiated lower than the R680millio n by TFR.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and your comment on these 
paragraphs? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So it is quite interesting to see that the 
benchmark had changed from R280 to R580 for starters and I think that 
probably had a lot to do with the pressure  that the minority 
shareholders and directors put on them but irrespective it still talks 
20 
about, refers to a potential fee of R100million to a company called BEX 
that is a dormant company. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  This dormant company that you are 
talking about do you know as to whether did it have directors, how 
many ...(intervention)  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 159 of 206 
 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair we do so if we can it’s on 
Annexures 9 and 10 so the first one perhaps on page 229, this was at 
that board meeting, I think it was on the 8 t h of April or the 10 t h of April 
2015, this was presented to us sort of by the Chinese directors, and it’s 
BEE verification certificate of exemption for micro enterprises, so this 
is for Business Expansion Structured Products Pty Limited and it says 
at the bottom you will see “company identification status exempt micro 
enterprise” that is turnover of R5million and below and then if you look 
at Annexure 10 which is page 231 we’ve got core 14.3 from CIPC, 
certificate of confirmation and here we will see there’s th e active 
10 
directors of the company is one Mark Shaw and Mark Shaw was 
appointed by the company on the 15 t h of April 2015, so it seemed that 
the company as established sometime in 2009 as a dormant company 
and on the 15 t h of April 2015 Mark Shaw was appointed as a director 
and on the 25 t h of April this company signed the agency agreement with 
CNR South Africa. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And that’s the company that was going to 
be entitled to that huge amount of the relocation fee?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Correct, initially the fee of 370million but 
it was changed down to 100million.  
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes, now may I refer you back to your 
statement and please take us from page seven paragraph 25 and 
please make us to understand the different amounts that ar e reflected 
therein and their significance. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Ja so I think it goes to the point that BEX 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 160 of 206 
 
was entitled to a fee of anything over R280 million.  For starters we did 
not know where the R280 million came from.  On the 21 April 2015 the 
company emailed us a calculation which is attached as Annexure 11 
showing us calculations for supporting an amount of R287 million.  At 
that stage obviously we had not even seen.  When we saw the BEX 
contract an amount referred to of R280 million we had no i dea where 
that amount had come from. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And on the 21 April for the first time we 
saw some calculations supporting an amount of R287 million.  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Maybe let us go to those calculations.  
Chair it is RG11 to be found on page 233.   
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair it is on pages 233 to 235. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So unfortunately it is a long A3 page it is 
sort of printed in three A4 pages.  But you will see quite  an amateurish 
document that says for example point1 increase logistics costs R45  100 
million.  Then increased cost for set up facilities in Durban and 
traveling R27 300 million etcetera.  And there are eight line items and 
the total of that line item is R287 million and some change. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And Chair if I may just add what I find 
fascinating is this was emailed to us by the company claiming that the 
relocation claim should be R287 million.  But ultimately Transn et paid 
them R647 million which is even more absurd.  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 161 of 206 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  [coughing] excuse me.  Your calculation of the 
relocation costs was about R9 million, is that right?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair R9.7 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  R9.7 million.  So this company at this stage 
inexplicably says R26,3 million well it has got some whatever it says 
here but you say ultimately it was 600 and something million?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair ja our – we increased the 
tender price by 9.7 million for all 232 locomotives.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  The company submitted something for 
10 
R287 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And that is obviously when they entered 
into the initial – when they had discussions with BEX initially and the 
draft agreement we got referred to a benchmark of R280 million.  So it 
seems that this is where the R280 million came from.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And so this is their own calculation sent 
by the company of a potential claim that they thought they  had of R287 
million but ultimately Transnet paid R647 million to the company.  
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  From an amount which you say it was 
R9.7 and it was already factored in – into the amount that was 
supposed to be paid to the consortium?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  That is quite correct Chair. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Now for now we are now sitting at an 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 162 of 206 
 
amount of R280 million which you are unable yourself to give meaning 
or sense to it as to how it was arrived at?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Absolutely Chair.  I mean you can see on 
pages 233 to 235 a very poorly constructed schedule supporting an 
amount of R287 million. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Do you know if there was anything that 
significantly changed from when the relocation amount was 9.7 for it to 
arrive to be R208 that could at least you know explain or justify this 
amount? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair I – I have no doubt that when the 
10 
company arrived at Bayhead they may have found that the facility 
maybe is not what they expected and thought that they – there was an 
amount that they could possibly claim.  If that was the case it would be 
very easy to prove what it is and Transnet should have given us the 
answers and said, the company is entitled to a claim for this specific 
reason.  For example maybe this p iece of equipment does not exist and 
we said it did exist and so we need to – you had to acquire the 
equipment yourself so we now need to reimburse you.  But nothing of 
that sort happened. So I cannot see any justification when we 
submitted a fixed final price that included an amount for relocation as 
20 
we had calculated together with CNR of R9.7 million and included that 
in the final price of the locomotives how we were entitled to anything?  
Bearing in mind that we are shareholders in the company.  We would  
love to get a reimbursement of an amount.  We just could not see any 
justification for it.   
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 163 of 206 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Ja may I refer you back to your 
statement?  Page 7 and proceed to deal with paragraph 26 because it 
appears that that amount for 280 does  not end there but for some 
reason it gets increased?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Sure so Chair what actually happened is 
that a contract was signed it is in Annexure 12 on page 238 and this 
was a contract signed between CNR, South Africa and TFR in respect 
of this relocation allowance or claim.  It was signed in July 2015 and 
Counsel I do not know if you want me to go into the amounts now?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes let us go – maybe let us do that – let 
10 
us align that with you – with Annexure RG12 on page 238. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Sure. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So – Chair then on page 239 you will see 
that the claim now has gone – moved from this R287 million that we 
were referring to to an amount of R719 million and then CNR are quite 
gracious in offering a settlement discount of 10% amounting to R71 
million to TFR and that the nett amount…  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am sorry.  You have lost me.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Page 239 Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe in part because I h ave been thinking 
about what you telling me.  These kinds of amounts that were just 
claimed and paid.  Okay where are we?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Chair 239.  Page 239 that is where the – 
That is where Mr Gonsalves is.  Mr Gonsalves while the Chair is 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 164 of 206 
 
shocked about those amounts could you please be slow and take us 
through the contents of 239?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Sure.  So…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hopefully somebody else will come and – and say 
there was no reason to be shocked this was all justified.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair we have requested that from TFR.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Transnet already and from CNR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And no one has given us a satisfactory 
10 
answer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you.  229 you said  Mr Mokoena? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  239. 
CHAIRPERSON:  239. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  239 yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair this is the agreement that was 
eventually signed between CNR South Africa and TFR in respect of the 
relocation allowance and you will see that it was signed by Jeff on page 
249, by Jeff Wang on behalf of CNR and by Anoj Singh on behalf of 
20 
Transnet.  The version that we have in this file is only being say – 
signed by Jeff Wang we do not have the version tha t was signed by 
Anoj Singh as well. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  But can you confirm that you are aware 
of the signed version which was signed on behalf of Transnet by Anoj 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 165 of 206 
 
Singh and on behalf of the consortium by Mr Jeff Wang?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Correct Chair you will see later on that 
Siyabonga Gama confirms that this is accepted.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.   
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair going back to page 239 if I 
may?  You will see in the first – at the bottom of the first paragraph the 
cost has now ballooned from this 9.7 to the R287 million to now R719 
million and… 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is okay let me – that is 239? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  It is under the heading ‘Summary’ Chair?  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Executive Summary? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Executive Summary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Maybe if we – what we can do Mr 
Gonsalves if you can read it?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Sure. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  And then thereafter you can comment 
about it so that at least we are able to follow y our evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair I will read the first two 
20 
paragraphs under the Executive Summary.  
“We have been requested to analyse the cost 
increase for the locomotive delivery and locomotive 
factory relocation in terms of manufacturing facility 
relocation for Class 45D locomotive supply project.  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 166 of 206 
 
The decision to relocate from Pretoria, Gauteng to 
Durban KwaZulu Natal will cost an estimated R719 
million but the precise amount is R719  090 548.00.  
Of this amount we are happy  to offer settlement 
discount 
of 
10% 
amounting 
to 
R71  909 054.00 
therefore the reduced amount due to CNR after 
deducting the settlement discount amounts to R647 
million 
– 
R647 
million 
the 
exact 
amount 
R647 181 494.00.” 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  And your comment on these 
10 
paragraphs bearing in mind the 9.7?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So ja so Counsel you are quite correct.  
Chair the amount went from 9.7 to an email that we got supporting 
R287 million which seems to tie in with the initial draft BEX contract  
where there is a benchmark of R280 million and then this ballooned to 
R719 million but CNR was so gracious as to give a 10% discount to 
TFR so that the amount reduced to R647 million.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  They were indeed gracious with that 
amount.  If you may refer back to page 7 of your statement and 
summarise the contents of paragraph 27 Mr Gonsalves.  
20 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Ja I think what we mentioning here is 
that the – as alluded to earlier on is that the benchmark in the first 
draft BEX contract alluded to an amount of – referred to an amount of 
R280 million and in the signed contract with BEX I am using the term 
BEX loosely because there were two different companies with two 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 167 of 206 
 
different registration numbers but that amount – that benchmark then 
increased to R580 million. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  And you may proceed with your 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay so I am sorry.  Where is the R580 
million? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That figure? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  If you go to Annexure 8 I think it is Chair 
you will see under the fee section it should be Clause 6.   
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Page 216 Chair. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  222. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you and then go to – do I go to 217? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Triple 2, 222. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  I think 222 is the best page. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Ja 222. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh where we were just now?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I see it here.  Thank you. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Sure Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But as we talk about these figures I asked you earlier 
on what justification or what Transnet said when you put your 
suggestion or preference to them that the manufacturing should happen 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 168 of 206 
 
in Gauteng.  You said they said something like they wanted to speed – 
as you understood their argument why did that – why was that 
necessary? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair I think it is possibly a capacity 
issue. There is only so many locomotives that can be manuf actured.  
So if you have got two facilities I know that they wanted to expedite the 
production of the locomotives.  So if you could only make for example 
12 locomotives in a month in one facility say in Koedoespoort if you 
split it between Koedoespoort in Bayhead you could make 24 
locomotives in a month.  So it would be expedited that was one reason 
10 
I know that they mentioned.  The other reason that was mentioned was 
just a transfer of skills.  Having skills in both Koedoespoort and 
Bayhead to manufacture locomotives so you would have the skills in 
two different locations. 
CHAIRPERSON: But if one looked at the costs and let us leave it at – 
at your figure of 9, something million.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did it seem – did this seem to justify all those costs 
to you, all of that? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair obviously we were not involved in 
20 
Transnet’s decision making. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  I do understand that there may be an 
argument why he would want to split it and di versify a risk from a 
geographic perspective. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 169 of 206 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Skills transfer not having all your risk in 
one facility if something had to go wrong at Koedoespoort.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR 
ROBERTO 
GONSALVES: 
 
At 
least 
you 
could 
contin ue 
manufacturing in Bayhead etcetera.  So I understand that.  I was not – 
we were not involved in that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  It was just given to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it would just depend on the finer details I would 
10 
imagine – finer details of around that decision.  I guess always subject 
to how much it is going to cost to do that.   
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair if … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Probably if you – if you are a state entity it is not like 
you just using your own money. But as you say the re may be – there 
may be value which – on which one cannot put rands and cents or rand 
value if you talk about expansion of skills and so on.  But of course as I 
say subject what the costs will be. Obviously also one would look at 
long term benefits of tha t – of splitting you know.  Okay alright.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Correct Chair. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  But could there have been a justification 
for the amount of 9.7 to become 280 and ultimately 647?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Mr Chair… 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Whatever the reason that might be 
proffered? 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 170 of 206 
 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair absolutely not.  So the decision 
was made that CNR South Africa had to manufacture and assemble in 
Bayhead.  It was done.  We increased the price that we bid on the 
locomotives by R9.7 million taking into account the additional cost and 
some of the savings and we were – it was paid for in built-in in a fixed 
price contract.  Even if the amount was R287 million had ballooned to 
R287 million from R9 million which I think sounds abs urd by any stretch 
of imagine we had no basis for a claim in my mind and until someone 
could justify that and show us we – you know we just could not accept 
it. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  I mean surely as a shareholder would 
have loved that this money must be paid to your company to the 
consortium to benefit the consortium but in your clear conscience you 
say that there could not have been justification for the company to 
receive such amount from Transnet.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  No Chair it is I mean – it may sound 
absurd for a shareholder to turn around and say we do not want the 
R647 million that we have paid we do not believe we are entitled to it 
but that is precisely what we did.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but it is – it is what makes you to reject it is the 
20 
fact that it is improper.  If you thought it was proper by all means you 
would welcome it I have no doubt.  But the problem was that you took 
the view that this was improper. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair I think you hit the nail on the head.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 171 of 206 
 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So if it was a proper claim and it had 
justification for it we would have been happy.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And the only way we could find out was 
to approach Transnet and say this is what we have been paid R647 
million.  If we are entitled to it fantastic.  We still got a problem with 
the BEX issue but that is another issue.  But are we entitled to the 
R647 million, can you help us in that respect?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes.  May I refer you back to your 
witness statement with particular reference to page 8 and please if you 
10 
may comment from paragraph 28 and share with us what you are 
conveying in that paragraph and also paragraph 29?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES: Sure.  So perhaps Chair I can just read 
this because I think it is quite important. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:   
“It was not clear to us as the minority non -executive 
CRRC directors why having negotiated the term…”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay is it page 7?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Page 8. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 8. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Paragraph 28. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay thank you. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Sure so Chair I will start again.   
“It was not clear to us as the minority non -executive 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 172 of 206 
 
CRRC directors why having negotiated the terms of  
an agreement with Transnet as extensive and 
complex as a locomotive supply agreement and 
despite having access to considerable rail rolling 
experience with the shareholder base CNR South 
Africa nevertheless felt it necessary to appoint an 
intermediary such as BEX which appears to have 
been a newly formed company with no trading history 
and 
little 
or 
no 
background 
in 
assembly, 
manufacture, 
maintenance 
or 
operation 
of 
10 
locomotives or any other experience in the rail 
industry to negotiate a second directly related 
agreement 
[which 
we 
subsequently 
noted 
was 
referred to a variation order with Transnet and 
furthermore to do so on such significantly generous 
terms to BEX.” 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  While you are there may be let us 
complete that thought by referring  you to RG14 on page 261 and if you 
can identify the document and also summarise the contents of that 
document and please proffer your comment on it?  
20 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Sure.  So Chair this is a document 
signed on the 23 July 2015 by the acting Group E xecutive Siyabonga 
Gama of Transnet and it is addressed to Jeff Wang of CNR and in 
summary what the letter says is that it serves to confirm the 
acceptance of the variation order of the amount of R647 million of 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 173 of 206 
 
which the proposed payment terms was 50% pay able within fourteen 
days which is R323 million and I am rounding the numbers and 50% 
payable in 24 equal instalments of R13.4 million.  Chair if I may just 
add on my paragraph 28?  What we – what I was referring to there is 
that the locomotive supply agreement is a document of over 500 pages 
and it took weeks on end to negotiate.  A similar document was 
negotiated with Transnet Engineering also over 500 pages. This was 
done within the consortium we had lots of experience especially 
amongst the BE partners.  We had Azon Rail there.  We had a guy 
called Julius Nobanda from Nanetta, Linontando. We had Global Rail 
10 
with tons of rail experience.  Women in Rail. You had Kadies Asalves.  
We had negotiated all these agreements.  We now had a possible claim 
from Transnet related to these agreements why did they not engage 
with us, why did they not inform us, why did they not let us do the 
calculations if there was a calculation? Why would they appoint a 
company BEX that has got no trading history that has never traded  and 
pay them ultimately an amount of R67 million but at one stage could 
have possibly been an amount of R370 million.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you have just said in effect that you had enough 
relevant expertise and experience to do whatever calculations neede d 
20 
to be done and why did they need BEX ja?  Do you want to compare the 
expertise and experience that your team or your consortium had 
compared to BEX’s and I know that you said they were a dormant 
company and so on but just talk, contrast the two for me?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Ja so I think Chair what we are saying is 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 174 of 206 
 
BEX is a dormant company. They absolutely have no experience in this.  
They do not know anything about the local supply agreement.  They 
were not involved in any of the negotiations on the rel ocation to 
Bayhead etcetera.  Within our consortium the reason why CNR selected 
us as a consortium was because of the extensive experience that many 
of the partners in the consortium had in the rail industry.  Why would 
they not turn to us and say we think  we have got a possible claim from 
Bayhead for whatever reason from Transnet for the relocation to 
Bayhead we do not believe that we do but let us assume that there was 
a basis for it can you assist us in putting together some calculation or 
10 
formulate a claim for us?  Instead they turned around to a company 
called BEX that is as we know a dormant company ten days earlier they 
appointed the director, no trading history etcetera.  That just does not 
make commercial sense whatsoever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How many directors did this company have with whom 
they concluded this contract BEX?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair if I can take you I think it is 
Annexure 12 or 13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  And I  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Annexure 10. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  About 10? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Annexure 10 no, no sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Annexure 10. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Ja you will see…  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Page 231. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 175 of 206 
 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  231 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  One director Mark Shaw appointed on the 
15 April 2015.  The BEX agreement was signed on the 25 April 2015.  
So one director seemingly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Ja.   
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  He might have been experienced Chair?  
CHAIRPERSON:  He? 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  He might have been experie nced? 
CHAIRPERSON:  He might have had experience yes, yes.  
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And a very relevant expertise.  Well maybe the 
witness must tell us whether they did any check on what that director’s 
professional and practical experie nce was?  What experience or 
qualifications he had that may be – may have been relevant to this kind 
of project?  Are you able to shed light on that?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  No Chair.  The only light I can shed on 
here is on the – in the first agreement put in front of us the Annexure 5 
agreement I am going to call it which is the BEX structured products 
that 2000 company I believe that such a company does exist and 
20 
effectively if I may use the term they hijacked the credentials of this 
company and put a doc ument in front of us that purported to show that 
BEX had experience in similar activities.  The reality is that when we 
asked for the documents and they brought us the documents by that 
time the agreements had already been signed and so there was almost 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 176 of 206 
 
we could do.  When they showed us the Sipsey document and the BE 
Certificate document it did not take – it took a few seconds to realise 
that this was a sham company and said so right in front of them.  
Gentlemen do you realise that there is one director tha t is just recently 
been appointed and this company has never traded. It has got a 
turnover less than R5 million.  Obviously they could not respond in any 
meaningful way to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But was your understanding that they were shocked 
by this they just had not done their homework before deciding that they 
would have this arrangement with this company, contract with this 
10 
company?  Or was you understanding that they knew and they may 
have had other reasons to continue and conclude the contract with 
them? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair certainly when they presented 
us at the board meeting with these documents and we counted 
immediately when we saw that it was affectively a dormant company, a 
sham company they – they never defended it in any way.  They n ever 
expressed any shock in any way.  I kind of sensed that they were aware 
what they were dealing with or who they were dealing with.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you.  If they were aware that might mean 
20 
that they may have been up to something that was not pro per.  Are you 
able to indicate what you think?  Why would they – why would they 
want to let a company with no experience, with really that had been 
dormant and with one director that had operated on the basis of a 
turnover of less than R4 million want it t o handle hundreds of millions 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 177 of 206 
 
or rands?  Why would that be beneficial to them?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair the benefit to them was that 
BEX acting as an agent was able to procure R647 million from Transnet 
which they claim that they could not and for B EX to be able to facilitate 
that BEX got paid an amount of R67 million.  So remember that what 
their claim was at one stage R280 million.  Let us just – let us assume 
that it is a correct calculation done by the company they ultimately 
receive R647 million through the assistance of BEX and for that BEX 
was paid R67 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But how could a company with no experience or 
10 
expertise in this sector that you were involved in be able to get I do not 
how many indistinct] I mean hundreds and hundreds o f millions or rands 
above what a consortium with a lot of relevant expertise and experience 
could get, how could that be possible?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair that is the million dollar question. 
That is precisely the same question we asked.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean if – if we talking about for example accounting 
and auditing business and – and one business wants to buy another 
one or some arrangement, I would not have much experience and if you 
– if you took – you a Chartered Accountant you would do far bette r than 
20 
I could ever dream to do to negotiate anything because you have an 
appreciation of various features of the business and certain nuances 
and understandings.  So how could come in with no experience, no 
knowledge, no exposure to the sector and be able  to do that better than 
you? 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 178 of 206 
 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair we could not agree more with you.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm - but you say you – you never checked whether 
the single Director what his or – was it a he or she?  What his or her 
professional background is.  Was it a Chartered Accountant like you or 
was it somebody with Matric only?  Was it somebody within anything 
that one can rely on maybe to – to explain this phenomenal success in 
the negotiations? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  No.  Chair we – we demanded a few 
times … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  That we meet with BEX.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  That was never forthcoming …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  For obvious reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  We asked the question of them have you 
ever met with BEX.  They claimed that they had met with BEX.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So we demanded the same thing.  We 
20 
want to see CVs, credentials …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Etcetera.  None of that ever – we never 
received any of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 179 of 206 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  May you please return back to your 
statement page 8 and summarise for us what your statement from 
paragraph 29 which I believe it is quite important.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Ja.  So I think page 29 – paragraph 29 
we are saying that even though the variation order is financially 
beneficial.  We think that the Locomotive Supply Agreement already 
envisages that we – the operations are going to be at Bayhead and it is 
a fix price contract and an amount of R9.7 million has already been 
included for all 232 locomotives.  So we cannot see how we are entitled 
to any amount. 
10 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe I should just say something.  I should not be 
misunderstood.  I talked as we are talking about what experience the 
BEX Director had.  I said maybe it was just somebody with Matric.  I do 
not mean that people with Matric – you know - cannot have experience 
and expertise.  So I just want to – to – I was just comparing for 
example you are talking about in the example I gave of financial 
Chartered Accountants or getting – you know – for that you would need 
– I would imagine – you know - to be on at least the same level as the 
people in that sector but certainly there are m any people even without 
20 
Matric who are very good in their jobs and who have lot of important 
and relevant experience.  So I do not want to be misunderstood in 
anyway.  I was just comparing with a situation where you need 
somebody with certain – you know – academic qualifications in that 
sector but maybe you might be given somebody who does not have that 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 180 of 206 
 
when that is essential.  So that is what – so I thought I must just 
explain that. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Okay, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Understood. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes – but what expertise would be 
required for one to really negotiate such a transaction?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair I think you would – to – to 
negotiate that one would have – need quite a bit of rail experience 
especially experience in the manufacturing and assembly of – and 
10 
understand what the basis of the claim could be.  Does it relate to 
logistics?  Does it relate to training?  Does it relate to the facilities, the 
equipment etcetera?  So one would hav e to be pretty knowledgeable 
about the rail industry and manufacturing and supply chain – you know 
– processes to be able to calculate an amount.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now the minority shareholder is 
also – did have regard to that variation order and they made certain 
observations as you do from page 9 paragraph 31.  If you can please 
summarise what is written therein.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Ja.  Chair so even though CNR had 
20 
signed the agreement with BEX we thought we would let them know that 
we thought this is outside the ordinary course of business and in terms 
of the Memorandum of Incorporation it requires 70 percent of the 
shareholders to agree on a transaction on agreement and because CNR 
holds 66 percent of the shares 30 percent held by (indis tinct), 2 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 181 of 206 
 
percent by Global and 2 percent by Cadiz that if we could elevate this 
to a shareholder level we would vote against it …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And their response was we have taken 
legal opinion that this is in ordinary course of business. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So clearly they did not want to heed the 
advice that you are giving them against – you know – having to accept 
this amount from Transnet?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair that is correct.  They knew that the 
minority Directors already voted no at the Board level and if it went to a 
10 
shareholder meeting they would vote in the same way.  So they would 
only get 66 percent and not 70 percent and therefore they would not get 
the shareholder resolution signed.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  In order to contextualise what you 
are saying can I refer you to RG15 – 1-5 Chair.  It is on page 263.  
Maybe you will be able to explain much more clearly to the Chair what 
you are trying to explain to us now by having regard to this  document.  
Please identify that document first.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair this is the MOI – the 
Memorandum of Incorporation – for CNR Rolling Stock South Africa.  
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And if I may refer you to page 265 with 
particular reference to paragraph 4.1.3.27.  If you can read it and give 
your perspective on that clause. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair this is a clause out of the MOI 
and these are all the issues - and there are 30 of them – that require if 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 182 of 206 
 
you like the majority of the share holders to approve and 4.1.3.27 has 
one of the items there as: 
“The conclusion of any contract outside the ordinary 
course of the business is an item that would require 
the majority of your shareholders …”  
Which is 70 percent. 
“…to agree on it.” 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and subsequent to that the minority 
shareholder also did write a letter to the company expressing their 
concerns.  Am I correct?  
10 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair that is quite correct.  That is 
included as Annexure 16 from – on page 267. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair it is page 267.  If you may turn to 
that – that page Mr Gonsalves.  For the importance of this letter and 
what is contained therein Chair may through your indulgence request 
the witness to read it as it also finds itself later o n when - when the 
witness testifies about reporting the matter to the Hawks.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair the – the letter is dated 
8 June 2016.  That is when the last person signed it and it is addressed 
to the Board of Directors of CNR and to the moth er company – CRRC.  
20 
It is quite important.  So we also sent it to China and the heading is 
“The Appointment of BEX Expansion Structured Products (Pty) Ltd”.  
There are 19 points in the letter. I thought if I may just highlight which I 
thought  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes, you may do that. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 183 of 206 
 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Are the relevant points. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes, yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So in paragraph 4 of that letter I read 
out: 
“It has also come to our attention that despite all 
the Board Directors nominated by the minority 
shareholders of CNR South Africa the Non CRRC 
Directors 
expressing 
serious 
reservations 
and 
offering considerable opposition to the appointment 
of BEX.  The Directors nominated by CRRC …”  
10 
In other word the CRRC Directors. 
“…nevertheless proceeded to vote in favour of such 
appointment.” 
We then – if you could turn over the page – Clause 8 or paragraph 8 of 
the letter. 
“At the Board Meeting of 10 April 2015 the Non 
CRRC Directors objected strongly to the company 
entering into an agreement with BEX and requested 
that the descent be expressly noted and minuted.”  
The next paragraph: 
20 
“Notwithstanding the objections of Non CRRC 
Directors CNR South Africa nevertheless proceeded 
to sign an agreement with BEX as opposed to BEX 
Structured Products (Pty) Ltd on 23 April 2015.” 
And then paragraph 16 right at the bottom of page 268.  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 184 of 206 
 
“Although the second agreement …”  
That is a second agreement with Transnet.  
“…concluded 
with 
Transnet 
maybe 
financially 
beneficial for CNR South Africa it remains un clear 
why or how such agreement was concluded given 
that the Locomotive Supply Agreement envisages 
and provides for CNR South Africa to establish its 
operations at the Bayhead Depot and for the supply 
of locomotives to take place Bayhead on a fixed 
price basis.” 
10 
And then paragraph 17 is – it is the one that I referred to about 
shareholder approval being required because we believe it is outside 
the ordinary course of business and then perhaps and most important 
or very important aspect of this letter paragr aph 19: 
“Furthermore we believe that this matter to be of 
significant importance and as such we will be 
scheduling a meeting with Transnet to discuss the 
matter.” 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Was this letter reacted to by the 
majority shareholders?  Did they react?  Did they …?  
20 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair not – not in any means whatsoever 
and that is sort of being typical of their behaviour whenever we raised 
an issue there has been on response.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now did you proceed to have the 
meeting instruction with that letter with Transnet in order to raise the 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 185 of 206 
 
same issues? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Absolutely Chair.  So on 16  August 2016 
Rowlen von Gericke …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Paragraph 34 Chair page 9. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Page 9 ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES: 
 
So 
on 
16 August 2016 
Rowlen von Gericke from Global together with Stan  Whiting from 
Global, Lulamile Xate representing Endinamix and I representing Cadiz 
we met with Siyabonga Gama who is the Group Chief Executive Officer 
10 
with Garry Pita the Group Chief Financial Officer and we met with 
Ndiphiwe Silinga who is the Group Legal and Compliance Officer to 
discuss this. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes and what happened in that meeting?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Well what is quite interesting is that at 
that stage we had not seen the variation order that had already been 
signed by Anoj Singh and we had not seen the acceptance letter of the 
variation order signed by Siyabonga  Gama as well.  So we went into 
that meeting just raising our issues about the BEX contract, how it was 
entered into, the amount that was claimed and what our belief was that 
20 
there was no commercial substance to it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well in your statement you do not seem to deal much 
with the content of that meeting – the discussion.  I know you have just 
made two sentence or so.  If you are able to it would be good if you can 
tell me more.  This is what you said and that is what the Transnet 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 186 of 206 
 
delegation said or Mr  Gama if he was the only one.  Oh, not he  was not 
the only from Transnet.  There was a delegation.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The exchange – the issues you raised – you know.  
You told us the issues were of concern to you.  Did you raise the same 
issues? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and what was their response?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe if you can you can give their response to the 
10 
different issues. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair we raised two issues.  One was 
that the relationship between the minority shareholders and CNR was 
not ideal.  Mainly because of corporate governance issues.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  That the Chinese did not seem to 
understand that we took corpor ate governance seriously and so that 
was the one issue. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And you will see it is referred to later on 
in … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  In the papers …  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 187 of 206 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And then the second issue was BEX.  We 
said that the company wants to engage or has engaged with BEX and to 
pay them a fee in respect of the relocation allowance.  We do not 
believe that we are entitled to a relocation allowance.  We may be 
missing something.  There may be something in the locomotive supply 
agreement which is a 500 page document that entitles us to a claim …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  That we are not aware of.  Was Transnet 
aware of this claim?  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Do they know whether we are entitled to 
an amount?  Can they justify the amount?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So perhaps we do not have the problem 
with the amount that is being claimed from Transnet and then we have 
only got a problem with BEX. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Their response was surprise from – from 
Transnet’s perspective. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  With hindsight there should not have 
been any surprise but you will see why and – I mean – there was even 
a comment I think that the CEO made that this alarming because 
perhaps a similar amount could have been paid to other OEMs …  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 188 of 206 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And said therefore this had to be 
investigated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So – so you say their – well did you tell them 
one there is going to be no relocation here?  Did you – did you …?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  We told them that (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and what – what did they say?  That they insist 
that there was going to be relocation on their  understanding? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  No.  So look we – so let us maybe clarify 
the relocation.  So …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  R9.7 million was an increase in the price 
- in the tender price because manufacturing no longer was going to be 
at Koedoespoort based on our initial tender calculations and it was 
going to be at Bayhead …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And once that was agreed to and – and 
formulated into the final pricing …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  It was signed on a fixed price contract 
20 
basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So we told them - that is exactly what we 
told them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 189 of 206 
 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So we did not think that we were entitled 
to an amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  But we also said that it is possible …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  That we are entitled to an amount and we 
just do not know what the basis of that amount is and how it is 
calculated and on what basis in the legal agreements we  can claim that 
amount … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And perhaps we had missed something …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And it was a simple response – a simple 
answer and someone can refer us to the Locomotive Supply Agreement 
and say in terms of Clause 32 or whatever it is you are entitled to a 
relocation allowance under these circumstances.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So we asked them please provide that to 
us and they undertook that they would look into it and they r equested 
us to give them copies of all the documents which we did subsequently 
20 
you will see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  At that time when you met with them where were 
these costs?  I mean – they have been moving up.  Was it around what 
figure were they at that time if you are able to remember?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  I think it comes later on.  I do not – at 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 190 of 206 
 
that stage I think we were still talking about the term of R80 million.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay but you are saying that at that meeting 
they were not able to tell you why you were entitled to – to that 
amount? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Absolutely not.  They said they would 
investigate it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So – so it was not even a situation where they 
would tell you something but you – an explanation which you find 
unacceptable.  They simply said they would investigate?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which means they did not – they – they might not 
have been aware.  That is one way of interpreting.  That they might not 
have been aware but that is difficult to say because they - they would 
or maybe they would investigate by talking to people who were much 
more involved maybe. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Ja.  So Chair we assumed when we left 
the meeting we assumed that they were not aware of  this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  That is the impression that we got.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  But we can see from the evidence that …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  The variation – acceptance of the 
variation order had already been signed …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 191 of 206 
 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  By the CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so that meeting the variation had been signed?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Yes but we had not seen it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had not seen it? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if they had signed – if it had been signed then 
they should be - they should have been aware of the justification - if 
there was one? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Correct Chair, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do you remember who – who had signed on 
10 
behalf of Transnet? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The variation. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  The variation order was signed by 
Anoj Singh … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And the acceptance of the variati on order 
was signed by Siyabonga  Gama.  So we can refer that to (intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No as long as you – you know that to be the 
case.  So certainly Mr  Gama who was at that meeting having signed he 
20 
ought to have known what justification there w as and he – I take it – he 
would have known that at some stage those costs had been estimated 
at 9-something million.  So now at that stage they had gone up to 
200-something million. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair that is quite correct. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 192 of 206 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So unless he had signed without interrogating 
those amounts which – which would not be good in terms of looking 
after – protecting Transnet – Transnet’s interests as well. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Ja.  Chair that is quite correct.  If you go 
to page 261 …  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh.  Yes. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And importantly on that page is the date.  
What is the date of that letter?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES: 
 
Ja 
correct. 
 
Chair 
the 
date 
is 
10 
23 July 2015 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And our meeting with the Transnet 
Executives was on 16 August 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it was long after.  I mean at least about a month 
or so.  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  let us – let us … 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then … 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Chair just - just to clarify. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Those dates.  The meeting took place …  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 193 of 206 
 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  The 16 t h. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  On the 23 r d.  The meeting took place on 
16 August 2016. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  2016.  So it is a year almost – more than 
a year later. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  It is more than a year later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, more than a year later?  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  I thought it was a month – the same year. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  So there was no doubt that when you 
10 
met with Mr Gama and the delegate from Transnet already a variation 
order which you have referred the Chair to on page 2 61 has already 
been signed by Mr Gama? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Correct. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Reflecting the amount that you informed 
the Chair about? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Correct.  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And did they ever come back to you?  They  said they 
would investigate.  Did they ever come back to you and let you know 
that this increased amount that you thought you were not entitled to 
20 
you – you were actually entitled to it by virtue of A, B, C, D?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So Chair you will see in my statement a 
couple of things happened.  So after we met we – with – with the 
Executives in person on 16  August on 13 September 2016 - and that is 
paragraph 35. 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 194 of 206 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  35. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  We physically met with Ndiphiwe Silinga 
and handed him 84 pages of documents around the BEX issue that we 
had and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry what documents were those?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  All the BEX issues …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Most of the documents that …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  That we had at that stage relating to 
BEX. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Correspondence and minutes and so on.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Minutes … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  (Indistinct) documents etcetera. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Silinga had been one of the people who had 
attended the August meeting?  
20 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Chair that is quite correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And then Ndiphiwe Silinga called me on 
12 October 2016 and informed me that they were conducting two audits 
– internal audits and the one – to find out two things.  One why 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 195 of 206 
 
Transnet Engineering had not been paid part of the R647 million.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes explain that to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, what - what is that now? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES: 
 
So 
Transnet 
Engineering 
is 
a 
subcontractor …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  To CNR South Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  They build the bodies and the bogies …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR ROBERTO GONSLVES:  And they probably make up 25 percent …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Of the build price. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So what he was implying was that if CNR 
South Africa was entitled to a claim of R647 million …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Then Transnet Engineering maybe was 
entitled as a subcontractor …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  To a portion of that amount …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And his other question was – so at this 
stage I must just correct myself.  We knew it was 647 million.  It was 
not 280.  We are talking about 647 million.  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 196 of 206 
 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Because this 2016 – is how the four – 
R647 million was arrived at as they thought it had looked like certain 
amounts had been duplicated.  That was a telephonic discussion we 
had with him. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And then what happened after that 
telephonic discussions?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Then not a lot until … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  So on – on – so paragraph 36 reveals 
that they did actually come back to you.  After the meeting of August 
10 
they did come back to you or you had interactions and in terms of those 
interactions Silinga – was Silinga a male or female? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  A male. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Silinga indicated that they were investigating 
having conducted audits to establish among others how the R647 
million had been arrived at.  So by this time which was a year later – 
over a year later – the amounts had – the amount has gone up to 
600-something million. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  647 million, quite correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And what – what transpired after that 
meeting with Mr Silinga? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Then on … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am sorry.  I may – I may have – I may have 
misrepresented and you may have agreed – wrongly agreed.  After your 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 197 of 206 
 
August meeting, 2016 is the position that for the rest of that year they 
never came back to you?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So on that – we met on 16 August 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  On 13 September 2016 we met with them 
again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that was still …  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And we gave them all the physical 
10 
information … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And then we had the conversation on 
12 October 2016 where they informed us that they were doing this – 
these investigations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  So in other way  or another you got to 
know that they were investigating?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  Thank you Chair. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Now during these meetings that when 
you met with Mr Silinga and at the time w hen you met with the 
delegation of Transnet was it ever disclosed to you that there was a – a 
variation order that was already signed to this amount?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES: 
 
Chair 
absolutely 
not. 
 
We 
only 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 198 of 206 
 
discovered that later on.  We got that from Hogan Lo vells later on. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Then you may proceed.  That is 
now after you have met with Mr  Silinga on 12 October 2016 what 
happens? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So on 12 October Mr Silinga called me 
and – that is the – and informed me about the  two audits. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  That they were doing. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Subsequent to that? 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  And subsequent to that on 8  December 
10 
Mr Silinga informed us that – he sent us an email saying that Transnet 
has appointed Harold Jacobs of Werksmans to investigate the BEX 
matter and that Mr Jacobs would be contacting us for interviews.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Proceed. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES: 
 
And 
what 
happened 
is 
on 
14 December 2016 we met with Werksmans  team and shared all the 
information that we had on the BEX matter with them.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  And what was the outcome of that 
meeting?  Did they produce any report subsequently?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  No.  They – they were – we kept on 
20 
asking them where they were progressing.  I think the next contact with 
them is we sent them an email at the end of January  2017 asking them 
what the status was of the investigations and they – they stated that it 
was ongoing. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Was there any other subsequent 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 199 of 206 
 
engagement with Transnet?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  A few times we – we would have phoned 
Mr Silinga just to find out what the status was, whether we could assist 
them in anyway, how the investigations were progressing.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:  Yes.  Now from paragraph 40 you refer 
to a letter which you received from Mr  Silinga.  Can you take us 
through the contents of same there on paragraph 11?  What was he 
conveying to the main shareholders?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:  So that is Annexure 18.  So what 
happened was initially the company requested that Lulamile  Xate sign a 
10 
letter that the company addressed to Transnet. In the initial draft that 
they put in front of Lulamile there was a reference in there that we had 
resolved the BEX matter an d Lulamile refused to sign it and had it 
removed, and then signed the letter, and the letter basically said that 
the relationship between CNR and the minority shareholders seem to be 
improving, they were getting a better understanding and appreciate of 
what we meant by corporate governance and that we had directors 
fiduciary duties and responsibilities.  
 
In response to that letter Mr Silinga sent us a letter which is 
attached I think on page 277 ...(intervention)   
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes, but you did reproduce its contents 
from page 11, Chair contents are on page 11.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    Correct.  And in – what Mr Silinga 
requests it says, in essence the letter seems to advise that all 
differences between the shareholders of CNR Rolling Stock Sout h 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 200 of 206 
 
Africa have been resolved and there now exists a good working 
relationship between the parties and he says in the next paragraph:  
“As a direct result of the differences that existed between the 
shareholders you laid a complaint against what you suspected  
to be an untoward conduct by the entity and/or some of its 
shareholders in relation to the relocation cost to a plant in 
Durban.  Transnet through its external attorneys initiated 
investigation which is still at its initial stages.  In light of the 
tone of the attached letter we would be pleased to hear from 
you whether the resolved differenced including the issues 
10 
raised in your complaint in the circumstances Transnet would 
like to know whether you are still pursuing with drawing the 
complaint.” 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   And did the minority shareholders react 
to this letter. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    Chair we responded to the letter and we 
basically said we would like to remind you that there were two items 
that we raised in a meeting with you, the first i ssue relating to the 
relationship and cooperation between CNR and the shareholders, and 
we would like to report that significant progress has been in this 
20 
respect and now I’m reading directly:  
“The second issue related to the BEX issue and the impact on 
the 
minority 
directors 
and 
the 
original 
draft 
of 
the 
abovementioned CNR SA letter made reference to the BEX 
issue but this was removed by Mr Xati as the minority directors 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 201 of 206 
 
and minority shareholders had deliberate not engaged with the 
CNR on this issue, given  that the Transnet is undergoing its 
investigation.  We therefore respectfully encourage you to 
continue along this road until a satisfactory outcome is 
reached and will continue to cooperate fully with you in this 
respect.” 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   So it was clear and unambiguous that in 
as far as it related to the minority shareholders the issue pertaining to 
BEX was still alive and it was still persisting with the complaint.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    That’s quite correct Chair and we 
10 
continued to request that they continue with the investigation.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :     Yes, and then what happened after 
this exchange of correspondence?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that except for the fact that you may have got 
to Transnet’s attention, Transnet’s attention pos sible wrongdoing by 
your co-directors as minority directors and they in regard to a business 
relationship or contract between Transnet and your company why would 
Transnet be interested in whether any disagreements among yourselves 
have been resolved becaus e the majority and the minority, do you 
know?  My own thinking is that if you brought to their attention that for 
20 
argument’s sake, let us say what you brought to their attention was 
corruption they would be obliged to look at it because they shouldn’t be 
party to any corruption and nobody should have engaged in corruption 
relating to any business they were doing, that is Transnet but other 
than that why should it be their business whether you were getting 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 202 of 206 
 
along or not, because I guess if you’re not getting along results in you 
not being able to do – carry out your contractual obligations then they 
should just say look if you don’t – as long as you perform we are not 
concerned about your own issues among yourselves, but if it affects 
performance in terms of the contract we might have to terminate it and 
give it to somebody else who is going to perform.  Why are you – one 
gets the impression from their letter as if you said to them yes we have 
resolved our issues that would mean they mustn’t continue to find ou t 
whether there was anything untoward that had been done by anybody 
from the company? 
10 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    Chair I think you’re absolute correct, I 
think the objective of the letter was to give Transnet grounds not t 
pursue the BEX matter any further.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But am I right that in their letter they seem to be 
concerned about whether you are sorting out our issues?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    Ja, remember that Chair that when we 
went to him them were two issues that we raised, one was shareholder 
issues and like the relationship wasn’t ideal and the second one was 
the BEX issue, and I think what ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but why did you – why should the shareholder 
20 
issues concern them, why did you take that one to them?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    I think there as a bit of a debate as to 
Chair whether we raised with Transnet or not, we just saw them as a 
significant stakeholder and we had a bit of impasse with CNR and we 
were trying to see whether Transnet could assist in that process and 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 203 of 206 
 
they made it clear Chair that they didn’t want to get involved.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh they made that clear?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:   Ja in the relationship and the 
shareholders issues, we had to resort that – sort that out ourselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:     Now flowing from that discussion with 
the Chair Mr Gonsalves I mean let us assume for the moment that there 
shareholders differences were amicably resolved within the consortium 
itself what would justify Transnet from not investigating ho w this 
amount escalated from 9.7, 280 647 000 being an SOE?  
10 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    Chair I would have thought it was a top 
priority and you will see that internally they said there was an 
investigation, I don’t know what the outcome of that is or was, an d then 
they requested Werksmans to do an investigation, I think ultimately 
Werksmans produced a report and I don’t know whether the BEX matter 
was dealt with in that report or not but certainly we were concerned at 
the pace at which you know developments w ere moving. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    And do you know as to who were the 
auditors of the consortium at this stage?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    CNR South Africa? 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :     Yes. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    KPMG. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Were they engaged at any stage 
pertaining to these issues, I mean these are serious irregularities, this 
is serious matters of concern that were raised by the minority?  
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 204 of 206 
 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    Sir the only time that KPMG got 
involved was that we heard that there was a reportable irregularity in 
respect of this but we only heard that a bit later.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes can you deal then with your 
evidence from paragraph 42, page 12 Mr Chair.  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    Mr Chair from a timeline perspective 
this is almost sort of six months later, I received a call from Daisy 
Zang, (indistinct) she is one of the employees at CNR South Africa and 
she mentioned to me that KPMG had informed them that they were 
considering issuing a report of irregularity and that report of irregularity 
10 
if I can refer is the second RI, it’s the second Reportable Irregularity 
because unbeknown to us at that stage they had already reported on 
the BEX issue as a reportable irregularity.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC:   And then what happened after she, after 
the call. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:   So I called Fred Van Eckenstein, the 
KPMG partner, to find out about this reportable irregularity and on that 
call he mentioned to me that this wasn’t the first one that he had 
already issued a reportable irregularity and but obviously I didn’t know 
that was in connection with. 
20 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes.  Now if I may refer you to RG20, 
it’s on page 281 Chair, it’s a very lengthy letter if you may identify that 
letter and summarise for the Chair what it  sought to convey and what 
was the purpose of that letter?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    So Chair this letter is dated the 4 t h of 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 205 of 206 
 
September 2017, it’s a letter from Hogan Lovells addressed to KPMG, 
to the partner, Fred Van Eckenstein, and it’s a letter supporti ng why 
KPMG should not consider the BEX issue to be a reportable irregularity, 
so once KPMG had reported that this was a reportable irregularity, the 
BEX issue, the company then engaged Hogan Lovells to draft a 
response to KPMG and this is the response in Annexure 20. 
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :   Yes, did the minority shareholders 
agree with the sentiments accord in that letter?  
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    Chair absolutely not, we had no 
knowledge at that stage that there was even a reportable irregularity 
10 
and that Hogan Lovells had been engaged to report and work on – to 
respond to the reportable irregularity.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Ja, may I refer you back to your 
statement, page 12, and commence from paragraph 45 of your 
statement to share with us what you’re conveying in that paragraph. 
MR ROBERTO GONSALVES:    So on the 22 n d of September 2017 I 
wrote to Fred van Eckenstein, the KPMG partner, I thanked him for the 
call, I said that he had mentioned to me on the call that there was a 
previous reportable irregularity as well, I told him that none of the 
South African directors, myself, Lulamile Xate or Rowlen von Gericke 
20 
was aware of that and I asked him for – to give us any correspondence 
on it and that correspondence I subsequently got from Hogan Lovells 
and I requested a meeting with him as soon as possible between 
ourselves and the management of the company.  
ADV PHILLIP MOKOENA SC :    Yes, Chair I see that it’s four o’clock, 
23 MAY 2019 – DAY 97 
 
Page 206 of 206 
 
would this be an appropriate time to adjourn, even if we can start at ten 
tomorrow we should be able to deal and complete with the evidence of 
Mr Gonsalves and the other short witness that we might have.  
CHAIRPERSON:  We will take – we will adjourn for today and we will 
resume tomorrow at ten, so do come back.  We adjourn  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 24 MAY 2019
