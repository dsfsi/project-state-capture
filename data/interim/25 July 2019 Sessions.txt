20 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Well I live in Vrede I am an emerging 
farmer around the area of Vrede that is where I farm. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  And tell us about your 
involvement with the municipality in 2012? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE: Well I was a sitting councillor in 2012 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 4 of 77 
 
in the Phumelele Municipality which is made up of three units.  Vrede, 
Memel and Warden. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And which organisation were you 
representing in the council? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  I was representing the Democratic 
Alliance. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  In your statement you tell us about 
the event that took place on the 19 June of 2012 during a council 
meeting.  Would you please elaborate on what happened on that day? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Well it was supposed to be an 
10 
ordinary council meeting at around in the morning.  Then the then MEC 
for Agriculture Mr Mosebenzi Zwane came with his crew from the 
Department of Agriculture and they have a discussion with the ruling 
party which is the ANC.  That is where they ask us as a DA to delay the 
council with two hours so that they can re-represent us with the 
proposal from the Department of Agriculture to maybe to – for the 
council to lease them land of or for agricultural purpose. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And who accompanied Mr Zwane from the 
Department of Agriculture? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Well it was so many people but the 
20 
one whom I remember who did the representation Peter Thabethe. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And what position was he holding at the 
time? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  He was the HOD in the Department of 
Agriculture. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 5 of 77 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And then other than Mr Thabethe was there 
any other official from the Department that you remember? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes, yes there were other officials.  
That one they say is the manager but I cannot recall their names 
because they did not come with any documents in writing they just 
presented us with the verbal – with the oral work. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes then tell us what happened then during 
this presentation? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Oh that is when we – Mr Zwane first 
spoke and told us that they have earmarked Vrede to – to maybe to 
10 
establish a dairy farm whereby there will be a milk processing plant.  
So they were in the council to ask the council to give them permission 
to lease that land which is Krynaauwslust in Vrede.  Then thereafter Mr 
Thabethe came with the representation but he never gave us any 
written documents he was just doing it orally.  That is when they said 
there is a company which is called Estina who will work in partnership 
with a certain company in English which is the big company milk 
processing plant in England. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Did they say in England? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  I mean in India.  The name of the 
20 
company is Paras.  Then they – they told us about the figures of the 
money that will be injected in the project. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and did they tell you where was the – 
what is it that they were requesting from the council? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  They requested that the council 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 6 of 77 
 
should lease the agricultural land to the Department of Agriculture so 
that the Department can establish that dairy plant.  
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And where is this land? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  The farm? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes the agricultural land? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  The agricultural land is the land 
around the area of Vrede.  I think it was – it is a big agricultural land 
which was used by the municipality before.  And by that time I think in 
2011 around August the council has just taken a resolution to lease that 
land to the surrounding commercial farmers.  That land I think it is – it 
10 
is 4400 hectares big.  Then when they represented this story of theirs 
in the council that land was already rented by the local farmers.  
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And how much was the municipality making 
out – making from that land on monthly or annually? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Well you usually – in agricultural 
point of view you usually charge per annum – a hectare per annum.  
And by that time the – the equivalent rate I think it was close to a 
million because if you – if you lease an agricultural land you just – you 
check first what is the – is the value of the hectare then plus or minus 
10% of the value of the hectare that is the rental amount per annum. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes did they explain who or how they 
identify this land? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Not at all. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  The – this request or these type of requests 
how are they usually tabled at the council?  Will someone come in and 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 7 of 77 
 
make an oral presentation or is there a formal process that needs to be 
followed? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Well the procedure was they should 
have written a letter to the municipality so that the speaker and 
municipal manager they can discuss the matter first with the mayors 
and if we do have a council meeting that thing – their item can be 
documented so that it can be on the record.  As this one on the 19 t h 
you cannot find it in the record of the municipality because they come 
just before the council meeting and hijacked the council meeting. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And it was not on the agenda for that day? 
10 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  No not at all. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  How were they – what is it that they were 
offering to the council in exchange for this land? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  They said they will – they will pay the 
council the money which those commercial farmers were paying to the 
council.  Then the Department of Agriculture will buy the commercial 
farmers contract out and compensate them so that they can operate the 
dairy on the farm. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Do you know how much time was still 
outstanding before the lease that the council had with the farmers 
20 
expired? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  As this contract – as this meeting 
took place on the 19 June at the farm you usually – the contract begins 
on the 1 s t August. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 8 of 77 
 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:    I think it was just less than a year – 
almost a year.  The contract of the commercial farmers was less than a 
year old.  They were left with two and maybe two and three months or 
four months to … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Oh they still had about two years 
remaining? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Ja they still have to have more than 
two years in their contracts. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and who was going to buy out the 
commercial farmers that were leasing the land from the municipality? 
10 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  To what it was represented in the 
council it was said the Department of Agriculture will – will do the 
compensation and buy them out. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and you said who made the 
presentation?  Is it Mr Zwane or was it someone else from the 
Department? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  The bigger – the large portion of the 
representation was done by Mr Thabethe. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay.  And what else did they tell you with 
regards to the project that they wanted to use the land for on that day?  
20 
You deal with that in paragraph 5 of your affidavit which is on page 2. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  They told us the figures of the money.  
They said the Department of Agriculture is prepared to pay 100 million 
per annum in this project till it get off the ground.  They said the pilot 
project will be three years.  And in addition of that 300 million for that 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 9 of 77 
 
three years they said then they have also earmarked 100 people who 
will be beneficiaries in the BEE beneficiary model in that dairy.  Then 
those people will be given 100 million again which makes it 400 million 
in all.  Then – which means – which mean… 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Sorry how were they going to be given this 
100 million? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  They said they – one beneficiary will 
be given 1 million so that they can – they can buy cattle.  That the 
dairy cattle and bring them into the dairy. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
10 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Then they said Estina will… 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And sorry how does it add up to 400 million 
then? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Well the Department they said the 
Department has planned to inject 300 for the project.  Then in extra the 
Department will give beneficiaries 100 million that is what makes it 400 
million. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes.  Then they also said Estina will 
come with half a million – will come with 500 million. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Which will be – which will be injected 
by the – by that big company from India which is Paras.  They said 
Paras will give Estina that 500 million.  Then all in all when we worked 
this out then it was close to a billion.  If you maybe you add up the VAT 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 10 of 77 
 
by that time.  It was very much close to a billion. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and how was this received by the 
council? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Well I – I am the – in the council I 
was the only person who is clued up with the agriculture because I 
have been farming since 2003.  The council were so excited because 
the figures that just make people to be excited but when you look at the 
bigger picture you could see that from the beginning this thing was – 
was a little bit like a scam because they came in the council with no 
feasibility study, no business plan, no budget.  They just – they just 
10 
throw in figures without giving documentation on how these figures will 
be generated or will be brought into … 
ADV 
ZINHLE 
BUTHELEZI: 
 
Did 
you 
ask 
for 
the 
supporting 
documentation or did anyone in the council ask for that documentation? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  As they hijacked the council meeting 
just after they left the – the first item in the – in the council was the 
council of the Department of Agriculture. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  As you can – then that is when we 
asked the question now among ourselves and I was the person who was 
20 
asking those questions and say Honourable Councillors this thing if we 
do not think outside the box then we will get into trouble if we – we 
approved this certain project.  Because it did not sound like really.  It 
looked like a dream but if you are clued up then you could see that it 
was a scam. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 11 of 77 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Why do you say it is a scam?  Why did you 
– how did you reach that conclusion? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  In the same council meeting when we 
discussed the matter I even asked them that how are they going to 
identify those beneficiaries?  Then the criteria was not clear.  I even 
warned them.  I said let us not make this thing to be a pay cheque for 
maybe for party members because most of the time on the ground the 
party members more especially if there is a ruling party, party members 
believe that thing has been planted in the – into their minds that each 
and everything which comes from the government is meant for them not 
10 
for the community at large.  It is meant for certain individuals that is 
where we discussed this matter and say they must table – they must 
bring forward the criteria in which they are going to identify 
beneficiaries.  Then I was – I remember then they said I am against 
development because this thing is going to develop Vrede and it is 
going to benefit the people of Phumelele. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes do you know then what happened to 
this request eventually?  Was there a decision that was taken after you 
deliberated as council members? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Just after that then in the following 
20 
council meeting then that is when the documentation with regards to 
this Estina Dairy scam appeared in the council records.  Then that is 
where we – we – the council took a decision that they will lease the 
land to the Department. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Was this a unanimous decision?  Were 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 12 of 77 
 
there any opposition to this particular resolution? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Well we opposed the [indistinct] and 
it was a unanimous decision because as we were we were only three 
councillors from the opposition then the ANC councillors were I think 
were 13.  All in all we were 15. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So there were 12? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  There were 12 yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So the opposition did not oppose this 
request? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Well I do represent my side of the 
10 
story from [indistinct]. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Your concerns? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  But I represented it personally in my 
personal capacity as the person who know – who knows about 
agriculture.  As I am saying all 14 – all 14 councillors sitting councillors 
by then were not clued up with agriculture. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  On paragraph 9 of your statement you 
deal with the decline in dairy farming in the area.  Could you just take 
20 
us to that or elaborate on that? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Around the area of Phumelele when 
we grew up until late 90’s we had more than 30 dairy farmers around 
that area and. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 13 of 77 
 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  As a result when they represented 
this proposal of theirs we had only three dairy farmers around the area 
of Phumelele. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know what was the reason for this significant 
decrease in the number of dairy farms? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Chair I think the – I believe that the 
reason emanated from the farm gate.  When those farmers were 
farming by that time the milk processors used to buy maybe a litre 
maybe they will pay R2.00 per litre from the farm gate and by that time 
10 
then the cost of feeding those cattle – those dairy farms has escalated 
as is well known that dairy cattle need intensive feeding.  They depend 
on the feeding.  They cannot maybe be driving more than 300 meters 
from where they are being milked.   So when – I think – I believe that 
the farmers realised that they were doing a loss with regards to this 
dairy – dairy business.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So you believe that the decline was due to a number 
of challenges in the dairy farm business? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes inside the farm gate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm  Okay. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  So is the cost of – the cost of 
feed for these – for the cows that was one of the driving factors, is that 
your evidence? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes that is my evidence I put forward. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  And you also talk about the 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 14 of 77 
 
milk processing plants around Vrede were they milk processing plant in 
the area or close to the area of Vrede? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Before the decline the milk 
processing plant which was – it was in Standerton.  It is 50 kilometres 
from Vrede.  As a result of this decline from dairy farmers around the 
area then the milk processing plant was relocated to Harrismith. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Hm. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  And Harrismith is plus or minus 110 
kilometres from Vrede.  Then the people who were working in 
Standerton were also – the employees were also transferred to 
10 
Harrismith that is where they – most of them work even the ones who 
were residing in Vrede.  Then the other milk processing plant is in 
Frankfort and from Frankfort to Vrede it is plus or minus 80 kilometres.  
I think what made to relocate that milk processing plant is the decline 
of those dairy milk farmers around the area as by that time as I stated 
that there were more than 30.  One farmer was milking not less than 
100 cattle.  Then you can imagine the litres that they were supplying 
those milk processing plants around those areas. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Were you informed that for this 
project there was also an intention to build a processing plant during 
20 
that presentation? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  They said would – we were informed 
that it will be a dairy – they will have dairy milk cattle and also utilise 
the land thereafter then and a big milk processing plant which will 
supply South Africa. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 15 of 77 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Would that then not be to the advantage of 
the Vrede people having a processing plant nearby? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Well if it was done properly and 
maybe have people who knows how to do I think it was going to be 
feasible but as you can see they never gave us any documentation that 
we can go through and see what is their plan with regards to this thing.  
Then that is what made us not to believe it was going to be possible for 
it to be in operation. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes but – when you say it made us. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Who are you referring to? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  As – well when we discussed – 
usually when we go to a council meeting we do have some – we do hold 
a caucus but with regards to this dairy thing I was given the mandate to 
speak about it.  That is what I told my colleague in the caucus that this 
thing is not going to be feasible. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes because the councils municipal 
manager – Vrede municipal manager will come to the commission and 
say this project was supported even by some of the opposition 
councillors. 
20 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Well as I stated that I was the one 
who was speaking about it.  But in our caucus then we – I do stand up 
– I stood up and tell them that this thing is not going to work.  But in 
the council then I was speaking alone then I cannot – well I cannot 
stand in his way and say maybe he is wrong.  He might be right.  But I 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 16 of 77 
 
was speaking from the – the agricultural knowledge which I had with 
regards to this dairy. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay. And in paragraph 11 you deal with the 
relationship – you deal with the relationship that Mr Zwane had with the  
Mayor Mr Motaung can you just elaborate on that? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Mr John Motaung who is the 
Municipal Mayor in the Phumelele Municipality.  
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Ja he has been a Mayor for three 
consecutive terms in that municipality because he has been Mayor for – 
10 
since 2004. They were like brothers with the MEC Mr Mosebenzi 
Zwane.  That is why the Mayor even in the council that is him who 
insisted that this project must be approved. I mean this lease must be 
approved to the Department of Agriculture. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  And you attach the resolution that was 
made by the council.  It appears from page Chair.  Looking at this 
resolution there is no way where it indicates that there was opposition 
from the opposition party.  In fact this resolution was made 
unanimously by all parties or by all the members of the council. What 
do you say to that? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why do we not have a clearer copy? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Um. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have been saying whenever there are going to be 
annexures the legal team must please try and make sure that we have 
got clearer pictures.   
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 17 of 77 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes especially page 7 it is difficult even for 
me read Chair but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but I am asking why do we not have a clearer 
copy because I have been saying that for quite some time.  The legal 
team looks at the statements and annexures in advance.  If they see 
that an particular annexure is not legible they should try and arrange 
for clearer copies.   
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  I will try Chair to see if we can still find a 
clearer copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  There are other witnesses that will come 
and deal with this issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja I am just going to repeat.  Members of the legal 
team must please make sure that we get the best copies that we can 
get.  Sometimes you cannot get a better copy what you have is what 
you have. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But then I must be informed then I know. But if I have 
not been informed that attempts have been made to try and get a 
clearer copy I will take it that no attempts were made.  So let us 
20 
proceed but a clearer copy should be obtained if possible. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  We will do so Chair.  I believe that there is 
because there are some other witnesses that will deal with this issue.  
They might provide us with a more legible copy than the one that we 
currently have. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 18 of 77 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but then we must – if there is a clearer copy you 
must replace this one even in this statement with a clearer copy. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Will – I will do so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We must not have a situation where there is a clearer 
copy in other bundles but an illegible copy in some.   
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  I understand Chair.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  We may proceed. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Mr Radabe I was saying that looking 
at this resolution that was taken on the 19 June it seems as if this 
decision to lease the land to Estina was a unanimous decision of the 
10 
council.  Do you have any comment? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Maybe if I can firstly give the 
background with regards to this resolution. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Not only this resolution.  The Mayor 
took a decision in that municipality that anything which I speak in the 
council must not be written down.  And I think even the municipal 
manager when he comes here then we ask him I was the only councillor 
in the whole council sitting who was participating in not less than 80% 
of the items which were brought into the council meeting.  And you ask 
20 
yourself why such a person is not maybe noted when he is even dealing 
with such serious things.  We even asked the council that they should 
record the meetings with a tape recorder but we – we usually have to 
have a struggle each and every council meeting to – just to have a tape 
recorder.  Each and every time they will leave that tape recorder 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 19 of 77 
 
behind.  Then we will have to say the meeting must not continue before 
we have a tape recorder.  As we have recognised that most important 
issues are not recorded.  When it comes to this one of this dairy scam. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  That is why we insisted a lot that a 
tape recorder must be there but I am not surprised that my name does 
not appear here but on the tape recorders that is when we make sure 
that this thing was recorded in the tape recorder so that we can make 
reference because we know that this thing was not going to last even 
more.  I know – I knew it was not going to last even for five years. 
10 
That is why I insisted that it must be recorded.  If they can 
bring the tape recorder you can see how – how we deliberated on this 
matter. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  But … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So do you know whether the debates or discussions 
were mechanically recorded when the discussions happened or you do 
not know? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Chair more especially with regards to 
this – to this dairy scam.  They were recorded.  We made sure that 
before we start the tape recorder was working and … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  And the Municipal Manager is the 
person who usually is supposed to advise the council with the legal 
things inside the council.  He also insisted that it should be recorded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 20 of 77 
 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  I am dead sure it was recorded.  
Maybe it can be destroyed but it was recorded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Chair we will follow up with the Municipal 
Manager. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you.  Then on – on paragraph 13 you 
speak of the events that followed this resolution.  Do you know if the 
lease between Estina and the – Phumelela Municipality was concluded? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Chair it is just that some other 
10 
documents then - we cannot connect with them.  I think maybe they are 
missing but the documents that were agreed in the council is that the 
land was – the – the Office of the Premier sent a lease contract to the 
council so that the council can approve it that the council must lease 
the land. 
They said the council must lease the land to the Office of the 
Premier because the – they said legislatively it is stated that the 
council cannot lease the land direct to the Department of Agriculture.  
It must lease it to the Office of the Premier. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  So the land was not then leased to 
20 
Estina as far as you know.  It was leased to the Office of the Premier 
Free State.  Is that your evidence? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes.  As far as the resolution was 
taken by the council it is that the land should be leased direct to the 
Premier.  So that the Premier can – can maybe give it to the 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 21 of 77 
 
Department of Agriculture.  So then they can lease it to Estina.  It was 
a – it was a … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  It was a long, long, long story. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And – and do you know how long was the 
lease between the municipality and the Office of the Premier? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  The document which represented that 
the lease between the Municipality and – and the Premier’s Office was 
11 years … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
10 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  And thereafter then I – I learned that 
the Department of Agriculture did lease the land to Estina Dairy Scam 
for 99 years lease free contract. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  What do you mean by lease free? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Rent – rent free. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Rent free. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Rent free. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Rent free. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Rent free - for 99 years rent free to 
Estina Dairy Scam. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and do you know if the municipality was 
paid by the – by the Free State – Free State Province for this land … 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  I … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Or the Department of Agriculture?  Sorry. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  I followed this – this thing of the 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 22 of 77 
 
dairy because it was interesting very much closely and when I looked 
onto – on the municipal financial books because we were represented 
with those documents.  I have never seen any payment from the 
Department of Agriculture to – to the municipality and which was 
supposed to be close to a million by that time and in the agreement we 
agreed that they – they – it was agreed that the – the department 
should pay the money which is equivalent to – to the rates of that time 
and if – if the hectare is maybe 8 000 this year. 
Maybe next year it is going to be 10 000.  Then they must pay 
the money which is equivalent to the rate of the hectare.  I – I followed 
10 
this thing.  I have never seen any payment into the municipality. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  The Municipal Manager will come and 
testify.  He will say the lease between the municipality and the province 
was for a year and they were not involved in the 19 year - 99 year 
lease.  Do you have any comment? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  I do have a strong object on that 
because it – it – the – the representation from the Department of 
Agriculture is they said to the council the pilot project for this dairy 
scam is three years. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  For the dairy scam or the dairy project? 
20 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  The dairy project. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  He said … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well he says – he said that the project is a scam. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  Okay. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 23 of 77 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes continue. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Proceed. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Then it – it does not make sense.  
How can they lease the land to the people who have a plan of three 
years to – to take the project off the ground and anything can happen.  
You see in 11 years one year anything can happen.  Maybe they leased 
one – one on that level but as far as I know it was – it was 11 years not 
one year. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and he will say for that one year that 
they had this agreement with the province they were paid.  The 
10 
municipality was made for the land. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Then he just has to bring the proof … 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Which states that Department of 
Agriculture paid – the Provincial Department of Agriculture in the Free 
State paid Phumelela so much for – for the lease of land which is 4 400 
hectares. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay.  We will take it out with the Municipal 
Manager.  Let us proceed Mr Radebe.  On paragraph 14 you deal with 
20 
the report that you made regarding the dead cows from the farm.  Could 
you please take us through that? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Well during that – that time it was 
easy to access that – that dairy and I got a tipoff that the – the cattle 
were dying. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 24 of 77 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Which – which time is this?  Which year if 
you may remember? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  The cattle was bought in 2000 – 
towards the end of 2013 – towards the end of 2013. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  The cattle was bought for that diary.  
Then in 2014 I think the cattle started dying there towards the end of 
2013 again just after they arrived.  Then in February 2014 that was 
when I was alerted that the cattle – they are piling cattle up in the 
stream – in a certain stream around Vrede. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Then I went myself there and 
witnessed the situation.  Then I got that the cattle were - were dumped 
on the – on the stream which supplied drinking water to – to the Vrede 
Dam.  Then once I witnessed that I immediately alerted the press and 
the press came.  The story was on the front page on the very same 
week on Friday and the photos were taken on Wednesday. 
Then on Friday it was on the front page.  Thereafter then the 
– I – I saw that nothing did happen.  Then I alerted the Department of 
Environmental Affairs with regards that this - these people were 
20 
polluting water which is the drinking water for people of Vrede.  Then 
the official from the Department of Environmental Affairs came after I 
think it – the following week over the weekend. 
Then we met in Vrede.  I took them to the scene.  When we 
got there then we got that the cattle were now covered with – with soil. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 25 of 77 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  But where they still in that stream? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes in – in that stream. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Then the official told me that no I 
must wait for them in - in Vrede.  They will go to the – to the dairy 
themselves and deal with the – the official in the dairy.  Then they went 
there.  They instructed them to go and exhume those cattle on that 
drinking – drinking water stream and bury them in the farm.  They must 
dig a hole they – they said to me they instructed them to dig three 
metres deep hole and bury those cattle in that area. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And how many cattle/cows were there that 
were dumped in that stream? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Well taking into consideration that it 
was in summer and some of those carcasses were already decomposed 
but as far as I – I recognised when I got there it was not less than 45 
carcasses in that – in that stream. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is now the number of carcasses you saw on that 
particular day - on that particular day? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or you mean over a certain period you saw 45? 
20 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Up to – Chair up to that day where – 
where – up to that day of February which I reported this thing to the 
press.  The carcasses which were dumped there were not less than 45. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 26 of 77 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But as on the day when the media came were they 
still there – the carcasses – 45 of them? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes Chair.  They were still there.  The 
media even took the photos. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  And even the official from the 
Department of Environmental Affairs when they got there the carcasses 
were there but they were covered just with soil. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Was it possible to – were you able to get an 
10 
idea of how long the cattle had been – had died by the time you went 
there?  Could it have been a week?  Could it have been two weeks?  
Could it have been much longer than that or it was difficult to tell? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE: 
 
Chair 
when 
I 
got 
there 
my 
observation was that it was not three months since they were dying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is obviously … 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Up to that day yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  they – they may have died on different days. 
20 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  So were they also in different stages of 
decomposition? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes.  Others they were almost totally 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 27 of 77 
 
decomposed.  Others were fresh and for the record it never ended that 
day.  Cattle kept on dying afterwards. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you able to tell about how many in addition to the 
45 you have told me about also died that you were – became aware of 
afterwards more or less?  In other words how many more did you 
become aware of that died afterwards? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Chair just after that publication to the 
press because that thing it caught the attention of the whole South 
Africa.  Then the security was beefed up in that dairy that no one must 
10 
come close to that dairy.  We were even barred for you to – to maybe to 
walk in – into - into the field not just the dairy alone.  Then that is when 
I – we – we - I began to stay away because my life was going to be 
endangered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I understand that but what I want to find out 
because you said that those 45 were not the last ones to die.  Cattle 
continued to die after the date when the media was there.  So I am 
trying to find out whether you became aware - how many you became 
aware of that died afterwards or - or you did not see any that had died.  
You just heard that they were continuing to die. 
20 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Chair yes I – I just heard that the 
cattle kept on dying but I did not witness because now they were buried 
deep inside the farm where we cannot access that place … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 28 of 77 
 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  But people who working on the dairy 
then when we engage with them then they will tell me that the cattle 
keep on dying but we are burying them at a different place … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  From the one that you – you saw. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Radebe in paragraph 
15 of your statement you express a view as to – a reason why those 
cattle were dying.  It is your personal view.  Why do you think those 
cattle were dying in the farm? 
10 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Honestly speaking those cattle were 
dying – were – were starving and another thing they were not 
vaccinated.  They were not treated with proper medication.  That is why 
they were dying like flies.  Most of the time you do not just take dairy 
cattle and feed them in an open field.  You let them graze in an open 
field.  You have to give them some supplement and – and feeding but 
those were left to – to graze on their own on an open field. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the way did you say you yourself have a lot of 
experience in farming with cattle?  You yourself do you have a lot of 
experience of farming with cattle? 
20 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes Chair.  I have been farming – I 
have been fully farming since 2003 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  But with beef cattle and – and when 
you do farming you do all – all sorts of aspects of farming. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 29 of 77 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  It is grain.  It is – it is beef cattle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  It is – it is milk cattle.  Then you 
choose which one you want to – to work on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To focus on, ja. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes but I am clued up with the dairy 
cattle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have a good idea of how dairy cattle should be 
handled and should be treated? 
10 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes Chair I do have that (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair and then you then deal 
with the – the threats and the attacks that you experienced following 
the reports that you - you made.  Could you please take us through 
those events? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  More especially after this event of 
reporting the – the – those dairy carcasses … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  This thing caught even the attention 
20 
of the – the Parliament itself.  People around Vrede then became so 
violent.  They – they were angry at me as I was the one who reported 
the matter to – to the press and I was even attacked personally … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Hm. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  By - by a group of people who I -0 by 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 30 of 77 
 
that time we believe it was – was Mr Zwane’s private force.  He – he – 
after he became the – after he got into that – that position of – of the 
Agricultural MEC he had some dubious employment in the – in the 
Office of the Department of Agriculture around the area of Vrede. 
They were – he hired five people that – that office hired five 
people without following the proper procedures. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And how do you know that? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  What makes us to – what makes me 
to be suspicious that it was – the right procedure was not followed is 
that you cannot – you cannot hire – you cannot hire people who – a 
10 
certain group of people maybe how are friends at the same time when – 
when the population of that area is so big.  Which means those - those 
posts were – were created especially for them. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Hm. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Then … 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And what – what is it that they were doing 
these people – these special force for Mr Zwane what was their role in 
the Agricultural Department? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Their role in the department? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes.  What is it that they were doing? 
20 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  The two guys were security guards.  I 
think the two guys is Bongani Radebe and Dingaan Dinga. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  They were security guards and there 
were other two guys.  It is Thuto Kganye who was working in the office 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 31 of 77 
 
and the other one is Anton Sibeko known as Xolisa.  They – they were – 
all those two they were working in the Office of Agriculture and after 
that – after that time when they got into that office there was an 
extension officer working in that Office of Agriculture and another lady 
who is working – is an administration in that office. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Those two people were – were 
undermined during this thing of the dairy project.  I remember the 
extension officer he was even striped of the rights of driving a car.  He 
was walking … 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Hm. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  And those two guys were using the – 
the agricultural – the Department of Agricultural car by that time.  They 
were – it - it looks as if they were seniors in that office by that time. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And how – how were you attacked then?  
Who - who attacked you and how were you attacked? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  The people who attacked me they 
were – they were driving with Frans Mokoena. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And who is Frans Mokoena? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Frans Mokoena is – is a well 
20 
tenderpreneur in Phumelela.  He used to get tenders left and right in 
that area. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he is a businessman? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  I presume so.  He is a tenderpreneur. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 32 of 77 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Where was he getting his tenders?  From – 
is it the Government tenders? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Ja they were Government tenders. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  From which departments if you know? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  The – the – one of the biggest 
tenders that he got first is when – when Mr Mosebenzi was the MEC of 
– of CoGTA.  I think in 2009 he was MEC of CoGTA.  Then Frans got a 
big tender in Warden to build houses – the RDP houses.  That is one of 
his big tenders.  Then he – he will use some other tenders then around 
the area while Mr Zwane was - was the MEC. 
10 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Okay. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  When I was attacked they were – he 
was driving his car.  In his car it was Bongani Radebe, Dingaan Dinga 
and Anton “Xolisa” Sibeko. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Then I was – I was attacked.  Then I 
was even sprayed with pepper spray on the eyes.  They said that I am – 
I am disturbing the ANC from doing its work and I was not the only 
person who was attacked around the area.  Everybody who was 
associated with myself they were attacked throwing all sorts of insults 
20 
on the streets.  The life that we live by that time is – it was a 
frightening life. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know why they attacked you? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Chair, we – we had some difference 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 33 of 77 
 
just after the – the – after I reported those carcasses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the media – to the media? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Then we … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what were the difference about?  What – what 
were they saying and what were you saying on the issue? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Well we had – we – we had an 
argument with Thuto Kganye at one of the tennis courts around Vrede.  
Then thereafter … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what was the argument?  What was he saying 
and what were you saying? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Oh it – when we exchanging words he 
said with regards to the – to this day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words what I want is to see whether it was 
connected with your stance on the Vrede Dairy Farm Project or whether 
it was about other differences that the two of you may have had. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Well I cannot – I cannot recall 
correctly where but I – I – we had a going on each other with 
Thuto Kganye at the tennis court.  Then Thuto I do not know whether it 
20 
is him or maybe – but there was – they were all members playing at the 
tennis court.  Then they phoned those guys and say here is Doctor 
here.  Come and – and fix him up. 
When I was on my way to – to the police station then I – I 
think it is plus or minus 400 metres from the tennis court that is when I 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 34 of 77 
 
– I came across the car of Frans Mokoena with these guys.  They stand 
in front of me like this on the car.  Then they opened the doors all of 
them.  They came out and – and attacked me. 
When I – when I came out then Bongani Radebe took out a 
pepper sprayer and said the ANC is bigger than me.  I cannot touch the 
ANC.  Then he sprayed me with pepper spray in the eyes and I was – I 
was driving alone. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Then the other guy – (indistinct) I 
10 
could not see.  Then there was another guy who approached me from 
the front.  I asked him to drive to the police station with my own car.  
Then he drove me to the police station. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But are you able to say that they attacked you 
because of the fact that you had reported the – the fact that cows were 
dying on the Vrede Farm – dairy farm to the media or whether it was 
about other issues?  Are you able to say what it – it was about? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Chair with that one I am dead sure I 
was attacked based on this thing of the dairy farm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  I can put that on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and then you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And are you basing that on what they said when they 
were attacking you or one of them – what one of them said? 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 35 of 77 
 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes.  I am – yes Chair.  I am – I am 
basing it on what they said when they attacked me and afterwards 
maybe after a while when – maybe after around three years Bongani 
because we were sharing the same – surname then.  He came and 
approached and tell me that I am sorry about whatever happened 
because I was – I was used and I was duped but whatever you were 
doing then you were right because you were doing it for the people of 
Vrede. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what Bongani’s surname again? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Radebe. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Radebe? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes Radebe yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Same surname as you? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but he was one of those who attacked you? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  He was the one who – Chair he was 
the one who used the pepper spray on me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you say afterwards he – he spoke to you and 
20 
he said he was sorry about the fact that they had attacked you but the 
stance you had taken was the correct one? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes.  That is what he said.  Even now 
he still stands on his words. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He – he still says that now? 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 36 of 77 
 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay and how long after the attack was it when 
he said this to you? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Well Chair just after the attack he 
said – he spoke in Zulu.  He said (isiZulu) I am sorry.  Then I – then 
afterwards then we met and then he said I think the things were 
beginning to be – not to be rosy as they were.  Then after a long while 
he approached me and said I am sorry I was used and I was duped. 
I did not think clearly because the – it looks as if there was – 
there was greener on the other part where I was shown but anyone I 
10 
saw that what you were doing was right and you were doing it for the 
people of Vrede and – I mean for the people of Phumelela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say one of the – of your attackers said the 
ANC is bigger than you? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  That is “Xolisa” Anton Sibeko. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Just repeat what he said. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  He said I cannot stand on the way of 
the ANC.  The ANC is bigger than me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair.  Did you report these 
20 
attacks to the police? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE: 
 
Immediately 
when 
that 
guy 
approached me from the front I asked him to drive me to the police 
station but I could not see clearly because that – that thing is so sore 
inside the eyes.  When I got to the police station some other police 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 37 of 77 
 
officer said I must go to – and wash my face.  Thereafter I went to the 
charge room.  I told them what happened.  I want to open a case.  Then 
they said that they want to consult with their Station Commander. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And who is their Station Commander? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  He is Mr Xasa. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – that is strange. You come as a member of the 
public.  You say to – you say to the police officer at the charge office.  I 
want to open a case.  They say they want to consult somebody.  That is 
what they said? 
10 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Chair that is what they said … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  And eventually that is what happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they went to consult the Station Commander? 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:   
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes Chair they went to consult the 
Station Commander.  Then the Station Commander issued a statement.  
He said to me that such cases do not – do not fall in – in their office.  
There is a certain office from Bethlehem.  There is a certain official 
who must come and assist us with such cases because my incident was 
20 
not the – he said my incident was not the first one. 
These cases are political related cases.  They do not work 
with political related cases.  There is a certain department in 
Bethlehem.  Then I was – then I was turned away and say – they say 
they will bring people from Bethlehem but even today those people 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 38 of 77 
 
never came. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which year was it when you were attacked? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  It was the election of 2014, just after 
the incident of the carcasses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they refused to open a case for you and take a 
statement from you because they said there is another office that 
handles politically connected cases or political motivated cases and 
that office is in Bethlehem? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But they said they would arrange for somebody from 
10 
Bethlehem to come and take a statement from you or did they say you 
should go to Bethlehem? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Chair they said they will arrange 
somebody from Bethlehem to come and make – and open a case for 
me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that has never happened? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Chair even today it never happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did the station commander at – is that – it’s not at 
Vrede Police Station is it? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:    Yes Chair it’s in Vrede Police 
20 
Station 
CHAIRPERSON:  This happened in Vrede Police Station? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the station commander at the time was who, what 
was his name? 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 39 of 77 
 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Chair it was the same person Mr 
Xhasa but by that time he was acting, now I think he’s a permanent 
station commander. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it’s Mr Xhasa? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja Xhasa, (name spelt) I think? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He has never contacted you about this case since 
then?  He has never come back to you to say whether, when he tried to 
get somebody from Bethlehem there were any problems? 
10 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  He never came back to me, the last 
time we spoke about this case it was that time when I was turned away. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I’ve heard, I think from Mr Dhlamini also that he 
showed the same station commander a video of threats on his life and 
that station commander and the police station didn’t open any docket 
and they didn’t take any statements from him.  So you are also saying 
you went there and you spoke to him, you wanted a case to be opened 
because you had been attacked and you had actually been attacked on 
20 
the same day, you reported on the same day and they didn’t open a 
case and he said they would need to contact another office in 
Bethlehem and they’ve never come back to you? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes Chair, you’re right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay the legal team must please follow this up as 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 40 of 77 
 
well and I need to have report backs on all these instances where I’ve 
heard evidence that the police or some Law Enforcement Agencies 
don’t appear to have conducted investigations in circumstances where 
they should have and they’ve never kept complainants informed as to 
what was happening with investigations.  I need to have report backs 
on all of them.  Okay continue. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair, Chair we have already 
notified our Law Enforcement Work-stream on this issue of Mr Radebe 
and his statement was made available to them as well but we will follow 
up. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you, Mr Radebe would you please 
then tell us about the further abuses that you experienced as a result 
of the influence that these people had in Vrede? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:    Yes, in addition, I can even assist 
the Commission with other three guys who were attacked beside me, 
who were turned away from the police station the same way I was 
turned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh what are their names? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:   The first one is Thys Qwebu. 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and who else? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  the other one is Sisezwane. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes and the third person? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  He is well known as Magaga, but I 
know – I know him personally and even were he stays, we call him 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 41 of 77 
 
Magaga, I think his surname is Magaga. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when were these incidents – when did they 
happen? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Chair they all happened in 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they were reported in 2014? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes Chair they were reported in 2014, 
the very same police station. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say up to now, nothing has happened, they 
were turned away, actually from the police station, is that what you’re 
saying? 
10 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes Chair they were told that there 
will be people coming from Bethlehem who will assist them to open 
their cases. I even tried to speak to them when the Commission first 
approached me, they said, it just ended like that, they never came back 
to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes were the attacks on them connected with the 
dairy – Vrede Dairy Farm Project or were they just – or were they just 
criminal attacks or were they attacks that were politically motivated by 
their political opponents, as far as you know? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:    Chair they were strictly politically 
20 
connected those three guys were very much close to me while I was a 
councillor, I used to spend lots of time with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but they were not involved in any opposition to 
the Vrede Dairy Farm Project as such, the attacks may have been 
politically connected but in regard to other matters? 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 42 of 77 
 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Chair by that time Thys Qwebu and 
Sisizwane, they were DA members in good standing, then Mr Magaga 
he was – he was even supportive of us we used to spend time with him, 
but he was not a member by that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright, the legal team, I suggest that you don’t 
ask somebody else to be in touch with the police, if you’re going to ask 
somebody else to do that, it’s going to take ages.  I suggest that 
communication with the SAPS about these matters be direct.  If it’s 
somebody else you’re asking then it should involve just drafting letters 
that are to be signed by the acting secretary but don’t ask another 
10 
work-stream to look at that, look at that yourselves, then it’s going to 
be quicker. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Will do so Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Chair I’m told it’s tea time, I’m almost 
finished with this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja let’s try and finish with him. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you yes.  You then deal with other 
abuses that you experienced, in paragraph 21 and 22 of your 
statement, as a result of you having reported this matter, can you 
20 
just…(intervention). 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Some of the abuses are very much 
traumatised you cannot go back to them but I can bring one to the 
attention of the Commission that I was once shot by the police when I 
was getting into the farm.  It as in 2014, when I got into the farm then – 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 43 of 77 
 
but for security reasons and I cannot speak all the details but the 
police came at the gate and said to me, it was at night, they said they 
want to search my car.  I said, but how can you search my car when we 
are not even – you haven’t even turned on the blue lights, I don’t trust 
you, let us go to the house because – it’s only 300 metres from the 
main gate to the house.  I said I don’t trust you, let us go in the house 
because I’ve got some people in the house who can maybe be 
witnesses or back me.  Then I drove off, when I drove off, they fired 
five live ammunition shots on my car and two of them landed on my car 
and I don’t know what happened with the others, then I went straight to 
10 
the house.  When I got into the house they followed me, they came and 
in the house it was my brother and my cousin and the other guy, there 
were three, they went and spoke to them, they asked them what are 
they looking for, they said they want a driver’s license, then I gave my 
brother the driver’s license they said they want to search the car.  They 
opened the car then thereafter they said – a certain lady said to me I 
think I’m clever then they are the police they will get after me and 
immediately I went to open a case, then the case was investigated by 
the IP, it drag on and on and on then eventually then it just disappeared 
and no-one ever came to me, notify me what happened with the case 
20 
even today. After the investigation was done then police got some 
cartridge on the scene and take them as evidence but even today no-
one ever came to me, it’s more than five years now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that will be included in checking exactly what 
happened ja. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 44 of 77 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you was this also after you reported 
this – the carcasses at Estina? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes this one I clearly remember it did 
happen on the -  it was on the 14 t h of June 2014. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Thank you Chair, we’ll take it up with the 
authorities. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Than you and you deal with what was 
happening with the State vet at Vrede in paragraph 21 and 22 of your 
statement would you please talk to that? 
10 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:   As I have stated once these 
gentlemen were employed in the department – the office of the 
Department of Agriculture, that office was eventually turned to be a 
political party office of the ANC, even Mr Zwane, when he came to 
Vrede he will go to that office and they will have meeting in that office.  
If they feel that the (indistinct) is small they will just take a phone call 
and phone the mayor in the Municipality so that the mayor can provide 
them with – if there’s space immediately without even making some – 
maybe an appointment or book a place to the Municipality and once 
these 
gentlemen 
got 
employed 
in 
that 
office, 
I 
was 
20 
taking…(intervention). 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Who are these gentlemen now? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  The one’s which I stated I think there 
was one private force? Kolisa, Thuto, Dingaan Dinga and Bongani 
Radebe. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 45 of 77 
 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  To my surprise I was – as a farmer we 
– as farmers then we will get the extension officer did have his data 
base of the farmers but I was taken out of that data base after that 
gentlemen got into that office and - as we had some differences 
politically.  Those two were securities they were sitting at the gate you 
can’t get there in the office if you were not pro ANC and as a result 
then I - my cattle got sick, in that office there is a State vet and usually 
we don’t pay for the State vet because the State vet is paid by the 
Government, we just go to the State vet and consult when we do have 
10 
problem with cattle.  Then I was denied access to the State vet, after a 
while I got the lady who was an administrator, the old lady in that office 
on the street, I ask her to give me the phone numbers of the State vet 
and then she phoned me the following day and give me the phone 
numbers of the State vet.  Then I phoned the State vet and gave them 
the circumstances of the cattle on how they were dying then she 
described me the medication of the cattle.  Unfortunately by that time 
I’ve already lost 45 heads of cattle and most of them they were heavy 
pregnant and the State vet diagnosed that my cattle were suffering from 
some serious sickness which quickly turned into red water but when it 
20 
begins it looks like the (indistinct) then he gave me some prescription.  
Just after that prescription then, my cattle then stopped sicking. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Stopped dying? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Stopped dying yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just note that at a certain stage when you called the 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 46 of 77 
 
media about the cattle that were dying on the dairy farm, it was 45 
cattle and you also lost 45 head of cattle. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Chair, mine – I even counted them, 
that’s why the extension officer did – I did have his numbers and he 
had my numbers.  When my cattle died I phoned him to come and take 
the pictures, that’s when he said to me, I’ve been stripped of the rights 
of driving – to drive the car from the department so I cannot get into 
your farm to go and have the pictures and witness the cattle.  The best 
thing that you can do then, take some pictures bring them to me so that 
I can see what I can do.  That’s then, when I took the pictures and – 
10 
but when I got to him I asked him, is there any, maybe a disastrous 
relief grant from the department, then he said they don’t have such 
thing.  Those one – if you link these two, 45 and that other 45, maybe 
the carcasses that (indistinct) but I do have pictures of all of them, 
even the one from the dairy, you can see yourself, the one from the 
dairy they were not less than 45. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Mine are exactly 45. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Radebe. Is there anything really that 
still needs to be covered, you still need to cover? 
20 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  There’s just one issue Chair, that when we 
consulted with you in Vrede there was a group of men that walked to 
the venue where the consultation was taking place.  Are any of these 
enforcers part – were any of these enforcers part of that group? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Chair when we were sitting in that 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 47 of 77 
 
room, the first time you came to Vrede, one of those people, of that 
group which assaulted me, it was Frans Magwena who got, then the 
other one are his friends, they were not involved in…(intervention). 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  But Frans Magwena was one of them? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:   Yes Frans Magwena was there. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Is there anything that you’d like to share 
with the Commission? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes I do. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Yes proceed. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Through you Chair, there are three 
10 
cases with regards to this dairy – Vrede Dairy Project scam, those 
cases includes murder they are related in murder.  The first murder 
which did happen I think it was in 2013 where a guy was hijacked, I 
don’t know kidnapped or hijacked by the name of Moses Chauke, he 
was – in February 2013 and then he eventually died in 2015, around 
there – I mean in May 2013.   He was hijacked in February 2013 then 
died in the hospital, the same year in May and the guy was working in 
the office of the Department of Agriculture and he was against this 
dairy thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This dairy farm project? 
20 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes, and up to so far I followed his 
story, the perpetrators, even today they are not arrested. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether they are known? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  No not yet because he was 
(indistinct) I just read (indistinct) story on the newspaper he was in 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 48 of 77 
 
Bethlehem but the other two which I’ll speak – I will talk about now are 
those two cases, I worked on those two cases personally, hands-on, I 
know what was going on in those cases.  The first case is the case of 
the guy in Warden, he was my friend, when I got to Warden – Warden is 
one of the (indistinct) Mpumelela , I used to go to him then, his name 
was Vusi Mlaba, he was also a farmer then he – they were not in good 
terms with Mr Zwane because I believe if that guy – that guy was also 
an emerging farmer, he was supposed to be included in this project of 
the dairy milk, but because now he was standing on the opposite side 
then he was not included but I know he was an emerging farmer.  The 
10 
guy was killed, was mowed down with plenty bullets, I worked on his 
case then his case I can assure you it was a pure cover-up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well how far are the police with the investigating his 
murder, do you know? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:   The case just disappeared, the 
investigator kept on ducking, ducking then eventually never surfaced in 
Warden, then the case was – the case end up like that, no-one was 
arrested till today. 
ADV ZINHLE BUTHELEZI:  Who was the investigator, do you know? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  I can speak to the family of that guy 
20 
then maybe they can give me the exact name but the investigator was 
from Bethlehem it was not a person from Warden, it was a special 
person from Bethlehem, that case disappeared. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the third case, or was that the third case? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  That was the second case, then there 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 49 of 77 
 
– the third case is the case which happened last year of Mr Philemon 
Ngwenya, it happened in Vrede. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes, I – well I’ve been told about that one. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  He was one of the beneficiaries. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the first one you mentioned also I’ve been told 
about yes. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  He was killed last year in October.  
Then the police were working on the case, the case was transferred to 
NPA in the province, they are the ones who were working on the case 
but on the ground there is this -  one of the things that we mustn’t take 
10 
for granted is the public opinion, it’s not true but you must follow it and 
see what’s happening.  That case even today the people who killed Mr 
Philemon Ngwenya are not arrested. If you go to Vrede, you look how 
small is Vrede and you look at the resources that the police have, in 
order to investigate cases you become suspicious that there is 
something that is like a cover up on these case, even today, the 
perpetrators or the people who killed Mr Philemon Ngwenya haven’t 
been arrested yet.  They arrested two guys they say there’s not enough 
evidence then the case was thrown out of court but even today there is 
no progress. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no thank you very much.  Those were the three 
cases you wanted to talk about? 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Yes Chair, maybe – the other one is 
in 2017, it was the end of 2017 in Mpumelelo Municipal storerooms did 
surface four brand new Range Rovers and when we followed on that 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 50 of 77 
 
case we found that there was a document from the Department of 
Agriculture which said those cars were bought by the Department of 
Agriculture to fund the farmers with two Range Rovers then I don’t 
know whether that case can fall in this Commission because up to now 
then the community, everybody, we are at a loss, we don’t know what 
happened with that case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no I suggest that you speak to the legal team 
and the investigators, give them whatever information you have of 
cases that you think should be brought to the attention of the 
Commission, they will look at them and they will know if they fall 
10 
outside of what the Commission is looking at or not. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Okay Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Okay, maybe for the last one Chair, 
I’ll ask the Commission – I think this is the last resort for us as whistle 
blowers and people on the ground to speak to and may we please, the 
Commission look at one of the specific things or the harassment that 
the whistle blowers get, it’s not just the physical one, these things go 
deep – deep, deep, deep and it puts the lives of the people who speak 
out at risk and most of the time then we live in fear and it’s not good to 
20 
live in fear in a democratic country as if you are lawlessness country, I 
think that the Commission, may you please look onto that thing, it 
doesn’t effect individuals as such alone, it also affects people who are 
close to the individual who was speaking out.  That will be my humble 
plea to the Commission. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 51 of 77 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no, I think that’s very important, it’s a point that 
has been made by others who have come before the Commission as 
well.  If you have any information relating to, what you refer to as 
harassment of whistle blowers and those around them, also talk to the 
legal team so that maybe another statement can be prepared which can 
be sent to the Commission and you indicate what you’d like to highlight 
to the Commission to such harassment. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you very much for having come to give 
evidence, before the Commission, we are grateful to you for having 
10 
done that, if a need arises you will be contacted and asked to come 
back again but thank you very much for coming forward. You are 
excused for now. 
MR ALBERT DOCTOR RADEBE:  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are going to take the tea adjournment now, the 
time is twenty-five to twelve, the – I’ll take a twenty minute rather than 
a fifteen-minute tea break, we’ll resume at five to twelve.  We adjourn.

template that was followed in the preparation of these affidavits.  We 
10 
concede it is not a sworn affidavit and we will make sure that any new 
ones that come just refer to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will either be a sworn statement or just affidavit. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Indeed so.  All I am pointing out is we have 
taken the lesson.  Thank you DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes.  Mr Basson’s evidence revolves around 
three major areas DCJ.

machinery and equipment that was used to construct the processing 
plant at the Vrede dairy farm.  The second will be dealing with the

or two completely different pieces of evidence you will be able to get 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140

MR WILLEM BASSON:  Yes Chairperson. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  How long have you been a farmer?

ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And do you farm in dairy cows or in what is 
colloquially called red meat cattle. 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  I do business with meat cows as well as a

CHAIRPERSON:  As well as? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  As well as game. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  May I say something Chairperson? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  I have just sold the farm recently with the 
cows. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Is this the game farm or the cattle farm? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  Chairperson both.  Both of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Have you ever had any interest in dairy 
20 
farming? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  No. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But you say you know the farmers who in the 
farming committee? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  I do have knowledge about the others who are 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 59 of 77 
 
doing business with the milk cows but myself I for one I do not have 
any one. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes.  There are four farmers – commercial 
farmers who were leasing the Krynaauwslust farm in the municipality, 
do you know them? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  Yes I do Chairperson. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  They are the ones who were moved off the 
property and the Vrede dairy farm was then established on that same 
farm. 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  Ja it is correct so.  Yes it is correct so one of 
10 
the farms Chairperson it is Krynaauwslust. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Were those particular commercial farmers 
dairy farmers? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  No. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Okay.  Let us talk about Estina and the Vrede 
dairy farm.  You say that you were contacted in or about 2012 by 
people who wanted you to assist at the dairy farm.   
MR WILLEM BASSON:  Ja it is so. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I think it will be of interest to the Chairman to 
know if it is the people who were running and operating and managing 
20 
the dairy farm who contacted you or completely different set of people. 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  CP Prasad Chairperson and this person was 
from India. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  What did he ask you to assist with? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  He wanted me to come and help at the farm 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 60 of 77 
 
with roads, dams which was – were supposed to be built on the farm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Roughly when might this have been 2012, 
2013 I do not know if you can recall? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  I am not so sure about the date or the year but 
it was around 2012 to 2013 I am not certain about the exact time. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  The commission has heard evidence that by 
December 2012 the basic farm was up and running.  Would you agree 
that by December 2012 the farm itself the operations were up and 
running? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  Not in full operation Chairperson partly. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  I am satisfied with that answer but would like 
you to explain where you then fitted in and the services you provided 
fitted in to establishing this farm? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  Yes indeed so we were busy or I was busy 
building up a build – a big store or I beg your pardon – I beg your 
pardon Chairperson I just want the correct name for  
CHAIRPERSON:  A shed. 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  I thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  A shed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A shed. 
20 
MR WILLEM BASSON:   A shed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A shed oh okay. 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  A big shed thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Just to assist you in recollecting the events in 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 61 of 77 
 
a chronological order when I look at your paragraph 7 you talk about 
enlarging the dam on the farm.  Would you have done that before you 
built he shed? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  No. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So you put the shed up before you built the 
dam? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  Built the dam.  Indeed so Chairperson. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  You also speak about levelling the place out 
and compacting the farm surface.  Would that have been one of the first 
tasks you undertook? 
10 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  When you were working on the farm were 
there any cattle at all on the farm? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  Many of them. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Now let us take this slowly please Mr Basson.  
So you start off by arriving and compacting the ground and levelling it.  
Were there cattle on the farm when you were doing that? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  Chairperson the cattle were already on the 
farm because they – they are going – they are being milked – at the 
time when they are milked Chairperson they formed a circle. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  When – when you observed that am I correct 
to say that the milking shed had not been set up yet?  The milk 
processing plant, there was nothing there which is why you were 
compacting the ground? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  There was a small shed with a little concrete. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 62 of 77 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Had you been to this farm before you were 
invited to go there by Mr Prasad? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  Chairperson indeed so I was there. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So were the buildings you describe when you 
came to compact the place there already? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  No. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  That is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long prior to this visit to the farm had you been – 
how long before had you been to the farm before this particular visit? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  I was about three to four years before that 
10 
particular time Chairperson because my duties or my contract is linked 
to repair the municipality things as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  But the farm was owned by private individuals 
before it was bought by Estina, am I correct? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  No. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Who – who owned the farm before it was sold 
– the farm and I am talking about the farm with the buildings that were 
there before it was sold to Estina? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  Chairperson it was the municipality and the 
20 
person who was in the forefront of that was Krynaauwslust farming. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Can I just spell that Chairman?  It is 
Krynaauwslust farm. 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  Yes it is correct so. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Had the municipality been leasing that farm 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 63 of 77 
 
out to private individuals prior to Estina arriving? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  Initially Chairperson it was not a private person 
who was occupying or working on the farm it was – it was councillor… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Municipality farm. 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  Yes it is so Chairperson. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  No a Raadslede is what he said who occupied 
it. 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Meaning that council leaders? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  Ja.  They had a farmer who was farming for 
10 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So was it before Estina, was it leased to members of 
the council who had a farmer who was helping – who was running it? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  Krynaauwslust was the one who was occupying 
the land and doing the farming but he was doing that for the 
municipality. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Then you say at paragraph 8 that in or about 
March 2013 you were asked to attend to drainage and construction 
relating to the cattle sheds. 
20 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  It is indeed so Chairperson because that trench 
it is a very big trench.  That particular trench it is being used to suck 
the urine of the cattle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we proceed.  Mr Gcabashe we normally go – 
break for lunch at one but we propose to continue until half past one 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 64 of 77 
 
and take the lunch break from half past one to half past two.  Would 
that be fine with you Mr Basson and Mr Interpreter? 
INTERPRETER:  That will be fine for me Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and for Mr Basson is that fine? 
MR WILLEM BASSON:  It is right Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  So just in relation to the cattle sheds that you 
were asked to assist with you have annexed as WB1 the invoice you 
sent to Estina PTY Limited.  At page 7 you will find the invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  7 will be written 07 – WB07 that will be 7.  At the top. 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Under the first tab, tab number 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can you see the yellow tab. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  You will find the invoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The yellow tab. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  No his are different Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh they are different colours. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  Yes.  So just where number 1 is written there 
is an invoice there dated the 27 November 2013.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Please ask the people who prepared these things to 
make sure that we all have exactly the same thing including the colours 
20 
of the dividers.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  We will do that Chairman.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I think go and assist them.  You see if the divider was 
yellow with them it would be easy.   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE:  And the amount of the invoice is R6 384.00. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 65 of 77 
 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  Yes.  I can see that. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The important fact here is that the invoice 
went to Estina (Pty) Ltd. 
MR WILLIE BASSON 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
It 
is 
correct 
so 
Chairperson. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I point it out Mr Basson because you say 
in your statement that there were other subcontractors. 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  Chair the subcontractors 
that they have just left and they said it is very expensive and they – 
they are overcharged.  There is something which I want to mention. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  And the other private 
contractor is Koos.  I do not know where he is his … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You have mentioned him in your 
paragraph 6 Mr Koos Eksteen. 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And you have also mentioned a 
Mr A Floris – F-L-O-R-I-S. 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  It is so and they had 
another contractor at Estina and they did not have any machinery and 
20 
they hired me to come and do the job. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So the contractor who had been employed 
by Estina and you have here mentioned EG Construction. 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  Ja, it is correct so.  It is 
correct so Chairperson.  It is Koos Eksteen. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 66 of 77 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  They had no machinery.  So you brought 
yours in from your company and worked with them on the property. 
MR WILLIE BASSON 
(through 
interpreter): 
 
It 
is 
correct 
so 
Chairperson.  This Koos Chairperson he was in engineering but he did 
not have any machinery.  So he hired me to come and help out. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Your invoices however were not to EG 
Construction.  All your invoices went to Estina (Pty) Ltd. 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  No.  There are invoices 
which I sent to Koos Eksteen not EG. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We will come back to that because most 
10 
of the invoices that you have given us here just the ones here are 
directed either at Estina (Pty) Ltd or at Vrede Dairy Projects.  Now can 
you explain to the Chairman who Vrede Dairy Projects are? 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  I can just answer you 
there.  I had my office there.  I had an office there and all my – my 
invoices I used to – to send them out to – to Estina not EG. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No, no.  That is not what he said.  Please 
– can you please repeat your answer? 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  I had my office there and 
20 
all my invoices I used to send them to Estina. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am sorry to - to repeat this.  I am 
understanding you to say Mr Basson that when you were preparing this 
affidavit you asked your office PA to simply pull out the Estina invoices 
and the Vrede Dairy Farm invoices and that is the reason you do not 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 67 of 77 
 
have the invoices from the other subcontractors.  Please correct me if 
my Afrikaans is so poor that I have misunderstood you. 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  Chairperson at the time 
when I requested my secretary I told her or him that I want Estina or 
Vrede Dairy.  I do not want EG’s invoices. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes.  That is what I understood you to say 
but that does not explain to the Chairman who Vrede Dairy Projects is.  
Are you then saying Vrede Dairy Projects was really Estina (Pty) Ltd? 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  Listen Estina Dairy has 
its own invoice … 
10 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No. 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  And Vrede Dairy was 
taken by the province. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am sorry Chairman.  I - I actually spent 
time at the University of Natal.  We had to do Afrikaans.  It was 
compulsory. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So I do understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am very poor at speaking it but I 
20 
understand it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And what I understood Mr Basson to say 
is Estina was die Guptas se whatever.  It belonged to the Guptas … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 68 of 77 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And that has not come through in the 
translation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No I - I must confess I am no longer good in 
Afrikaans as I once was when I was at high school and I think my 
Afrikaans is - yours is definitely better than mine but the longer I hear 
it the better I become.  I improve all the time.  So, okay.  Now 
Mr Interpreter just listen carefully to the questions as well as to the 
answers. 
As you - as you heard counsel is saying she heard Mr Basson 
saying certain things which were not translated accurately.  So just try 
10 
your best - and I think she will go back to that question - try your best 
to interpret accurately on both sides. 
INTERPRETER:  Pardon me Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay thank you.  So you may go back to that 
aspect and get clarification. 
INTERPRETER:  I thank you.  I thank you Chairperson. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:   
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I will also try and keep my questions 
shorter.  It will assist. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine, ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Can I then ask you Mr Basson to confirm 
what you said?  No.  I am sorry Chairman that is not the question I 
asked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, yes.  Okay.  Mr Interpreter just listen 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 69 of 77 
 
carefully.  Just interpret just what counsel is saying and no more and 
then when Mr Basson answers just interpret what Mr Basson says and 
no more.  Okay, alright. 
INTERPRETER:  Chairperson let me - let me confess. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
INTERPRETER:  I forgot the name confess in Afrikaans.  I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
INTERPRETER:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
INTERPRETER:  It does not come in my mind.  I beg your pardon 
10 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
INTERPRETER:  I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.  Okay, alright. 
INTERPRETER:  Pardon me Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright thank you.  Thank you. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I would like to just get clarity on this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You said Mr Basson Estina belonged to 
the Guptas.  Is that right? 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  Yes it is correct so. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Then you were going to explain what 
Vrede Dairy Projects was. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 70 of 77 
 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  The Vrede Dairy that 
belongs to the province. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The province owned Vrede Dairy? 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  The Province Free State 
from Bloemfontein. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  What about that?  Continue. 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  They are the ones who 
are operating the farm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So there were at offices from the 
Department of Agriculture in Bloemfontein? 
10 
INTERPRETER:  Come again? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Department of Agriculture. 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  Yes.  It is - yes it is 
correct so but - but I think they do have another name.  I am not sure 
about it. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The other name we know is the 
Department of Agriculture and Rural Development shortened to DARD - 
D-A-R-D. 
INTERPRETER:  Shortened to? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  D-A-R-D DARD. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  A-R-D. 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  Chairperson the particular 
name which was mentioned now I do not know that name.  There are so 
many tractors which are standing in my property and I was or I am the 
one who is repairing those tractors for them. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 71 of 77 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Mr Basson I will just ask.  It could be the 
Free State Development Corporation also who - who hired your 
services. 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  Yes it might be so. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Okay.  Most importantly from the invoices 
you have annexed.  Not meeste.  All of them used the same P O Box 
number. 
INTERPRETER:  P O Box 3? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  It is P O Box/Posbus 349 Vrede. 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  Ja.  It is correct so 
10 
because their offices it is situated on the dairy farm on the milk farm. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Other than Mr Prasad who are the other 
people you met when you rendered services at the farm? 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  There were three Guptas.  
That is now the head of the family of the - the Guptas. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Please repeat your answer. 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  I had three people at the 
boilers.  Those people are from India and I was introduced to them as 
the Guptas.  Is there anything? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No.  I am … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said something about the head of the family.  
What was that? 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  Chair it is these three 
Guptas which were mentioned in the - in the media.  You - surely you 
know about them. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 72 of 77 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you meet all …? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  No complete - sorry Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  He has not completed the translation.

ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  He continued to say they are from that 
family.  That is the full sentence. 
INTERPRETER:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just - just repeat the answer - the full answer. 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  Where the boiler was 
10 
situated the containers were shipped in. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The boiler was shipped into the country in 
containers? 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Continue. 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  Three Indians came to me 
and at that stage I took everything out of the container and it is at the 
time when they came and they introduced themselves to me and these 
people were introduced to me because those people cannot just speak 
English or anything. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes.  So you have met Mr Prasad.  You 
have met these three people who were introduced to you as Guptas? 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  You have associated your meeting with 
the Guptas with the installation of the milk processing plant.  Please 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140

correct me if I am wrong. 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  Ja.  They came there 
Chairperson to come and build that thing. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  To come and build the milk processing 
plant. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry.  As I said my Afrikaans is - is not good but the 
more Afrikaans I hear and the more Afrikaans I try to speak the better I 
become.  So Ms Gcabashe you have been very good in picking up.  I 
think you continue to be concerned. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am very concerned Chairman. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are very concerned? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may well be therefore that maybe we should try and 
get another interpreter.

CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Chairman I believe we could create space 
if we have to first thing tomorrow morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If Mr …we just need to talk to Mr Basson 
and see if it is amenable to his arrangements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Mr Interpreter counsel who as I have said 
understands Afrikaans better than me continues to be concerned about 
whether you are able to interpret accurately what the witness is saying 
and what sometimes she is putting to the witness and her concerns are 
10 
strong enough that we should try and get another interpreter.  You 
understand that? 
INTERPRETER:  I do, I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Okay, thank you.  Let me find out from - 
you can translate this - let me find out from Mr Basson whether he 
would be available tomorrow morning if we were to adjourn until 
tomorrow morning in order to try and get another interpreter. 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  Yes.  I can sleepover. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Interpreter you did not interpreter.  
Mr Interpreter interpret what I say - said.  Would you be available to 
20 
come back tomorrow morning Mr Basson if we adjourn so that we can 
get another interpreter? 
MR WILLIE BASSON (through interpreter):  Yes.  I will sleepover. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  No, no thank you.  I think we will do that.  
The - in terms of the starting time the witness that you otherwise have 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 75 of 77 
 
for tomorrow is supposed to take how long? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  He will probably take about three to four 
hours Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We actually had two set down for 
tomorrow but we could (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that please. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The - the first witness … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Is likely to take three hours possibly four.  
10 
The report he goes through is quite an important one and the questions 
are detailed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The second witness however Chairman we 
might be able to speak to.  He does not implicate anybody. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So we had squeezed him in … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And because he is Johannesburg based  
CHAIRPERSON:  Jm. 
20 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  We will ask him very politely if he either 
could come in the afternoon or just come when we come back … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And we then deal with his evidence then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
25 JULY 2019 – DAY 140 
 
Page 76 of 77 
 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Because he is local I believe he may even 
be able just to be on standby … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  And come in within an hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  If all indications are that we are going to 
finish by lunchtime and we can take his evidence after lunch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine.  So what time do you suggest we 
start tomorrow - 10 o’ clock/half past nine? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Could we start at half past nine 
10 
Chairman? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Half past nine? 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  The interpretation takes a little longer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  I am finding. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV LEAH GCABASHE SC:  So we need a buffer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  We - we are going to then - we are 
20 
going to adjourn and tomorrow we will start at half past nine.  So if you 
could be back here tomorrow at half past nine Mr Basson. 
MR WILLIE BASSON

INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Good afternoon Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good afternoon. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Mr Chairman this afternoon 
the legal team intended to present evidence of one witness but 
unfortunately due to circumstances that were discussed in Chambers it 
10 
is not possible to do so and we are now seeking an adjournment of the 
proceedings until tomorrow morning because I believe my learned 
friend Ms Gcabashe still continues with her team tomorrow morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you.  I was going to hear the evidence of 
a certain witness.  That evidence cannot be heard at this stage and its 
hearing will be postponed until further notice.  So we will adjourn for 
the day and tomorrow we will proceed with the evidence relating to the 
Estina Dairy Farm.  We adjourn. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.
