annexures does it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It does have annexures Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is admitted together with its annexures 
as Exhibit U31.1. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  .1 thank you Chair.  Thank you.  Ms 
Goodson just by way of a background could you tell the 
Chairperson please what is your profession? 
MS GOODSON:  Chair I do not have to have a profession.  
I studied – I have got a post graduate degree in physical 
10 
science and maths from the University of Natal and so I am 
not really like a certified professional necessarily in 
anything like an accountant and so forth.  And straight 
after obtaining my degree I started my career in the mining 
industry and I was in the mining industry and progressed 
my career up until the end of 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Hm.   How did you get employed at 
Trillian? 
MS GOODSON:  Oh dear.  Ja so Chair I – I had a really 
good career from the time I got my degree up until 2015 
20 
and then I progressed almost every second year I was 
getting promotions within the 
mining industry and it 
culminated in me working for Anglo American.   
 
So in 2015 I was employed in Anglo American and I 
received a call from an ex colleague of mine from a 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 8 of 361 
 
previous company who said that he had a friend who was 
interested – who was starting a management consulting 
company; wanted it to be very proudly South African and 
was looking for a black female CEO; would I be interested.  
That is the question.   
 
 
And it was because the referral so to say came from 
someone that I trusted I thought it could have been a great 
opportunity. 
 
In this phone call this gentleman then said to me 
okay look you are going to get a call from a Mr Daniel Roy 
10 
and just take it from there.   
 
So I got a call very shortly afterwards from a Mr 
Daniel Roy saying that he was part of this company that 
would be built up and his words to me physically were but I 
am too far down the food chain physically. 
 
You going to get a call from a Mr Clive Angel who is 
going to explain more to you.  So although I thought it was 
a bit bizarre I did not really act on anything because it was 
the first time that I had been head hunted in this specific 
way for a start-up company right. 
20 
 
Anyway so later I got a call from Mr Clive Angel and 
Mr Clive Angel asked to meet me.  We met and that is how 
the process of – and that is my introduction to Trillian 
right.  Subsequently when we met face to face not on the 
phone. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 9 of 361 
 
 
Should I go into more detail on this? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  When did you say this was? 
MS GOODSON:  This was roughly please forgive me I do 
not have exact dates but it is between September and 
October 2015.  So I was still employed at Anglo American.  
Had a very average life and out of the blue I just get these 
calls. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes you wanted to go into more detail. 
MS GOODSON:  Ja.  So subsequent to the initial call with 
Mr Clive Angel I did meet with him one – a few days 
10 
afterwards and what Mr Angel – but I am – sorry please let 
me know if I am going into too much detail.  I am going to 
overshare and you can tell me to stop. 
 
You know before you meet somebody you generally 
go onto the internet and you sort of Google/stalk them if – 
especially when you hear names for the first time right.  So 
I never heard of this Clive Angel before so I go onto 
LinkedIn and see what connections we have common and I 
just try and find out more about him. 
 
And what I find out from the internet search at the 
20 
time was that he was actually a director for a company 
called Integrated Capital Management.  So I was a bit 
confused because we were talking about a company named 
Trillian but this gentleman is from a different company and 
it did not quite make sense to me. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 10 of 361 
 
 
A few days later like I said we did meet in person 
and Mr Angel explained to me that Integrated Capital 
Management were brought on by the major shareholder of 
what will become Trillian to – and their services and their 
position was to in essence establish Trillian – to set it up 
and 
that 
is 
why 
they 
were 
looking 
for 
executive 
management for some of the subsidiaries so that this 
executive management could start setting it up. 
 
So I asked a few questions.  I did ask questions like 
you know what is the intention with the management 
10 
consulting company; what type of industry would they be 
targeting?  Mr Angel informed me that specifically Trillian 
Management Consulting would be focussed predominantly 
in the public sector and to that extent they had already 
secured work at Eskom. 
 
Personally I do not have skills to sell things.  I am 
not a sales person right and I mentioned this concern to Mr 
Angel and I said if I am the CEO I am going to struggle to 
secure work to ensure revenue.  And he explicitly said to 
me you do not have to worry about that because the work 
20 
is secured. 
 
And after that first meeting he gave me a set of 
documents and those documents – they were physical 
documents unfortunately I do not have them anymore but 
they were Minutes of the Eskom Board Tender Committee I 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 11 of 361 
 
think that is what it was referred to – sub-committee – the 
Eskom Board Tender Sub-Committee in which they were 
discussing this program referred to as the Top Engineers 
Program and you could see that the nego... – in the 
minutes – the minutes referenced the fact that negotiations 
had already taken place between Eskom and McKinsey. 
 
So at the meeting with Clive – the initial meeting 
with – sorry Mr Angel he gave me these documents.  We 
subsequently met again and he said the instruction that I 
had at the time was Bianca read through it and if you have 
10 
got questions reach out right. 
 
So I read through the documents and I reached out 
to him and we had a subsequent meeting and I asked the 
question but what is Trillian’s role because clearly this 
work 
at 
Eskom 
was 
negotiated 
between 
Eskom 
and 
McKinsey; what is the role of Trillian? 
 
And Mr Angel said to me that Trillian would be the 
supply development partner for McKinsey in this work.  So 
this is now towards the end of October 2015.  And that is… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So what is – sorry towards the end of? 
20 
MS GOODSON:  October 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  October 2015. 
MS GOODSON:  Ja I am still employed at Anglo American 
00:12:11.  
CHAIRPERSON:  He – ja he will be lead you. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 12 of 361 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS GOODSON:  Must I carry on? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No – you want to carry on? 
MS GOODSON:  Yes because I want to explain how I got 
on board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh yes. 
MS GOODSON:  (Inaudible). 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS GOODSON:  So I met with Mr Angel the second time 
10 
and understood then that the relationship or the revenue 
for Trillian would be predominantly through Eskom because 
that work was secured. 
 
And it would be through working with McKinsey as 
the supply development partner.  Mr Angel then said it 
would be prudent for me to meet with the main shareholder 
because there was one majority shareholder of Trillian.  
Trillian would – he did not explain the structure to me at 
that time which I will explain to you a bit later but the 
holding company had one major shareholder and that 
20 
shareholder ’s name was Salim Essa – Mr Salim Essa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which one was the holding company? 
MS 
GOODSON: 
 
The 
holding 
company 
the 
way 
I 
understood it at the time was Trillian Capital Partners.  So 
maybe I should explain the structure now? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 13 of 361 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You can do so yes. 
MS GOODSON:  Okay.  My understanding was that Trillian 
Capital Partners was the overall company very similar to 
Anglo American Group of Companies so to say.  And then 
underneath there was five subsidiary companies right.  And 
the 
subsidiary 
companies 
were 
Trillian 
Management 
Consulting of which I was being interviewed at the time to 
become the CEO.  There was – there would be Trillian 
Financial Advisory of which Ms Mothepu – Ms Mosilo 
Mothepu would become the CEO.  There was Trillian 
10 
Securities of which Mr Eric Wood would be the acting CEO.  
There was Trillian Asset Management of which Mr Daniel 
Roy would be the CEO and then lastly at the time when I 
was having these discussions there was discussions about 
another subsidiary called Trillian Properties of which Mr 
Mark Pamensky was earmarked to be the CEO. 
 
It was also explained to me that Mr Eric Wood 
would eventually become the CEO of the group – the 
holding company but only at the 1 s t of March 2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
20 
MS GOODSON:  So Mr Angel explained this to me and he 
mentioned that it was prudent that I meet the major 
shareholder of the holding company which would be Mr 
Salim Essa prior to us progressing any further with these 
discussions. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 14 of 361 
 
 
So I met Mr Essa for the first time. Again I tried to 
Google him prior to meeting him and I did not really find 
anything on the internet.  At that time he was a very 
unknown entity.  
 
So I had no reasons to be suspicious or concerned.  
I met Mr Essa as a second interview – sorry I am not 
getting my chronology correct. 
 
Prior to me meeting Mr Essa I had a meeting before 
and 
that 
meeting 
was 
with 
Mr 
Eric 
Wood 
and 
Mr 
Mohammed Bobat and it was part of the interview process 
10 
so to say. 
 
And it was in that meeting that Mr Wood explained 
to me his transition that he was at Regiments at the time 
and that as of the 1 s t of March of the following year he 
would become the CEO of Trillian.  I did not ask him 
details about why he was leaving.   
 
Mr Mohammed Bobat asked me a few questions 
things like did I – did I have experience with the PFMA 
which I answered no but did I not come from the private 
sector. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Where did – where did this meeting 
take place? 
MS GOODSON:  This meeting took place in the Integrated 
Capital Management’s office in Melrose. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In Melrose Arch? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 15 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:  In Melrose Arch ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And your meetings with Mr Clive Angel? 
MS GOODSON:  All in the same office. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you do go to Melrose Arch for these 
meetings. 
MS GOODSON:  Melrose Arch ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.   
MS GOODSON:  And then when I met with Mr Salim Essa it 
was also in Melrose Arch a different office.   Basically it 
was their Integrated Capital Management’s offices were 
10 
just one floor up – you could walk – park in the same 
basement and just walk up the ramp. 
 
 
Anyway so when I met Mr Essa for the first time it 
was an interesting interview because it felt as though he 
was selling the company to me as opposed to me trying to 
sell my skills and competence to him.  And I found it a bit 
bizarre. 
 
So Mr Essa went on to say that his vision for 
Trillian Management Consulting was that it would compete 
in the same space as the likes of McKinsey and at that 
20 
time a leading management consultants South African 
management consultants company was Letsema and he 
says you know why is it only Letsema and McKinsey in the 
public sector space there needs to become a new business 
– 
a 
new 
proudly 
South 
African 
black 
management 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 16 of 361 
 
consulting company that also competes in that space.  And 
that was his vision for this entity.  At the time load 
shedding was rife.  He mentioned to me that the intention 
was to go into Eskom to help reduce load shedding and 
help Eskom become a first world utility.  And it sounded 
exciting. 
 
So Mr Essa was really selling this opportunity to me 
and towards the end of the interview he asked me so tell 
me about yourself and I am not too sure what came over 
me at the time but I actually decided to tell him a lot about 
10 
my upbringing. 
 
You know I come from – from Pietermaritzburg, 
small community, very, very strong family values, my 
parents are very religious now I went into that type of 
detail. 
 
The next day I got an email from Clive saying Salim 
likes you if you want the job it is yours.  That is how I got 
on board. 
 
I signed – I formally signed my offer of employment 
in about November 2015 however I had to fill out my 
20 
resignation period at Anglo American.  So I only formally 
started working for Trillian on the 1 s t of January or the first 
working day of January 2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Hm.  You signed your employment 
contract on the 17 November 2015. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 17 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:  I believe my affidavit yes that has more 
details than I remember at this point. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  But what did you say about 
January 2016? 
MS GOODSON:  I only formally started.  My start date in 
that contract – the effective date so to say is 1 s t of January 
although I resigned in November.  I had to – I had a 
resignation period that I had to honour at Anglo American 
still. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So from the time you signed the 
10 
employment contract 17 November 2015 to the time you 
officially resumed your employment what were you doing? 
MS GOODSON:  That was a very interesting time.  I had 
accumulated quite a lot of annual leave from Anglo 
American at the time so in that period call it about six 
weeks so the last two week of November and the month of 
December 2015 I had taken my leave in lieu of my 
resignation period so to say.  But technically I was still an 
employee of Anglo American. 
 
And I had mentioned this to Mr Angel and Mr Angel 
20 
had said to me that I need to get my skin in the game.  So 
he had arranged numerous meetings for me with the 
McKinsey team.  It was obviously clear to me from the 
documents that Mr Angel had given me prior that McKinsey 
had started at least negotiating towards working on this 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 18 of 361 
 
contract. 
 
So it was in December very early December 2015 I 
had already met quite a few members of the McKinsey 
team that were working on the Eskom Top Engineers 
Program. 
 
In addition to that I was also introduced to a 
company 
called 
E-Gateway 
an 
Indian 
and 
Emerging 
company and I was told that this would be the company 
that Trillian sub-contracts for one of the work streams at 
Eskom. 
10 
 
So we had quite a few meetings during that period.  
So it was 00:20:21 working or it was quite active. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And this is – I mean when you go to 
them to going to Melrose Arch offices. 
MS GOODSON:  Yes.  Yes almost all the time if I remember 
correctly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So official commencement of your 
employment contract is 1 January 2016 how long did you 
remain there? 
MS GOODSON:  This is the shortest job I had ever had in 
20 
my life Chairman.  I resigned on the 19 March 2016 so I 
was employed for what does that make it two and a half 
months round it up to three months. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  
MS GOODSON:  I was – I have never ever stayed in a 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 19 of 361 
 
position that quickly.  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you – what you will tell the 
Chairperson is your experience in that relatively short 
space of time. 
MS GOODSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is – then go into the services that 
Trillian rather on your position what is your position on 
Trillian? 
MS GOODSON:  My position in Trillian was the CEO of one 
of the subsidiaries the Trillian Management Consulting 
10 
Subsidiary. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  You were – you were the CEO of the  of 
TMC? 
MS GOODSON:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And whereas you said a number of 
subsidiaries and there was the holding company. 
MS GOODSON:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I guess it is going to be important to 
refer to TMC as TMC and to the holding company as the 
20 
holding company and whatever other subsidiaries so that 
we are sure which one – which entity we are talking about. 
MS GOODSON:  I will be clear on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 20 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am mentioning this because it is easy to 
just say Trillian, Trillian, Trillian. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is right. 
MS GOODSON:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then one does not know which entity.  
Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes so your position is CEO of TMC. 
MS GOODSON:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And what – from your experience at the 
time what services was TMC providing? 
10 
MS GOODSON:  So TMC was intended to be a stock 
standard management consulting company so very similar 
to what we – the services that McKinsey or the likes of 
extension 
or 
Deloitte 
would 
offer. 
 
It 
was 
not 
any 
specialised services in any way. 
 
If I assumed that if we encountered a client that 
needed specialised services in the realm of finance that 
one of the other subsidiaries that was more applicable 
would then take up the work.  But Management Consulting 
is quite in my opinion is very generic services that entities 
20 
generally bring on board if they just do not have the 
manpower or the experience to do it themselves.  So it was 
not specialised in any way.   
 
Sorry – so – you know now that I say that it is 
maybe worth mentioning that Mr Angel also did tell me and 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 21 of 361 
 
I did come to know that this Top Engineers Program was 
awarded so to say – I will come and explain that a bit later 
to McKinsey and its SD and our supplier development 
partner on a confined basis on the basis that they were 
offering specialised services.  And I do not believe that 
Management Consulting is a specialised service in any 
way. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja you can go into it. 
MS GOODSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The Top Engineering Program – Top 
10 
Engineers Program. 
MS GOODSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Was it already a project or program 
giving to McKinsey by the time you were appointed at 
TMC? 
MS GOODSON:  But that is what I understood so I have 
mentioned Chair that I had met with the McKinsey teams in 
December 2015.  I still had not formally taken my role as 
CEO of TMC at that point.  And it seemed to me that the 
McKinsey team were streaks ahead in terms of delivering 
20 
work against this program.  They had established teams.  
They had already got for example work schedules in terms 
of what work needed to be done.  They were – they were 
prepared and ready to hit the ground running first thing in 
January and I felt as TMC on my back foot because TMC 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 22 of 361 
 
did not even have any employees at the time it was just me 
you know. 
 
So McKinsey had already started doing something 
towards this program and the program consisted of four 
specific work streams.  I am not too sure if Mr Seleka 
would like me to explain them now or later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe before you go on just in one 
or two sentences explain what was the object of this Top 
Engineers Program? 
MS GOODSON:  It was so convoluted I will try really hard 
10 
to put into two sentences.  The Top Engineers Program if 
you take it literally talks about top engineers literally.  So 
the intention was to create skills within Eskom that gave 
you the – what is the word I am looking for?  It was as if 
you had succession planning right and you retain the IP 
and you retain the skills within the organisation to sustain 
the 
business 
in 
four 
specific 
areas 
looking 
at 
the 
Generation work stream.  So how do we generate energy?  
Looking at procurement in terms of what were they 
spending?  There was a claims work stream and then there 
20 
was a primary energy work stream.  
 
And the intention was to take Eskom employees in 
each of those different areas and actually build them up so 
that they could in essence in long run replace the likes of 
McKinsey so that Eskom would have its own McKinsey in-
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 23 of 361 
 
house so to say.   
 
But the plan was that while you do that you have 
got the sub-contractors or these consultants like McKinsey 
and Trillian walking the journey with the Eskom employees. 
 
That was then – that is the way I understood it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so the idea was not to take new 
graduates 
and 
train 
them 
and 
give 
them 
certain 
opportunities so that in long term they could be top 
engineers available to Eskom.  It would be to take people 
who are already engineers but help them to get to the top 
10 
of their – of their game? 
MS GOODSON:  I wish I could – I wish I could answer that 
in more detail the thing is McKinsey just did not get me 
involved  and did not even require Trillian to get involved 
in that recruitment process and that recruitment process 
was extensive. 
 
My understanding – I do not know if I can say 
categorically yes to the question that you asked what I do 
know for certain though is that it was employees within 
Eskom. 
20 
 
So whether those employees were already qualified 
or working towards a qualification I do not know.  But it 
certainly was people – it was not external recruits it was 
all employees of Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 24 of 361 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Did Trillian had any role to play in 
the rendition of the services relating to the Top Engineers 
Program? 
MS GOODSON:  Trillian was supposed to have a role to 
play because we were the Supply Development Partner.  
We were supposed to be working with McKinsey to deliver 
on the objectives and I tried so hard to work with McKinsey 
but McKinsey made it impossible – absolutely impossible. 
 
To – sorry I am running away with myself but to the 
extent that I remember attending a leadership meeting 
10 
McKinsey and Trillian in a leadership meeting at the 
McKinsey offices in January and one of the principles of 
McKinsey said – because I was fighting to say why do you 
guys not want us to put people on the ground?  If we do 
not put people to work how do we get paid?  And I 
remember the one principle saying to me why do you care 
you will get your money anyway.  And I could not 
understand how could we get paid if we were not working?  
So I tried so hard to get people involved in delivering to 
contribute – I mean I come from mining the primary energy 
20 
works stream for example would have been one of the work 
streams that I could add more value than anybody on the 
McKinsey team because of my experience.  McKinsey 
would not get me involved.  We were completely sidelined.  
So – does that answer your question Mr Seleka  There was 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 25 of 361 
 
an attempt to deliver. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Yes.  I think you should also 
explain 
to 
the 
Chairperson 
whether 
or 
rather 
the 
contractual relationship between TMC and McKinsey. 
MS GOODSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because there is evidence to the effect 
that there was no contract between the two.  You were the 
CEO ...[intervenes]  
MS GOODSON:   I would not know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...in a better position to know what was 
10 
going on? 
MS GOODSON:   Absolutely.  Just to...  I am going to start 
referencing one other individual.  The gentleman’s name 
was Glen(?) Bernard.  He became a COO.  So before I get 
to the question, I just – because you know answering some 
of these questions for Mr Seleka, I need to reference my 
COO.   
 
Mr Bernard on board that he – he worked with 
me at Anglo American.  So also had extensive experience 
in the mining industry and he joined Trillian also in January 
20 
of 2016 from Anglo American. 
 
And so we started working at Trillian together in 
January.  So it was myself and my COO.  And we had all 
these meetings with McKinsey and during the meetings, 
especially when the meetings were not necessarily going 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 26 of 361 
 
well, so when I would want to influence the work stream, 
for example, and we would get pushed back, Glen and I 
would always try and default the contract. 
 
So we spoke to Mr Angel... the then existing 
contract... with negotiations for this work prior, right.  And 
Mr Angel said to me, no, there is no existing contract.  We 
spoke to Mr Sagar who – Mr Becca(?) Segal who was a 
director at McKinsey and he spoke about – we had to put a 
contract in place that governs the relationship between the 
two entities.   
10 
 
So Mr Sagar, at some point..  Please forgive me 
for not getting my terminology a hundred percent right, but 
I am just trying to answer your question on the contract. 
 
In some point during my tenure and I seem to 
remember there was some time, I think towards the end of 
January, it could very well be the beginning of February, 
Mr Sagar sent me a two or three pages sub-contractors 
agreement. 
 
But you must keep in time that at the time that 
the cash flows for this project, this Top Engineer Project, 
20 
were going to the regions of about R 10 billion over three 
years, okay. 
 
And the subcontractors agreement that was sent 
to me was about three pages long and you know my COO 
and I were asked to sign this, right.   
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 27 of 361 
 
 
So I looked at the subcontractors agreement and 
I was, like, there is no way that you could sign a three 
pagers that is so loose and floppy to govern a transaction 
that is worth R 10 billion for an SOE.   
 
So I tracked changes and I – almost every single 
sentence in that subcontractors agreement I had an issue 
with and I sent it back to McKinsey.  By the time I 
resigned, 
I 
had 
not 
received 
any 
feedback 
on 
that 
subcontractors agreement.   
 
So what I am aware of is that there was a 
10 
discussion about the subcontractors agreement.  There 
were initial communications about one but during my very 
short tenure I had never seen a signed copy. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  And ...[intervenes]  
MS GOODSON:   Sorry.  And I certainly did not find a copy. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You are certain you did not find 
...[intervenes]  
MS GOODSON:   Absolutely not. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  Also explain the distinction 
between what has been referred to as a corporate plan and 
20 
the master service agreement which I see you deal with 
also to some extent in your affidavit.  Just enlighten us on 
the distinction between the two. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay.  Chair, is it okay that I am not 
going in a chronological order?  It is okay?  Like, okay? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 28 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, we will guide you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and he will reign you in when 
you...[intervenes]  
MS GOODSON:   Because I just going to answer the 
question.  I mean, things did not quite happen so 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja-no, he will ask you the questions. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he knows what he is looking for. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if there is something important that 
you feel you were not asked to talk about that you want to 
share, then you will have that chance but he will guide you.  
He knows what he is looking for. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay.  So you...  Do you mind repeating 
the question? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, just the distinction between what is 
referred to the corporate plan and the master service 
agreement. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay.  So this is...  Sorry, I chuckle 
because of what I know now in hindsight.  The Top 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 29 of 361 
 
Engineers Programme consisted of only four work streams 
and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Four work streams? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, and I will repeat them for you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   There was Generation, there was Primary 
Energy, there was Claims and there was Procurement.  So 
there were only those four.  There is no Corporate 
Planning. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, but where did it form, the corporate 
10 
plan or the master service? 
MS GOODSON:   So the reason why I am saying this to you 
Chair and how I know it only included four is because 
during my tenure I got sight of what draws(?) the master 
services 
agreement, 
the 
draft 
at 
that 
time 
for 
this 
programme and it only referenced those four work streams, 
right.   
 
So that is the scope of the contract to my 
understanding.  The corporate plan who is something that 
during my tenure – I am trying very much to answer the 
20 
question based on what I knew then and not what I know 
now.   
 
I have no idea then what the corporate plan was 
because it had nothing to do with Trillian Management 
Consulting.  Nobody asked me to do the work.  We did not 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 30 of 361 
 
have people to do the work.  It did not fall within the scope 
of the MSA.   
 
After 
watching 
numerous, 
you 
know, 
these 
sessions, the Commission’s sessions, I now understand 
that the corporate plan fitted into something else but it 
certainly was not anything that I was aware of.   
 
Certainly not Trillian Management Consulting 
and not Trillian Financial Advisories as far as I knew but I 
could 
be 
wrong 
with 
that 
but 
definitely 
not 
Trillian 
Management Consulting.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can I just take you back, a little bit, to 
this Programme of Top Engineers.  Did Trillian have any 
engineers? 
MS GOODSON:   Any engineers? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS GOODSON:   No.  So when I was at Trillian for those – 
the first three months – for the first two months there were 
only two employees.  So it was myself and my COO, right? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
20 
MS GOODSON:   On the 1 s t of March when people came 
over from Regiments, there were about 15 employees or so 
that came over from Regiments.  I think there were a few 
engineers in that contingence of people.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, just repeat that. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 31 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:   I think there were a few individuals within 
that team that transferred that were – that had studied 
engineering. 
 
I 
do 
not 
know 
if 
they 
had 
certified 
engineering qualifications. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Okay.  H’m. 
MS GOODSON:   But yes, we eventually did on the 
1 s t of March have some engineers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Would you say how many that you 
knew of? 
MS GOODSON:   Not many.  A handful.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS GOODSON:   So five...  five. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   But keep in mind Chairman that when I 
signed the offer of employment I was told by Mr Angel that 
eGateway were the specialist in Generation and they had 
the qualification but there is a lot to be said about that 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS GOODSON:   ...surrounding the... 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And as far as you know, 
McKinsey had lots of engineers? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes.  No, no...  What...  Sorry.  Let me 
ask you a question.  What is a lot?  What does a lot mean? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs]  Well, it depends, you know.  
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 32 of 361 
 
Would you regard 10, 20?  It just depends on you. 
MS GOODSON:   The team that I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You give me your own view of whether 
they had a lot and whether that is... lot, that is another 
issue. 
MS GOODSON:   Ja, I think the McKinsey – if I could give 
you an indication of the McKinsey Team.  And the McKinsey 
Team eventually for this programme... it is like about a 100 
people.  It was a very significant team.  I think the 
qualifications that you founded in there – when I say 
10 
qualification, 
I 
am 
just 
talking 
about 
degrees, 
not 
certifications. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS GOODSON:   Would be along the lines of finance.  
There were a lot of people that had MBA’s.  Dr Weiss, for 
example, was an engineer.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS GOODSON:   And you would have probably again about 
a 
handful 
at 
most 
two 
of 
people 
that 
had 
studied 
engineering but the rest more in the lines of finance.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  I am trying to understand what was 
sought to be done, what the – was really sought to be 
achieved by the Top Engineers Programme because the 
first impression I get when you say to me top engineers is 
that those people are really at the top of their profession in 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 33 of 361 
 
terms of how good they are.  Okay.   
 
Now 
the 
programme 
was 
not 
called 
Top 
Managers.  It was Top Engineers.  And if the people you 
are talking about who are to go and be in the programme 
are not people who are already top engineers but you want 
to make them top engineers, I would expect that you need 
top engineers to make these group of engineers top 
engineers.  
 
You would need engineers to make them top 
engineers. 
 
That 
would 
be 
the 
first 
impression 
10 
...[intervenes]  
MS GOODSON:   It takes one to know one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that one would get.  If you want...  If 
Mr Seleka wants to make somebody, a young lawyer a top 
lawyer, you know, he must at least be a lawyer himself.  
Preferable he must be a top lawyer himself.   
MS GOODSON:   Absolutely.  It take one to know one, as 
you would say.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So that is why I am trying to find 
out whether Trillian had engineers, had top engineers but it 
20 
might be easier to say they had engineers maybe to 
...[intervenes]  
MS GOODSON:   Can I explain? 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...to say whether it was top engineers.  
McKinsey the same thing.  That – you want to say 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 34 of 361 
 
something? 
MS GOODSON:   Chair, would it help if I explain what the 
different work streams were intended to do? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS GOODSON:   You will actually find ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   ...that it did not have much to do with 
engineering at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja explain that. 
MS GOODSON:   Can I explain that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  H’m. 
MS GOODSON:   The only...  So I have mentioned before, 
okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS GOODSON:   In my experience and I am not that young 
but – and I have got quite a bit of experience but the only 
other four – the only work stream that had a very 
significant reliance on the engineering faculty, the pure 
20 
engineering faculty being civil, electrical and mechanical 
was the Generation work stream that because it was highly 
technical.   
 
And I know this because I come from mining, 
right, that will be the only space where you maybe would 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 35 of 361 
 
have needed some technical insight to actually increase 
the performance of the power stations, right.   
 
But what was so bizarre about that in itself is 
that the work stream that McKinsey was putting forward to 
bring about these efficiencies within the power stations had 
nothing to do with engineering.  They were proposing a 
human capital optimisation.  They wanted to restructure the 
people and the processes and the – not the technical 
processes.   
 
The business processes of the power station to 
10 
bring about the efficiency that Eskom sought to achieve.  
So technically if you are going to try and restructure your 
human capital and improve your business processes, all 
being it for a power station, you do not really need 
engineering qualifications for that, right.  So that was the 
Generation work stream.   
 
On the Primary Energy work stream, I also 
thought to an extent that would seek some sort of guidance 
from the likes of mining engineering, right.  Because you 
are looking at the coal mines and you are looking to 
20 
optimise the quality of coal that you are getting out of the 
mines to bring into the power stations, right.  But that is 
not what McKinsey was doing.   
 
What McKinsey were doing in that specific work 
stream was renegotiating the costs plus contracts and that 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 36 of 361 
 
is more contractual work stream.  Then you come to the 
Procurement work stream.  The Procurement work stream 
is basically just looking to optimise the spend, the 
commodity spend of Eskom.   
 
So in essence what they were doing is this term 
that management consultancy throw around called strategic 
sourcing where you would say, okay, because I am Eskom 
and because I have got economy to scale, I can take my 
entire spend on computers, for example, I got one supplier 
and say that because I want to buy such bulk, I need the 
10 
best price.   
 
That is what they were doing in Procurement, 
okay.  Put very simply.  In clients(?) they had lawyers on 
the team because they were negotiating contractual claims 
for a third party against Eskom and for Eskom.  So it is 
lawyers.   
 
So as you can see, within those four realms, 
although it is called the Top Engineers Programme, it really 
was not the rise(?) any engineers from the way that 
McKinsey had proposed to do the work, okay.   
20 
 
I felt differently.  I felt that Generation could 
have technical expertise which would have been engineers 
and I felt the same about Primary Energy but my voice was 
not heard in the McKinsey team. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay thank you. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 37 of 361 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   Sorry, I... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, that is fine.  You mentioned earlier 
that McKinsey was appointed on a confinement basis.  Now 
in respect of which of the ...[intervenes]  
MS GOODSON:   The top engineers. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was it the top engineers? 
MS GOODSON:   Top Engineers Programme. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did the Top Engineers fall under the 
master service agreement? 
10 
MS GOODSON:   Correct.  The master service agreement – 
the Top Engineers Programme was referred to by two 
different names.  It was either – you either referred to it as 
the Top Engineers or the Eskom Turnaround Plan but it was 
exactly the same thing.  And the MSA, the master service 
agreement, governed – because it is the same thing, it 
goes two things – people just use the names, the reference 
interchangeable.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   Sorry, I do not want to add more 
20 
acronyms and it just makes things more confusing and...  
[laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, I have that.  And let us go back to 
the 
proposal 
that 
Trillian 
should 
be 
the 
supplier 
development partner.  So you, I think you mentioned, that 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 38 of 361 
 
two or three pager document which is the subcontract, was 
that in relation to this master service agreement? 
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You did track changes on it? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You sent it back? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But by the time you left it was never 
signed. 
MS GOODSON:   To the best of my knowledge.  Absolutely. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To the best of your knowledge. 
MS GOODSON:   There were too many issues.  That entire 
contract would have to be completely redrafted.  And after 
sending my comments back to McKinsey I heard nothing 
about it, following – and I did follow up but I never 
received feedback.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MS GOODSON:   But the contract needed to be completely 
redrafted.  My home loan agreement, for example, that is a 
lot less than R 10 billion [laughs] is a lot more extensive 
20 
than just two pages.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  But then, during that three months 
that you were there, was that subcontract not having been 
signed, what was the relationship between Trillian (TMC) 
and McKinsey? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 39 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:   The relationship was based on – it was at 
risk and it was on faith, almost.  Wherever we would speak 
– and when I say we I talk about now the executive – and 
the executive of Trillian comprised of the CEO’s of the 
different – the various subsidiaries.   
 
So that is myself, Ms Mathebo, Mr Rooi, my COO 
for example.  We would often meet and talk about what was 
happening in our respective subsidiaries and we would 
raise concerns because McKinsey would always say that, 
look, they are worried because the MSA is not signed.  And 
10 
I would also speak to the people in my company to say, you 
know, what is the issue with the MSA.  Why is the MSA not 
signed - getting signed?  And what is the issue with our 
contract with McKinsey?   
 
And I would ask McKinsey the same questions 
and the reply that I would get, specifically from Mr Sagar 
and Dr Weiss, was that it will be signed eminently.   
 
And I believed them and I understood or I 
accepted that it was on this basis that it will be signed 
eminently that they felt that they could carry on work.   
20 
 
So although these contracts were not signed and 
it was not anything formal, it did not necessarily – so it did 
not stop the momentum of trying to make progress towards 
the project. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  Okay.  You...  Well, to that – to 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 40 of 361 
 
the extent that the contract was not in place.  How did TMC 
feature in the services that McKinsey then did to Eskom 
pursuant to either the Top Engineers Programme or any of 
the work streams that you mentioned? 
MS GOODSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see you are shaking your head. 
MS GOODSON:   Ja, you know, Chair I do not want to 
come across as somebody who is just complaining and – 
but I really do disagree with the perception that the 
McKinsey team, specifically with Dr Fine and Dr Weiss said 
10 
at this Commission.  I can believe and I accepted the 
intention was to build junior companies, small to medium 
size companies of which Trillian was perceived to be one, 
right but the way that they went about doing it during my 
entire tenure and my relationship with McKinsey was 
extensive.   
 
I met with them and I spoke with them every 
single day for the time that I was there.  They were not 
helpful at all.  They were supposed to be the main 
contractor because they have got all the global experience, 
20 
they have got the global network, they have done things 
like this before and so forth.  And they were supposed to 
be taking...  as I understood this.   
 
Sorry.  They were supposed to be taking Trillian 
under the arm and do the transfer of skills to build up that 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 41 of 361 
 
as well.  In a management consulting company you provide 
a service and the only asset that you really have is people, 
right.  People have the IT, people have the skills.  You do 
not actually have anything else that is tangible.   
 
So the only way that Trillian could grow, in my 
opinion, was for us to put people to work alongside 
McKinsey.  Every single time I asked McKinsey, and I met 
with them on all four work streams, okay, every single time 
they would tell me an organogram of the team that would 
be executing any of the work, there was never a single 
10 
Trillian representative.   
 
And I had - my frustration was so heightened 
because I kept on saying...  I mean, we would get people.  
My COO and I were getting CV’s of people.  We have 
reached out to talent acquisition companies to start 
interviewing people and getting people onboard and every 
time we would interview.   
 
So we spent a lot of time interviewing people.  
We would then shortlist and we would then to got McKinsey 
to say, okay, here is the – here is the Trillian people(?) 
20 
that are going to start on, call it the 1 s t of April, right.  
McKinsey would say:  No, we are not accepting and it is 
not good enough.  We are looking for an MBA.  No, we are 
not – we...  You know on Generation it was the funniest 
thing.   
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 42 of 361 
 
 
McKinsey said to me that they were looking for 
somebody who had at least 25-years’ experience in coal 
towered power stations but had to be BEE compliant.   
 
Now if you look at the history of this company, 
how are you going to find somebody that is non-white, that 
has got that kind of experience in the coal industry that 
has – that is also young and is willing to come on as an 
associate in a management consulting company?  [laughs]   
 
You know, the made it impossible to work and 
their attitude was:  Why are you even complaining?  You 
10 
are going to get paid anyway.  That never made sense to 
me.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  That is ...[intervenes]  
MS GOODSON:   So...  Sorry.  We had a very acrimonious 
relationship. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Did you report that situation to 
either Mr Eric Wood, Mr Salim Essa or... 
MS GOODSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think you said Mr Mohammed 
Goldberg was also in your interview. 
20 
MS GOODSON:   Ja.  I did not have a relationship with 
Mr Wood because I did not come from Regiments.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MS GOODSON:   Right.  So during the period, January to 
February, my contract was always with Mr Angel.  I only 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 43 of 361 
 
started – if you could call it working with Mr Wood slightly, 
from the 1 s t of March.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So ...[intervenes]  
MS GOODSON:   Although he did interview me.  You are 
absolutely 
correct. 
 
But 
there 
was 
almost 
a 
in 
communication between January and February.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   What was Mr Clive Angel’s position? 
MS GOODSON:   Mr Clive Angel is the person that signed 
my employment contract and my understanding was that he 
was the acting CEO of the Holding Group until Mr Wood 
10 
came onboard. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
MS GOODSON:   So you will notice in my employment 
contract, I am one of the only people that Salim Essa has 
actually signed an employment contract for and Mr Clive 
Angel.  So I was the first ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So ...[intervenes]  
MS GOODSON:   ...employee. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you know Mr Salim Essa? 
MS GOODSON:   Well, he interviewed, if you recall.  I 
20 
mentioned.  And to answer your questions.  Did I escalate 
my concern. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
MS GOODSON:   Okay.  In a roundabout way I was trying 
to 
answer 
you. 
 
I 
did 
to 
escalate 
the 
concern 
to 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 44 of 361 
 
Mr Goldberg, nor did I escalate the concerns to Mr Wood 
because I did not have an operational relationship with 
them.   
 
However, I did escalate the concern to Mr Angel 
on a daily basis.  I communicated it to Mr Sagar.  I 
communicated 
it 
to 
mister 
– 
whatever 
principals 
at 
McKinsey, Mr Lawrence Jinkling(?).  I think, I stand 
correct.  I escalated it to Mr Essa and I escalated it to 
mister...  I must get it right.  Mr Koko.  Or was it 
Mr Matshela?  Mr Koko. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Matshela Koko. 
MS GOODSON:   Mr Koko.  Mr Matshela Koko.  And I 
escalated it to Mr Koko.  So, yes, I – Mr Koko, when he 
was here yesterday, referenced that emotional meeting that 
I had with him.  And, I mean, you can see how – he still 
getting angry now even though this was years ago. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, he was here on Monday. 
MS GOODSON:   Sorry.  Forgive me.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes.  And it was that, I was telling him 
20 
about the acrimonious relationship that we were having at 
McKinsey and was really seeing some way that Trillian 
could get some form or representations on these work 
streams.  We could not get paid for not doing work.   
 
And although we did not have the people to do 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 45 of 361 
 
the work at the time, we had three years to get people in 
work and to get experience.  And we were trying to get 
people in – people in chairs in front of computers, starting 
the 1 s t of April.   
 
And every single time we would put forward any 
kind of views...  Whenever my COO and I put forward any 
kind of views in terms of the delivery approach... where we 
are experts which is Primary Energy specifically, we were 
just dismissed.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  But I have seen in your affidavit 
10 
your reference to individuals or experts taken from India 
and the United Arab Emirates who were used by Trillian to 
provide certain services. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can you go into that? 
MS GOODSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And talk about it?  Because you do say 
that McKinsey was not pleased by that. 
MS GOODSON:   No.  So the Emirate and Indian team 
come from a company called eGateway and...  Although 
20 
also, if you try to Google it, you would not really find much 
about the organisation but what I understood about this 
specific company is that they had a representation or 
footprint in both Dubai and in India and that they were 
experts in coal power stations.  So they fit really good from 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 46 of 361 
 
a technical perspective in the Generation work stream.   
 
After I signed my employment contract and it 
was in December 2015 when Mr Angel started arranging all 
these meetings with McKinsey, the one such meeting was 
with the Generation work stream in which there were 
representatives of both McKinsey and eGateway.   
 
But I would like to mention to the Chair is that I 
did not have any view of bringing eGateway onboard.  I 
was told that they are related to our shareholder and we 
will use them.  That is my – I had.  There was no place to 
10 
meet, debate or discuss things.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   And ...[intervenes]  
MS GOODSON:   So that is all that it was. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And who is the shareholder there, it 
was said there, related to? 
MS GOODSON:   Mr Essa.  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you – who is telling you this? 
MS GOODSON:   Mr Angel. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Angel is telling you eGateway is 
related to Mr Essa. 
20 
MS GOODSON:   Mr Essa has an interested in eGateway.  
The words verbatim. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   That is what Mr Angel told me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you say you were told that 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 47 of 361 
 
because 
you 
did 
not 
have 
a 
view 
about 
engaging 
eGateway.  You were told that they should be engaging. 
MS GOODSON:   They will be our subcontractor.  Verbatim.  
They will be our subcontractor.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  I am interested in why you 
mentioned this.  Is it because they had the – the lacked the 
qualification to do the work required? 
MS GOODSON:   Well...  Can I get there? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, go ahead. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay.  So my first initial engagement with 
10 
the Emirate and the Indian team was in Melrose Arch in 
Integrated Capital’s office.  It was both McKinsey and 
eGateway.  I was introduced to eGateway and as I said to 
Mr Seleka, I was told they will be your subcontractor.  This 
was in December of 2015.   
 
So we have started these engagements.  If you 
just go forward a little bit in time and I now you put 
yourself in this – call it the end of January, the beginning 
of February 2016, these teams have progressed.   
 
McKinsey at the time was happy to have two 
20 
individuals from eGateway on the Generation team because 
they did have the engineering qualifications.  They did 
have the experience.  And so they were at the Medupi 
Power Station making this difference.   
 
The team was quite big.  I think the team had 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 48 of 361 
 
about 
20 
people 
of 
which 
there 
were 
only 
two 
representatives 
of 
Trillian 
and 
those 
Trillian 
representatives 
were 
not 
employees 
but 
rather 
two 
gentlemen of Indian descent or Indian nationality rather.  
Sorry.  Because they literally had to come in and go out...   
 
They were part of the team.  So it was not even 
Trillian.  So in the background I am in Joburg, in Sandton 
and I am having these fights with McKinsey saying we need 
to put people onboard because nobody is learning or 
nobody is getting the skills required.   
10 
 
And McKinsey would say to me but we are happy 
that you have got two people from, you know, on the 
General work stream and I would argue with them saying 
my issue as that that goes against the fact that this needs 
to be a proudly South African business.  We are actually 
not training anybody to get these skills from Trillian’s side.   
 
My second issue was that it is specialist skills.  
If 
you 
are 
trying 
to 
start 
a management 
consulting 
company, you do not want specialist skills unless the 
intention 
is 
to 
specialise 
and 
that 
was 
not 
Trillian 
20 
Management Consulting’s stream.  We wanted to stay in 
general engineering management consultancy.   
 
So the fact that McKinsey would only use or 
utilise specialist skills that were not even South African, I 
found to be a huge contradiction.   
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 49 of 361 
 
 
And then they would argue with me later and 
turn it around... later to say but you are not even 
complying with your requirements because all the people 
that you are putting on the teams, and all the people being 
two, right, are not even South African.   
 
And this came out later.  So this created a lot of 
contention amongst so many other issues that we would 
fight about.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So just to understand this.  You 
mentioning eGateway as a ...[indistinct – audio cut off] ... 
10 
to TMC. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And TMC is a subcontractor to 
McKinsey. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And you are saying TMC was providing 
personnel from eGateway which were not TMC’s own 
employees. 
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was there a subcontract agreement 
20 
between TMC and eGateway? 
MS GOODSON:   At the time in January there was not, 
there was subsequently a subcontractors’ agreement that 
was signed.  I signed it, it was signed between Trillian 
Management Consulting and eGateway and the terms of 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 50 of 361 
 
that agreement in my opinion are completely ludicrous.  
They are ludicrous to the extent that eGateway would get 
775 of everything that Trillian Management Consulting 
would earn on the Generation work stream.   
 
Now to me that was an exorbitant amount of money 
for two people, it meant that their charge out rate per hour 
was something close to like, I do not know, a half a million 
per hour considering how many hours they would have 
worked on at Majuba.  But I signed that agreement with a 
gentleman – I cannot remember his name right now, sorry, 
10 
it 
was 
a 
long 
time 
ago 
but 
I 
am 
sure 
I 
got 
the 
subcontractor's agreement as an annexure, I am sure.  If it 
is not, I will give it to you.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, there is extensive amount of 
annexures there. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But was McKinsey aware that you were 
subcontracting?   
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Were they aware? 
20 
MS GOODSON:   Yes business these gentlemen, for 
example, 
when 
they 
started 
working, 
Majuba 
– 
the 
generation work stream started with Majuba power station 
and it started very, very early in January the entire team 
went to Majuba and worked there, so they were working on 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 51 of 361 
 
site.  So they were staying in the same guesthouse.  These 
individuals made it very clear that they were from India, 
they were not from Trillian, they worked for eGateway, they 
did not have email addresses at the time from Trillian and I 
did not hide it, there was nothing to hide, I was also very 
clear that they subcontracted because that is what I was 
told. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Any other subcontractor Trillian 
used? 
MS 
GOODSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
then 
there 
was 
another 
10 
subcontractor.  The other subcontractor was called Cutting 
Edge Commerce. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And in which work stream did they use 
Cutting Edge? 
MS GOODSON:   That was in the procurement work stream 
and it was on a very similar sort of setup as eGateway, 
there was already an existing relationship it seemed 
because again, shortly after I signed my employment 
contract Mr Angel said to me we will be working with them, 
our shareholder has an interest in the company, I was 
20 
introduced to directors. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    And the shareholder is again Mr Salim 
Essa? 
MS GOODSON:   Mr Essa, ja.  I was introduced to two 
directors of Cutting Edge Commerce, one was Althaf 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 52 of 361 
 
Emmamally and the other was Mr Santosh Choubey and 
they had already been working at Eskom, they were 
established at Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Are these South Africans? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, that is a South African company.  Mr 
Choubey, whenever he would email me, however, his email 
address came from Sahara Computers.  So I suspected a 
link to the Gupta family of business organisations.   
ADV SELEKA SC:    Was there a subcontract agreement 
between TMC and …[intervenes] 
10 
MS GOODSON:   I never – no, I did not find a 
subcontractor’s agreement between TCM and Cutting Edge.  
I never started negotiations with one and I have never 
seen one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   In that period that you were there at 
TMC did Eskom make any payments in regard to the 
services under the envisaged MSA? 
MS GOODSON:   I would not even know.  So at the time I 
would not have known because I asked Mr Angel – again, 
Chairman, if you just keep in mind that my reference frame 
20 
is 
large 
organisations 
like 
Anglo 
American 
and 
I 
understand how those type of organisations work and are 
structured.  I expected as the CEO of the subsidiary TMC 
that I would have sight of the financials of the business, I 
would assume that one of my KPIs would be the financial 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 53 of 361 
 
health of the subsidiary, as is reasonable for a CEO and 
then I asked Mr Angel this and I said a case of when do I 
get access to the bank accounts and when do I get access 
to managing how money is coming in and going out, he 
says no, that will never happen, all the money is going to – 
all the financial aspects of Trillian will be managed 
centrally at the holding company.  So the executive 
management – so all the CEOs and COOs will do nothing 
when it comes to finances and I thought that was very 
bizarre because I wondered then how will you manage my 
10 
performance?  How will you know that I am actually doing 
a good job or not?  You know?  So no, to answer your 
question, during my tenure I had absolutely no idea if any 
amounts had been paid or any – I knew about the one 
invoice being issues, which I am sure we will speak about 
later, but I did not know anything about any money coming 
in, I was concerned at the – it was on the 16 March 2016 
and I remember going to the CFO who was Mr Tebogo 
Lobolo, 
the 
CFO 
of 
the 
holding 
company, 
TCP 
…[intervenes] 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Tebogo Lebalo? 
MS GOODSON:   Excuse me? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is it Tebogo Leballo. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, sorry, Tebogo Leballo. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 54 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:   Yes.  I remember going to him and going 
him because the Regiments team had come on board and I 
knew that suddenly our cost base had increased, now we 
had to pay salaries for quite a few more people then prior 
to them coming on board.  It was only Ben and I, Mr 
Benade and I that we were paying salaries for and I 
remember going to Mr Leballo asking him how are we going 
to pay for things if the MSA is not signed, because if the 
MSA is not signed we are not getting money in and I 
remember even asking Mr Angel and Mr Angel said to me 
10 
that it does not matter because we have shareholder 
capital investments, as you do in a start-up, so it did not 
seem unreasonable but without have sight of how much 
money the shareholder was prepared to put into the 
company, I did not know how long this business would 
actually be able to sustain itself, so I had no sight of any 
money coming into the business during my tenure, Mr 
Seleka.  I have later come to find out when I was working 
with Mr Budlender on his investigations into Trillian, so 
that was in 2017.  I found out for the first time that Trillian 
20 
was in fact paid – I think it was after my departure, though. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  There were payments in August 2016, 
December 2016 and February 2017.   
MS GOODSON:   But I came to know that later. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you had already left by that time. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 55 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:   I beg your pardon? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You had already left. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The date you gave when you make 
enquiries about how are we going to pay the employees 
because the MSA is not yet signed, did you say 16 March 
2016? 
MS GOODSON:   Correct, it was a Wednesday. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What were told about Mr Salim Essa at 
the beginning of your employment at Trillian? 
10 
MS GOODSON:   About the company? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  About him personally, his role, because 
you have been mentioning he is the majority shareholder. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja, what role were you told he is 
going to play in the group? 
MS GOODSON:   Okay.  Mr Salim Essa did not tell me 
much about himself when I met with him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   But I understood Mr Salim Essa’s role 
20 
rather through Mr Angel.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay, tell the Chairperson.,  
MS GOODSON:   Can I explain that?  Okay.  Mr Angel – 
this is really interesting – so I had mentioned, Chair, that 
Mr Angel and I had met a few times before I signed my 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 56 of 361 
 
employment contract and obviously once I had accepted 
the offer we were in a lot more constant contact and then 
Mr Essa – it was before I had committed to joining Trillian 
– I do recall asking Mr Angel how was it possible that 
Trillian could secure work at Eskom?  And the reason why I 
asked that question is because coming from – just having 
experience, a little bit of experience in the management 
consulting side of things, I just know that working within the 
public sector is very difficult, it is very difficult to secure work 
within the public sector and probably more difficult to secure 
10 
work in the public sector if the company does not have a 
history to prove that it has delivered, as such, and that would 
have been Trillian because Trillian was just starting and Mr 
Angel specifically said to me that you need people with 
relationships and our major shareholder, Mr Essa, is one of 
those people with those relationships.  His words to me that 
you need people to open the taps, the phrasing that he used 
and our shareholder can open the taps.  
 
In subsequent conversations – I do not remember the 
exact date, I also remember asking Mr Angel things like what 
20 
is the long term plan of Trillian, was is the intention – because 
Integrated Capital Management spoke of themselves as an 
IPL, an initial public offering.  So typically in this industry if 
people are setting up an IP, oh, you setting up a company to 
list on the stock exchange ultimately so I had asked Mr Angel 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 57 of 361 
 
this, is that the intention with Trillian?  And he replied to me 
and he said he is not sure because Trillian’s lifespan is 
envisaged only for the current dispensation, is what he had 
said to me at the time.  So in my mind, Trillian was only going 
to be working for about three years or that is only the plan for 
three years and after that people would be what is going to 
happen with it later? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, so the current dispensation, you 
understood it to be a period of three years? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes because that was 2016. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   I understood to like a political affiliation 
with our current President and the next election was going 
to happen …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just face the Chairperson, what did 
you understand it? 
MS GOODSON:    I understood that it was like current 
dispensation meaning the political party of the ruling party 
or the President. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Who was the President at the time? 
20 
MS GOODSON:   Mr Jacob Zuma and the next general 
election would have been held at that time, it was either 
2019 or 2020, was going to be the next general election. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, I  would not recall offhand. 
MS GOODSON:   Sorry? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 58 of 361 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I would not recall offhand. 
MS GOODSON:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, there was to be a local government 
election in 2016.  There was a general election in 2014 and 
there was another general election in 2019. 
MS GOODSON:   Ja, so this was said to me in 2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   So the current dispensation would have 
been about three years. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The next election was scheduled for 
10 
2019, as you say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, of course there was going to be an 
internal ANC election in December 2017, the ANC was 
going to be having an elective conference in December 
2017 at which elections would take place for its leaders. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So which one were you talking about? 
MS GOODSON:   I personally understood it to be the 
general election where we could get a new President, I do 
not follow politics, so I did even know about the 2017, but 
20 
my personal understanding when Mr Angel said the current 
dispensation, I assumed the time period from that point to 
be until the next general election.  That is what I 
understood. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 59 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:   So please forgive my naivety in terms of 
politics, I .... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is fine.  Because I think when the 
Eskom board members were appointed in 2014, December 
2014, they were appointed on a three year term.  Ja, I 
know some of them left in 2017.   You do – okay, you were 
told that about Mr Salim Essa. 
MS GOODSON:   Does that answer the question correctly?  
I mean, well appropriately that is all I can tell you, 
10 
unfortunately.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, no, that is alright. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What you know, which is what you were 
told, and then Mr Angel told you about – just repeat the 
words, you said Trillian is what for the dispensation? 
MS GOODSON:   Trillian – because I asked him about the 
future plans. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   Right and he just says what we know is 
20 
that we have got the secured work for the current 
dispensation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, got secured work for current 
dispensation. 
MS GOODSON:   And when you look at the cash flows for 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 60 of 361 
 
the top engineer programme they were for three years. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, can you take the Chairperson to 
that please? 
MS GOODSON:   Oh, okay.  Let me see …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is on page 450. 
MS GOODSON:   Sorry, 415 or 450? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  450, yes. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay, here we go.  Okay …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Of Eskom bundle 14, Chairperson. 
MS GOODSON:   So I have got the table in front of me, I 
10 
will just wait for the Chairman to get it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay.  So Chairman, what you see in the 
table on that page is …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The table is on page 451. 
MS GOODSON:   I am talking about – but I only 
referencing the table now, is that okay? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, I am just placing on record. 
MS GOODSON:   Sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The right page for the table. 
20 
MS GOODSON:   Sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You may proceed. 
MS GOODSON:   The first column of the table you can see 
in the top corner it says Top Engineer, right?  And in that 
entire column it gives you a whole bunch of different work 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 61 of 361 
 
programmes and work streams and I am going to explain 
them to you now shortly.  Okay?  Some of them different 
from what I have spoken about but I am going to put that in 
context here. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Just before you do that – Chair, I see 
we are five minutes into your tea time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us take the tea break, we will 
resume at twenty five to twelve.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn.

INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you, DCJ – sorry, Chairperson.  
Just before we proceed, Chair, I have been able to get the 
assistant 
to 
update 
the 
bundle 
with 
Ms 
Goodson’s 
supplementary affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which is in Eskom bundle 14(B) page 
566.1.  I would just like Ms Mothepu to confirm it so that 
20 
we can admit it as an exhibit.  Ms Goodson, [indistinct – 
dropping voice]  Ms Mothepu. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you get the page number? 
MS GOODSON:   Sorry? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 62 of 361 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 566.1.  She will help you.  Is that 
the one? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you, Mr Seleka, I have got it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ms Goodson, you are also there, page 
566.1? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is an affidavit – well, the line says 
statement but it is on the last page commissioned by a 
Commissioner of Oaths.  
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:    The last page is page 566.5.   
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you there? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And there is a signature there, you 
confirm that to be your signature? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The affidavit is dated 19 February 
2021.  Do you confirm this to be your affidavit? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And confirm the contents thereof. 
MS GOODSON:   Absolutely. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, I beg leave to have it

EXHIBIT U31.2. 
STATEMENT OF BIANCA CHERISE GOODSON TOGETHER 
WITH ANNEXURES HANDED IN AS EXHIBIT U31.2 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you, Chairperson.  Ms Goodson, 
just before the adjournment …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you want me to put this file away for 
now or…? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes please, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.  So we must go back to the 
file we were dealing with before the adjournment.  That is 
EB, Eskom bundle 14.  Ms Goodson, you were about to 
take the Chairperson through the forecast cash flows and 
which is the table on page 451 and I think as you do that, 
please give the Chairperson the context, where does this 
table come from, who gave it you, for what reason and 
what does the table show? 
MS GOODSON:   Okay, Mr Chairman, if you look at the 
20 
table and you look at the first column you will see in the 
top left hand side it says Top Engineer under which it has 
got PMO, GX Design and so forth.  All those in that column 
are difficulty sub-work streams, which I will explain each 
shortly. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 64 of 361 
 
 
And then you have two more columns with numbers 
in them, the first is dated the 17 December 2015 and it is a 
forecast and then there is another, that is the 18 November 
2015, which is a forecast.  Okay?  
 
I would like to just give you the context of where 
those numbers come from.  So the column that talks to 
November, which is the rightmost column, was an email 
that I received from Mr Clive Angel.  Mr Clive Angel had 
forwarded an email to me.  The original email, when you 
look at the thread, the original authors of the email was Mr 
10 
Vikas Sagar and attached to this email was an Excel 
spreadsheet and in the Excel spreadsheet where those 
different work streams, so to say that you see on the left 
hand last column. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said the original author or the 
person from whom the email originated? 
MS GOODSON:   Originated. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   From Mr Sagar. 
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was from McKinsey. 
20 
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay, so Mr Sagar sent the email to Mr 
Angel, Mr Angel then sends the email to me, okay?  There 
is an Excel worksheet in there and I have extracted the 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 65 of 361 
 
numbers from that Excel worksheet into the column on the 
right-hand side. The way that you read the numbers is that 
where the number is positive, so for example you see Top 
Engineer, 341.  That is actually a cost that McKinsey has 
to invest, okay?  Wherever the number is negative, it is 
actually revenue.  So if you go to the bottom and you look 
at total cash flow, the second row from the bottom and you 
look in the column for November 2015 you see that the 
number there is minus 10 311, so that number is actually 
…[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am sorry, let me try and – yes, 
I can see that, ja. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay.  That number is actually millions, so 
that number is actually 10 billion and 300 million.  Okay? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second.  Did you say it 
represented McKinsey’s or Trillian’s cost, the positive one? 
MS GOODSON:   This the positive [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously]3 
CHAIRPERSON:   The cost? 
MS GOODSON:   The combined team that the stream worked, 
20 
so this would be McKinsey and I am assuming also the supply 
development partner, [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS GOODSON:   So that is why, Chairman, you will see in 
the 
Top 
Engineer 
line 
item 
is 
actually 
an 
investment 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 66 of 361 
 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just hang one second.  Yes, okay, you can 
continue, ja. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay.  So before I start explaining what this 
table represents, would you mind if I take you through what the 
different work streams are on the left hand side? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, yes. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay.  So the Top Engineer in the context3 
of this table is that you first described it to me, when you were 
asking the clarifying question about engineers.  So the Top 
10 
Engineer there talks to McKinsey’s investment or McKinsey 
and its partners investment into Eskom employees to make 
them top engineers and that investment in both scenarios, the 
December forecast, as well as the November forecast as an 
investment of 341 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why – is there any significance to the 
fact that the earlier month, namely November 2015, is put 
at the end and the later month, namely December 2015, is 
put before?  Is it an accounting thing or what? 
MS GOODSON:   The reason why I did that, Mr Chairman, 
20 
is because I wanted to show you the one first that was 
most prevailing so the one that was the last and most 
significant one that I have seen as actually the middle 
column, so it could – there is not any …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Made any significance, okay, alright.  
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 67 of 361 
 
MS 
GOODSON: 
 
 
In 
that 
[inaudible 
– 
speaking 
simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Okay, continue. 
MS GOODSON:   So obviously I assume that December 
supersedes November in terms of the forecast and you will 
see that those numbers are slightly different by a billion.  
But the Top Engineer program was an investment from 
McKinsey’s and its partner side into Eskom and that is why 
it is a positive number, okay, because they have got to 
expend the money. 
10 
 
The next line is PMO and what that stands for a 
project management office, so it is an overhead of the 
entire structure that has to oversee this entire programme, 
so again that is not revenue generation, it is actually and 
expense and that is why you see McKinsey forecasting 
expense as being 320 million.  Okay? 
 
The next two lines that you see is GX design and 
scale and then GX rollout.  Okay?  Those two together 
make the generation work stream that I spoke to you about 
earlier that forms part of the Top Engineer ’s MSA.  So 
20 
those two together are generation. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So GX stands for generation? 
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see they described above the table. 
MS GOODSON:   Correct.  Okay?  So what this table tells 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 68 of 361 
 
you is that in December the authors of this spreadsheet 
which was McKinsey anticipated at least R3 billion as 
revenue from the generation work streams together. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the two figures added together? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, so if you take the 1537 and you add 
it to 1537, I am rounding it and I am calling it 3 billion but 
it is a little bit more than 3 billion, okay?  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   And you see that that number stays more 
or less the same in November as well. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay?  If we go to the next line item 
which is procurement, I explained the procurement work 
stream to you earlier and McKinsey had envisaged that it 
and its partners would accrue a revenue of 1.6 billion for 
procurement.   
CHAIRPERSON:   What were they talking about when they 
were saying they would make that kind of money under 
procurement?  Did they mean that that is the tenders that 
they would get from Eskom? 
20 
MS GOODSON:   No, the way that this contract was 
structured was that McKinsey and its partners would only 
ever get paid – it was referred to as an at risk contract.  
So when you looked at the draft versions of this MSA, you 
know, in all the contracts you always get an amount, what 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 69 of 361 
 
is it going to cost you to get the service.  The amount of 
this 
specific 
contract 
was 
always 
zero 
because 
the 
explanation was that Eskom would never spend money on 
the consultants, the consultants would only get paid out of 
the savings that they realise. 
 
So the way you read this, under the procurement for 
example is that McKinsey had anticipated that out of all the 
savings that they would have got for Eskom, they would be 
deserving of or they would accrue 1.6 billion of that saving 
as fees.  That is how you read it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS GOODSON:   Well, this entire table. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS GOODSON:   PED is Primary Energy and I explained 
that that was one of the work streams in Top Engineers and 
for Primary Energy McKinsey and its partners had planned 
to get 1.6 billion in revenue.   
 
And then finally you have claims and I mention it 
here and that in that instance McKinsey felt that they could 
earn 710 million.  So I have explained to you now the four 
20 
work streams that I told you I understood a part of the Top 
Engineers.  I have explained Generation, I have explained 
procurement, I have explained Primary Energy and I have 
explains claims.  So when I looked at this worksheet, those 
are the only ones that I knew constituted this Top 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 70 of 361 
 
Engineers programme, okay? 
 
However, McKinsey clearly were planning other 
work that I did not know about, okay?  And now they start 
looking at the lines that start by new build.  I have no idea 
what that is but clearly McKinsey at some point in 
November thought that they would get 1.5 billion for that.  
There was financing and funding, I do not know anything 
about that.  There was the corporate plan, I did not know 
anything about that, there was fixed finance strategy, I did 
not know anything about that and then clearly they were 
10 
planning to do something with nuclear power with 300 
million. 
 
When you add all of those up and you take away the 
expenses, you are looking at the net cash flow line which 
shows you that the net cash flow from McKinsey and as 
partners would have been – I am rounding it up, would 
have been roughly R10 billion that they accrue through all 
this work and that was the plan and this work – and it is 
part my annexures, it is cash flowed, so you can actually 
see it as a sequence of time and you can see that this 
20 
money would be accrued over three years starting 1 
January 2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So what are these, projections? 
MS GOODSON:   Projections forecast, yes.  And I recall 
when I mentioned earlier that when I was having difficulties 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 71 of 361 
 
with my relationship with McKinsey, I had escalated the 
concerns to Mr Essa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes? 
MS GOODSON:   And I recall Mr Essa saying to me who do 
these guys think they are, we will replace them because I 
am getting my 5 billion.  Now the 5 billion is 50% 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, just repeat that sentence? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay, I mentioned earlier …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You recalled something, that is what I 
want to hear. 
MS GOODSON:   You recall that I mentioned that I 
escalated the acrimonious relationship with McKinsey to a 
few people, one of them being Mr Essa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that acrimonious relationship, I want 
to ask you earlier, was between yourself and McKinsey or 
with TMC or Trillian with McKinsey? 
MS GOODSON:   Well, I was TMC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so …[intervenes] 
20 
MS GOODSON:    We had no other employees. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so but you – what you mean it was 
not personal? 
MS GOODSON:   No, no, no, it was business, it was just 
…[intervenes] 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 72 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
It 
is 
just 
because 
of 
who 
you 
represented? 
MS GOODSON:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS GOODSON:   It was completely professional. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS GOODSON:   And I mentioned earlier that I escalated 
that acrimony to Mr Essa and in that meeting with Mr Essa 
Mr Essa says well, if McKinsey do not play ball we will 
replace them, I still want my 5 billion.  Now 5 billion 
10 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   They would replace them and…? 
MS GOODSON:   I still want my 5 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS GOODSON:   The 5 billion is half of the 10 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is half of the 10 billion. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, not that is fine.  But just go back to 
table 1 forecasted close, that table, did you say was based 
on the email you received from Mr Angel who had received it 
20 
from Mr… 
MS GOODSON:   Sagar. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS GOODSON:   Mr Sagar from McKinsey. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sagar, yes, okay. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 73 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:   That is November and on the 17 December 
I received an update and that is …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so you received two? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright but do you by any chance 
still have the document that you received? 
MS GOODSON:   Ja,. Part of my …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes?  Is it here by any chance? 
MS GOODSON:   H’m, part of annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  No, that is fine but these are 
10 
the figures. 
MS GOODSON:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   These figures you took from that 
document. 
MS GOODSON:   And if for some reason it is not attached 
just let me know I will give it to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, okay.  Okay, so do you have 
any understanding as to why revenue was reflected under 
negative? 
MS GOODSON:   No, it is so uncommon because usually 
20 
your revenue is positive and your expenses are negative, 
but it’s very uncommon …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja or was it way of hiding what it 
represented? 
MS GOODSON:   Chair, you are asking me to speculate. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 74 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t know.  Ja, no, no, if you do 
not know, you do not know but it is –ja, okay, you may 
continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Ms Goodson, I am reminded of Ms 
Mothepu’s evidence about an email that came from her, 
that came from Mr Eric Wood, Eric Wood to her, with also a 
table of cash flow projections.  I am wondering whether 
could this be – are you aware of that exchange between 
the two of them? 
MS GOODSON:   No and I followed Ms Mothepu’s evidence 
10 
in the parliamentary enquiry and here so closely that it is 
actually – no, it is the first time that you are mentioning it 
to me, but I would gladly take a look. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    No, she mentioned it here, when she 
was here. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay.  I do not know, I have never 
conducted and exercise to compare if they are the same or 
different, but I mean, I will happily do it if you want me to. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, that is fine, you will get the 
reference to that. 
20 
MS GOODSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   When do you say you received that 
email that came from Mr Eric – was it Mr Eric Wood? 
MS GOODSON:   Angel. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  From Mr Angel.  So it came from Mr 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 75 of 361 
 
Sagar, to Angel, Mr Angel then forwarded it to you. 
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  When was that? 
MS GOODSON:   The dates are shown on the top of the 
column.  The first – sorry, the second one was the 17 
December and then the first one was on the 18 November. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, those are the dates when you 
received the information. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, I see.  So you created this table 
10 
yourself. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, I did, because they were not in 
exactly the same format but for the sake of this affidavit 
…[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, okay, but the information obviously 
come from that email which was sent to you? 
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Then you left too soon before this 
money could be made. 
MS GOODSON:   Absolutely.  I thought this – I mean, this 
20 
was so ambitious. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You thought what? 
MS GOODSON:   This is so ambitious, this can be the GDP 
of a small country.  I did not think that this was actually 
achievable in three years. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 76 of 361 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
MS GOODSON:   I have never seen cash flows like this 
and remember, I come from mining, right, Anglo American 
has huge cash flows, this was for consulting, this was 
shocking, to say the least. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What was the reason why the 
information  was sent to you? 
MS GOODSON:   I do not even know why.  I think Mr Angel 
just sent it to me.  I do not even think I requested it 
because I did not know it existed.  So Mr Sagar sent it to M 
10 
Angel.  Mr Angel would very often do that, he would 
literally just quick forward without giving me explanations 
or comment and he would just send me things and I think 
that was the case with these as well.  If I recall correctly, 
there was not even any text in the email, it was just 
forwarded to me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What did you do with it? 
MS GOODSON:   I looked at it and I thought it was 
ridiculous, I do not know of any starter company – when I 
put my Trillian hat on and I do not think about McKinsey 
20 
because I know McKinsey because I know McKinsey earns 
a lot more money than start-up companies.  As a start-up 
company, Trillian making this kind of money in three years 
is bewildering, right?   
CHAIRPERSON:   So the focus was over three years? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 77 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay and at that time Trillian was a few 
months old. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes and Trillian only had me employed at 
this time on these dates, and I knew that I cannot do work 
for 10 – for 5 billion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well, you had not even officially started 
your employment. 
MS GOODSON:   I was still working for Anglo American on 
10 
these days. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  Could it be that this was used –
well, now looking at the timing of it, it was used to entice 
you to come into the company? 
MS GOODSON:   No because this was only shared with me 
after I signed …[intervenes] 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
After 
[inaudible 
– 
speaking 
simultaneously] 
MS GOODSON:   I think he reminded me that I sign my 
employment contract a day before the 17 t h. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On the 17 t h, I see. 
MS GOODSON:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you said you received this email 
which had these figures when? 
MS GOODSON:   The one was on the 18 November and the 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 78 of 361 
 
other one was on the 17 December. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, on the – those dates, on those 
columns, are the dates of receipt. 
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of the email. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes and if I remember correctly it is even 
the date of the Excel spreadsheet that is attached to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  They are not the dates when the 
forecast was made by whoever made the forecast. 
MS GOODSON:   I assumed both are true.  It is the date 
10 
that I received and it is the forecast was made, I believe 
both are true. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
So 
these 
are 
two 
companies 
exchanging information about cash flow projections in 
respect of work that they are busy negotiating together at 
Eskom or is it work or some of it, Top Engineers, you said 
they had already started in December? 
MS GOODSON:   That is the thing, McKinsey looked as 
though they had started working.  Just to come to your first 
20 
question you say that we were negotiating this together, 
Trillian was not part of these negotiations at all, right, so 
McKinsey was negotiating this and that is why I was the 
recipient of the information not concluded as – or not 
included 
as 
somebody 
to 
add 
or 
supplement 
the 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 79 of 361 
 
information.  I was just giving it.  Right, so all the work 
that was happening in the background I really got the 
impression that it was specifically between Eskom and 
McKinsey and Trillian as the SD partner was just informed, 
sort of like baggage on the side. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you know about Regiments? 
MS GOODSON:   I knew that Regiments had existed 
because when I met Mr Eric Wood and Mr Bobat in my 
interview …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Just face to the Chairperson. 
10 
MS GOODSON:   Sorry, forgive me, sorry.  I knew that 
Regiments existed and I knew that Mr Wood was going to 
be leaving in March the following year.  I did not know 
anything else about Regiments at the time.  Again, you 
know, you Google and you read the website but I have 
never ever heard of them before that one time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I am asking specifically in this 
period, November 2015, December 2015.  Did you know 
that there was a company called Regiments in existence? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes I did because Mr Eric Wood and Mr 
20 
Bobat had interviewed me in about November before I 
signed my contract and that was my first introduction or 
ever mentioned of the words Regiments.  That is all that I 
knew of them. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Can you – you were interviewed by Mr 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 80 of 361 
 
Eric Wood and Mr Mohammed Bobat, did you say it was in 
October? 
MS GOODSON:   The initial conversation started around 
about September/October and I think the interview was 
also probably in about October.  Could have been. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You have explained what Mr Eric 
Wood’s position was, Mr Clive Angel’s position was but 
what was the position of Mr Mohammed Bobat? 
MS GOODSON:   This is interesting, there is some 
information  that I found out in Ms Mothepu’s evidence to 
10 
you, Chair.  But also what Ms Mothepu said to you, I was 
also told by Mr Angel, right?  So what I was told, Clive had 
told me that I would be meeting Mr Wood at this interview.  
He did not tell me prior that I would be meeting Mr Bobat.  
So I was a bit surprised that when I walked into the room 
there were two gentlemen there.   
So after having this interview with them I asked 
Clive who was Mr Bobat and why did he have to interview 
me and Mr Angel said to me the reason why Mr Bobat 
interviewed you is because he would have taken the job, 
20 
so he was originally earmarked for the CEO of TMC.  And if 
I recall correctly, Ms Mothepu mentioned the same in her 
evidence and that is what she had heard from the 
Regiments side, right?   
So then I asked Mr Angel – I was like okay, so then 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 81 of 361 
 
why is he not taking it?  Why are you guys looking at me?  
And Mr Angel said because he has got a better opportunity. 
. And, you know, when people have said that to me, I have 
got a better opportunity , it is almost implies that you are 
leaving the company or the organisation and you are going 
somewhere else.  So I assumed that and that maybe he 
was leaving on decent terms and he just wanted to make 
sure that he was leaving, Eric got somebody that he 
trusted and that is why he was seeing me in the interview, 
that is what I assumed.   
10 
But on the 8 December 2015, Mr Angel called me 
and Mr Angel said to me do you remember I told you that 
Mr Bobat has got better things?  I said yes?  He says have 
you seen the headlines?  Like I think it – yes, it could be 
the 9 December and I saw the headlines and the headlines 
were that Mr Bobat was joining Mr van Rooyen at Treasury 
and had received promotion and Mr Angel said to me, see 
our boss, who is Mr Essa – not encourages – that was not 
the word, he promotes loyalty. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He what? 
20 
MS GOODSON:   Promotes loyalty. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He promotes loyalty. 
MS GOODSON:   So the way that I interpreter that was that 
Mr Bobat must have been quite loyal in some way to my 
boss, which was Mr Essa, and for that he became a special 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 82 of 361 
 
adviser to Mr van Rooyen when Mr Rooyen went to 
Treasury but I was – Mr Angel did explicitly tell me that Mr 
Bobat was actually supposed to have my job, that was the 
original plan. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And the date you gave, is it 9 
December 20…[intervenes] 
MS GOODSON:   It is the 8 t h or the 9 t h, it is one of those 
two, it is in my affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, but 2015? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   What did you say the headlines were 
saying? 
MS GOODSON:   That is when the news broke that Mr van 
Rooyen would be the new Finance Minister, and the 
headlines, the headlines very shortly after that was – no I 
think Mr Angel told me that he was coming but the 
headlines shortly after that was about Mr van Rooyen’s 
advisors and that he came with Mr Whitley.  It was 
something along those lines Chairman, I stand to be 
corrected on the exact dates but I do know Mr Angel told 
20 
me that Mr Bobat was with Mr Van Rooyen at Treasury.   
And I think the media picked up on the advisors 
possibly a little bit later I do not remember exactly the 
date, this was four years ago, five years now.  I am sure it 
is in my affidavit.  
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 83 of 361 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja, no that is fine.  You say the 8 t h or 
the 9 t h of December 2015.  You were explaining that, you 
thought when they say his what, his getting a better 
position. 
MS GOODSON:   Promoted, yeah well, I am sorry, what I 
meant, what I said verbatim was that his got better options, 
his got a better opportunity. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja, but you thought that he would be 
leaving the company. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Why did you say you thought is it 
because he still remained at TMC? 
MS GOODSON:   No, because usually, that is what you 
would say, like when I resigned from Anglo for example, 
and people would ask but why is Bianca resigning.  My 
manager would say, she has got a better opportunity, 
implying that I am moving, moving somewhere else.  
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, for greener pastures. 
MS GOODSON:   So to say.  
ADV SELEKA SC:    When Ms Mosilo was here, she 
20 
testified about the appointment of Mr Bobat as the special 
adviser to Minister Van Rooyen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you referring to Ms Mothepu? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ms Mothepu. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it is just that the record will, 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 84 of 361 
 
whoever reads the record will think it is somebody else 
because I think you mentioned a name rather than a 
surname I think. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Oh, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or did I misunderstand.  Ja, so 
somebody who is reading the transcript will think you are 
talking about somebody else and they would say, who is 
this now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ms Mothepu testified about this 
appointment but she also said there was a purpose behind 
it at one point.  Now, I am not going to tell you that 
purpose. Did you know of any purpose behind Mr Bobat’s 
appointment as a special adviser to the Minister? 
MS GOODSON:   At the time, what I knew or what I know 
now? 
MS GOODSON:   At the time, it was mentioned to me I am 
just trying, I am just trying to make sure that I get the date 
correctly, the year.  No, not in Treasury, once Mr Bobat had 
20 
moved to COGTA, Mr Angel was very explicit that we would 
be getting opportunities there, but not in the time with 
Treasury. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Okay. 
MS GOODSON:   No, which was only a few days, but the 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 85 of 361 
 
following year when I started, so in January 2016 there 
was 
a 
lot 
of 
movements 
and 
Trillian 
Management 
Consulting was invited to present to Minister Van Rooyen 
for example, and Mr Bobat facilitated that.  So, there was 
quite a bit of connection, but please forgive me I did not 
plan on discussing that here knowing that this is the Eskom 
work stream but I am happy to discuss it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, no I have seen it in your 
affidavit. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:    It is already there.  
MS GOODSON:   Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:    So you have no chance, unfortunately. 
Okay, you have talked about the events of December 2015, 
the appointment of Minister Van Rooyen as the Minister of 
Finance.  Mr Bobat gets to be appointed as a special 
advisor to him but that gets to be short-lived.   
Now you are in 2016 and you are taking us to their 
move from Treasury to COGTA, is that right?  
MS GOODSON:   Yes.  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Then tell the Chairperson about this 
meeting you are talking about and who arranges the 
meeting? 
MS GOODSON:   Okay, can I go into quite a bit of detail 
about this? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 86 of 361 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Well, let us see.  
MS GOODSON:   Okay, again, Chairman, please forgive me 
for not getting the exact dates, but I know that in my 
affidavit, they are very explicit and they are supported by 
meeting request and emails.  
It was sometime in January, and I refer to it in my 
affidavit as a road show being tongue and cheek. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    I can help you with the page number. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Page 457, four, five, seven, I see you 
10 
have dates there. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    The first week in January 2016, 8 
January 2016. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, correct.  On the 8 t h of January, Chair 
I get a call from Mr Wood.  Now Mr Wood is still at 
Regiment, I had just started working actually like that week 
because it was first day so to say and Mr Wood asked me 
to come through to the Regiments offices and he - and I 
go, I was quite compliant.  And when I get to the 
20 
Regiment's offices, he introduces me to two directors from 
a company called Oliver Wyman and specifically these 
directors are directors of Oliver Wyman but not Oliver 
Wyman South Africa, Oliver Wyman Dubai and Mr Woods 
says to me, we going on a road show, and I said okay, you 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 87 of 361 
 
know, so what do we need to do? 
So there is only four of us in that meeting, it is 
myself, Mr Wood and these two directors from Oliver 
Wyman and, and that night, that evening, Mr Wood had 
arranged for us to have dinner at Wombles in Parkers or 
Parktown North or something with Mr Gary Peter, in his 
capacity as the as the CFO of Transnet at the time. 
We have dinner and that was quite a surprise for 
me, I did not quite expect it and we have dinner at 
Wombles, and the discussion over dinner is with the Oliver 
10 
Wyman directors was, is there opportunity for Oliver 
Wyman to work at Transnet where Trillian would be the 
supply development partner.  So the dinner concluded, the 
next day…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but cannot conclude like that, what 
is the response? 
MS GOODSON:   Oh, no I was just going to tell you 
everything that I was going to tell you but the road show 
was like really cool. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now you took us to the dinner table, tell 
20 
us what was being discussed, you say they posed the 
question, are there business opportunities for us at 
Transnet and then you do not tell us what the response 
from Mr Gary Peter was. 
MS GOODSON:   Sorry, because the point I am trying to 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 88 of 361 
 
make is more about the road show but absolutely, I will tell 
you what Mr Gary Peter said, Mr Gary Peter said that he 
assumed that there were opportunities within Transnet 
engineering and, and I do not recall the rest of the details 
of that night. 
This was a long time ago and it is not one of those 
meetings where you take notes, it’s a dinner but Mr Peter 
replied in the affirmative.  I think that is what you are 
looking for, and the next morning the road show continued 
and Mr Wood asked me to collect…[intervene] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now this road show was that a 
programme in terms of which you were going to meet with 
potential clients?  What is the connection between a road 
show and what you were doing? 
MS GOODSON:   It is what I call it now after the events.  I 
was quite in the dark, I did not anticipate the dinner with 
Mr Gary Peter until I got the meeting invite from Mr Woods 
PA and then I just got the meeting invite that we are 
meeting Mr Singh the next day and in that same afternoon, 
we were meeting the Minister.  I woke up in the morning 
20 
expecting a normal day just going to the office, Chair so in 
hindsight when I wrote the affidavit I referred to it as a 
road show, but…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you gave it the term road show. 
MS GOODSON:   I gave it the term road show. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 89 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, but why did you give the term road 
show? 
MS GOODSON:   Because in two days we met really 
interesting people, we met the CFO of Transnet, the CFO 
of Eskom, and the Minister of COGTA in a space of two 
days. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright, okay. 
MS GOODSON:   And all that we doing we taking these 
directors around to meet all these influential people and I 
felt like a glorified driver.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why did you feel like that? 
MS GOODSON:   Because, so, sorry can I go again, 
chronologically now?  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ja. 
MS GOODSON:   So it is the morning after the dinner, Mr 
Wood asked me to collect the Oliver Wyman directors from 
their hotel, and this maybe too much information, but I 
distinctly remember how embarrassing this was because 
the hotel was next to my daughter's school and my 
daughter had thrown up in the car.  So now you have got 
20 
these directors of this company, in your car, you got to 
drive to Megawatt Park from Saxon from sort of the Saxon 
world, Sandton area and your car like, you know, it is very 
uncomfortable to be inside of it and you are on your way to 
go meet the CFO of Eskom.  You know, I just remember 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 90 of 361 
 
feeling so embarrassed and I just met these gentlemen the 
day before, I did not know what to talk to them about, I did 
not know what to tell them about Trillian. 
Trillian for all intents and purposes was only eight 
days old you know, I mean, what was I expected to say and 
do for a company that that is so huge and has a global trail 
like Oliver Wyman.  Anyway, you know people say fake it 
till you make it, so I tried to put on a smile, I try to act 
professional, I try to come across as though I knew what I 
was doing and I went to these meetings. 
10 
And in that morning, we met the two Oliver Wyman 
directors and myself, met Mr Wood at Megawatt Park and 
we were escorted to the executive wing in a boardroom 
where we were introduced to Mr Anoj Singh and it was very 
similar to the dinner.  Mr Wood introduced who everybody 
was and the directors from Oliver Wyman were very 
forthcoming saying that we would like to work with Eskom, 
we think Eskom has got great opportunities, and these are 
the things that they are thinking could help Eskom, and 
they proposed two work streams.  
20 
The one was a change management, a change 
management type of management consulting support, and 
the other one was associated with the nuclear program and 
Mr Singh was very much in the affirmative, very much like 
Mr Peter and Mr Singh was saying, okay fine get me a 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 91 of 361 
 
proposal, send it to me, let us see what happens after this. 
So the meetings were very short, they were very 
introductory, so at most they were like 45 minutes.  You 
know, 
there 
was 
no 
planned 
agenda, 
there 
was 
no 
presentations, there was nothing like that.  Later on that 
afternoon, Mr Wood had arranged a meeting with Mr Van 
Rooyen, so in between those two meetings we had that 
introduced. 
So the directors of Oliver Wyman and myself went 
to the Regiments offices and while we were there we were 
10 
communicating with Mr Bobat and Mr Bobat was telling us 
things like, of what how do you refer to it?  Sort of like the 
proceedings. like do not speak to the Minister first, the 
Minister must sit down first, you know, just the general sort 
of this is how you refer to a Minister and so forth, things 
that I did not really know so I appreciated getting 
feedback.  
Mr Bobat then sent me an email telling me that I 
have got to put together a business, like a business 
prospectus or business profile for Trillian it knocked me off 
20 
my feet, because this company was only in black, as I said, 
nine days old, and now I have got to put together this 
business proposal.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So to say you were the only employee. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, this was like a shock for me, right.  
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 92 of 361 
 
So we sitting in this boardroom with the Oliver Wyman 
directors, it is easy for them to come up with a business 
profile, because they have got all these marketing teams to 
help them, they have got these amazing slides and 
presentations.   
Here I am starting for the first time trying to put 
something together in any way, the long the short, we 
eventually go to the Minister in Pretoria.  So we go and 
meet the Minister. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    At COGTA. 
10 
MS GOODSON:   Of COGTA so Mr Van Rooyen, Minister 
Van Rooyen and at that time, he was the Minister of 
COGTA. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
At 
that 
stage, 
what 
was 
your 
understanding of the purpose Why you needed to meet the 
minister, or the scope? 
MS GOODSON:   Based on the dinner the previous night 
and in the meeting with Mr Singh in the morning, it became 
very clear to me that this was the road shows a good name 
to actually give this experience because it was introducing 
20 
these entities of the South African people to the Oliver 
Wyman directors as Trillian being the facilitator trying to 
get work, that was very obvious to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is what was obvious to you.  
Did nobody ever say what the purpose was? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 93 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:   No, Mr Wood would just introduce us and 
it was as though we were expected.  Mr Peter, and Mr 
Singh, for example, did not look surprised, like oh my 
gosh, you were not in my diary, who are you, why we 
meeting there was no sense of that at all.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
MS GOODSON:   So we met the Minister and we presented 
our…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who was the Minister with? 
MS GOODSON:   Mr Whitley and Mr Bobat. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, was the DG not there? 
MS GOODSON:   No, no it was it the four of us, the us 
being myself, Mr Wood and the two Oliver Wyman directors 
sitting on the one side, and on the other side is Mr Whitley 
and Mr Bobat and Mr Van Rooyen, that is all that was in 
the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Obviously, of course, Mr Bobat was well 
known to you. 
MS GOODSON:   I had met him before, not well known I 
had met him before. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean, ja, was well known to Trillian. 
MS GOODSON:   I never met Mr Whitley before. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you say you had never? 
MS GOODSON:   Never met him before that is the first time 
that I ever met Mr Whitley. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 94 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright, continue. 
MS GOODSON:   And what…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Sorry can you spell that name? 
MS GOODSON:   Whitley? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja. 
MS GOODSON:   W-h-i-t-e-l-e-y.  
ADV SELEKA SC:    Okay, so he…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so he was one of the two persons 
who were appointed to - one was chief of staff for Minister 
Van Rooyen when he was appointed as Minister of Finance, 
10 
and the other was an advisor, I keep on forgetting which 
one was which, was what. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Okay, the special advisor is 
Mohammed Bobat. 
MS GOODSON:   Mohammed Bobat and Mr Whitley. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   I see my affidavit; I spell it W-h-i-t-l-e-y. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    On that same page? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, if you look at paragraph 60 in my 
affidavit. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Paragraph? 
MS GOODSON:   Paragraph 60, six zero, of my affidavit on 
page 457. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   I spelt Whitley. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 95 of 361 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, I see that yes. 
MS GOODSON:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, continue so the Minister the 
meeting starts and then what happens? 
MS GOODSON:   We present our presentation.  So the 
Oliver Wyman directors had their own business profile 
presentation, and then I had - I must be honest with you 
Chair a really embarrassing presentation, because I only 
had a few hours to put it together.  I did not even know 
what this company was going to do. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you did not need much time. 
MS GOODSON:   I did not have time, I did not even have 
employees, I cannot even say what we good at because we 
did not even…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You put it as if you are complaining that 
you were not given enough time, you did not need enough 
time. 
MS GOODSON:   Apparently, apparently. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You could have put it together with your 
eyes closed. 
20 
MS GOODSON:   But that is the thing and I think that is the 
point I am trying to make to you is that as much as I would 
be in my professional career, if I had gotten fired for that 
piece of work, I would not even – I would believe my 
employer was justified.  But when we left that meeting, we 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 96 of 361 
 
received so much praise and subsequent to these meetings 
or subsequent to these road shows…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:    You mean on the basis of the 
presentation you made, you received so much praise? 
MS GOODSON:   100% and like I said, it is probably one of 
the poorest pieces of work that I have ever made. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    So who was praising you, Mr 
Mohammed Bobat? 
MS GOODSON:   No, Mr Van Rooyen. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    The Minister? 
10 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, do not leave the meeting as yet. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The presentation of the other people 
that you were with, what was its gist, were they just telling 
the Minister, what they do as a company and how good 
they were, and the track record they had…[intervene] 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But aimed at getting what kind of work 
as you understood it? 
20 
MS GOODSON:   The Minister told us what kind of work we 
could propose for. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS GOODSON:   So the Minister told us what kind of work 
we could propose for. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 97 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MS GOODSON:   So, the Minister suggested that we look 
at the back to basics program and look at optimising that 
and also, Mr Eric Wood was there so he was talking about 
some sort of debt structures, some financial instruments 
that are beyond me, and so this back to basics program 
and then there was also getting ready for the elections.  
The Minister proposed that we put forward proposals on 
those bases. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did the Minister not speak after they 
10 
had made their presentations? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, the presentation was exactly as you 
described, it is very generic in general, basically saying 
this is who we are, this is what we have done, this is what 
our record is.  I presented something, that was a little bit 
more, this is what we hope to become and then the 
Minister says, well, he thinks that there's opportunities in 
these areas. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How many employees did you say, 
Trillian has? 
20 
MS GOODSON:   As on that day, it was me and my COO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did you say how many? 
MS GOODSON:   No, I could not because I would be lying, 
I got the temptation if you follow my annexures it is so 
embarrassing. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 98 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say make what experience you 
had as a company? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, but I am talking about - the only 
thing I could put in there was my personal experience.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS GOODSON:   So I was basically putting my CV in there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright Mr Seleka.  Okay, so 
you are in this meeting the Minister make suggestions of 
what areas or what kind of work could be you could look at 
and make proposals about and then what happens after 
10 
that at the meeting? 
MS GOODSON:   And then we leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MS GOODSON:   We leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS GOODSON:   I think there was there was some sort of 
discussions between them but this was so long ago I do 
not know all the specifics, but what I do know that 
happened subsequent to that meeting, or subsequent to 
the road show if the case, I could rather do that.  
20 
The Oliver Wyman directors went back to Dubai and 
as soon as they got back home, so it was probably the next 
day they had started emailing me to start arranging that we 
move on these opportunities, right.  Eric had instructed me 
to get to arrange another meeting with Mr Peter. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 99 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is Mr Wood. 
MS GOODSON:   Mr - forgive me, Mr. Wood, had instructed 
me to arrange a meeting with Mr Peter, which I reached out 
and I sent him an email, but I never got a response.  
However, Mr Bobat had emailed me or he had sent 
something but he gave me a copy of the back to basics 
program, so that at least we had some basis to start 
compiling a proposal for COGTA. 
And the Oliver Wyman directors had sent through to 
me a proposal on the nuclear program and they were 
10 
already discussing the change management stuff. So my 
relationship with Oliver Wyman directors remained for my 
entire tenure, an entire tenure being three months and we 
were working on these proposals, two for Eskom, and one 
for COGTA. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Did you ever receive any messages 
from Mr Bobat by way of envelopes? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, I received a few messages from Mr 
Bobat. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    How many? 
20 
MS GOODSON:   What I have listed in my affidavit is what 
I - remember I wrote this a long time ago straight after I 
left. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   So I believe my affidavit more. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 100 of 361 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:    No I thought you mentioned the 
number. 
MS GOODSON:   No a few. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Oh, a few. 
MS GOODSON:   The one was really, really funny. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You talking about text messages, 
WhatsApp messages? 
MS GOODSON:   No, I am going to explain now, the one 
was really funny. It was a Gmail…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry hang on, are you talking 
10 
about text messages, WhatsApp messages, telephone 
messages, or some letters. 
MS GOODSON:   I am going to - the one was an email and 
the one was an envelope.  So I am going to explain. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ja so it is not SMS’s or WhatsApp 
messages? 
MS GOODSON:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MS GOODSON:   So the one was an email to my Gmail 
account, my personal Gmail account, from a person by the 
20 
name of Mika[?] Peroz as in Spanish, P-e-r-o-z, and then I 
get it, and I am like, I thought it is spam, right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry just repeat that? 
MS GOODSON:   I thought it was spam, you know how you 
get junk mail but I got a phone call from Mr Bobat saying 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 101 of 361 
 
did you get my email?  And I said, what email?  He says, it 
is the one some Peroz, and I was like, oh, is that from 
you? And I do not recall what was in that specific email but 
I still have the email, so you can take a look at it.  But that 
is the one way that he communicated with me, which was 
bizarre, 
completely 
unexpected. 
 
The 
other 
was…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:    But before you move to the other, 
what does he say in that one? 
MS GOODSON:   I cannot remember. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, before you go to the other one, 
complete your conversation with him when he called you to 
ask whether you received his email. 
MS GOODSON:   That is all that I remember, I just want to 
check in my affidavit under the Mohammed Bobat section if 
I actually mentioned it there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    That is on – well you have him 
discussed on page 441, paragraph 34. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay, no I do not mention it here.  Chair, 
I…[intervene] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry whereabouts in this affidavit 
are you now Mr Seleka?  The last time I knew we were at 
page 451.  
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, Chair.  We are now really talking 
about the position of Mr Bobat, she talks about him on 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 102 of 361 
 
page 441. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we have gone back. 
MS GOODSON:   We do not have to go there because I see 
in my affidavit that I have not mentioned this Mika[?] Peroz 
but I have got the email.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, if you are talking about what is the 
we need to go there, okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    No, she is explaining that she did not 
mention the email in the affidavit, but she has the email. 
MS GOODSON:   And I can give it to you. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja. 
MS GOODSON:   If it would be easier.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry; it is important that we get 
things as they happened.  Did you say that in the 
telephone conversation when he called that is Mr Bobat to 
ask you whether you received his message or his email or 
that happened was that you asked him to confirm if that 
was from him and he said yes, and that was the end of the 
conversation? 
MS GOODSON:   That was the end of it, it was very brief 
20 
and I do not remember the contents of that email.  I think 
the contents of the email was him giving me his private 
phone number, I do not remember the details of it, but I am 
happy to share that email with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you – ja that is what I - you have got 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 103 of 361 
 
the email? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, I still have it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is it in the bundle Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    No, it is not in the bundle, Chair. 
MS GOODSON:   No I will share it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, how come you did not give it to us? 
MS GOODSON:   Because I did not think - I sometimes 
question 
what 
is 
important 
and 
what 
will 
help 
you 
and…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but simply from what you are telling 
10 
me on the face of it, it looks like he was hiding his identity, 
that he was the person from whom the message was, the 
email was coming.  
MS GOODSON:   Yes, absolutely.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And, obviously, with what you knew, at 
the time you wrote this, you signed this affidavit, you would 
that that would be important. 
MS GOODSON:   This affidavit to a large extent was 
actually structured for the parliamentary inquiry and I trust, 
and I have really tried - my version of history has not 
20 
changed and there was a few changes that I made, that I 
had to correct for this submission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well it was deposed in September 2020, 
I guess what you may be meaning is that it was structured 
along the lines of whatever other affidavit you may have 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 104 of 361 
 
made, but it was done in 2020 and by then surely, you 
knew that there will be some importance in attached to him 
not putting his name to that email. 
MS GOODSON:   I am happy to submit a supplementary 
affidavit if I have to, and certainly will share all the 
information that I have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Thank you, Chair.  I asked that 
question, because we heard Ms Mothepu talk about you 
receiving an envelope…[intervene] 
10 
MS GOODSON:   I am getting there still. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja, so that is why I asked that 
question. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, is there anything, is there any other 
documents that you have or text message or WhatsApp 
message that you have not given it to the legal team or 
told them about that is important based on what you know, 
now? 
MS GOODSON:   I really question my understanding of 
20 
what is important, what I can tell you I have is that I have 
got a folder with quite a lot of hardcopy things that I 
received during my tenure there at Trillian and I originally 
gave it for safekeeping to my attorney, and I am happy to 
give that folder to the Commission in case you find 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 105 of 361 
 
something in there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS GOODSON:   And I have not looked at it in four years, 
but I still have that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think you must do that give them 
copies of what you have. 
MS GOODSON:   But it is an entirely large file, you can 
take the whole file I do not need it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine, no, you might need it some 
other times so I think the Commission can make copies and 
10 
then give you back the original. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay, one thing that is in that file is the 
second message from Mr Bobat.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MS GOODSON:   And that was one morning I come to 
work…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So but let me also get, so the email that 
Mr Bobat had sent you under a name you did not – under a 
Spanish name, I think you said was simply that he was 
giving you a number, and he said that is the number you 
20 
must use to contact him or to communicate with him or 
what? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, that is what I recall Chair but 
because I have not looked at the email in such a long time, 
I am under oath, I would rather just give it to you as I say 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 106 of 361 
 
later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is fine. 
MS GOODSON:   I have not looked at it in such a long 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So no that is fine, then you can go to the 
other message. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay.  So that is the first message as I 
explained, the second message is one day I come to work 
and on my desk is a white envelope, a white A4 envelope 
but one of those thick ones, you know, can you print a pack 
10 
of paper so it is a big envelope and it has got my name on 
it and I was I was quite early at work.  So there were not a 
lot of people I think I was one of the first people at work 
that morning.  I was very surprised about where did this 
envelope come from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You saying you were the first were you 
not alone, were you not the only one? 
MS GOODSON:   No, true story, no I was the only one for 
TMC, but remember that Mark Pamensky was there for 
properties, for example, right but I was the only one and I 
20 
get this envelope…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And this is around about what January, 
February, March? 
MS GOODSON:  I do not put a date in here.  I suspect it was 
March because the person who… 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 107 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  2015. 
MS GOODSON:  2016 just before my resignation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2016 ja. 
MS GOODSON:  Just before my resignation.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  No Chair she is on page 458. 
MS GOODSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Sorry.  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  There – there one such envelope is 
mentioned paragraph 66. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so just go back to how you came to 
– to work – you were the first one and what happened? 
MS GOODSON:  And I see this envelope on my desk with my 
name on.  
CHAIRPERSON:  A big envelope? 
MS GOODSON:  A big envelope – a big A4 white. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS GOODSON:  Big white envelope. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS GOODSON:  The contents of that envelope are in this 
20 
file that I will give to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS GOODSON:  But it is basically – it is a copy of – of a 
tender something about the back to basics thing as well. I 
did not – it was a lot of paperwork and I did not go through 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 108 of 361 
 
all of it and then I… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But that – that would have rang a bell 
because it was proposed by Minister Van Rooyen. 
MS GOODSON:  One hundred percent but I did not go 
through the details of it I was so busy with other work as 
well.  I compiling this proposal at the time was not my 
priority.  I had other things to do but I get a phone call from 
Mr – Mr Bobat saying did you get my delivery? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You get a what? 
MS GOODSON:  Did you get my delivery? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it the same day that you got the email 
from him? 
MS GOODSON:  No, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  These are different days? 
MS GOODSON:  Different days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How far apart were the two? 
MS GOODSON:  It cannot be more three months because I 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no.  I mean is – was it in March as 
well when you got the email or was it January? 
20 
MS GOODSON:  I cannot – it could have been February. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
MS GOODSON:  It could have been February. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But we will see from the email because you 
have got it. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 109 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:  Yes and I will give it to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  So he phones you on the morning 
when you found – you find this envelope on your desk.  Was 
it on your desk? 
MS GOODSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He phones you before you open it or after 
you have opened it? 
MS GOODSON:  Before I even opened it and he says did you 
get my delivery? 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what did you say? 
10 
MS GOODSON:  And I said yes is this from you?  He says 
yes it is for you it should help you put together the proposal.  
So I was confused. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now, now how did you know it was the 
envelope that you were seeing on your desk which you had 
not opened was from him? 
MS GOODSON:  Because as soon as I did open it you could 
see the Department of CoGTA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS GOODSON:  And he – he was at CoGTA.  I knew no one 
20 
else at CoGTA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS GOODSON:  So there was no logical reason for anybody 
else giving me this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 110 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:  At all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  The envelope was it written your 
name or addressed to you? 
MS GOODSON:  It just had my name written on it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It had your name – in handwriting? 
MS GOODSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Do you know whether it was his 
handwriting? 
MS GOODSON:  I have no idea. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know. 
10 
MS GOODSON:  I have no idea. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the documents inside did they have 
any handwriting or signature? 
MS GOODSON:  I did not look. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not look. 
MS GOODSON:  Chair but I will give you everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
MS GOODSON:  But I do not recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was no letter addressed to you 
inside? 
20 
MS GOODSON:  No there was no – nothing formal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There were just documents.  Ja.  Okay 
alright.   
MS GOODSON:  If Mr Bobat did not phone me and explain 
that envelope to me I would have thought it was trash 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 111 of 361 
 
because I would not have had the context.  There was 
nothing explaining why this has got my name on it.  I would 
have probably just thrown it away. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So CoGTA of course is the Department of 
Cooperative Governance and Traditional Leaders and this 
was you say March 2016 and you say this – the documents 
appeared to be connected with back to basic – the back to 
basic program and 2016 was the year when there were going 
to be local government elections.  No, no I am saying.  Ja I 
am not asking you.  Ja that is the year when there were 
10 
going to be local government elections in – I do not know 
whether they were in May or August but – okay alright.  So – 
so you received this – he calls you and apart from asking 
you to confirm whether you received his delivery what else 
did you talk about in that telephone conversation? 
MS GOODSON:  Nothing he just said this should help you 
put together the proposal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS GOODSON:  And that was the end of the call. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Prior to that had there been a 
20 
discussion that you would put together a proposal? 
MS GOODSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Within Trillian? 
MS GOODSON:  At the meeting with the Minister with Oliver 
Wyman directors. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 112 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS GOODSON:  The Minister said these are the areas that 
you could propose in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no I remember that but I am just 
thinking – the Minister could say – could have said whatever 
and – but you would make – Trillian could make a decision 
what to do and what not to do. 
MS GOODSON:  No in between the meeting with the Minister 
and receiving this envelope from Mr Bobat there were a few 
communications between myself and Oliver Wyman but there 
10 
were 
no 
communications 
between 
myself 
and 
the 
Department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  You may continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes so Mr Bobat phones you and 
explains to you the contents of the envelope.  I see there is 
– did you prepare the proposal? 
MS GOODSON:  The proposal was being drafted – so by the 
time I resigned on the 19t h of March there were a few 
proposals that were being drafted between Trillian and Oliver 
Wyman. By the time I had resigned though there were 
20 
nothing – there was nothing submitted.  Everything was still 
in a – being worked on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Hm. 
MS GOODSON:  And there are strings of emails that you can 
see in terms of that communication with these proposals.  I 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 113 of 361 
 
could not possibly reference all of them here but as you 
know I have got a copy of my computer from Trillian and I am 
happy to give that copy of the computer to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja no you should do that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So the string of emails is it between you 
and Mr Bobat? 
MS GOODSON:  No between myself and the Oliver Wyman 
directors about the 00:06:33 at CoGTA. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS GOODSON:  And at Eskom 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
I 
am 
sorry 
the 
emails 
involve 
correspondence between or among who and who? 
MS GOODSON:  Myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS GOODSON:  And the Oliver Wyman directors. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS GOODSON:  For the opportunities at both Eskom and 
CoGTA. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  As far as you can recall would those 
emails or anyone of them reflect a discussion that would say 
whether these documents came from Mr Bobat? 
MS GOODSON:  Not that I recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nothing like that. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 114 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:  Mr Bobat did not – from what I understand 
Mr Bobat did not communicate with the Oliver Wyman 
directors it was more like I was that channel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see in paragraph 67 of your affidavit on 
that page 458 you write: 
“In 
addition 
I 
would 
receive 
timeline 
expectations and valuable budget information 
from Bobat – Mr Bobat to ensure that the 
proposal was receiving – was being – well 
10 
was received favourably.” 
MS GOODSON:  Correct.  So Annexure U that I reference 
here is an email thread I think that is between myself and Mr 
Bobat. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see.   
MS GOODSON:  If I remember this correctly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS GOODSON:  That is what it is.  So you have that but if I 
give you a copy of my computer you will have that as well 
anyway. 
20 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
So 
this 
communication 
timeline 
expectations and available budget information Mr Bobat is 
sending that to you by email? 
MS GOODSON:  If I recall correctly I think so.  I think what I 
have done if I remember correctly I think we had a structure 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 115 of 361 
 
of a proposal and I sent to him and he commented on it and 
he sent the comments back and in those comments was this 
information.  If I remember correctly.  So yes to answer your 
question it was by email. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And at 60 – paragraph 68 you say: 
“I realised that securing the work at CoGTA had nothing to 
do with TMC’s history nor lack of employees to do the work.” 
What did it have to do with? 
MS GOODSON:  That – I guess that is mainly slightly 
speculative because by the time I left there was not 
10 
necessarily work secured at CoGTA but all indications were 
that it – if we had submitted a proposal when it was in a final 
state there was no indications that it would not be met with 
favourably.  So I – I cannot answer your question directly I 
can just tell you this from what I know Trillian was just really 
lucky so that even if you do not have employees and you do 
not even have work history you can still go and work in a 
Ministry like CoGTA.  I know that when I try and sell my 
services as a person I have to demonstrate previous 
achievements and Trillian did not have that and yet the 
20 
progression of his proposals has so much momentum.  In 
none of the feedback that you received was negative to 
suggest that you did not have a shot. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  My recollection of Ms Mothepu’s 
evidence was that prior to Mr Bobat being appointed as the 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 116 of 361 
 
Special Advisor to Minister Van Rooyen a group of them or 
the officials of Regiments as it was becoming – or moving 
away to become Trillian out of it by Mr Eric Wood they were 
told that Mr Bobat will be placed in that office of the Minister 
to ensure that work comes to Trillian.  Did – did you – what  
was your observation of the situation? 
MS GOODSON:  So I – I eluded to something like this earlier 
and I told you that when Mr Bobat was at Treasury Mr Angel 
did not say anything to me.  However when Mr Bobat had 
moved to CoGTA and I spoke to Mr Angel numerous times in 
10 
one day so I cannot tell you the time and the date because 
we literally spoke numerous times on one day every day with 
the exception of Saturday.  And in one of the phone calls I 
did ask Mr Angel why do we need Mr Bobat?  Why can we 
not just do what other people do reply to an 00:11:32 you 
know do what normal companies do to get work.  And Mr 
Bobat did say that he is positioned there to open the taps for 
us.  Sorry Mr Angel said that Mr Bobat is positioned there to 
open the taps and create opportunities for Trillian.  But I 
must appreciate that Trillian does not have people and it 
20 
does not have a history and we can only ever do this work if 
we partner with Global organisations such as McKinsey and 
Oliver Wyman.  So Mr Angel did explicitly say that to me but 
not when Mr Bobat was at Treasury but rather when he was 
at CoGTA. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 117 of 361 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  You – well you reference instances 
where you would interview candidates I think for Trillian – for 
TMC and that you would do so with Mr Bobat.  Now my 
question is and if he is now an employee of the state what 
did he have to do with Trillian or TMC? 
MS GOODSON:  No.  No.  So – can I – would you mind if I 
correct this? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, no please do so. 
MS GOODSON:  My statement slightly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
10 
MS GOODSON:  My understanding was that before Mr Bobat 
moved he was in fact looking after the Management 
Consulting area of Regiments.  So hence had he not moved 
he would have taken my job at Trillian right.  So he knew the 
people that would be transitioning to Trillian and he had a 
few if I may call them sort of favourites so to say.  
 
During my relationship with McKinsey I was aware of 
the people that would be coming.  So it was not a surprise 
for me on the 1 s t of March there was a list that I received 
from the HR Director of Regiments saying that these are the 
20 
people that would be transitioning and in around about 
February I was working with McKinsey to try and – to be 
ahead of the curve and be proactive and try and already get 
placements for these people on the Eskom work right.  And 
McKinsey would not take these people.  They kept on saying 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 118 of 361 
 
that some of these people were incompetent; they have 
worked with them before at Transnet they do not want to 
work with them again.  And I was stuck because I had no 
working history with these individuals that would be coming 
over.  So I did reach out to Mr Bobat.  I think I first reached 
out to the HR lady at Regiments and she suggested or 
recommended that I reach out to Mr Bobat to get a view from 
him.   
 
And Bobat would get involved in those types of – he 
would give me that feedback but there was one specific 
10 
example that I think it worth noting.   
 
There was a gentleman and I do not recall his 
surname that was promised a promotion when he moved to 
Trillian.  This specific gentleman I tried to place him in the 
projects of McKinsey and every single partner at McKinsey 
refused to work with him.  They sent me performance 
reviews of this gentleman; they wanted him nowhere. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He is a South African gentleman? 
MS GOODSON:  Yes I think it was Mr Masego – Mr Maseko 
with a k.  And I – I then compiled the organogram for what 
20 
Trillian would  look like and I did not promote this gentleman 
because everybody came to Trillian on the levels that they 
were at Regiments. 
 
And this gentleman was so upset that he phoned him 
– he was very clear with me saying to me I was promised a 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 119 of 361 
 
promotion by – we called Mr Bobat Mo so I am just saying 
verbatim to you – Mo promised me a promotion.  I said yes 
but I am not Mo.  I am Bianca.  I need to see 00:15:23 before 
I can promote you Trillian Management Consulting is my 
company it is not Mo’s.  He was so furious at me he phoned 
Mo – Mr Bobat and Mr Bobat phoned me to say how dare I 
not do it.  
 
So Mr Bobat was – although he did not work for 
Trillian he sometimes felt that he knew more about Trillian 
than I even knew about it.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh he did not work for Trillian – for TMC? 
MS GOODSON:  Not that – I certainly did not employ any 
contracts – sign any employment contracts with him.  Mr 
Bobat was not one of my employees. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And would you know whether he was on 
TMC’s payroll? 
MS GOODSON:  Did I know that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you know – would you have known? 
MS GOODSON:  No because I could not see the finances 
20 
because remember the finances were handled centrally. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS GOODSON:  And the CEO’s were not allowed to see this.  
I knew all the employees that came from Regiments I have 
got all those details and who would be coming into my team 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 120 of 361 
 
and Mr Bobat was not on that list. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Do you know about the bonus payment 
that was made to him? 
MS GOODSON:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You do not know.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Could he have been your boss without you 
knowing? 
MS GOODSON:  Yes I know.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes let us – let us deal now with TMC’s 
10 
relationship with Eskom.  Unless you have – I mean if we 
can move there unless if you have anything else to add to 
what we have done? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will that start with the – with the part of 
the road show as you called it that involved the CFO of 
Eskom? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The reason why I am asking it is because 
you said the road show was going to involve meeting the 
CFO of Transnet, the Minister of CoGTA and the CFO of 
20 
Eskom and you have told me about the two but not about 
meeting the CFO of Eskom as far as I recall. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am expecting you to complete the 
road show. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 121 of 361 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Yes I think as we go into your 
relations with Eskom we need to touch on that. 
MS GOODSON:  Okay.  Can I – you will lead me there? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. Chair we are two minutes away from 
lunch time.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay maybe let us take the lunch 
break so when we come back then she can tell us about 
Trillian and Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will adjourn and we will resume at two.  
10 
We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.  Ms Goodson, 
just before we adjourned we were about to go into TMC’s 
relationship with Eskom.  And as we do that, please 
explain which officials of Eskom do you remember meeting 
with, in what context and what gets to be discussed.  Let 
20 
us start with the one we mentioned in the morning which 
was Mr Anoj Singh. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  And the road show you mentioned.  
I mean, you can start wherever.  
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 122 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:   Okay.  I have already explained that I met 
Mr Anoj Singh in what I call the road show for the very first 
time.  I have not met Mr Singh prior to that.  The next 
interaction that I had with Mr Singh must have been – and I 
stand to be corrected again on the time – it was sometime 
in February of 2016 and ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can I...  Sorry.  Sorry to interrupt you. 
MS GOODSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think it will be important also to tell 
us who introduces to them and how do you meet with 
10 
them? 
MS GOODSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because it will not be out of nowhere. 
MS GOODSON:   Ja. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Ja. 
 
There 
must 
be 
some 
arrangements.  Who arranges these meetings? 
MS GOODSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MS GOODSON:   So with Mr Singh.  I met Mr Singh for the 
first time, as I mentioned, during the road show and 
20 
Mr Wood introduced me to Mr Singh as the new CEO of 
Trillian Management Consulting.  And the introduction was 
very cordial:  Nice to meet you.  Good luck in your 
position.  And so forth.   
 
In that specific meeting with our level 1 and 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 123 of 361 
 
directors I did not speak at all because I had nothing to 
say.  So in that first interaction with Mr Singh I cannot tell 
you anything else about it except for what I have told you 
already. 
 
The next time that I met with Mr Singh was a 
Steering Committee meeting.  I stand to be corrected but I 
think it was sometime in February 2016.  The Steering 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   In what meeting? 
MS GOODSON:   The Steering Committee meeting. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MS GOODSON:   And the Steering Committee meeting was 
compelled for the Top Engineers Programme.  So in that 
meeting were quite a few senior managers and some 
executives from Eskom.  McKinsey was represented, quite 
a few people and then Trillian was represented by myself, 
Ms Matshepo.  In one case it was Mr Wood.  And there was 
a few.   
 
So, and in during my tenure at Trillian I think I 
attended at most three Steering Committee meetings for 
20 
the Top Engineer Programme.  And at one specific meeting, 
I do recall that Mr Singh was chairing that meeting.  And it 
was very early on in the programme, that is why I seem to 
recall being in February.   
 
And I recall that McKinsey had presented the – 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 124 of 361 
 
had prepared the deck with all the different clients.  And 
there was one specific slide that came up that basically 
showed the believes from the contractor ’s perspective of 
the different work streams.  So that is four that I have 
mentioned five.   
 
And it was quite funny because the Trillian 
representative for each of the work streams, the name put 
down on that presentation was me.   
 
And Mr Singh stopped at that slide and he 
looked around the room and he says:  Are you guys crazy?  
10 
You come here with – and referring to McKinsey – you 
come here with a team of a hundred and Bianca must be 
the one person on all these things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  With a team of hundred 
and...? 
MS GOODSON:   A hundred people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and then what? 
MS GOODSON:   And then Bianca must be the one person 
from Trillian on all these things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
20 
MS GOODSON:   So Mr Singh was challenging McKinsey, 
saying where is your supply development demonstration, 
so to say.  Prior to this, however, I had an interaction with 
Mr Matshela, Mr Koko and told him about the actual 
...[intervenes]  
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 125 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, just to confirm.  You are 
referring to you when he said Bianca? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS GOODSON:   Correct.  Prior to this specific Steering 
Committee I had already met with Mr Matshela Koko and 
had vented the acrimony in the relationship between 
Trillian and McKinsey.   
 
So I understood that Mr Singh had gotten wind of 
this acrimony somehow but in my mind I thought it was 
10 
from Mr Koko, Mr Matshela Koko.  When Mr Singh stopped 
the Steering Committee meeting at that point, he was 
saying that really there has something broken down 
between McKinsey and Trillian and we need to sort it out.  
I cannot be the only person representing the supplying 
development partner moving forward.   
 
So he put quite a lot of pressure on McKinsey at 
that point to start becoming a lot more inclusive of Trillian.  
I recall very much that were one of the very few times in 
my tenure at Trillian, I actually felt supported.  I was a bit 
20 
surprised because I did not vent my concerns to Mr Singh 
directly.   
 
So I am sitting in this meeting, going through the 
agenda feeling as an outcast already because that was the 
relationship with McKinsey but Mr Singh stands up in my 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 126 of 361 
 
defence and really put his foot down to the extent that 
McKinsey starts acting on it the next day.   
 
That 
is 
the 
extent 
of 
my 
relationship 
with 
Mr Singh.  I obviously saw him in passing sometimes 
during Megawatt Park but we never really communicated 
otherwise.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which other official?  Well, you have 
mentioned Mr Koko.  You ...[intervenes]  
MS GOODSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...relate ...[intervenes]  
10 
MS GOODSON:   ...Mr Koko? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, please. 
MS GOODSON:   Again, it was sometime obviously early in 
the year and I do not remember the date but I know that in 
my affidavit I have got the dates exactly correct.  Mister 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry.  Sorry, Ms Goodson.  I am so 
sorry.  When Mr Singh raised that concern, was it ever 
addressed by McKinsey? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes.  Seemingly so. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja ...[intervenes]  
MS GOODSON:   Can I explain that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can you...  Yes, please explain to the 
Chairperson. 
MS GOODSON:   Seemingly so, right.  So McKinsey, 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 127 of 361 
 
Mr Sagar called me and said:  Look, Bianca.  We really do 
– we really are invested in developing Trillian.  Sincerely 
we are.  To the extent that we want you, myself, to build an 
international profile.   
 
And I remember looking at Mr Sagar...  Well, 
sorry, I was on the phone.  So I did not look at him but I 
remember shaking my head and saying to him:  Dude, I 
have got a young child.  I do not want to travel.  I have 
travelled already.  You try and say that we are inclusive.  
Make us do the work.  Do not promise me jet setting here 
10 
and there.  Get us involved in the work.   
 
And Mr Sagar said fine and then I started 
working with Mr Lawrence Jinkling who was or a partner, a 
principal 
at 
McKinsey, 
working 
on 
the 
KPI’s 
where 
McKinsey could demonstrate tangible the inclusion of us as 
an SDL partner and I was driving that process in terms of 
what those KPI’s should be. 
 
And the intention at that time is that we would 
present this work at the next Steering Committee meeting.  
So they did sort of come to the party a little bit but nothing 
20 
actually formally actioned from it.  They just spoke about 
their intention. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  But, I mean, they were told that 
they are a hundred and you are one.  They are a hundred 
from McKinsey, you are one from TMC.  Did you increase 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 128 of 361 
 
your numbers? 
MS GOODSON:   We did, obviously, get some people on 
the 1 s t of March when the Regiment contingent came over 
to Trillian and we were actively trying to recruit but the 
recruitment process takes a while because it takes about a 
month to interview someone and then that person has to go 
through the resignation period.   
 
So the – so we never really increased our 
numbers dramatically.  I think we formally employed three 
of four people at most while we were still there and the 
10 
rest of the team of... came from Regiments.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the contract is not yet signed? 
MS GOODSON:   The contract ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You have not signed ...[intervenes]  
MS GOODSON:   At the time I had resigned what I knew 
and believed at the time was that the MSA was never 
signed.  That is what I believed.  I could be wrong but I 
have never seen a signed copy while I was at Trillian.  And 
the subcontractor ’s agreement with McKinsey was never 
signed either. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It was never signed.  Did you know of 
McKinsey’s decision not to have Trillian – I do not which 
Trillian,  TMC as their supply development partner? 
MS GOODSON:   I only found out about that, I think it was 
through the public, because – I mean, keep in mind that I 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 129 of 361 
 
resigned on the 19 t h of March and after that I cut off 
contact with – I stopped doing – I did not have to work 
through a resignation period because I was only there for 
three months.  So I know that they were concerned about 
the relationship and McKinsey did express their concern 
about 
the 
shareholding 
of 
Trillian, 
even 
to 
me 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is ...[intervenes]  
MS GOODSON:   ...during the tenure but I did not know of 
the decision to terminate while I was there. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  You are going to the next official 
but let me pursue this point because McKinsey had raised 
being really concerned... concerns about TMC’s BEE 
status. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you know that? 
MS GOODSON:   No, Mr Sagar, Mr Wise and also 
Mr Jinkling of McKinsey very often asked me what was the 
shareholding of Trillian. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
MS GOODSON:   And I always looked at, especially to 
Mr Sagar, in complete shock because I have met him at a 
meeting with Mr Essa and I was, like, but you know 
Mr Essa owns 60% of this.  What else do you want now?  
The minority shareholders?   
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 130 of 361 
 
 
And he is, like:  No, we need to know who your 
major shareholder is.  And I kept on – I just found it bizarre 
because you know that somebody is asking a question that 
they know the answer to.  So what were they looking for, 
you know?   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, but I thought I came across a 
reference in your affidavit...  Ja, on page 448.  Eskom 
Bundle -14(A). 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 448, paragraph 51.4, 51.5.  Do 
10 
you see that? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, that is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Can you read that? 
MS GOODSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Please read that. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay.  So 51.4. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
“My COO engaged with the few of the experts 
brought out from India to find that they were 
20 
brought onboard shortly before arriving in 
South Africa, did not have the required permits 
to work in South African and were not paid on 
time. 
Not all the representatives of eGateway had 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 131 of 361 
 
company branded information, for example, 
emails, business cards, et cetera.” 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MS GOODSON:   15.5: 
“All individuals that I have met from the 
organisation were either Indian of Emirate, not 
South African. 
This caused contention with McKinsey as the 
leadership team, question team and the South 
African BEE partner.” 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   So there were two questions on BEE.  
The one is the shareholder. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   The majority shareholder.  And then the 
other was obviously the representation on teams.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   They expected the people that we put on 
teams to be reflective of the South African demographic 
but the people that we had on teams at this point, like I 
20 
mentioned, were from eGateway, were either Emirate or 
Indian nationals. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MS GOODSON:   And McKinsey, as much as they said that 
they wanted the technical expertise were also pushing 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 132 of 361 
 
back on us and saying but they are not South African.  How 
can you mortgage yourself as a proudly BEE South African 
company?  That was the context of this. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Did they not make specific 
requests to TMC in regard to the BEE status? 
MS GOODSON:   To me specifically when...  Like I said, 
when Mr Weiss and Mr Sagar raised concerns with me 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   ...they raised the concerns on the BEE 
10 
ownership. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay. 
MS GOODSON:   The partners and the individuals that 
were slightly more operational ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   ...in the management meetings would 
push back to me at the BEE representations of the teams 
doing the work. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m, h’m. 
MS GOODSON:   So those are the two elements of BEE 
20 
compliance.  The one is ownership and the one was the 
representation.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  So I know you gave us a 
response that you were surprised why they are asking 
because they knew Mr Salim Essa was the majority 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 133 of 361 
 
shareholder.  But what was your response to them? 
MS GOODSON:   So my formal response...  So this is 
interesting.  Is that Mr Sagar and Mr Weiss would ask me 
this when we had meetings. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   They would ask me to my face. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  The reason I am asking.  I think I 
came across an averment in doctor...  Is it Dr Weiss? 
MS GOODSON:   Dr Weiss, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, in Dr Weiss’ affidavit.  He was with 
10 
McKinsey, is it not? 
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  That you provided them 
information on BEE or that you said TMC is BEE compliant.  
You have any recollection of that? 
MS GOODSON:   I do not recall that for a few reasons.  
The one is.  I never ever applied for a BEE certificate for 
TMC.  I think one was sent to me from Mr Mark Chipkin 
who was a director at Integrated Capital.   
 
There were a few emails where they were asking 
20 
me about the ownership structure and then I would speak 
to Mr Angel and I would say to Mr Angel:  What must I give 
them that they do not know?   
 
And Mr Angel had a very basic organogram that 
showed the ownership structures which was not in a lot of 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 134 of 361 
 
detail.  It was very, very high level.   
 
So for example, it would just say 60% black 
owned, 40% owned by other.  You know, it was not in a lot 
of detail and Mr Angel would say:  Just send this to me.  
So I am not sure if they are referring to that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that what you gave them? 
MS GOODSON:   If I recall correctly.  I think so. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  What was your response to 
them?  You were about to...[intervenes]  
MS GOODSON:   My response to them would have been – 
10 
verbally my response to them would be:  But Vikas , it is 
Salim. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Say again? 
MS GOODSON:   I would say to Vikas:  But Vikas, you 
know it is Salim.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
MS GOODSON:   You know in terms ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you look this side so that I can 
hear? 
MS GOODSON:   Forgive me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS GOODSON:   I would...  When Mr Sagar would ask me:  
Who is this...  Please can you tell us who the major 
shareholder is?  I would reply to him and I am going to say 
this to you verbatim so it is informal.  I would say:  Vikas, 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 135 of 361 
 
you know it is Salim.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is Mr Salim Essa? 
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  H’m.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  Okay.  And what would he 
...[intervenes]  
MS GOODSON:   He would then reply and he would say:  
Okay but we need it in writing.  And I thought – would say:  
Okay cool, I will give it to you.  You know.  And when we 
needed to, I would raise the concerns of Clive again.   
10 
 
And I would be like:  Clive, why are they asking 
me this when they know?  And Clive would say:  But...  
Everyone calls me B.  Clive would say:  B, just send them 
the thing that I sent you.  Which was the very high level 
organogram structure without any detail in it and I would 
sent that.   
 
So it confused me why Clive – why there would 
be KG(?) with things that are very well-known between 
them.  And I know this because I was at a meeting with 
Salim, with Mr Sagar ... with Mr Essa and Mr Sagar and 
20 
with Mr Angel.  So we all knew this but for some reason 
putting it in paper seemed to be a weird thing. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja. 
MS GOODSON:   I do not understand.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did ...[intervenes]  
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 136 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:   And I could not give that detail because I 
did not know the other shareholders.  I knew about the 
60% because of this – I was told by Mr Essa.  I did – and I 
knew the 25% was Mr Wood but I did not know the other 
15%.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did that not concern you? 
MS GOODSON:   I thought it was very bizarre because 
when I asked the question to the person who was my 
leader, who was Mr Angel, I would get this weird response.  
I did not question him more.  I probably should have.  But I 
10 
thought it was bizarre.  Is bizarre the same as concern?  It 
could – it is.  I think it is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, maybe not.  [laughs]  I think it is 
an concern.  It does not sit well with you.  If it is bizarre, it 
may just be strange.   
MS GOODSON:   Ja, but I ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...against their ...[intervenes]  
MS GOODSON:   No, no.  Then it is concern.  It did not sit 
well with me.  It did not make sense. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  So you are in TMC which is 
20 
supposed to be a supply development partner to McKinsey, 
a BEE partner to McKinsey.  McKinsey is asking these 
questions and the questions seem to be directed to you or 
if not all of them but some of them.  And my question is.  
Did that not concern you?  That is my question. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 137 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:   It did concern me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Did you do anything about it? 
MS GOODSON:   Apart from bringing it up with Clive.  No, I 
did not act on it further.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  Okay let us go to the next 
official.  The next official which I think you were about to 
tell us about is Mr Koko. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   How you came to know him, to be 
introduced to him and under what circumstances you met 
10 
with him? 
MS GOODSON:   Mr Seleka, would you mind helping me 
with the page number of that section in my affidavit? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is at page 439.  Four, three, nine.  If 
that is what you want. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, correct...  Chair, I just was referring 
to my affidavit because I have got the dates in my affidavit 
more correctly than I remember them right now.   
 
On the 10 t h of February, I met Mr Koko for the 
first time.  The meeting was arranged by one of the PA’s of 
20 
Integrated Capital.  She contacted Mr Koko’s PA directly 
and the agreement was... 
 
Sorry.  Am I talking about...  Yes, the agreement 
was that I would meet Mr Koko, I think it was after..  No, 
sorry.  I am getting confused. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 138 of 361 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You can read the paragraph. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  32.1. 
MS GOODSON:   32.1: 
“Essa arranged for me to meet Mr Koko on the 
10 t h of February 2016 at two o’clock to discuss 
issues that I was encountering with McKinsey.  
And my working relationship with the McKinsey 
partners have become strain and I felt that 
Trillian Management Consulting was not being 
10 
included in the decision making in relation to 
the Eskom programme.   
At 
that 
time, 
I 
did 
not 
understand 
the 
resistance on the part of McKinsey to include 
TMC in decision making...” 
 
I am sorry.  I am going to skip to 32.3: 
“The meeting was arranged by Mr Samey-
Shane’s executive assistant and once the 
meeting was confirmed I was instructed by 
Angel on behalf of Essa to convey a message 
20 
to Mr Koko, articulating Trillian’s request for 
invoices...” 
 
So one of the things that I do not mention in 
here but I want to fully disclose every single interaction 
that I have had with Mr Koko.  The very first time I met with 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 139 of 361 
 
Mr Koko I was actually instructed by Mr Angel to go and 
attend a press conference at Megawatt Park. 
 
And I obviously had no questions because I am 
not part of the press.  So I just sat in the audience.  And 
the instruction that I got from Mr Angel was that when the 
press conference is finished I should go up to Mr Koko and 
I should introduce myself as the new TMC CEO which I did.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   When was this? 
MS GOODSON:   This was before this meeting.  So it must 
have been sometime either towards the end of January or 
10 
very 
early 
February. 
 
But 
nothing 
substantial 
was 
discussed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m 
MS GOODSON:   I literally introduced myself to Mr Koko 
as...  Sorry, my surname was Smith then.  Bianca Smith.  
The I am the CEO of TMC and I would like to meet you 
because I believe that we will be working together.   
 
Mr Koko was very gentlemanlike and he said:  It 
is nice to meet you.  I have heard about you.  Please will 
you make arrangements to come and see me sometime?  
20 
And that was the end of it.   
 
The next meeting that I had with Mr Koko is this 
meeting that is described in my affidavit.  And this meeting 
was, as I mentioned here, it was at two o’clock on the 
10 t h of February.  I went to this meeting with a specific 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 140 of 361 
 
agenda in mind.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m. 
MS GOODSON:   Right.  It was structured.  I called to the 
meeting.  It was arranged by ICM(?) and when I got to 
Megawatt Park, Mr Koko was expecting me.  As Mr Koko 
had testified what he – instead of meeting in his office...   
 
The way that the Megawatt Park executive wing 
is structured is, it is in the centre of the wing of – like were 
couches.  So slightly informal.  We sat in the centre of the 
wing.  And Mr Koko invited Mr Mabelane to join us.   
10 
 
So that was the very first time that I met 
Mr Mabelane.  And then Mr Koko asked me:  So what do 
you – why do you want the meeting?  How are things 
going?  He also asked me a little bit about myself, my 
history. 
 
So I told him I came from the mining sector and 
so forth.  He specifically wanted to know what was my 
involvement in Primary Energy and before I could answer 
him, I decided to take him to what my agenda points were.  
And the first agenda point that I had to discuss with him 
20 
was the acrimony between Trillian and McKinsey.   
 
And I had detailed and had examples of all the 
times that I was trying to literally build up Trillian and 
every single time I was trying to do it, McKinsey would stop 
it and I was exhausted.   
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 141 of 361 
 
 
I, if I remember correctly, I had not slept for two 
days because I was working, not because I had insomnia.  
So I was physical exhausted.  The fighting or the acrimony 
with McKinsey was impossible to deal with.   
 
And when I told Mr Koko this, both himself and 
Mr Mabelane came across very empathetic.  And that I did 
not ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, just repeat that sentence. 
MS GOODSON:   They came across very empathetic. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Implicated in what? 
10 
MS GOODSON:   Empathetic. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Empathy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  [laughs] 
MS GOODSON:   And I did not expect that.  And because 
they were so understanding, I started crying and that is 
what I detail and I do mention that in my affidavit.  Mr Koko 
gave me the assurance that if I had any problems with this 
moving forward, that Mr Mabelane as his right-hand man 
and he will help me address these issues.   
 
I tried to compose myself a bit and that I needed 
20 
to deal with the second agenda item which was an invoice 
that Mr Angel said – I do not know if it was...  Let me come 
back to that. 
 
There were two things.  The one was payment.  
Mr Angel knew about this meeting, obviously, and Mr Angel 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 142 of 361 
 
said:  Before you go to this meeting there are two things 
that you have got to discuss with Mr Koko.   
 
The one being that Eskom must pay Trillian 
directly.  Eskom must not pay Trillian via McKinsey.  And I 
asked Mr Angel why.   
 
And Mr Angel:   
“Bianca, you forget that we are a start-up.  We 
cannot wait for McKinsey to get the funds and 
then wait 90-days for them to pay us.  We 
need to maintain our cash flow.  So we need to 
10 
get paid the same time that McKinsey gets 
paid.  So please can you just go and ask him 
can we get paid directly? 
 
And then he...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean, that part, that conversation 
between yourself and Mr Angel, it is a conversation that 
happened before the 10 t h of February? 
MS GOODSON:   Before the meeting.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   I am pretty sure it was on the 
20 
10 t h of February via phone call ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   ...just before two o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 143 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And part of the objective of the meeting 
was to talk about payment? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
MS GOODSON:   And so before the meeting ended with 
Mr Koko and Mr Mabelane, I brought up the issue of 
payments and I asked Mr Koko, I said:  I have been 
requested to ask you can we get paid directly as opposed 
to Eskom paying McKinsey. 
 
Mr Koko replied to me and he said to me:  But 
10 
Bianca...  Sorry, I am saying verbatim, so I losing 
formalities.  He said:  Bianca, we do not have a contract 
with Trillian.  I did not dispute it and I did not push it 
because to me that was rational.  And I said ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MS GOODSON:   To me that was rational. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MS GOODSON:   And I said:  Okay.  Thank you.  And the 
meeting ended.  From that point on for the rest of my 
tenure, my contact person with the Eskom executives had 
20 
actually become Mr Mabelane.  So all the dealings that I 
had to deal with when it came to the executives was not 
with Mr Koko directly, it was through Mr Mabelane.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   H’m.  The right-hand man, you said. 
MS GOODSON:   I beg your pardon? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 144 of 361 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The one introduced to you as the right-
hand man? 
MS GOODSON:   I beg... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The one introduced as the right-hand 
man? 
MS GOODSON:   Correct.  Correct.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   That Mr Koko said is his right-hand 
man? 
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And he was then assigned...  Well, in 
10 
response ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am not sure whether your answer 
would have been captured.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your answer was yes? 
MS GOODSON:   My answer is yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS GOODSON:   And Mr Mabelane was Mr Koko’s right-
hand man. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that is what Mr Koko told you? 
20 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And you were explaining that that 
was in response to you complaining about the broken down 
relationship between TMC and McKinsey. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 145 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So did Mr Mabelane sort it out? 
MS GOODSON:   He tried to.  I thought he went above and 
beyond.  So Mr Mabelane said that I need to take a look...  
He asked me the question in that meeting:  Have I seen the 
MSA?  And I said no.  Because I think I had seen 
annexures of the MSA at the time but not the actual MSA.  
 
So he wrote down his Gmail account, his Gmail 
email account and my notebook – so I had a notebook with 
me – and he said:  Okay email me and I will send it to you.   
10 
 
So it was either that evening, later that evening 
or the next day but sometime very shortly after this 
meeting.  I did in fact email Mr Mabelane and I summarised 
what happened in the meeting and what was going to be 
next. 
 
Mr Mabelane, through the correspondents, then 
sent me the versions of the MSA with the supporting 
annexures and as they were at the time and said that I 
should look at the SN & S, SD Annexures, the Supply 
Development Annexure and make the changes that I 
20 
wanted to in that.  And I thought that was wow, I was lucky 
to be able to influence this contract that was negotiated 
from, you know, the previous years, so to say.  
 
But coincidently I had already started working on 
these KPI’s for supply development anyway.  So I did use 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 146 of 361 
 
track changes and I sent it back to Mr Mabelane.   
 
And I would like to believe, without any legal 
experience that I had at least tried to put some clauses 
into that annexure that would encourage and take this 
building up of a smaller partner.   
 
However, I do not know whatever happened with 
those annexures but I did make changes and I did send it 
back. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And this is after 10 February 2016. 
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Do you know that …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, that will not be recorded, Ms 
Goodson, is that a yes? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, it is a yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it is important that you articulate 
your answers so that it would be recorded. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you nod, it does not get recorded, if 
you shake your head it does not get recorded. 
MS GOODSON:   I know, Chair, I have watched so many of 
20 
these sessions at home. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay, thank you.  Do you know that 
there is a reason by – I think it is Mr Mabelane that the 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 147 of 361 
 
MSA was concluded in January 2016? 
MS GOODSON:   No, I have heard through Commission.  
What I know now is not what I knew then and I have heard 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let us just take it step by step.  
When you say no, are you saying no, you do not know that 
there is such a version or are you saying if there is such a 
version or are you saying no, you do not know that there is 
such a version or are you saying if there is such a version 
it is not true. 
10 
MS GOODSON:   No, no, no, sorry, know as in k-n-o-w, I 
am aware …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you know? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
MS GOODSON:   I am aware …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what you know is the version or the 
version and the fact. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, what I knew back then was not – 
was that an MSA was not signed.  What I have come to 
20 
know now through this Commission and through the 
parliamentary – through many things is that there was a 
signed MSA.  I have not seen any of them.  The last MSA 
that I had ever seen was that dossier that I sent back to Mr 
Mabelane and I have never seen any other version since 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 148 of 361 
 
then.  So I do not disagree with the statement that Mr 
Seleka is making, I just have not seen it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, well then in that case you do 
not know whether it exists but if somebody says it existed, 
a signed version, you do not want to dispute that, that is 
what you say. 
MS GOODSON:   One hundred percent. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Well, that is a story how it came to 
be signed and we will deal with it when we come to it.  
10 
Apparently it was – was it predated? 
MS GOODSON:   Or post-dated. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Post-dated. 
MS GOODSON:   So it is signed now but post-dated to a 
few months before. 
MS GOODSON:   Post-dated, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  so you may not be incorrect that as far 
as you are concerned you were working on what was at the 
time and unsigned document busy making changes to that 
document, you would not have known of an existence of 
20 
any other document apart from that as an MSA. 
MS GOODSON:   Absolutely not because the understanding 
both between myself, Mr Pepu, Mr Leballo and the 
McKinsey directors were that the MSA was not signed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja because the only …[intervenes] 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 149 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:   Because even in the steering committee 
meetings the agenda point was when is the MSA going to 
get signed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Let me tell you this also for the 
benefit of the Chairperson.  CDH, which Cliffe Dekker 
Hofmeyr, attorneys for Eskom at a time, they had to give 
advice to Eskom whether or not the MSA should be 
terminated and whether Eskom should make a settlement 
with McKinsey and Trillian, TMC.  They ultimately gave an 
opinion that there are suspensive conditions in the MSA 
10 
that were supposed to have been fulfilled in January 2016 
but it appears that they had not been fulfilled.  Now this 
opinion is given ultimately in February 2017 and the effect 
of that is, in the first place there is not an agreement to 
terminate, in the second place you are not liable to 
McKinsey Trillian, but Eskom had already paid.  Did you 
know that? 
MS GOODSON:   I knew that Eskom had paid Trillian 
specifically because I did support Mr Budlender in his 
investigations and that is when I saw that a few of the 
20 
invoices were paid.  I also supported Bowmans in their civil 
claim against McKinsey and Trillian so I know from those 
…[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Those processes. 
MS GOODSON:   But what you are mentioning now about 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 150 of 361 
 
CDH I have also learnt through this Commission by 
watching.  I did not know this at the time and it is 
disturbing. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now let us go back to the invoice, 
which is your second topic in the meeting on the 10 
February.  Which invoice is this that you were being asked 
to request that it be paid directly? 
MS GOODSON:   It is an invoice for R30.6 million, I think 
that is excluding VAT and it is for the corporate plan and 
this specific invoice, if I remember correctly, the very first 
10 
time that I ever saw a copy of this invoice was actually on 
the 24 February.  I think when I went into this meeting, if I 
remember 
correctly, 
the 
invoice 
had 
already 
been 
submitted and I was instructed to follow up on the invoice 
that was already submitted, I had not seen it by this date 
on the 10 February, so …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It was not in your possession. 
MS GOODSON:   It was not, it eventually came into my 
possession but only 14 days later, okay? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So who had the invoice been sent. 
20 
MS GOODSON:   To?  At the time of the meeting or are we 
just talking about the invoice now? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, prior – you say it was set prior to 
the meeting. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes and I did not know, I was not copied 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 151 of 361 
 
on it, I did not know anything about it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
MS GOODSON:   I was just told that there is an invoice 
and we need that invoice paid but not paid to McKinsey, 
paid to Trillian.  I conveyed the message and I accept that 
it was naïve of me to just convey the message.  I conveyed 
the message, Mr Koko’s reply was but we cannot pay 
because you do not have a contract.  Subsequent to this 
meeting I went to Mr Leballo and I asked him – sorry, I am 
going to verbatim again, please forgive me being so 
10 
informal, that I referred to Mr Tebogo Leballo as Dude and 
I phoned him and I was like Dude, what invoice is this?  
What are they talking about?  And he says do not worry B, 
I will send it to you and he subsequently forwards the 
email to me much later in the month and from that email 
you can see that the invoice was sent to Mr Singh – I think 
it was from Leballo, I do not remember all the details, you 
could probably help me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, I think it is from Mr Leballo. 
MS GOODSON:   To Mr Singh.  I was not copied on it but I 
20 
did eventually see it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I understand Mr Koko was copied? 
MS GOODSON:   It could be, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, it is fine, I have – ja, so you 
received when? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 152 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:   I received – personally I saw it for the 
time, it was on the 24 February. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  24 February? 
MS GOODSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  2016? 
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay, so he is sending it to you 
because you are asking what invoice is this? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Upon receiving it, what do you do? 
10 
MS GOODSON:   I just keep it, I think.  I do not think I do 
anything with it, in hindsight I know that I should have 
done a lot of different things with this invoice but ja, but I 
think when Mr Leballo sent to it to me, I just held onto it, if 
I remember correctly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes but will you not tell the Chairperson 
a little more because apparently there was a covering 
letter which bore you signature and the invoice itself also 
bore your signature.  You correct me. 
MS GOODSON:   There was a covering letter, I just cannot 
20 
remember, could you help me refresh my memory was this 
the covering letter about Mohamed Bobat or was this the 
covering letter requesting payment directly? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Requesting payment directly, yes. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay, alright.  Yes, so I had an electronic 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 153 of 361 
 
version of my signature and on the 9 t h or the 9 February, it 
is part of my annexures, the email itself is part of my 
annexures.  I have emailed that signature to Mr Angel. I 
was on my way home from work and Mr Angel asked me to 
come to the office to sign an invoice but I do not live 
anywhere near Melrose Arch, I live in the sort of Fourways 
area and traffic is horrendous and I was not going to go 
back to sign and I asked him what invoice is it and why do 
I need to sign it and he said that we need to pay or we 
need to release payment for the rental offices that we had 
10 
at the time, so we need the invoice, we need that to be 
signed so we can actually make this payment.  So I said 
look, Clive, I am not coming back to Melrose, I will just 
send you my signature, can you please just sign it?  That 
is my understanding and I emailed my signature to Mr 
Angel. 
 
When I saw this email on the 24 February with the 
cover letter and the invoice for 30.6 million, both of which 
have my signature on, I was very disturbed because I did 
not compile that letter.  I think I did actually, I think I 
20 
compiled a draft but I certainly did not sign it and I 
compiled a draft as a follow-up from a meeting with Mr 
Koko because I knew that I was requested to sort out this 
payment directly to Trillian but I did not sign this and I did 
not sign that invoice and what is very clear when you look 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 154 of 361 
 
at 
those 
signature 
is 
that 
you 
can 
see 
that 
those 
signatures are almost identical and it is, in my opinion, it is 
the picture that I sent to Mr Angel.  I did not sign either 
one of those letters, the invoice nor the letter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, you talk about this on paragraph 
48.2 of your affidavit, page 444.  Are you there? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, I am. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, so on 24 February 2016 I received 
an email from Leballo that contained an invoice and cover 
letter dated 29 January 2016 addressed to Anoj Singh, 
10 
CFO of Eskom.  A copy of the email attaching the invoice 
and the letter is attached.  That is on page 459.149. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay, I have that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You have that? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is that the email? 
MS GOODSON:   That is the email that – the first time I 
saw it, correct, and that is the 24 February. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So it is forwarded to you on the 24 t h? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes and you are correct, Mr Seleka, Mr 
20 
Leballo sent it to both Mr Singh and Mr Matshela. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And Mr Koko, CEO. 
MS GOODSON:   And Mr Angel. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And Mr Angel? 
MS GOODSON:   Ja. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 155 of 361 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  On the 3 February 2016? 
MS GOODSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Before the meeting on the 10 t h? 
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So on the 10 t h you are told follow-up on 
this invoice? 
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then the letter …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka?  Will you please arrange for 
your team or somebody to make sure that the annexures 
10 
are easily identifiable or recognisable.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you see what they have done, it is 
just in regard to some, they run annexure so and so and 
write on the inside of the previous page. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So when you are looking for the 
annexure you struggle and it is hidden. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Should not be like that. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I do not know who did it and why, so if 
you can get somebody to make sure that certainly mine is 
sorted out but all of them should be sorted out. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, Chair. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 156 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   What you normally do is to write on the 
first page of the document annexure so and so.  If you do 
not do that, what they do is to put page that shows that the 
next document is annexure so and so, but not this way, it 
makes it difficult to find the annexure. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That shall certainly be corrected, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that is the email and then on page 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I may have lost out on what you 
10 
were saying, you had said page 459 – page 149, is that 
right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Let us start at 459 and 149. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is where I am.  But I do not think 
I heard what you asked her about this. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So, Ms Goodson, that is the email. 
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes and the email is sent to you on the 
24 February 2016. 
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   From Mr Leballo. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And you were saying I am correct 
about? 
MS GOODSON:   You are correct in that this email was 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 157 of 361 
 
sent to both Mr Singh and Mr Koko. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And Mr Koko.   
MS GOODSON:   And seemingly also to Mr Angel. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Mr Leballo was connected with what 
again? 
MS GOODSON:   Mr Leballo was the Chief Financial 
Officer of the Trillian Holding Company. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay and the annexure that he 
was sending to Mr Singh and to Mr Angel and to Mr Koko is 
10 
the one at page 459.151? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So this – it says: 
“Please find attached the invoice from Trillian for 
Eskom Corporate Plan deliverable.  We have also 
attached a letter for your consideration.” 
The email is sent on the 3 February 2016.   So that is 
clearly before your meeting with Mr Koko on the 10 
February. 
20 
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And this is the email you were asked to 
follow up on with Mr Koko. 
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that direct payment can be made to 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 158 of 361 
 
Trillian. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then there is the letter on what should 
be the next page and page 459.151, it is addressed to Mr 
Anoj Singh. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did you say it is 29 February – 29 
January 2016? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Do you recognise this letter? 
10 
MS GOODSON:   As in I received in the email, yes, I do not 
recognise this letter as in I compiled it, I did not compile 
this letter and I did not sign this letter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you are neither the author neither 
the signatory to this letter. 
MS GOODSON:   No, I did not make this letter, I did not 
complete this, nor did I author this letter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, but now it bears your name at the 
end of it.  Ms Bianca Smith.  
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was that yourself at the time? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, that was me, yes. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Ja, 
CEO 
Trillian 
management 
consulting.  Explain to the Chairperson why do you say you 
are not the author nor the signatory to this letter. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 159 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before doing that do you want to confirm 
that – whether the position is that at a certain stage, 
including this time, you were using the surname Smith but 
you no longer use the surname. 
MS GOODSON:   Ja, I subsequently got married, Smith is 
my maiden name. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, but were you using the 
surname Smith at that time? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, but subsequently you have 
10 
changed? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, so where we see Bianca 
Smith we must know it is you? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, continue? 
MS GOODSON:   I did not compile …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes I was saying explain to the 
Chairperson why do you say you are neither the author nor 
the signatory to this letter? 
20 
MS GOODSON:   I cannot explain it beyond saying to you 
under oath, Chair, I did not compile this letter and I did not 
sign this letter.  There is no further explanation I can give 
you, I did not do this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The signature that appears above your 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 160 of 361 
 
name, would it have been the one that you sent to 
…[intervenes] 
MS GOODSON:   Mr Angel. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Angel? 
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  You said that you had sent it to 
him to use it for what? 
MS GOODSON:   He said that we needed to pay an invoice 
for the rental offices that we were using at the time.  In as 
part of my annexures as well, the email that I sent to Mr 
10 
Angel including this, so you can see – I think he got this – 
cannot remember the exact date but you can see the date 
that he got a copy of my signature.  And that was my 
understanding, that he would only use that signature for 
things that I approve and I believed that we needed to pay 
for the office, the rental office spaces that we had at the 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In order to pay, why would he need your 
signature, explain that part? 
MS GOODSON:   I am assuming to sign off a payment, I 
20 
mean that will be some of the governance processes that I 
am used to from coming from Anglo American, for example.  
If I am authorising a payment, I would have to sign for that 
payment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say when you sent the signature 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 161 of 361 
 
you sent it together with a note? 
MS GOODSON:   No, I did not.  It is just an email that says 
as discussed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but it did not say – it did not reveal 
the purpose for which you are sending the signature. 
MS GOODSON:   Unfortunately not, I was not that specific 
on that day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Thank you, Chair.  The email is – well, 
check whether this is the email, page 459.154. 
10 
MS GOODSON:   154? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, I had sent it to my COO Ben Burnard 
on the 2 February and then I forwarded that email to Mr 
Angel on the 2 February.  So Mr Angel had a copy of my 
signature from the 2 February and I recall also sending a 
copy of my signature to Mr Burnard because at the time we 
were trying – we were making employment offers to one or 
two individuals that we had interviewed and he just needed 
to sign the employment offer, so that is why my COO had a 
20 
copy.  We wanted to send out offer letters of employment 
but the reason why I sent it to Clive was for a completely 
reason.  Sorry, reason why I sent it to Mr Angel was 
different. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the date when it sent it was it not in 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 162 of 361 
 
February? 
MS GOODSON:   It is the 2 February, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so it is close to the 29 t h? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ms Goodson, I do not think we have 
the attachment to your email. 
MS GOODSON:   I can always give it to you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The one that shows your signature. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, I can always give it to you. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because I see the email says attached. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes and it should be, it was attached as a 
JPEG. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   So I could always forward it to you in its 
nature format. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  That invoice related to the 
corporate plan, you say? 
MS GOODSON:   Sorry, can I just raise one point? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, certainly. 
20 
MS GOODSON:   If you go to annexure pages 459.151, that 
is the letter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
MS GOODSON:   The letter is dated 29 January. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 163 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:   Okay?  However, if you go to the previous 
page 459.149. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes? 
MS GOODSON:   You can see that this was sent on the 3 
February.  So although the letter is dated the 29 t h it is 
actually only sent through on the 3 r d and I sent my email 
signature to Mr Angel on the 2 n d, so I do not believe that 
the date of this letter is in fact the 29 January, I actually 
think that it was an updated and sent through on the 3 r d.  
That is my hypothesis. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it may well be that it was written 
originally on the 29 t h and the date has not changed. 
MS GOODSON:   And only signed or included later. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS GOODSON:   But technically the date before this 
invoice is sent through to Eskom is the day that I give my 
signature to my manager.  Sorry, I am going off topic. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, no,  you need to explain yourself, 
of course.  I see Trillian Management Consulting’s address 
is 4 t h floor, 23 Melrose Boulevard, Melrose Arch on that 
20 
letter. 
MS GOODSON:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That was the offices you operated from. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, it was rental offices, we were renting 
offices from a company called Extra Space, it was not the 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 164 of 361 
 
formalised offices of Trillian which they moved to later, 
also in the Melrose Arch precinct but for my entire tenure 
at Trillian we were using these temporary offices. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me take this opportunity to ask you 
some questions that are not related to this, to your 
evidence.  We have heard – I have heard a lot of evidence 
about people allegedly meeting with Mr Salim Essa at 
Melrose Arch.  Now do you know whether there were 
offices at Melrose Arch that he used where he could be 
found? 
10 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And where he may have met with 
people? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, I have met him – when he 
interviewed me, I met Mr Essa at Mr Essa’s offices in 
Melrose Arch . 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   It was also in those offices that Mr Essa 
introduced to Mr Abram Masango who was – at that time he 
was the executive head of Transmission at Eskom.  I met 
20 
him in those offices.  I met Mr Sagar at those offices.  Ja, 
it is very likely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And those offices were the offices of 
which of the entities with which he may have been 
associated. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 165 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, I can explain all of that to you.  So 
Melrose Arch is obviously at the precinct, right?  And if you 
are familiar with Melrose Arch, I am going to try and use 
the gym as a central sort of landmark, right?  The 
temporary offices of Trillian, everything in Trillian, Trillian 
Management 
Consulting, 
Asset 
management, 
all 
the 
subsidiaries’ temporary offices were opposite the gym, was 
almost above Woolworths when Woolworths was there and 
that was the extra space offices, right?  Integrated Capital 
Management offices and Mr Salim Essa’s offices were on 
10 
the other side of the precinct almost as if you were going 
onto Athol Oaklands, so almost by the exit there was 
another separate corporate building there, the building of 
businesses.  On the ground floor is Integrated Capital’s 
offices of this specific building, it is white with black 
windows and on the first floor of that same building, so 
directly above Integrated Capital is Mr Salim Essa’s 
offices.  So get from one place to the other was very – it is 
just a walk.  So when I had a meeting with Mr Essa, I 
would walk out of where temporary offices were by the gym 
20 
and just walk across – almost like across the road. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so what did you say was the name 
of the entity that had the offices where he could be found? 
MS GOODSON:    Integrated Capital Management. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Integrated Capital Management? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 166 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But there were other entities connected 
with Trillian around as well.  TCM was there or was it not 
there? 
MS GOODSON:   TCM was not in that building. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MS GOODSON:   We were in a different building but in the 
precinct you could walk. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, in Melrose Arch . 
MS GOODSON:   Hundred percent, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, yes.  So he – and did you say 
his office was on the first floor? 
MS GOODSON:   Mr Salim Essa’s office was on the first 
floor of the same building as Integrated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of the same building? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MS GOODSON:   So it is something like, Chair, we were 44 
Melrose Boulevard, they were something like 2 Melrose 
Boulevard. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MS GOODSON:   But all in the same road. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, okay.  No, thank you.  Mr 
Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. Well, you mentioned Mr Abram  
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 167 of 361 
 
Masango being introduced to you.  When about was this? 
MS GOODSON:   I have it in my affidavit, I am sure – Mr 
Koko even references the fact that it is in my affidavit, I 
have got the exact date that I mention …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   In your affidavit you talk about – I think 
you talk about November or December 2016. 
MS GOODSON:   Just let me see under Mr Essa?   
ADV SELEKA SC:   On page 431, paragraph 18.3.2.  
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  During or about week 50, 2015, 6 to 12 
10 
December 2016 and at Essa’s office, I was introduced by 
Essa to Abram Masango.  So that is December. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You went there in March 2015. 
MS GOODSON:   2016. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, I am talking March 2015, I am 
deliberately asking you that question. 
MS GOODSON:   No, in March 2015 I did not know 
anything about Trillian or Regiments or Eskom, I just 
worked for Anglo. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh.  Who else from Eskom – well, let 
me put it differently, did you see anybody else from Eskom 
and Melrose Arch in the period that you were there? 
MS GOODSON:   No.  The only other people that I saw 
quite frequently was Mr Sagar from McKinsey and Mr 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 168 of 361 
 
Pamensky was there.  I cannot remember if he was on the 
board at the time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr who? 
MS GOODSON:   Mr Mark Pamensky. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You saw him there? 
MS GOODSON:   Ja, frequently.  Sorry, I have got a bad 
habit chair, I am a smoker and Mr Pamensky was a smoker 
as well so we often were in the same place that is smoking.  
Mr Pamensky was always between the different buildings. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He was on the Eskom board in 2015. 
10 
MS GOODSON:   No, I saw him – okay, well then that is 
another person I have met from Eskom, to answer your 
question and there is nobody else that I can think about. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, he is not from Eskom but he 
served on the board of Eskom. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  He is a non-executive director. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I also ask on the floor where Mr 
Salim Essa’s office was, was there a balcony?   
MS GOODSON:  Yes, but it was one of those balconies, the 
20 
way the office was configured was that there was like a 
central court yard, and all the offices were around the 
court yard.  So there was a balcony that overlooked into 
the internal court yard, if that makes sense.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 169 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:  When you look, I have never been ... I 
have only been to the board room in that specific office.  I 
have never been beyond it, but when you drive on the N1, 
because I know exactly where this building is and which 
office it is, it does look to be a smaller balcony that looks 
out onto the M, for mother, 1 from that building. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you can see it from the road? 
MS GOODSON:  You can see it from the M1, the one 
balcony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MS GOODSON:  And then on the other side of the office, 
the balcony like I said faces inside towards the central 
court yard.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  If you are on the outside going to those 
offices, where would you park? 
MS GOODSON:  Oh, it was easy.  You want me to explain 
this? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
Is 
there 
a 
basement 
parking 
...[intervenes]  
20 
MS GOODSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Or outside.  Also outside ...[intervenes]  
MS GOODSON:  Both.  The outside parking is a lot smaller.  
I think it can only accommodate about ten cars or so, but it 
is directly on the ground floor as you can walk into the 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 170 of 361 
 
building.  The basement parking if I remember correctly it 
was not even really access controlled.  You just had to tell 
the security guard I am going to this company and he 
would just open for you and then the basement parking was 
just one level beneath and was slightly more extensive.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  The balcony that you say you can 
see from the highway, is it accessible when you are, when 
you are in Mr Salim Essa’s office? 
MS GOODSON:  I think it is only accessible if you are in 
the office.  The balcony that looks into the internal court 
10 
yard is accessible to anybody. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
MS GOODSON:  Ja.  I did not include this type of stuff in 
my affidavit.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  You did not include it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  [indistinct] 
MS GOODSON:  I am talking about balconies.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But you know about it.  While you were 
there, was it usual to see people on the balcony by any 
chance?   
20 
MS GOODSON:  I do not know Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know that.  
MS GOODSON:  Because every time I have went, I have 
always met Mr Essa in the board room. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 171 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:  And the board room was as you came 
through the front door, the board room was right there.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS GOODSON:  So you did not really navigate through the 
rest of the office to get to the board room. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS GOODSON:  So I would not know.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
Yes. 
 
The 
integrated 
capital 
management, so only Mr Abraham Masango you were 
10 
introduced to? 
MS GOODSON:  I beg your pardon? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Only Mr Abraham Masango, you were 
introduced by Mr Salim Essa?   
MS GOODSON:  Yes, yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did he tell you anything about him? 
MS GOODSON:  He, Mr Essa introduced Mr Masango as 
the group executive of transmission and then introduced 
me as the CEO of Trillion Management Consulting and that 
was it.  It was very brief.  
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Pamensky ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  So you were not having a 
meeting with the two of them? 
MS GOODSON:  No, I was actually going to meet with Mr 
Essa, so as I was meeting with Mr Essa Mr Masango was 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 172 of 361 
 
leaving.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Pamensky was there, and what was 
his position you say? 
MS GOODSON:  Mr Pamensky was around a lot.  He was 
with, he was the CEO of Trillion Properties.  In the 
beginning when I first, first, first started with in January of 
2016, Trillion had a subsidiary called Trillion Properties 
and Mr Angel told me that the CEO of Trillion Properties 
was Mr Pamensky.   
10 
 
During my tenure at Trillion the property division 
stayed 
but 
Mr 
Pamensky 
was 
replaced 
by 
another 
gentleman whose name I cannot remember right now.  But 
it was Mr Pamensky, so we ... Mr Pamensky and I would 
smoke on the same balcony.   
 
So we would both be standing looking at the gym 
and very often when I would go and meet with Mr Angel, Mr 
Pamensky was also in that building.  But Mr Pamensky he 
was just a regular feature.  So he sometimes do not write 
about things that you just, you know, they were just 
20 
normal. 
 
I did not include it so much in here I do not think. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja, no it is fine.  He was a regular 
feature.  So what do you mean, he was there every day? 
MS GOODSON:  Every time I was in the office I saw him, I 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 173 of 361 
 
mean and sometimes I would not always go to the office.  I 
would sometimes go to Megawatt Park, sometimes I worked 
from home, but every single time I was in the office I 
would, not every time.   
 
Mostly I would see him, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And you were going to the office every 
day? 
MS GOODSON:  Mostly, and if it was not him it was his, he 
also had like a COO by the name of Mr Michael Shapiro, 
Michael Shapiro.  So if Mr Pamensky was not there, Mr 
10 
Shapiro was there, but Trillion Properties had a very 
separate section of the rented offices.  
 
So if ever I wanted to go and see Ms Matsepo for 
example, I would walk past the Trillion Properties and you 
would always see somebody in there.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see you talk about Mr Pamensky 
asking you to review his CV. 
MS GOODSON:  Yes, we were having a smoke one day and 
he asked me to take a look at his CV and I thought his CV 
was really bad.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You thought what? 
MS GOODSON:  His CV was really bad.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  You know you cannot say that about 
him? 
MS GOODSON:  Sorry? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 174 of 361 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You know you cannot say that about 
him? 
MS GOODSON:  No, his CV was ... it was a one pager CV 
and I did criticize this to him. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
MS GOODSON:  Because he wanted my feedback, so I 
gave him my feedback and my feedback was quite critical.  
It did not really have much about experience and the utility, 
I do not understand why anybody would want, he said that 
he was applying for a board position. 
10 
 
I did not know what board and I just said this is, 
you do not show any managerial positions or any other 
executive experiences.  I would not employ you on my 
board and as far as I know he went and he affected the 
changes that I recommended.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you knew each other quite well? 
MS GOODSON:  Smokers generally have a good rapport 
with each other, and a lot of the times when I would go and 
have a cigarette, he would be there you know.  So we 
would always sort of just speak about stuff. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you know that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you, did you tell him you recommend 
that he should include in his CV some experience that he 
had forgotten that he had? 
MS GOODSON:  I just told him that I thought it was thin.  I 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 175 of 361 
 
just said is this all you have got.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And then he put, he put some more? 
MS GOODSON:  And he said well give me an example, and 
I just rattled off some stuff that I could think about.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MS GOODSON:  And he was like, okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Seleka?   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you subsequently see the revised CV 
by any chance? 
10 
MS GOODSON:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, thank you.  well, if you saw one that 
he may have submitted to the Department of Public 
Enterprises, before he was appointed to the Board of 
Eskom, would you know whether it is the same as the one 
you criticized or not? 
MS GOODSON:  I really would not remember.  It was such 
a long time ago Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MS GOODSON:  And it was over a cigarette.  You know, 
20 
you are not really paying attention at the time, and 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  Alright.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you or did you not know that in 
January 2016 he was serving on the Board of Eskom? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 176 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:  I did not know that.  When the first time 
Mr Pamensky became very significant to me, was in March.  
It was the week after I resigned and I think it was the Mail 
and Guardian.  The Mail and Guardian had this picture of 
Mr Essa and the Guptas, and all these ministers on boards.   
 
It was Eskom on the one side and Transnet on the 
other side, and at the bottom are all these people that 
were connected and there was a picture of Mr Pamensky, 
there was a picture of Mr Sandy Shane from Intercredit 
Capital.   
10 
 
There was a picture of Mohammed Bobat.  So the 
only time this concept of state capture really hit me, was 
when I looked at this picture, this schematic and there 
were way too many people’s faces that I recognized on that 
schematic and that is when the significance, and that is 
when I realised, but that was in March. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  March 2016? 
MS GOODSON:  2016, ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  But before you went, there is a 
question I wanted to ask and I want her to flow in that one.  
20 
Let me get to this, because I want to end with that.  The 
corporate plan, you said TMC did not render services in 
respect of corporate plan. 
MS GOODSON:  Categorically not.  Trillion Management 
Consulting did no work for the corporate plan.  It did not 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 177 of 361 
 
plan, did not do it, did not envisage it, it did nothing.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you know anything about the 
corporate plan? 
MS GOODSON:  No, I knew nothing about the corporate 
plan.  Absolutely nothing.  I am so emphatic about this.  It 
has been my position from five years ago and it is still my 
position today and I know the people may have opinions 
about it, but Trillion Management Consulting of which I was 
the CEO had nothing to do with the corporate plan. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I think Ms Matsepo did say that the 
10 
corporate plan, services relating to the corporate plan were 
rendered by [indistinct].   
MS GOODSON:  Okay, and I would not have known that 
because I was at Anglo American. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
MS GOODSON:  Right, I did not work for Riggermans, so if 
they did do the work, again my statement is still correct 
that Trillion Management Consulting, of which as far as I 
know, I was the first Employee, did not work for this.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Much less so in February 2016 when 
20 
there was only two of you? 
MS GOODSON:  Absolutely.  It was just myself and Mr 
Bernard, and we were trying to set up the company.  We 
could not do any billable work.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 178 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:  We were stretched so thin. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You know, Ms Goodson, in that context 
I am reminded of what Mr Koko said when he was here.  He 
said there was a workshop given by McKinsey and Trillion 
at Eskom, and I think he said on the 10 t h of February, the 
day when he met with you. 
MS GOODSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well, two questions.  Were you, you 
were the CEO at the time.  
MS GOODSON:  I am the only one of two Employees.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  
MS GOODSON:  I can assure you that ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  This is the question, were you aware of 
the workshop? 
MS GOODSON:  No, because the first ... look, as I 
mentioned I had met Mr Koko before the 10 t h, after the 
press conference, right.  But on the 10 t h there was no 
workshop, there was nothing like that.  I parked at 
Megawatt Park.  I went straight to the executive when I sat 
on the couches with Mr Koko and Mr Mabuleni.  
20 
 
I did not do work.  Like as in a workshop, right.  So 
it categorically was not me.  I do not remember my COO’s 
calendar but I do not remember us being operational at 
that point, but I stand to be corrected.  Absolutely and it 
could not have been anybody else because it was only me.   
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 179 of 361 
 
 
If it was not me, it was Mr Bernard.  So Trillian 
certainly was not represented in plural because there were 
only two and if it was plural it would have been me and Mr 
Bernard.  Maybe Mr Bernard was there but I cannot 
remember.  
 
But it certainly was not me and when I met Mr Koko 
on the 10 t h, he did not even mention that to me.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean the workshop was supposed to 
have been when Mr Seleke? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I think Mr Koko said on the 10 t h, on the 
10 
day he met with ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The 10 t h of February 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, surely if TMC had only two 
Employees, one of whom was the CEO there is no way that 
the CEO, there would be workshop attended by somebody 
from TMC that the CEO would not know about? 
MS GOODSON:  Impossible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, because even if it was your COO, so 
you were the CEO and the COO but you, did you have a 
20 
messenger? 
MS GOODSON:  It was honestly just the two of us.  So I do 
not know, maybe there was another Employee from Trillian, 
I do not know but as far as Trillian Management Consulting 
is concerned, it certainly was not me.  If it was Mr Bernard 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 180 of 361 
 
who was my COO, maybe and I just cannot remember. 
 
But if that was the case I would have expected Mr 
Koko to say but I met Mr Bernard this morning.  Or you 
know, the workshop went well, but that meeting of the 10 t h 
was only about, we only discussed what I explained to you 
which 
was 
the 
relationship 
with 
McKenzie 
and 
the 
payments.  
 
We did not, I did not know about the workshop. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Or maybe that I am meeting Mr Bernard 
after this meeting or that there is a workshop after my 
10 
meeting with you. 
MS GOODSON:  Ja, but okay, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, did he mention that? 
MS GOODSON:  No.  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Was there an indication from him that 
he will go to Melrose Arch and sort out the issue of 
payments. 
MS GOODSON:  No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Or kill the issue of payments with TMC? 
MS GOODSON:  The, the issue of the payments was very 
20 
succinct.  I asked Mr Koko would they consider paying us 
directly and Mr Koko replied very succinctly we cannot 
because you do not have a contract.  End of story.  I did 
not push that because that was reasonable.  
 
But there was not a debate or a discussion.  This 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 181 of 361 
 
was not prolonged.  It was very, very succinct.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that is in February 2016.  Was this 
payment of 30.6 million rand made during your time?   
MS GOODSON:  No.  No.  No, but if it was I would not 
have even seen it, because I did not have access to the 
finances.  But if I recall the information that I got, that I 
had been working with Mr Budlender, I think it was paid, 
but later.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  It was paid on the 14 t h of April 2016.  
MS GOODSON:  Ja.  But so no, not during my time.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So why did, why did you leave on the 
19 t h?  Did you leave?  Did you resign?  Did you, what?  Did 
they chase you away?  What happened? 
MS 
GOODSON: 
 
I 
resigned 
under 
really 
difficult 
circumstances.  But if I could ask you, I know you are 
going to read my resignation letter, so let us rather 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  No, I have that.  Let me ask you this 
question before I go there.  Ms Matsepo testified here 
about you being present with her when Mr Lebelo you have 
20 
mentioned. 
MS GOODSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  That her notes, on her notebook. 
MS GOODSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  The words ...[intervenes]  
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 182 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:  They are going to finance the minister, the 
Finance Minister. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  For change of minister.  
MS GOODSON:  Ja.  Something like that.  Yes, I remember 
it very specifically.  It was Wednesday, the 16 t h of March 
2016 and I know that because that is Ms Matsepo’s 
birthday.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Which date? 
MS GOODSON:  The 16 t h of March.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
10 
MS GOODSON:  2016, and it was a Wednesday morning. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It was three days before you resigned.  
MS GOODSON:  Yes, and it was Ms Matsepo’s birthday and 
she shared an office with Mr Lebelo and I had just come 
into the office and as you do, you make a cup of coffee and 
you walk around the office and you say good morning to 
people, and before you start you know sitting with your 
computer, and I did exactly that.  
 
My office was on quite a different side.  Ms 
Matsepo’s office was a lot closer to the Trillian Property’s 
20 
office, so it was on the other side of the building.  Made a 
cup of coffee and I went to the office and Mr Lebelo was 
there, Ms Matsepo was there and the first thing that I 
asked as I walked into this office was Mr Lebelo, I called 
him Tebogs.   
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 183 of 361 
 
 
 I said Tebogs, what is happening with the MSA.  Is 
it still not signed, and I say this but I am walking towards 
Ms Matsepo and he gets up and he says ja, it is still not 
signed.  You know, so the three of us are sitting there with 
our coffee, and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was this going to be, was this a planned 
meeting? 
MS GOODSON:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or you just ...[intervenes]  
MS GOODSON:  No, it was just what you do in the 
10 
morning, catching up.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS GOODSON:  Saying good morning to people.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS GOODSON:  It was not scheduled, nothing, and 
because I really got along very well with Mr Lebelo and Ms 
Matsepo, we referred to each other as sisters sometimes, 
you know.  So I was just going to say good morning and 
they were both there.  
 
I said so Ms Matsepo says but how are we going to 
20 
get paid.  How are we going to pay, because now 
remember all the Riggermans’s people had come over 
already, and I mean, Ms Matsepo and I were very 
concerned that this MSA was not signed because our 
understanding was as long as the MSA is not signed we 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 184 of 361 
 
are not getting revenue and if we are not getting revenue, 
how can the business sustain itself.  
 
Then Mr Lebelo said but there is bigger problems.  
Something along those lines and that is when he wrote in 
the notebook.  So everything that Ms Matsepo said in her 
testimony is 100% correct.  He wrote, I do not remember it 
exactly. 
 
She remembers it better than me, they are going to 
change the minister.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well, let me read it to you. 
10 
MS GOODSON:  Ja, sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You might be upset. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, before you read it, it might be good 
to know what is her recollection of what was written. 
MS GOODSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but just say on your recollection what 
was written.  
MS GOODSON:  So what Mr Lebelo wrote was they are 
going to change the minister, the Finance Minister.  It was 
20 
very specific.  It was not just any minister, they are going 
to change the Finance Minister, and I remember what I 
remember was Ms Matsepo almost shrieking. 
 
Saying are they mad?  Who?  Mr Lebelo was 
pointing in the direction of Mr Wood’s office, which was 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 185 of 361 
 
more in the direction of where my office was, and then Ms 
Matsepo just goes crazy.  She is like but ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that, the pointing towards Mr 
Woods’s office. 
MS GOODSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was that meant to say? 
MS GOODSON:  It was meant to suggest that the 
leadership are going to be changing the Finance Minister.  
The leadership of this organisation bigger than us, that are 
already CEO’s, but bigger than us are going to change the 
10 
Finance Minister.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, so as he when he was pointing, when 
you said they ...[intervenes]  
MS GOODSON:  He was pointing ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  He was pointing in the direction of Mr 
Woods’s office? 
MS GOODSON:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS GOODSON:  And Ms Matsepo, Ms Matsepo just got, 
she got, crazy is not the right word, but she got so angry.  
20 
Angry is probably the right word and she just kept on 
saying did they not see what happened at [indistinct].   
 
Who do these people think they are?  She was 
really upset.  I just looked at both of them and I just said I 
cannot deal with this, goodbye and I remember feeling 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 186 of 361 
 
sick.  I was feeling like I was, like you are about to get the 
flue.  
 
Because we were in Melrose I went to the mall and I 
went to Clicks to go get some Corenza, and before I went 
into Clicks and I remember very distinctly standing by the 
door of Clicks, and I phoned my fiancée at the time and I 
just, and I told him what had happened and I said to him, I 
said I do not know if I am going mad, but I just need to tell 
someone about this, in case it happens and I do not want 
to forget, and I said I do not know if this will happen. 
10 
 
I do not know if it is nonsense, but I just need to 
tell somebody what just happened and I remember, and my 
fiancée was at work and he was like okay, I am making a 
note of this and he remembered.  So he was always like in 
case I go crazy and this actually happens, I have got like 
some sort of validation.  
 
Ja, that is ... what Ms Matsepo had said to you 
Chair, I agree with completely.  You may have slightly 
different versions of what was exactly said, how it was 
said, but what she said is 100% correct.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I would let Mr Seleka read you the actual 
note now, but before he does so, I need you to tell me what 
you told your fiancée.  
MS GOODSON:  I told him that I was in the office with, I 
am going to verbatim, okay.  As much as I can remember. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 187 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MS GOODSON:  I phoned him and I said babe, I was in the 
office with Tebogo and Masilo.  The MSA is still not signed, 
so I do not know what is going to happen with this 
company, if it is even going to exist or anything, but the 
reason why I am really phoning you is because Tebogo just 
told us that the Finance Minister is going to be replaced 
again, and I cursed and I said can you believe this.  
 
He said are you sure, and I just said to him ... I 
said I do not know, but just remember today.  Can you 
10 
please just remember what I am saying to you now?  
Because I may forget and then we just see this afternoon 
how am I doing, and I told him I am going to get some 
meds and that is it.  
 
That is the best that I can remember like what I said 
to him, and as far as I know, that is what he remembers me 
saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether, do you remember 
whether he ever subsequently talked to you about what you 
told him on that day?  Subsequently whether same year or 
20 
the following year?   
MS GOODSON:  Unfortunately not, because as quickly as 
we got married, we also got divorced.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS GOODSON:  So no, we never really spoke about things 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 188 of 361 
 
like that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, no that is fine.  It is just that the 
Minister of Finance at the time was Mr Pravin Gordhan, but 
he was not fired during 2016. 
MS GOODSON:  It was a year later.  
CHAIRPERSON:  He was fired in March 2017. 
MS GOODSON:  It was a year later.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So I was wondering whether when 
Mr Gordon was fired in March 2017, he might have said 
well it took long, but I see it is happening or something like 
10 
that.  
MS GOODSON:  By 2017 in March, I was I think I was still 
working at Mr Budlender.  Because I started helping Mr 
Budlender and his report in January of 2017. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS GOODSON:  And I remember speaking to Mr Budlender 
about that, and I was in such a state of trauma, because 
the realization of what was happening at Trillian was very 
evident to me then.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MS GOODSON:  And I think as much as I could I actually 
just tried to ignore these things, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Mr Seleka, you can ... you 
may read the note now.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  You, it is your 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 189 of 361 
 
handwriting.  It reads: 
 
“Changing Finance Minister.” 
MS GOODSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I am sorry.  Please repeat? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It reads: 
 
“Changing Finance Minister.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is in the bundle.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Here we have obtained Mr Lebelo’s 
affidavit.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  I can read it out to the Chairperson.  
For the record ...[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, do so, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I would place it where it is.  It is Eskom 
Bundle 
14(C) 
on 
page, 
I 
am 
going 
straight 
to 
the 
paragraphs.  Page 877 point 102 and it reads under the 
heading response to the allegations removal of former 
20 
Finance Minister Gordon.   
 
Paragraph 21: 
 
“I have dealt with Ms Matsepo’s allegations that I 
allegedly had prior knowledge of the firing of the 
former Finance Minister, Pravin Gordon.” 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 190 of 361 
 
 
And he gives the paragraph numbers: 
 
“I request that the contents of the said paragraphs 
be 
incorporated. 
 
Given 
the 
contents 
of 
Ms 
Matsepo’s statement and her oral evidence, I am 
obliged to say more on the matter.” 
 
Paragraph 23: 
 
“Having now had site of the relevant page of Ms 
Matsepo’s notebook, I recognize the handwriting on 
Annexure MM3.” 
 
That is to Ms Matsepo’s affidavit: 
10 
 
“As my own.  This notwithstanding I deny that I had 
any prior knowledge that former Finance Minister 
Gordon would be removed or that the President 
wanted to remove him.  No reference is made to the 
President in MM3, nor is this document dated.” 
 
Then he goes on to say, he puts context to that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  But I think the important part here is 
what the Chairperson had wanted us to do, which is to 
confirm whose handwriting it is.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, yes.  Yes, thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Well, then let us go 
to why you resigned.  Ms Goodson?   
MS GOODSON:  Must I explain or will you read my 
resignation letter? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 191 of 361 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Should I go to your resignation? 
MS GOODSON:  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
MS GOODSON:  Sorry Chair, it is a very emotional letter 
and I would rather answer questions than have to explain.  
If that is okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:  No, that is fine.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  That is to be found in Eskom 
Bundle 14(B).  ja, B.  I think you have, you know the 
contents.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Keep your mike on at all times Ms 
Goodson. 
MS GOODSON:  Okay.  So I was just saying I know the 
contents of the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MS GOODSON:  Like the back of my hand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, that is fine, but rather remind me 
where it is Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is Eskom bundle ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, I have got it I think.  I have got it.  
20 
459 point 26. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is correct.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 192 of 361 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay.  This is a relatively long letter. 
MS GOODSON:  Must I go through it quickly?  Must I 
explain what happened? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes, please.  
MS GOODSON:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That, well there is no need to read it, but 
what can be done is highlight the important features.  
MS GOODSON:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because we can read it.  
MS GOODSON:  But Chair, let me give you the context that 
10 
led up to me writing this letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MS GOODSON:  So I have explained to you what happened 
on the 16 t h of March.  It was, particularly it as Ms 
Matsepo’s birthday, but it is the same day that Mr Lebelo 
informed us about the Finance Minister.  On the Friday, 
which was the 18 t h of March, of that week, Mr Angel ... at 
this point in time Trillian Management Consulting had 
moved 
temporary 
offices, 
because 
the 
Riggermans’s 
people had come on board.   
20 
 
We were not at the extra space offices in, I do not 
even know that area.  It is on the other side of the N1, but 
it was not in Melrose Arch anymore.  It was in, what do you 
call that area?  On Greystone, but on the other side of the 
N1. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 193 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I wanted to just say something. 
MS GOODSON:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you proceed.  To say when you 
were the only Employee of TMC, you know just you and 
your COO, were you or was the COO the receptionist as 
well?   
MS GOODSON:  There was no one to phone.  
CHAIRPERSON:  There was no one to phone. 
MS GOODSON:  No clients, no one was phoning.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Just go back to the letter, 
10 
how the resignation ...[intervenes] 
MS GOODSON:  Yes, the Friday.  Anyway, so because we 
had grown on the 1 s t of March, now it is quite a lot of 
people, Trillian Management Consulting was moved to 
extra space offices, but on the other side of the N1.  Right, 
so it was not in Melrose Arch anymore.  
 
While I was in those offices, I get a phone call from 
Mr Angel on my cell phone and Mr Angel instructs me, he 
says B, you are going to get an email.  You need to sign 
these letters and sign it back very quickly.  Right. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is this now on the 19 t h of ...[intervenes]  
MS GOODSON:  It is the Friday, the 18 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The 18 t h? 
MS GOODSON:  I resigned the next day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 194 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:  And because I had not received the email 
yet I did not care about it and I just said okay, you know 
whatever.  I will deal with it when it comes through.  So the 
email comes through and there is a Word document 
attached to it, and it talks about a Bank of Baroda 
accounts and it has places for signature for both myself 
and my COO and the contents of the letter talk about my 
COO and I handing over the rights of this accounts to Mr 
Mark Chipkin from Integrated Capital Management, so 
sharing and opposite my COO, and he – so I called him, 
10 
and I said Ben have you ever heard of the Bank of Baroda 
and both of us are like no, you know so we go, and we 
Google, and you know like what is this, like you know in 
South Africa you have got ABSA, Nedbank, Standard Bank, 
FNB, 
you’ve 
just 
got 
the 
basic 
four 
kind 
of 
thing…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    No., there’s a Bank of Africa. 
MS GOODSON:   Sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    There’s also a Bank of Africa. 
MS GOODSON:   Okay but Bank of Baroda was a very 
20 
unknown bank name.  So, we googled it and I’m like, why 
must we sign this, I had already opened, in January of 
2016 I had opened a business bank account with Absa for 
Trillion Management Consulting, and I was comfortable to 
do that, as a signatory right but this Bank of Baroda 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 195 of 361 
 
account is just weird.  So, I replied to Marc Chipkin, Mr 
Marc Chipkin and I asked him, I said, what is this 
about…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Who sent you the email, I thought it 
was…[intervenes]. 
MS GOODSON:   Mr Angel but Mr Chipkin was also copied 
right, so I replied to both…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And who was he? 
MS GOODSON:   Mr Chipkin was just another Director of 
Integrated Capital Management. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh Okay.  
MS GOODSON:   He was performing services that would 
suggest that he was like the company secretary.  He was 
getting all the documents, the BEE certificates and tax 
registrations and stuff like that.  Mr Angel replies to my 
email and says, 
“Bianca, we need this bank account to facilitate 
payments to E Gateway”,  
So, 
remember 
now 
the 
E 
Gateway 
was 
the 
Generations Specialist in Dubai and India, and I’m like but 
20 
why, Absa can do the exact same thing, why do we need 
another one?  So, anyway I speak to my COO, My COO 
looks at me and says, I’m not doing that, I’m not signing it, 
forget about it.  I phoned Mr Chipkin I said, listen Ben’s not 
going to do it, I am going to come to your offices, and we 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 196 of 361 
 
can talk about it later and he says, okay fine, we need you 
here at 4 o’clock.  So, 4 o’clock on a Friday afternoon I go 
to Melrose Arch, I go to Integrated Capital and as I walked 
in, there is a representative from the Bank of Baroda in the 
boardroom with all the paperwork to sign, to open this 
account. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Who were you going to meet in the 
boardroom? 
MS GOODSON:   In the boardroom was my – it was myself, 
the representative from the Bank of Baroda and Mr 
10 
Chipkin. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes, but when you left your office to 
that meeting, did you know that there would be somebody 
from the Bank of Baroda or…[intervenes]. 
MS GOODSON:   No, I just thought I was going to discuss 
this issue with…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    With Mr Chipkin? 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay, alright, continue. 
MS GOODSON:   So, I get there and I don’t complain that 
20 
the Bank of Baroda gentleman is there because at least 
now I can understand what it is about and this gentleman 
has all the forms that you need to fill out to create a bank 
account and affidavits and a whole bunch of stuff and I – 
so I go and I sign the letters and I look at each page and I 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 197 of 361 
 
read each page and I sign it and mark it there and there’s 
nothing weird about it, I didn’t find anything disturbing 
about it until I saw that the overdraft facility of this account 
is R300million. 
CHAIRPERSON:    How much? 
MS GOODSON:   R300million, so I push back on Marc and 
I say, Marc why do we need this, the overdraft facility for 
Absa is R3million, Absa’s our main transactional account 
why do we need R300million for a sub-contractor, are you 
mad but I thought, okay, whatever and I carry on reading 
10 
through these things and then there comes this letter that 
says that I must now sign over all authority of this account 
to 
Mr 
Chipkin 
and 
I 
just 
laughed 
at 
it 
and 
the 
representative from the Bank of Baroda said, are you sure 
you want to sign this and I looked at him and I said, no.  
So, I changed the letter, I physically wrote that all 
transactions on this account need the approval of both Mr 
Chipkin and I.  So, instead of making it, I’m giving it away I 
tried to put in more controls.  Mr Chipkin wasn’t happy with 
the letter and the Bank of Baroda representative asked if 
20 
the letter could please be typed out rather. 
 
So, Mr Chipkin takes it to the back office, and I can 
hear Mr Clive – Mr Angel screaming, saying, who does she 
think she is.  Some time passes, Mr Chipkin comes back 
with the letter that’s corrected, as I had made the changes 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 198 of 361 
 
and I signed that letter…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And did the letter, is without the 
changes you had made? 
MS GOODSON:   With the changes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh, it’s with the changes? 
MS GOODSON:   With the changes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
MS GOODSON:   Saying that, the only people that can 
transact on this account – and I was very specific, I didn’t 
say myself or Marc, I said myself and Marc and the Bank of 
10 
Baroda representative especially asked me, he said, this is 
going to make it difficult because both of you need to 
always have it together, I said, exactly, it was very 
deliberate on my side.  Clive was furious with me and I 
signed it, I opened this bank account and I left, it was 
probably now, an hour later so it was about 5 o’clock on a 
Friday afternoon and the traffic was crazy going from 
Melrose to the part of Joburg where I live and I phoned my 
fiancé and I just told him what happened and I just cried 
the whole way home and I told him, I said, by the time I get 
20 
home, just don’t even talk to me, just make sure we have 
wine.  I get home and I drank quit a lot of wine, I think I 
had about three glasses and I didn’t speak to anyone, I 
went to bed.  I woke up at 2 o’clock on Saturday morning, 
now it’s the 19 t h, I woke up my fiancé and I told – and my 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 199 of 361 
 
fiancé had just left working at De Beer so he was staying 
at home he was taking a bit of a hiatus and I woke him up 
and I said, I have to resign and he said why, and I told him, 
I said, something is going on and I don’t know what it is 
but I’m resigning and we had a very brief conversation 
about, oh my God, if you resign then our family’s got no 
income and he said, okay do it and I said, okay you go 
back to sleep, I’m going to do it. So, I wake up and I start 
typing out this resignation letter that’s a bit lengthy and it 
took me a long time to write it and just to let you know, 
10 
Chair, every time I resign, I always write one paragraph,  
 
“Thank you for the opportunity but it’s with regret 
that I’ve got to move…”, 
 
You know, very to the point.  This is a much longer 
resignation letter, and it was probably my tenth version 
because no matter what I wrote, I wasn’t happy with the 
message that was coming across.  Eventually my fiancé 
woke up at 6 o’clock in the morning and I was just finished 
this letter, he read through it, he asked me, are you sure 
you want to send it, I said yes, I sent the letter and that 
20 
was it.  I switched off my phone and the letter is very 
damning and what I tried to do in this resignation letter is, 
I didn’t write the resignation letter to Eric who had now 
become the CEO of the holding company, because, Eric, I 
didn’t 
have 
a 
relationship 
with 
Mr 
Wood, 
I 
had 
a 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 200 of 361 
 
relationship with Mr Angel and my resignation was to Mr 
Angel because I believe that Mr Angel was the person 
putting me in a situation that was compromising so I was 
resigning from him. 
 
So, my resignation letter is addressed to him and 
it’s a very angry letter but at the same time I didn’t want to 
resign based on suspicion I wanted to resign on things that 
I knew I could reference.  So, I referenced the fact that Mr 
Angel and I had an ongoing debate about remuneration, 
when I on boarded with Trillion I had actually taken quite a 
10 
significant cut in my salary as well as my COO, I 
referenced that, I referenced the fact that I thought that 
there were Gupta links with some of the entities that we 
were working with and I referenced the fact that these guys 
are expecting me to take risks but that they take the 
benefit.  In the case of the Bank of Baroda account, I must 
open the account and I must have the liability for that 
account while somebody else transacts on it, it’s like, are 
you crazy you know, so that was the resignation letter and 
I left with immediate effect. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:    You reference the fact that they have 
Gupta links, is that what you said? 
MS GOODSON:   I mentioned that – I think I give five 
reasons for me leaving and one of them is Gupta links and 
that was suspicions I did not categorically know.  What has 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 201 of 361 
 
happened, I just want to let you know what had happened 
is, it was that time – that sort of time of year when your 
Easter holidays are towards the end of March and not just 
in April, so I had planned to go away for that following 
week anyway.  My family and I had gone away, and I 
switched off my phone because I knew that people would 
be phoning me to say what happened.  When I eventually 
came back to Johannesburg Mr Angel wanted to see me 
and Mr Wood wanted to see me, and they wanted to know 
what had happened.  Mr Wood asked me if there was 
10 
anything, he could do to make me stay and I said yes, you 
can change the business processes, you can give me 
access to the finances of this company and you can make 
me negotiate my own contracts, so let me manage this 
business as a CEO would and he said, that will never 
happen, so I shook his hand and I said goodbye. 
 
With Mr Angel, I didn’t wait to hear what he said I 
just – then shouted at him saying, how dare he put me in 
such a compromising position and I think one of the things 
that I even said to him is, I said, it seems as though you’ve 
20 
put me in a position where my daughter could lose a 
mother, what about you and your children, how could you 
do this to me and I was in tears and I’ve never seen or 
spoken to any of them since. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja, I will go through some of the 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 202 of 361 
 
paragraphs in the letter, the letter from you, is it an email 
– it’s an email. 
MS GOODSON:   It is an email. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    From yourself dated 19 March 2016 at 
5h58 addressed to Mr Clive Angel, “reasons for my 
resignation”, and I start reading from paragraph 3, it says, 
“My resignation is personal because I have taken 
risks”…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the un-numbered paragraph 3 
because there’s a paragraph 3 that’s numbered on the 
10 
following page. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, correct, Chair sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, for the record, the paragraphs 
are not numbered I will count, the third paragraph, 
“Mr resignation is personal because I have taken 
risks and endeavour taking risks and support you.  
Our relationship can be summed up as a square peg 
in a round hole and I cannot support you nor the 
company further”, 
20 
 
What risks were you referring to here, which you 
continued to take? 
MS GOODSON:   The biggest risk was this – to me, the 
most significant one was this Bank of Baroda account.  If 
somebody – if I open this account, I can’t imagine paying 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 203 of 361 
 
back R300million in my lifetime.  R300million is so much 
money that I’m pretty sure that my daughter ’s children 
would have to be paying off a debt like that.  So, why 
would I take on a responsibility of R300million and give it 
to somebody else, that was the first and biggest risk.  
There were a lot of other things that were concerning, the 
relationship with Mr Bobat and Mr Bobat’s involvement in 
Trillion was very concerning.  You know, by my standards it 
wasn’t ethical, my question was never answered, why could 
we not just respond to RFP’s like everybody else and have 
10 
a fair fight, a competitive chance of seeing if our services 
are good, you know, so there were just these issues and 
then the Wednesday prior to that, you get the CFO saying 
to you, that a Finance Minister is going to get replaced, no, 
those were risks to me I don’t want to be associated with 
people like that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    There’s a paragraph in  your letter to 
the effect that, the money is not worth the risk. 
MS GOODSON:   Hundred percent because I did take a 
step back in my salary, I honestly did. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja, so which means that you thought 
they were not paying you what the risks were worth, so 
they were paying you less than what you…[intervenes]. 
MS GOODSON:   What I did say to the DCJ was that I did – 
I 
didn’t 
want 
to 
come 
across 
completely 
based 
on 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 204 of 361 
 
speculation and I did want to reference things that was a 
long standing discussion between Mr Angel and I and 
remuneration was one of those.  I know that people have 
said that I was in it for the money and the truth of the 
matter is, is that, if I was earning enough as in, I didn’t 
lose when I joined Trillion and if I was financially 
comfortable there was a part of me that probably would 
have stopped to say, let me wait and see if I’m imagining 
this.  There was a part of me that would have reconsidered 
putting my family at risk the way that I have, and I would 
10 
have thought, probably, about being pragmatic more than 
shooting from the hip.  I’m not saying that I would continue 
doing things that were wrong for money because if I 
wanted to, when I spoke to Mr Wood, I would have told 
him, yes, pay me more and that’s not what I said, 
so…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, because that’s exactly what 
we’re trying to understand, whether was your venting out 
meant to say, look, if you give me more money, I will stay. 
MS GOODSON:   No. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:    And stomach the risks. 
MS GOODSON:   In the event that it was misunderstood 
that way, I did definitely clear it up with Mr Wood, like I 
said.  Mr Wood explicitly asked me, what can we do to 
make you say.  I responded by saying, change the business 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 205 of 361 
 
processes, give us access to our finances, he responded 
and said, that’s never going to happen, so I shook his hand 
and I walked away.  My condition, precedent, so to say 
were two things that were not financially linked. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, just explain this because a third 
party reading the letter sees how you conclude it says, 
“It is with regret, from my side that this has not 
worked out”. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, which part of the letter? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Oh, the next page of the letter. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, before we go to the next page, I see 
on 
the 
4 t h 
paragraph, 
un-numbered 
paragraph, 
Ms 
Goodson, you say in the five months that we have been 
working together…[intervenes]. 
MS GOODSON:   I counted December because although I 
was still working at Anglo, I was so active with meetings 
that I had, what I deemed a working relationship, unofficial 
but a working relationship with Mr Angel. So, I counted it, 
including December and a little bit of November. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well even with December it would be 
20 
four months not five months, isn’t it? 
MS GOODSON:   But it counted a little bit of November as 
well, I round things up, Chair, sorry I always think, let me 
give the worst case scenario than the best. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, okay Mr Seleka, you said, 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 206 of 361 
 
which paragraph is it? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, the paragraph – if you turn the 
page, right at the end where – like your greetings, you say, 
 
“It’s 
with 
regret, 
from 
my 
side 
that 
this 
is…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry, if you go to the next paragraph 
the – the next page, the paragraphs are numbered, which 
paragraph number? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Are you paragraphs numbered, mine 
are not – right at the end Chair, just before…[intervenes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The letter of resignation, the one that 
starts at page 459.26? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Well, mine is on page 566, I’m looking 
it at page…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Does it start like,  in a working 
environment? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   “Hi Clive, in a working environment”? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is the first page and up to the 
20 
last two sentences or lines, it’s not numbered, then it 
starts to be numbered then – where she’s giving reasons, 
she says, 
“I will not be pursuing my career both in Trillion, for 
the following reasons”, 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 207 of 361 
 
 
Then she has got six reasons, those are the 
paragraphs I am saying are numbered. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, mine is un-numbered throughout. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How is that possible? 
MS GOODSON:   No, I did – there was numbering when I 
wrote the email, there was definitely numbering. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    I think, even her file, has an un-
numbered one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, you don’t have – so  your one is 
not authentic, she says they were numbered. 
10 
MS GOODSON:  It wasn’t every paragraph, but I think the 
reasons…[intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but where you set out the reasons, 
the paragraph which contains the reasons are numbered. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    I’m reading just above her name 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the – how does it start, the 
paragraph, from where you are reading? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    She writes, 
 
“It’s with regret”, 
20 
 
That’s at the end of the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, 
“It’s with regret, from my side that this has not 
worked out. I have tried, but my efforts alone will 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 208 of 361 
 
not rectify this.  I am not arrogant to think that, 
should expect an investment from you, so I’m out”. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, what was the question there? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    The question – it reads like a person 
who, as you say, you regret having to leave, you would 
rather want to stay. 
MS GOODSON:   The vision of Trillion, specifically when I 
was interviewed by Mr Essa back in Novemberish of 2015 
and what he said to me in that interview was echoed a lot 
by, also the McKinsey individuals as well as Mr Angel, that 
10 
the intention of this programme was to change Eskom and 
to make Eskom into a first world utility because it had the 
potential to be that way because years ago it used to be. 
Coming from the mining industry, I appreciate the impact 
that things like load shedding and a failing fleet of power 
stations can have on the economy. I wanted to be part of 
that difference that made it – I wanted to be part of the 
team that would make this country better and that is what I 
regret.  I regret that, that never happened and clearly by 
the time I left, it seemed as though that was never the 
20 
intention and it was very regrettable up until today.  I think 
Eskom should get that help and people that are in a 
position to help should help but not to extort money from it. 
So, I do regret that, what I initially signed up for, did not 
realise and up to today, years later, I carry that regret. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 209 of 361 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Ja, now, I have a challenge with the 
numbers, Chair, because there’s another paragraph I want 
to read from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You must just make sure that you – 
every bundle has got the version that where the reasons, 
the  …[indistinct] reasons are numbered. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, there’s …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because we now know from the author 
that the letter that she wrote had paragraph numbers in 
respect of the reasons. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, if we move from where I read, 
last Chair, a paragraph, one, two, three up which starts 
with, 
 
“Owing to the nature in which we get business”. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that’s paragraph – that’s reason 
number four, that’s paragraph four of the reasons. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, Ms Goodson it reads, 
“Owing to the nature in which we get business, the 
risk of exposure and reputation of damage is more 
than I can absorb”. 
20 
 
The risk here is different from, what is it, the Bank 
of Baroda. 
MS GOODSON:   Yes, the risk is different here, the risk 
that I’m referring…[intervenes]. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    This is more the type of – the way in 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 210 of 361 
 
which…[intervenes]. 
MS GOODSON:   This talks to, for example, the road show. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   This talks to the fact that you’ve got an 
individual that – and this individual being Mr Wood, in the 
span of two days introduced me to a Minister of the country 
and two CFO’s of two of the largest utilities in the country 
with ease.  That in order to secure work at the back of a 
really bad presentation, we have to work with someone like 
Mr Bobat.  There should never have been that sense of 
10 
success and in COGTA because I know what I presented 
and what I presented was – it was horrible but there’s the 
sense of success and progression and we’re already 
opening bank accounts because we’re going to be paying, 
what, R300million plus to some people in the Emirates.  
The cash flow is R10billion, these things were not meshing 
up. I know, from Anglo America, and I’m sorry that I keep 
referencing it, but the Anglo America, to earn R10billion in 
revenue, I understand and appreciate the extent of work 
that, that equates to and it’s a lot of work, it’s a lot of 
20 
mining, it’s a lot of people, it’s a lot of effort. This just 
seemed – it was – this just seemed too easy and it seemed 
wrong and I always maintained that I resigned on the basis 
of suspicion, that suspicion was confirmed a few days later 
and subsequent to that, since, almost every month, there’s 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 211 of 361 
 
news things on State Capture and I – the suspicions were 
just my value base and what my parents had instilled in me 
as what is right and wrong, and this felt wrong. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    In one sentence, what was your 
suspicion? 
MS GOODSON:   Now even? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Then, the suspicion that led you to 
resign? 
MS GOODSON:   The concept of tenderpreneurs getting 
work that you don’t deserve, so you’re just getting work 
10 
without really adding value, so it’s taking money from the 
State, to put it bluntly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    You continue to say, in that same 
paragraph,  
“I am not silly to know that contact with the Eskom 
Executives, people in COGTA, and other companies 
are precarious.  I find it most inconsistent that I’m 
the conduit to get work done with these individuals 
yet, still get your instruction on what to say, when 
to say it and via which medium.  The last I checked, 
20 
I can manage my own relationships, be part of 
discussions in which the rules of engagement are 
determined and trusted, enough to execute against 
them even in the most precarious situations”, 
 
So, you felt that you were just a conduit? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 212 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    When did you realise that? 
MS GOODSON:   Bank of Baroda was the straw that broke 
the camel’s back.  I had a lot of suspicions, the suspicions 
very gently started growing at things like the road show 
when you would sit in a meeting and say nothing but 
apparently, you’re important.  I mean, you know, why did I 
even need to be there, you know but the Bank of Baroda 
was the – was indisputable. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    You were saying earlier that it has 
10 
been said that you were in this for the money. 
MS GOODSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    If a comment is also made or an 
observation is also made, that – in the manner in which 
you are writing here, you either knew or ought to have 
known that something was amiss in this arrangement, what 
would be your comment? 
MS GOODSON:   I can only answer that question now in 
hindsight and with what I know.  I can’t pretend like I’ve 
not watched the Commission over the past two years, I 
20 
can’t pretend that I didn’t follow the Parliamentary Inquiry 
into Eskom.  So, what I know now, I’m ashamed that I did 
not do more. I should have pushed back on Clive’s 
instructions more.  I shouldn’t have taken that invoice of 
R30.6million to Mr Koko and spoke to them about paying 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 213 of 361 
 
Trillion directly.  I shouldn’t have opened the Bank of 
Baroda account because I know it was used to siphon 
Transnet’s money off to Tegeta.  There’s a lot of things that 
I shouldn’t have done, I was in this company for three 
months too long and it’s ruined my life. I should have 
spoken up more but whenever I think about it, I am 
comforted by the fact that it was only three months. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    It was what? 
MS GOODSON:   It was only three months, so it’s difficult.  
There’s a lot more that I probably could have done to stop 
10 
this. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    I have also observed or rather read 
your letter or email to Mr Clive Angel and Tebogo Leballo 
which, Chair, you find on page 566.6. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just tell me the page number again, just 
tell me the page number again? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Oh no, that’s not the document I’m 
looking for, no it’s not the document I’m looking for.  When 
your went to – at this time, this is 2015 when you are 
headhunted and you, ultimately, get employed, there were 
20 
media reports, news, about the Gupta’s, Mr Salim Essa’s 
relations with the Gupta’s. 
MS GOODSON:   I don’t know about Mr Salim Essa but the 
Guptas for sure, the Waterkloof landing was in the public

ADV SELEKA SC:    The what? 
MS GOODSON:   The Waterkloof landing. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   Was in the public domain but Mr Essa – I 
recall, specifically, even trying to Google him before 
meeting him and there wasn’t a lot about him in the public 
domain when I on boarded. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes. 
MS GOODSON:   At the time I resigned, there was. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    By the time you resigned? 
10 
MS GOODSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    So, prior to you resigning there was? 
MS GOODSON:   There were small – prior to me resigning, 
for example, the articles about the special advisors was in 
the public domain, for example. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes, you didn’t go into this job, well 
knowing what was going on? 
MS GOODSON:   No, I didn’t. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry I am – there is something I am 
looking at, at the resignation letter. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I may have missed something please 
tell me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No I am giving you time Chair to 
...[intervenes]  
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 215 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no I was just trying to follow something 
on the – on the letter here.  Ms Goodson on some parts of 
the letter and I have not finished checking.  On some parts 
of the letter it seems – one gets the impression that the most 
important consideration that led to your resignation was that 
you 
were 
feeling 
that 
you 
were 
not 
given 
space 
to 
meaningfully participate in decision making.  Is that correct? 
MS GOODSON:  That is correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS GOODSON:  I was told what to do.  I was instructed.  I 
thought I was coming into new position of leadership where 
my skills and expertise would be used to build the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS GOODSON:  And that did not happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS GOODSON:  I was – I believe I was lied to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes.  Ja because that comes across 
on certain parts.  You say at page 459.26 you are unaware of 
20 
what motivates me.  Oh no, no, you start earlier on by 
saying: 
“My strength – my strengths experience, 
ability, loyalty and competence have not yet 
come to – come out in this organisation 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 216 of 361 
 
because 
through 
you 
my 
opinion, 
recommendation 
and 
views 
are 
not 
requested.” 
MS GOODSON:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in the next paragraph you say in part: 
“You are – that is now you are talking to – you are writing to 
him – Mr Angel. 
“You are unaware of what motivates me nor 
what 
causes 
concern 
because 
our 
discussions are mere receiving instructions 
10 
and feedback from you.  I have tried to 
establish a relationship with you with no 
success.” 
And then – and then in paragraph 459.27 that is the reason 
you give for your decision to resign.  After the few lines you 
say: 
“I believe in the opportunity but I have very 
little faith at leadership.  Would you not care 
for my opinion will care to put my interest 
first.  Trillian has shown their hand.  This is 
20 
not a priority.  In five months this should 
have been a priority to retain and motivate 
me and knowing that I took on this job for the 
incentive.  How long can I be expected to 
work on faith?  For me that time has come 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 217 of 361 
 
and I am done.” 
Maybe there are more.  But the reason why I ask this while 
obviously it is important it does not come across as saying I 
do not want to be involved in the kind of activities that I think 
this company is involved in.  That is why I am leaving. 
MS GOODSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it may well be that looking at this 
paragraph or these excerpts like that is unfair when one has 
regard to the other reasons you give. So – but I am just 
putting that to you to say what – what would you say if 
10 
somebody says well those parts at least do not come across 
like you are saying I have experienced the type of business 
you are engaged in.  I do not want to be part of it even if you 
were to seek my opinion to seek me to be part of decision 
making if this is the type of business you do I will not be part 
of it.  It comes across as if at least I felt that I was – my 
opinions were respected and I was given a meaningful role in 
decision making then maybe I would stay. What would you 
say if somebody says that is how it comes across? 
MS GOODSON:  I think the way that you say it is a hundred 
20 
percent correct.  I think that – I agree with you that there is 
a disjoint between what I have told you my reasons were for 
leaving and what my resignation letter says and that disjoin 
is deliberate and with intention.  And the reason for that is 
because in my resignation letter I could only reference 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 218 of 361 
 
things that I knew.   
I did not – I suspected that the business activities of 
Trillian were wrong but I did not have proof.  I have later 
come to realise things that were very, very wrong with this 
company and everything else that it has done I later come to 
realise what this Bank of – this Bank of Baroda account took 
pensioner’s money from Transnet to pay for Tegeta.   
I had been admitted into a psychiatric hospital when I 
found that out.  I did not know that when I opened the 
accounts.  I did not know Mark Pamensky was on the Eskom 
10 
board until later.  I did not know that this company was used 
to siphon money out to Gupta entities.  I did not know.   
And I felt that if I just put all my suspicions in a 
resignation letter and even I read it to myself I felt that I 
would sound crazy.  So the only thing that I could reference 
to motivate me leaving and I also was very strategic in that I 
did not want them coming back to saying I did not want to 
give them a reason where they could say okay but Bianca if 
we give you this then you must stay.  That is why there is a 
five or six reasons there.  They could never address all 
20 
those concerns.   
I was never going to come back no matter what they 
offered me.  But I have to use examples of things that I knew 
at the time only and that is why there is this disjoin. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Mr Seleka. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 219 of 361 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said you were done or there is 
something arising? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja let me just add to that Ms Goodson.  It 
is a split screen image here.  You get one reason and then 
you get the other.   
MS GOODSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Like this paragraph I think where the 
Chairperson was reading just before your reasons it says: 
“If our relationship was more respectful and 
10 
transparent my perception towards the issues 
listed below would have been dealt with 
within 
the 
boundaries 
of 
a 
trustworthy 
relationship and in all likelihood not even 
perceived as risk.  With a good relationship I 
would almost blindly support you as my 
leader.” 
MS GOODSON:  Chair absolutely please can I explain? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS GOODSON:  If there was – if – because I am talking 
20 
about a hypothetical example there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS GOODSON:  If there was a transparent relationship.  If 
there was a transparent relationship and somebody told me 
that Trillian was being used to siphon money out I would 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 220 of 361 
 
have pushed back. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  No you said to a blind support. 
MS GOODSON:  No not under any circumstances.  I said if I 
knew. It is predicated on it being transparent.  It does mean 
that the transparency must be some forms of illegality and I 
will be okay with it.  Absolutely not.  So if I knew … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS GOODSON:  I could at least have had a conversation 
with Clive to say but why can we not try the right way?  Why 
can we not try and just do RFP’s?  Why can we not work in 
10 
the private sector?  Why is it only public sector?  I could 
have pushed back.  I could have actually said this is totally 
illegal are you aware of what you doing?  If it was a 
transparent relationship.  I could have – but it was not.  And 
if those answers – this is me giving him the benefit of the 
doubt – if the answers were legitimate to those questions 
that I would have raised I would have and I accepted the 
reason as being something that I maybe just did not 
understand or something that I maybe just did not get or 
there is more information that I did not have I would have 
20 
been loyal to the cause.  I am still giving them the benefit of 
the doubt that there was no corruption at this point because I 
personally could not prove it.  And if… 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MS GOODSON:  My suspicions – if there was a rational and 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 221 of 361 
 
reasonable reason which there could have been maybe or 
why 
these 
things 
happened 
we 
could 
have 
had 
a 
conversation about it and if it was reasonable we could have 
moved on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
MS GOODSON:  No illegal.  I did not say I would blindly 
follow them if it was illegal. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Hm.  Ja you see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let me tell you what my understanding 
of the phrase almost blindly supports is and you can tell me 
10 
what you have to say about it or you may offer a different 
meaning.  You say I would almost blindly support you as my 
leader.   
 
If you did not put in the word almost there you would 
have said I would blindly support you as my leader.  Now 
that would have meant in my book that no matter what 
weaknesses, no matter what bad things the leader did you 
would just support if you did not put in almost okay because 
it seems to me it says I would overlook whatever you did that 
I might not otherwise have been happy with and just support 
20 
you blindly. 
 
Now your letter does not say blindly support it says 
almost and I want to say to you that seems to come very 
close to blindly support without almost. 
MS GOODSON:  True. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 222 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that seems to suggest there would be 
lots of things you could overlook. 
MS GOODSON:  Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you agree with that interpretation? 
MS GOODSON:  I would agree with that interpretation and I 
am so grateful that I am here to provide context. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, ja. 
MS GOODSON:  For that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please do that ja. 
MS GOODSON:  But I do agree with your interpretation if I 
10 
am allowed to give you an example?  In my previous position 
in Anglo American my manager, my direct manager was not 
based here she was based in London and she had access to 
the Invesco and the board of Anglo American I did a lot of 
work 
that 
was 
presented 
to 
those 
committees 
and 
I 
presented them myself.  
 
There was a lot of times when my manager would 
come to me and she would say something like Bianca you 
need to do this is South America and I would ask why and 
she was like look I cannot explain to you now but please just 
20 
trust me and I would do it.  I would trust her.  And it would 
eventually come out and she says okay now I can explain.  
This is what the plan was.  There was a strategy behind it, 
we could not share the information at the time but ultimately 
that information would come back and there would al – or 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 223 of 361 
 
sometimes you cannot know everything beforehand and you 
sometimes do have to trust people that are your leaders and 
I have done that and I have always worked for highly 
integrous people.  People with the utmost – utmost integrity 
and ethics and I had no reason to ever think that my 
employer would ever, ever put me in a position that would be 
bad for me.  I have never ever worked for anybody like that 
until I worked for Trillian.   
 
So the context of the word blindly is assuming that 
you are working with ethical people and people with integrity 
10 
which I always had and I have been very fortunate to have 
until this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course if it is blind support you will 
not see even when there is no integrity. 
MS GOODSON:  No a hundred percent but like I did I mean 
you know in my previous example there were things that my 
– my technical director of Anglo would say Bianca please do 
this for me I will explain to you later.  And you blindly do it 
without understanding or sometimes all of the context 
because you trust the relationship.  That was not the case 
20 
here.  But that is the way that I meant it.  I am not – I am 
saying that your assessment of reading it literally is a 
hundred percent correct Chair but the way that I intended it 
was different and I am grateful that I can explain it to you.  I 
would never ever look the other eye for something that has 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 224 of 361 
 
costing this country billions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The – perhaps the last one also to give 
you a chance to explain is the reason in the paragraph 
numbered 2 on the next – numbered 9 so it would be the 
next page and it reads: 
“The risks associated with this position and 
specifically with the shareholders of this 
company are exceptionally high succinctly 
put my career would be over if there was 
10 
ever a public association between myself, Mo 
Bobat, Gupta’s and or Salim.  These risks 
are not worth taking without having sight on 
reward.” 
MS GOODSON:  A hundred percent. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   
“So I am prepared I am not prepared to 
absorb them anymore.” 
You understand? 
MS GOODSON:  Yes absolutely. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So the risks… 
MS GOODSON:  I am standing by my resignation letter one 
hundred percent. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  The risks… 
MS GOODSON:  So I will give you my context. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 225 of 361 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Chair did you see that one.  The 
risk are not worth taking without having sight on reward. 
MS GOODSON:  One hundred percent. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But here you knew about the Gupta’s.  
Mo Bobat, Gupta’s and or Salim. 
MS GOODSON:  Ja so by this time by the time that I was 
resigning in March. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay. 
MS GOODSON:  The media had picked up momentum. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Let me say this.  Ja before you answer. 
10 
MS GOODSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Let me say this.  The way you make it 
sound there is the carrot you are giving me is not big enough 
to make me take the risk. 
MS GOODSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You give me a bigger one I will take the 
risk. 
MS GOODSON:  (Inaudible). 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I will stay and take the risks and almost 
blindly follow you also let us stick to this one. 
20 
MS GOODSON:  Gee 00:17:29 have you ever thought this 
would happen at this resignation letter when I wrote it that 
morning.  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is that what you were meaning there? 
MS GOODSON:  No.   
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 226 of 361 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  If I give you – if you up my reward I will 
take the risk. 
MS GOODSON:  That is not what I mean.  That is not what I 
mean and again I demonstrated in the fact that if I wanted 
more money I would have asked Eric when he offered me 
what can we do to keep you.  I would have just said okay 
give me R4million a year.  I had that opportunity and I did 
not do it.  What I meant in this specific clause or in this 
specific paragraph was that the scales are not balanced and 
I am not saying that the scales should be balanced I was 
10 
trying to articulate the fact that this was just completely 
ludicrous.   
 
At that time the risk associated with the Gupta’s was 
very well established in the media and there was in my 
opinion there was no reward ever that could actually make 
that risk worth it.  I did say that it is not worth it because it 
was not.  For me particularly I lost so much.  I had taken a 
salary cut I subsequently lost my career. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You took a salary cut when? 
MS GOODSON:  When I joined Trillian. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So why then did you join? 
MS GOODSON:  Because I believed in the opportunity.  I 
honestly thought that this company and I believe that this 
company was going to make a difference at Eskom. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you really believe that? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 227 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:  I really did and very soon after I joined I 
realised that that was not – it did not look like it was going to 
happen and it started show – that started showing me for 
example through the acrimony with McKinsey.  But the 
intention to reduce or to create 00:19:23 and procurement to 
increase the efficiencies of the power plant those are not 
unrealistic.  That is – Eskom still has that issue now with 
maintenance and I thought that there was a chance where I 
could be part of the team who actually could effect that 
change and I – I have said this to the commission already it 
10 
was me being naïve I guess. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let me read to you one or two parts 
that you may like better than maybe some of the ones that 
we have been raising. 
MS GOODSON:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Under your ad-reason for resigning you 
say: 
“Originally I thought that this job would 
culminate in networks that could be leverage 
20 
because my tenure at Trillian.  It is obvious 
to me now that those networks will be 
politicised although not much may humble 
career 
history 
has 
been 
established 
on 
bloody hard work and integrity.  I would 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 228 of 361 
 
rather have a future career defined by those 
attributes than a politically connected one.  
So from my side this job in effect is more 
detrimental for my future and the networks 
that I will come – that will come from this 
position.  I am not networks that I will 
willingly 00:21:14 future.” 
Well in the – in reason number 4 there seems to be quite a 
bit which – which you say there that seems to relate to your 
complaint that you were not – your opinion was not 
10 
appreciated or you were not being allowed to take part in 
decision making.  You say in part: 
“I find it most inconsistent that I am the 
conduit 
to 
get 
work 
done 
with 
these 
individuals yet still get your instruction on 
what to say, when to say it and via which 
medium.  The last I checked I can manage 
my 
own 
relationships. 
 
The 
part 
of 
discussions in which the roles of engagement 
are 
determined 
and 
trusted 
enough 
to 
20 
execute them even in the most precarious 
situations.” 
And then you say: 
“I am more than someone who gets the tail of 
discussions and then is responsible for the 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 229 of 361 
 
high risk and high exposure work to get 
things moving. I am resigning because I do 
not believe that you are looking out for me 
through this risky relationships.” 
That part might be more in line with what we have been 
raising with you. 
MS GOODSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it seems to say if only you can do 
what is necessary to ensure that these risks that you expect 
me to take are manageable. 
10 
MS GOODSON:  Ja I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am just putting my understanding to 
them. 
MS GOODSON:  Please just also remember it took me four 
hours to write that letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. No, no. 
MS GOODSON:  And it was ten versions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I understand. 
MS GOODSON:  Ten I have tried all these permutations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I understand and then the last one I think 
20 
or two that I want to read.  The one is in reason number 5 
towards the end it says: 
“My 
completely 
00:23:57 
team 
has 
shareholding in TCP you and their risk 
reward offered is different to mine.  So 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 230 of 361 
 
please 
know 
that 
I 
will 
not 
be 
legally 
responsible for other people’s actions.  If my 
leadership expects this of me my reward has 
to be of such a nature that my family will be 
supported in the event that I am not able to 
do it. This reward structure has not been 
approached as a priority although the risks 
are immediate.  I will not be absorbing this 
risk any longer.” 
Yes and I think in paragraph 6 you – or in reason 6 at least 
10 
in part you go back to not being included in decision making.  
I guess the – you have said what you – what you can say or 
is there anything you want to say? 
MS GOODSON:  There is a lot of things that can be read into 
my resignation Chair that was emotive.  That was not 
planned.  In one day my family . 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I see that … 
MS GOODSON:  All over 00:25:22. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I see that it reflects 5:58 am. 
MS GOODSON:  I told you I woke up at two o’clock in the 
20 
morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS GOODSON:  And I sent – (inaudible). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you said it was – the one you sent was 
version number 10. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 231 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS GOODSON:  It was not easy to write that.  I have never 
ever left a company on that basis. I have never ever only 
worked for three months.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS GOODSON:  Even now I still get emotional when I think 
about this experience was horrendous.  So I guess what I 
can say is this there is a lot of things that could be read into 
the resignation letter but what you certainly can do is look at 
10 
my actions instead.  I never went back to Trillian.  I did not 
wait for them to push out I resigned.  And I went – I walked 
away and as soon as I could I helped law enforcement 
agencies.   
 
The first person that I helped that approached me 
was the Public Protector.  After that it was Mr Budlender, 
after that it was the Parliamentary Inquiry.  I have become a 
walking evidence docket ever since blowing the whistle and 
my life has been ruined.  So as much as people may want to 
look at the resignation letter and tear it apart what I 
20 
subsequently done since resigning speaks a lot more 
volumes than what can be misinterpreted in that letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But part of what you are saying is whoever 
reads the letter must have regard to the entire context and 
background. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 232 of 361 
 
MS GOODSON:  The background and also subsequent 
actions after submitting it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the subsequent actions. 
MS GOODSON:  One hundred percent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you woke up at two am, you woke up 
your partner, you had made up your mind you wanted to 
resign. 
MS GOODSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you – you worked – so you must have 
worked on it for  
10 
MS GOODSON:  Four hours. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For quite a few hours.  Ja. 
MS GOODSON:  And I could not find the right thing to say 
because I could not prove it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja and you have to find – find words 
to express yourself to your satisfaction on why you were 
resigning. 
MS GOODSON:  One hundred percent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and – and ultimately this is the version 
that you sent. 
20 
MS GOODSON:  Chair I would like to just remind you that 
when I came back from Durban and I met with Mr Wood he 
asked me what could he do to make me stay.  I did not ask 
him for money, I did not ask him for anything that would 
elevate my status in any way.  I asked him to change the 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 233 of 361 
 
business processes.  And he said emphatically that will 
never happen.  I shook his hand and I left.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS GOODSON:  There is a procedural issue which – with 
Trillian that was an issue and if they had people like me in 
their leadership doing the right kind of work this would never 
have ever have happened.  Because people with integrity 
like me do not do things like this to the country. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Thank you.  Are you? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I am done.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are done? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I am done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Ms Goodson for 
making time to come and assist the commission. 
MS GOODSON:  Chair can I say two things before we end? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS GOODSON:  Just one thing sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MS GOODSON:  That I would just like to use the opportunity 
to just ask you very sincerely and respectfully.  Yesterday 
there was a report that was released by an institution called 
the IBA which is the International Bar Association.  And they 
did a survey on – global survey on whistleblower protection 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 234 of 361 
 
laws across the world and South Africa is ranked incredibly 
low on that survey and its made public and I could send you 
guys the link.  And as somebody who blew the whistle both 
publicly as well as anonymously to help the fight against 
corruption and state capture I realise and I have lived 
through what a huge impact it can have on whistleblowers 
and I just say just respectfully just would like to ask you to 
consider that in your recommendations when you are done.  
That is the first thing.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sure Mr Seleka will try and get to 
10 
that publication for the commission. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you – now that you have said that you 
remind me and I will say to you what I said to Ms Mothepu 
when she appeared before the commission I am very 
interested in looking at the adequacy or otherwise of 
protection or whistleblowers in South Africa. 
MS GOODSON:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it seems to me that providing a lot of 
protection to whistleblowers is a critical pillar to meaningful 
20 
fight against corruption.   
MS GOODSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If – if you – if you have a very good regime 
of protection of whistleblowers as a country you stand a 
good chance that people who want to blow the whistle when 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 235 of 361 
 
they are aware of corruption will find it easy to do so. 
MS GOODSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if people who want to engage in 
corruption know that there are good chances that somebody 
will blow the whistle that does contribute to deterrence. 
MS GOODSON:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you – the country needs to have good 
and a strong regime of protection of whistleblowers because 
1. That will enable people to blow the whistle in regard to 
corruption. 
10 
2. It will serve – it will contribute to a deterrence for those 
who want to engage in corruption.  The next thing you 
want is that those who get involved in corruption must 
know that when the whistle has been blown by 
somebody the law enforcement agencies have a good 
chance of doing a proper job to investigate and to 
catching them – of catching them. 
And then the third thing is that they will be prosecuted. 
MS GOODSON:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if found guilty sent to jail.  So that is 
20 
very critical.  If any of these pillars is weak it compromises 
the fight against corruption.  So I do have people within the 
commission or people that are looking into this issue. 
MS GOODSON:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And just as I invited Ms Mothepu I would 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 236 of 361 
 
invite you and anyone else listening or watching who would 
like to make submissions as to the adequacy or otherwise of 
our regime for the protection of whistleblowers and what 
proposals can be made to the commission to say this is what 
it should propose should change in the law or in some 
practices and so on and so on so that in the report we could 
have a section that deals with how the pillar of protection of 
whistleblowers 
can 
be 
strengthened 
if 
it 
needs 
that 
strengthening.  So you can also make a contribution by 
sending submissions to the commission. 
10 
MS GOODSON:  Thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS GOODSON:  If that was in – if that was in place when I 
blew the whistle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS GOODSON:  My life would be very different right now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS GOODSON:  But Chair there is just one last thing that I 
would just like to say.  I am have to represent my family I am 
00:03:41 sit here and I just do want to say that on behalf of 
20 
my family and especially in light of the business day report 
or the business day headline that came out today I would 
just like to thank you and your commission for what you are 
all doing.  I think you will have a thankless job and I – if I 
was in your position I would have fatigue by now and I just 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 237 of 361 
 
want to encourage you to carry on and I just want to say 
thank you for what you are doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Mr 
Seleka who are the witnesses for tomorrow just for the 
benefit of the public? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  This is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or is it – is it another work stream? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  It is a different work stream tomorrow 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I will have to check.  Can you 
10 
remember which work stream? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I am asking Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I normally know. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes I know.  I am asking my … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and where I am sure the – the 
Secretariat has issued a media statement or something 
advising the public – that is fine.  Oh I think Reverend 
Stamela might be … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  But I understand Chair you have an 
evening session. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I do have an evening session ja.  Oh I 
think – I thought the Reverend might have been conveying. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Not to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine.  We are going to 
adjourn tomorrow will – the commission will be sitting but I 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 238 of 361 
 
am going to have an evening session starting at I think at 
five.  We adjourn. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I thought it was going to 
take just a few minutes.  It turned out that it was 
something that needed more time.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we may proceed. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Chair, at this stage, may we draw 
your attention, please, to the fact that the supplementary 
statement I mentioned earlier, has now come to hand? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I, with your leave, hand that up 
to you? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And ask that it be added to Bundle 
Denel 8 at page 483.1?  Perhaps the registrar would be 
able to assist. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Mantsha, may I 
ask if you could please look in that bundle at page 483.1? 
MR MANTSHA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You have that? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 239 of 361 
 
MR MANTSHA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, 483.1.  You need to switch on 
your microphone as well when you get the chance. 
MR MANTSHA:   Thank you.  I see 483. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, I said 483.1.  It is not 483.  It is 
483.1.  I was told it is in your bundle immediately after 
483. 
MR MANTSHA:   Is it number 35 by the marker? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Page 483 has got somebody has 
marked it as 35.  Yes, that is 483. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Remember to look at the top left black 
numbers on the page. 
MR MANTSHA:   Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Ja, but just after that document.  Do 
you have a document marked Denel-08-483.1? 
MR MANTSHA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It is a simple question.  Do you have 
that or not Mr Mantsha? 
MR MANTSHA:   483.1? 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR MANTSHA:   I see the supplementary statement.  Is 
this the one? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, we are going to deal with what it 
is in a moment.  Have you got 483.1? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 240 of 361 
 
MR MANTSHA:   Yes, I do. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  And that is headed 
supplementary statement.  Correct? 
MR MANTSHA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And it goes for three pages and on 
page 483.3, it bears your signature.  Is that right? 
MR MANTSHA:   That is correct.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And I see you swore it before a 
commissioner of oaths on Monday, the 1 s t of March.  Is that 
right? 
10 
MR MANTSHA:   That is correct.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I have noticed, in all your affidavits, 
the commissioner has recorded that your swore the oath 
but in your oral evidence you have given an affirmation.   
Are we clear that whether you took an oath or an 
affirmation?  You have confirmed on your conscience that 
all of the evidence, both in the affidavit, the statements 
and in your oral evidence are the truth? 
MR MANTSHA:   Indeed Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  Thank you.  And then Chair I 
20 
am not proposing to take the witness through all of the 
contents.  But just indicate, Mr Mantsha, correct me if I am 
wrong ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Do 
you 
want 
me 
– 
before 
that 
Mr Kennedy. 
 
Would 
you 
like 
me 
to 
admit 
this 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 241 of 361 
 
...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I was about to get to that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   If I may just ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   ...indicate to you what it contains? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It just contains references to a 
couple of passages in his earlier affidavit, the very first 
one, which is ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   ...is now corrected. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And I do not propose to take him 
through ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, no, no.  I, when I was looking at 
his earlier statement last night, I saw the notes I have 
made where he made corrections and I remember that the 
past 
two 
supplementary 
affidavits 
to 
effect 
those 
corrections. 
20 
ADV KENNEY SC:   I am afraid your voice keeps going off 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ah, okay.  I think, I am saying, you do 
not need to go ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 242 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...take me through them. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I remember the corrections. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So we will not take him through it 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it is not necessary. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   May I then formally move for your 
leave Chair to admit this as an exhibit from page 483.1 in 
10 
Bundle-03 and that it should be admitted as Exhibit W-
22.4? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The supplementary affidavit of Mr Simon 
Daniel Mantsha, starting at page 483.1 is admitted and will 
be marked as Exhibit W-22. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   22.4. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you very much Chair. 
SUPPLEMENTARY 
AFFIDAVIT 
OF 
SIMON 
DANIEL 
MANTSHA, STARTING AT PAGE 483.1 IS ADMITTED AND 
20 
WILL BE MARKED AS EXHIBIT W-22 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now Mr Mantsha, just before the 
adjournment I had to – I was referring you to a passage in 
one of your statement.  If you could turn, please, in the 
same bundle to page 334? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 243 of 361 
 
MR MANTSHA:   I am there Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now I was reading out, if I recall 
correctly, the top part of that page and that was dealing 
with a call that you had while you were in London with Mr 
Saloojee and you had a call that members of the Audit and 
Risk Committee were having a problem.  They tried to 
convene a meeting of a committee but they were refused 
access to the boardroom by the Company Secretary.  You 
recall receiving that call? 
MR MANTSHA:   Indeed Chairperson. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And you said at the top of your 
affidavit at 332, you recollection is that...  I beg your 
pardon.  Just a moment.  I am sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then I read out to you the next 
passage that they called you and you intervened and you 
had a discussion with Mr Saloojee.  Is that right? 
MR MANTSHA:   It is correct Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And in the next paragraph it says: 
“The Company Secretary... 
20 
 
We are talking about Ms Africa, correct? 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   “...that she was instructed by 
someone not to allow the Audit and Risk Committee to do 
its work...” 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 244 of 361 
 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that the perception that you picked 
up or is that what you were told? 
MR MANTSHA:   Well, Chairperson, I actually found it very 
strange that the person in a position of a Company 
Secretary would refuse access of...  You know, the 
Company Secretary is basically an employee of the board.  
Would refuse access of members of the board to have 
access to a meeting room on her own.  So I, you know, my 
perception was she probably – she is not alone. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And so did you understand that she 
had been instructed by somebody in particular to refuse 
them access? 
MR MANTSHA:   Well, I, of course, did not have any 
specific name who might have instructed her to refuse 
access. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But you believed that, because it 
seemed to you that she must have been instructed by 
someone.  Are you referring here to Mr Saloojee? 
MR MANTSHA:   Well, I was seated next to Mr Saloojee. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR MANTSHA:   And when I got this call I said:  Mr 
Saloojee, this is the situation. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, my question is. Did you think 
that this someone that you are referring to ...[intervenes]  
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 245 of 361 
 
MR MANTSHA:   No. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   ...was Mr Saloojee? 
MR MANTSHA:   No, I had no reason to think it was Mr 
Saloojee. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   You do not know who it was? 
MR MANTSHA:   I do not know who it was. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  But – would you agree though 
that to the extent that Ms Africa apparently refuse access 
to members of the Audit and Risk Committee to the 
boardroom 
that 
sounded 
serious. 
 That 
is 
why 
you 
10 
intervened.  Correct? 
MR MANTSHA:   Of course, very serious. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  And then, if I can just 
complete reading the passage.  It says: 
“After it, I explained the situation to Mr 
Saloojee. 
He then spoke to the Company Secretary...” 
 
Was that on the phone? 
MR MANTSHA:   On the phone, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
20 
“...and it was then that the members of the 
Audio and Risk Committee were given access 
to a meeting room.” 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now is this the incident that informs 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 246 of 361 
 
us when we see on the other page we looked at a moment 
ago, the insubordination complaint against Ms Africa.  Is 
this what it has to do with? 
MR MANTSHA:   It was inter alia one of the allegations. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I see. 
MR MANTSHA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So there were other allegations of 
insubordination as well against her? 
MR MANTSHA:   Well, indeed Chair because ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Try to lean forward, please. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, do not move away from the mic. 
MR MANTSHA:   Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTSHA:   Thank you Chairperson.  Yes, there were 
several allegations.  One of it, the records of the meeting 
of the 10 t h of September, we had to scramble through.  So 
there were a number of complaints and there were, you 
know in general, she was very dismissive of the members 
of the board.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was the date of the meeting?  Was 
it 10 September, the meeting where you say members of 
the Risk and Audit Committee were denied access to the 
boardroom?  Was that on the 10 t h of September? 
MR MANTSHA:   No, Chairperson, the 10 t h of September is 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 247 of 361 
 
where members of the Risk and Audit Committee were 
mandated by the board ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
MR MANTSHA:   ...to investigate the transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
MR MANTSHA:   And thereafter they arranged their 
meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTSHA:   I do not have a specific date but at that 
time ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTSHA:   ...when they convened that meeting 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTSHA:   ...I and Mr Saloojee, we were not around. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were in London? 
MR MANTSHA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  I think it may have been 20 
something, maybe, but I am not sure.  Okay alright.  Maybe 
I may as well ask this question.  In terms of the hierarchy 
20 
of the employees in the company, where would the 
Company Secretary’s place be in terms of the hierarchy, 
seniority? 
MR MANTSHA:   Well, in terms of the structure, the 
Company Secretary is an employee of the board.  So it is a 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 248 of 361 
 
board, non-executive members and executive members of 
the board and then there is Company Secretary.  The 
board’s non-executive and executive, they constitute a 
board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MANTSHA:   And then the chief executive and CFO and 
other executives, they constitute a Management Team.  So 
Company Secretary is an employee of the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTSHA:   So it would be incorrect to say the 
10 
Company Secretary reports to the Chief Executive Officer 
but because of the nature of the work situation where the 
Company Secretary resides within the company and the 
Chief Executive Officer being the ultimate head of the 
company. 
 
S there is regular contact in terms of preparing 
the board presentations, submissions, convening the board 
meetings, calling for meetings and all of that.  So I do not 
know whether Chair I answered your question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You tried.  [laughs]  And maybe you tried 
20 
your best.  No, what I was thinking is.  When you were 
suspecting that she had been instructed...  I think it was a 
she, is that correct? 
MR MANTSHA:   Indeed Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  She was instructed – I am trying to 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 249 of 361 
 
think who you – who could have had the power to instruct 
her if the Group Chief Executive was not the one but from 
what you say, I am not sure whether she is below the 
Group Chief Executive.   
 
You seem to suggest that she might not be but 
for practical purposes, maybe it looks like that.  So in 
relation to the Group Chief Executive, where would the 
Company Secretary be, if you know? 
MR MANTSHA:   Well, in terms of that direct line 
...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTSHA:   ...from the Chief Executive Officer.  So 
the 
Company 
Secretary 
does 
not 
feature 
because 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTSHA:   ...she is on another line that comes from 
the board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so ...[intervenes]  
MR MANTSHA:   She comes from the Executive Authority, 
...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTSHA:   ...the board, the Company Secretary 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTSHA:   ...and then it gets to the Chief Executive 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 250 of 361 
 
Officer and all sorts of things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Would it be correct then to say, at 
least on your understanding of the hierarchy or the 
seniority, the only people who could instruct her could only 
be people from the board, board members or otherwise 
nobody would have the power to instruct her as such? 
MR MANTSHA:   I think Chair, with respect, if I can just 
give a little bit of context? 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MANTSHA:   The meeting of the 10 t h of September, it 
10 
actually got very tense when actually board members 
realised that they are sitting on a time bomb because they 
had to pay 455 in a week or two.  So it actually got very 
tense.   
 
And of course, as even other reports have 
indicated, the demeanour of the executive, I am referring 
to CFO and CE and the Company Secretary, they were not 
in the opinion of the board members taking the board 
members who were new, by the way, having their first 
meeting in confidence.   
20 
 
So that was the feeling and there were a number 
of questions why you have a situation like this.  So it got 
very tense.   
 
So when myself and Mr Saloojee left, we left a 
very tense situation where we actually realised that if 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 251 of 361 
 
something is not done within these two weeks, we are 
going to have a very catastrophic situation in the country 
because we were going to be fault to pay the R 455 million. 
 
And that would mean, any bond holder in these 
state-owned companies, they can call upon their board 
because the result of that would be a cross default. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I am going to interrupt you 
Mr Mantsha.  It may be that that context and that 
background is important but I am not sure that it helps me 
to 
understand 
who 
could 
have 
given 
the 
Company 
10 
Secretary – who had power to give the Company Secretary 
instructions because that is my question because you said 
you thought or suspected that she had been instructed or 
something like that.   
 
So now I was wondering if – who it is who could 
instruct her and you have excluded the Group CEO from 
people who might have done that.   
MR MANTSHA:   With respect Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MANTSHA:   If I just put these factual situation before 
20 
you.  A call is then made to the Company Secretary by the 
then Group Chief Executive Officer to say:  Well, there is a 
complaint that you are stopping people from accessing the 
boardroom.  And the consequence of that, people were 
given access.   
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 252 of 361 
 
 
So I think – I am not going to speculate on 
basically who but the impression I got which I still have, 
even as I am talking to you, she could to have done that 
without talking to someone else. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you do not know who that person is. 
MR MANTSHA:   I cannot take it further, more than that 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Would I be correct in understanding 
that the, that this complaint and the related complaints of 
10 
insubordination on the part of Ms Africa were a matter of 
serious concern?  This was not a minor issue, correct? 
MR MANTSHA:   Indeed Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Thank you.  And just to 
complete our reference to this page 334. In paragraph 12, 
you refer to the acquisition of LSSA for the R 855 million.  
And in paragraph 13, you say and I think this bears out 
what you gave evidence on a moment ago: 
“The Audit and Risk Committee was mandated 
by the board to urgently address the emanate 
20 
default by Denel to pay R 455 million bridging 
finance to Nedbank which was during a week 
or 
two 
after 
the 
board 
meeting 
of 
the 
10 t h of September 2015...” 
 
Does this refer to what you mentioned earlier 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 253 of 361 
 
that 
the 
board 
had 
the 
first 
meeting 
on 
the 
10 t h of September 2015, 
mandated 
the Audit 
and 
Risk 
Committee to investigate this? 
MR MANTSHA:   Indeed Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And then you continue: 
“...and Denel was not in a position to pay that 
amount when due and payable and it was that 
R 400 million 
which 
was 
borrowed 
from 
Nedbank as bridging finance and paid into 
LSSA which by enlarge contributed to the 
10 
liquidity problems at Denel...” 
 
On your latest supplementary affidavit, that has 
just been admitted by the Chairperson, you have corrected 
the R 400 million to read R 455 million which is consistent 
with what you said earlier about this was the shortfall. 
MR MANTSHA:   Thank you Chairperson.  It is correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  So let me just sum up and 
my understanding of your evidence so far then on this 
point is this, that the suspension of Mr Saloojee and 
Mr Mhlonthlo related to the LSSA transaction and the 
20 
terrible risks that it was bringing about in relation to 
hundreds of millions of rands that were short and that led 
Denel into a liquidity crisis or contributed largely, you said 
elsewhere, to a liquidity crisis.  Is that correct? 
MR MANTSHA:   That is correct Chairperson. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 254 of 361 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that was a very serious concern 
on your part. 
MR MANTSHA:   Indeed Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In the case of Ms Africa, the 
complaint against her was not in relation to the LSSA 
contract.  It had to do with the insubordination complaints 
or concerns relating to keeping the Audit and Risk 
Committee members from not accessing the boardroom and 
other concerns that were exercised in your mind at that 
stage.  Correct? 
10 
MR MANTSHA:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that it was serious. 
MR MANTSHA:   That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay thank you.  Now I want to draw 
for 
a 
moment 
on 
that 
first 
board 
meeting 
of 
10 t h of September 2015.  You are correct.  Our information 
bears out your point that the Audit and Risk Committee 
were asked to investigate the LSSA transaction. 
 
But 
at 
that 
meeting 
of 
the 
10 t h of September 2015, what was also raised was the 
20 
possibility that Denel might get into a business venture 
involving the Asian continent.  Is that correct? 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct Chairperson.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Now Mr Saloojee has given evidence.  
His written statements and his oral evidence are to this 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 255 of 361 
 
effect on this point.  The first person who proposed the 
idea of a venture to explore market opportunities in Asia 
together with VR Laser was Mr Ntshepe who reported 
Mr Saloojee.  Do you know about that or do you dispute it 
or do you not know? 
MR MANTSHA:   Well, Chairperson, let me give context to 
my answer.  I think on my earlier evidence I had indicated 
that Denel went to India 24-years before, I think that 2015.  
There were problems corruption allegation.  Then the 
company was blacklisted then.  And there were litigation 
10 
from the authorities in India against Denel. 
 
And of course, the government of the republic 
got involved to try to resolve the matter.  So when – during 
the induction, I do not remember who, I think I have stated 
it before, I was then given because it was part of the 
presentation by the Executive Team as part of the induction 
of the new board members where are the opportunities and 
all sort of things.  So I was given the – a note for that. 
 
But 
the 
evidence 
went 
further 
that 
during 
February, I am not mistaken, of 2015, Denel sent a team to 
20 
India to actually explore, since now the matter has been 
resolved, to try explore the entry and of course at that 
time, 
Mr 
Saloojee 
was 
in 
charge 
and 
at 
that 
time 
Mr Ntshepe was the head of Business Development. 
 
Of course, naturally, as Mr Ntshepe as the Head 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 256 of 361 
 
of Business Development, he would then be involved in all 
the business activities because there was a company Chief 
Marketing Officer.  So he would be the one to even survey 
a market and you know explore the market and make 
recommendation to his Chief Executive Officer. 
 
His Chief Executive Officer would then discuss it 
with him, the Executive Team and if the Executive Team 
feels that the matter requires the board’s attention or seek 
an approval in way or the other, then they would present to 
the board. 
10 
 
So in this instance, when we had that meeting of 
the 10 t h of September 2015, one of the requests by the 
Executive was they needed a mandate to go and explore 
the possibility.  I indicated previously that a resolution to 
that extent was given. 
 
So the board then agreed to say:  Look, let us go 
and explore it.  Of course, there was detailed information 
from the Executive.  They had went there.  They gave us a 
full blown background of what happened in the last 25-
years and also a clear business case which then said to us 
20 
the fast – the fastest growing defence market in the world 
at that time, 2015, was an Indian market in particular. 
 
So any serious defence company would, you 
know, want to try to get into that market.  So to be direct to 
the question.  Whether that was suggested by Mr Ntshepe 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 257 of 361 
 
or was suggested by somebody else, as a board we would 
not know that because what comes to the board is the 
submission already which has gone through the internal 
protocols, gone through the board committees and it comes 
as a submission, presented either by the Chief Executive 
Officer or by the CFO or by any person that the Chief 
Executive Officer would invite. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Well, I must just say Mr Mantsha.  
Try and just give direct answers to some of these 
questions which are quite direct and simple because on 
10 
this answer you could have said:  I was not aware who 
brought up the idea or whatever.  So try and do that. 
MR MANTSHA:   I am indebted to the Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair and thank you 
Mr Mantsha.  So...  Ja, the questions was.  Did this idea 
originate from Mr Ntshepe been given to Mr Saloojee or the 
other way around?  You do not know, as I understand your 
evidence who initiated the discussions about the joint 
venture for the Asian business. 
20 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But it was – but the possibility of 
such a venture was raised at your very first board meeting 
on the 10 t h of September 2015? 
MR MANTSHA:   [No audible reply]  
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 258 of 361 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   On the 10 t h of September 2015, the 
possibility of a venture, jointly with VR Laser for the Asian 
market, was raised. 
MR MANTSHA:   Indeed Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Correct.  And the upshot of that was 
that the CEO was then mandated by the board to look into 
this possible venture thereafter. 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct Chairperson.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Alright.  And that was one of the 
resolutions taken on the 10 t h of September 2015. 
10 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct Chairperson.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Now Mr Saloojee has said that 
when Mr Ntshepe had initially suggested to him that Denel 
should get involved with a joint venture with VR Laser for 
the Asian market, Mr Saloojee was not enthusiastic.  In 
fact, he was – he said that this was problematic and in any 
event premature. 
 
If that had to be explored, it would undertake – 
they would have to undertake analysis and research and so 
forth 
but 
he 
was 
not 
enthusiastic 
overall. 
 
Again, 
20 
presumable, you were not aware of discussions between 
Mr Ntshepe and Mr Saloojee that took place before you 
started chairing the board? 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct Chairperson.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right.  But what Mr Saloojee has 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 259 of 361 
 
testified to is that at the meeting that you did chair on the 
10 t h of September 2015, he indicated that if this was to be 
explored at all it would need a great deal of work and 
research and so forth and he conveyed that he felt that it 
was not a particularly promising or positive project that 
was being proposed.  Do you dispute that? 
MR MANTSHA:   Well, I do not recall Mr Saloojee making 
those comments. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes because he was very specific 
about that in his statements and you have responded to his 
10 
statements in your own statements where you particularly 
raised individual items of disagreement but this was not 
one of them so I would suggest to you that presumably you 
did not raise it in your affidavit because you do not recall 
such a negative attitude from Mr Saloojee on the 10 
September 2015.  I hope you have been listening to the 
question while you are looking through the file, Mr 
Mantsha? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think he is listening but he wants some 
document to help him to answer. 
20 
MR MANTSHA:   I am sorry, Chairperson.  I am with you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes, I understand.  Am I correct in 
what I say to you, is the reason why you have not said in 
your affidavit I disagree with Mr Saloojee that he was not 
particularly positive about the Asian project when he said 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 260 of 361 
 
that in statement.  You did not say you disagreed with him 
in your affidavit because you cannot recall is he said that.  
Is that fair for me to infer? 
MR MANTSHA:   Well, Chairperson, on my previous 
appearance I actually intimated about the extract of the 
resolution of the 10 September.  I think it is important for 
me to read into record what was presented by the Group 
Chief Executive Officer at that meeting. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR MANTSHA:   It says the Chief Executive Officer 
10 
…[intervenes] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Sorry just before you get to that, just 
so that we can all identify what you are reading from.  Are 
you reading from an extract of the minutes of the board 
meeting on the 10 September which was sent to me during 
the course of today I think by your attorney? 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct, Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Chair, we will take steps to have that 
introduced into the bundle in due course. 
...do you dispute that? 
20 
MR MANTSHA:   Well, I do not recall Mr Saloojee making 
those comments. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes because he was very specific 
about that in his statements and you have responded to his 
statements in your own statements where you particularly 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 261 of 361 
 
raised individual items of disagreement but this was not 
one of them so I would suggest to you that presumably you 
did not raise it in your affidavit because you do not recall 
such a negative attitude from Mr Saloojee on the 10 
September 2015.  I hope you have been listening to the 
question while you are looking through the file, Mr 
Mantsha. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Yes, carry on Mr Mantsha. 
MR MANTSHA:   Thank you.   
10 
“The CE indicated that the comprehensive report 
submitted to the board was taken as read.  It was 
structured 
specifically 
to 
provide 
detailed 
information by the Group Chief Executive Officer, 
the 
Group 
Financial 
Director 
and 
the 
Chief 
Operating 
Officer. 
 
In 
a 
global 
context 
it 
is 
important  to note that Denel has recently, for the 
first time, been ranked among the top hundred 
defence 
companies 
worldwide. 
 
Comparatively 
speaking, South Africa as an industry has spend 
20 
small amount and it is critical for Denel to obtain 
other external sources of revenue to sustain the 
industry as a whole and to provide sovereign 
capabilities.  Such initiative would include exploring 
opportunities in South Eastern Asia region.  Against 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 262 of 361 
 
the 
above 
background 
the 
following 
was 
recommended to the board for consideration and 
approval to give the executive the go-ahead to 
explore the possibility of establishing a stronger 
foothold in South Eastern – East Asian region and 
in terms of action the recommendation to approve 
the mandate was given to the executive, would be 
discussed at the in-committee.” 
So, Chairperson, in short, this is what the Group Chief 
Executive Officer presented at the board meeting of the 10 
10 
September and that position at the time was occupied by 
Mr Saloojee.  So I am sure if there was any indication of 
him not – of him being hesitant, I suppose maybe those 
discussions took place within his management team and 
what he has presented to the board is a position as 
approved by his management team and requested the 
board to give them the permission to do that and of course 
there was a strong business case for that.  So that is the 
answer to my question. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  When you say there was a strong 
20 
business case for that, strong business case for what?  For 
the proposed joint venture with VR Laser Asia? 
MR MANTSHA:   There was a strong business proposition. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  For what? 
MR MANTSHA:   To go to the East Asian market. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 263 of 361 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR MANTSHA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   yes but my question was specific 
about the proposed joint venture with VR Laser for the 
Asian market and Mr Saloojee has given evidence that he 
was not positive about the proposal.  Can you recall 
whether he indicated he was positive or negative or neutral 
about that proposal on the 10 September 2015? 
MR MANTSHA:   Well, I think clearly on the 10 September 
2015 there was no VR Laser mentioned because what the 
10 
executive requested was to explore the possibility.  So 
there was no VR Laser mentioned in that meeting.  So if Mr 
Saloojee had reservation and he has expressed that to his 
executive team including Mr Ntshepe, well, such was not 
expressed in that board meeting. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  May I just indicate what you read out 
a moment ago from the minute does not correspond with 
the document I was sent by Mr Denga earlier today.  I am 
not saying the content is completely contradictory but the 
wording is not the same.  May we ask through your legal 
20 
team you make available a copy of the document that you 
have just referred after this hearing is over?  Mr Mantsha, 
it is a simple request, it is a simple request. 
MR MANTSHA:   Yes, I am with you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Will you please get your legal team to 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 264 of 361 
 
provide us with a copy of which you have just read? 
ADV CILLIERS:   We will look into the matter, Mr Chair, 
and we will comply with the request. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I wanted to check, it may well be that 
the staff might be able to make a copy while we are 
continuing.  Will that be possible?  Ja, it will be possible 
so if Mr Mantsha is able to make the document available to 
the registrar then a copy can be made or maybe she is 
going to get the document from somebody else.  But they 
can make those arrangements while we proceed. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:    Yes, thank you, I will leave that to 
the staff of the Commission and our learned friend, I am 
grateful for his intervention. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I do not believe it will be necessary 
for me to come back and cross-examine on it.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I will lead the witness in relation to 
the two versions.  But, Mr Mantsha, where you not aware at 
some stage – maybe not on the 10 September 2015 but 
20 
perhaps some later stage that there was in fact a 
difference of opinion between Mr Saloojee and Mr Ntshepe 
as to the viability and the suitability of a proposed joint 
venture with VR Laser? 
MR MANTSHA:   Chairperson, I have no knowledge of that. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 265 of 361 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And were you ever made aware of the 
fact that Mr Saloojee had a conversation with Mr Tony 
Gupta in the presence of Salim Essa where he was left with 
the impression that he was not cooperating sufficiently with 
their proposals for business deals with Denel including the 
VR Laser deal for Asia.  Were you ever made aware of 
that? 
MR MANTSHA:   I am not aware, Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And were you ever aware  - made 
aware that Mr Saloojee according to his evidence was in 
10 
fact almost reprimanded by Mr Tony Gupta at that meeting 
at Mr Gupta’s residence in Saxonwold, why do you not take 
money like the rest of them are taking money?  Were you 
ever made aware of that allegation by Mr Saloojee against 
Mr Gupta?  
MR MANTSHA:   Not at all. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay.  You see, Mr Saloojee 
suggests in his evidence that the real reason why he was 
suspended on the 23 September 2015 was that you and 
those working with you were troubled by the fact that Mr 
20 
Saloojee was in fact not keen about the Asian deal with VR 
Laser at all and that the whole reference to the LSSA 
transaction was a smokescreen.  That essentially, as I 
understand it, is really the thrust of his evidence. 
MR MANTSHA:   I completely disagree with that evidence, 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 266 of 361 
 
Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay, thank you.  Now I want to just 
take you through a brief sequence of events, just so that 
we can put the factual context before the Chairperson.  So 
we 
have 
already 
dealt 
with 
the 
meeting 
of 
the 
10 
September and then we have a letter from the audit and 
risk committee.  I want to please ask you, do you have a 
bundle there, I may have to ask my learned junior to help 
you locate it but there should be a bundle there marked 
W4B. 
10 
MR MANTSHA:   Yes, Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right, thank you.  Chairperson, may I 
ask your learned registrar to find that file for you? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, they will find it for me.  What is the 
page number? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It is 440.  Now in this bundle I am not 
sure because I was not involved in the team at that stage, 
here they had a different paging system, here there was a 
very simple system on the right hand side of the top the 
page nu appears. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And Mr Mantsha and Chair, may I ask 
you please to turn to page RS440? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, page 440, yes, that was before they 
came up with the black numbers.   
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 267 of 361 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  The new system, multi-coloured. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Mr Mantsha, may I ask you, do you 
have that document in front of you? 
MR MANTSHA:   Indeed, Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I am going to here just refer to the 
page number by the actual number not the initials RS, 
okay?  So if you look at the top do you see RS440, 
somebody has printed there. 
MR MANTSHA:   Yes, I can see. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Somebody has already written there 
in thick Koki pen RS29.  You do not need to worry about 
those numbers, okay?  Now 440 is a letter from the audit 
and risk  committee, it is Chairperson Mpho Omonghe(?) I 
think his name at page 444, it is a letter dated 22 
September 2015 addressed to Mr Saloojee.  Do you see 
that? 
MR MANTSHA:   Yes, Chairperson, I can see. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Now the heading is this: 
“You are requested to provide reasons why the audit 
20 
and risk committee should not recommend to the 
board for your urgent suspension and disciplinary 
action to be taken against yourself. 
1. The audit and risk committee held meetings as 
mandated 
by 
the 
board 
to 
consider 
what 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 268 of 361 
 
transpired during the board meeting of the 10 
September 
2015 
where 
information 
surfaced, 
amongst things, that the Chief Executive Officer 
and the Chief Financial Officer, misled the new 
board, the Minister of Public Enterprises and 
Minister of Finance and further that PFMA and 
Denel MOI was contravened.”  
Now were you made aware that this letter had been sent to 
Mr Saloojee, Mr Mantsha? 
MR MANTSHA:   Yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right and this appears to relate in 
paragraph 1 to the misleading relating to the LSSA 
transaction, is that right?  Is that your understanding? 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Okay, thank you.  Now a similar 
letter was sent to Mr Mhlontlo, I do not need to take you to 
that at this stage but are aware that a similar letter was 
sent to Mr Mhlontlo? 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And this called on Saloojee and 
20 
Mhlontlo to give reasons why the audit and risk committee 
should not recommend to your board of which you were the 
chair the following day on the 23 September that they 
should be suspended and face disciplinary action.  Is that 
your understanding of what they were they were called 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 269 of 361 
 
upon to do? 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now they then give some reasons, I 
am not going to take your through the detail of the reasons 
but may I just indicate my understanding of the letter and 
just see if we are on the same page.  Effectively, there are 
allegations from the audit and risk Chairperson that Mr 
Saloojee and likewise Mr Mhlontlo misled the board on a 
whole lot of different aspects which were affected by 
sections of the PFMA, is that correct? 
10 
MR MANTSHA:   Well, just for correction, Chairperson, is 
the letter from the Chairperson of the audit and risk  
representing the audit and risk committee. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR MANTSHA:   The instances cited in this letter as 
grounds of misconduct, or whatever, they all relate to that 
transaction that we are talking. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes, I thought that was my question 
and I am glad that you have confirmed the positive answer 
to that and in fact, for example, in paragraph 3 it refers to 
20 
the 
transaction 
between 
LSSA 
and 
Denel 
that 
this 
contravened the following legal instruments and then 
details are set out of the sections of the PFMA and the way 
in which it was alleged that Mr Saloojee and Mr Mhlontlo 
had 
misled 
the 
board 
and 
had 
contravened 
various 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 270 of 361 
 
provisions of the PFMA.   
 
If I can take an example, page 442, paragraph 8: 
“You have contravened Section 54(2)(c) of the 
PFMA by failure, refusal/omitted to disclose the full 
and material financial aspects of the acquisition of 
LSSA by Denel to the Minister of Finance and 
Minister of Public Enterprises.  So this was one of 
the allegations that was made against them by the 
audit and risk committee, correct? 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct, Chairperson. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And am I correct in saying you took 
this in account when you decided the following day on the 
23 September to suspend Mr Saloojee and Mr Mhlontlo? 
MR MANTSHA:   Indeed, Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now the – then there is an 
allegation for example in paragraph 10 that there was 
failure by Saloojee to comply with conditions of approval 
from the Minister of Public Enterprises.  The Minister at 
that stage was Malusi Gigaba, is that right? 
MR MANTSHA:   For correction sake, Chairperson, it was 
20 
Minister Lynne Brown. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Sorry, just say that again? 
MR MANTSHA:   It was Minister Lynne Brown at the time. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Lynne Brown, at that stage was she 
already in office?  Thank you.  So these are serious 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 271 of 361 
 
allegations, you will agree with me? 
MR MANTSHA:   I agree, Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now if I can take you to the 
foot of page 443, paragraph 18, it says this> 
“The audit and risk committee intend to recommend 
to the board that you be suspended with immediate 
effect pending further investigation into the above 
and your disciplinary hearing which shall commence 
as soon as the investigation is completed, the audit 
and risk committee will further recommend that you 
10 
be suspended with pay and further, that your period 
of suspension should not exceed three months.” 
Then it says paragraph 19. 
“You are further hereby notified that you should 
provide the audit and risk committee with reasons 
why the 
audit and 
risk committee should 
not 
recommend to the board for your suspension.  You 
reason should be emailed to the Chairperson of the 
audit and risk committee on or before 15h00 on the 
23 September 2015.  Kindly take notice further that 
20 
you are invited to attend a board meeting scheduled 
for 17h00 the 23 September 2015 at the group’s 
head office wherein you are further invited to 
present 
your 
reasons 
why 
the 
audit 
and 
risk 
committee should not ask the board to suspend 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 272 of 361 
 
you.” 
So you were made aware that this communication was sent 
by the audit and risk committee. 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct, Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  To Saloojee and also to Mhlontlo.   
MR MANTSHA:   Correct, Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  You were not a member of the 
audit and risk committee, I think you have indicated in your 
evidence previously.  Your were not a member of the audit 
and risk committee yourself, not so? 
10 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct, Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Now if I can take you to page 
– following page 445, this is a letter jointly, if we look at 
page 448, it was sent jointly by Mr Mhlontlo, Mr Saloojee 
and Ms Afrika and just for the record, Ms Afrika was sent a 
similar letter although it may not have dealt specifically 
with the LSSA transaction.  Were you made aware of this 
letter that was in fact addressed to the board at the top of 
page 445.  Do you see that? 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct, Chairperson. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes and presumably you would 
acquainted yourself with this letter.  The bottom line of the 
letter seems to be - the essence of what they seem to be 
saying in the letter is that the procedure that is being 
followed is completely unreasonable and unfair to them 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 273 of 361 
 
because they expected to deal with a complex matter by 
giving written representations within a day which they say 
was unfairly short.  Do you recall that they made that 
complaint to the board? 
MR 
MANTSHA: 
 
 
Ja, 
that 
complaint 
was 
made, 
Chairperson, and it was dismissed. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  In fact in paragraph 3 on page 
445 they say: 
“We are not in a position to address the A & R 
committee of the board today...” 
10 
And one should notice that the date of this letter at the top 
of 445 is the 23 September. 
“This truncated timeframe is grossly unfair and 
contrary to corporate governance.” 
And then they give reasons why they make that complaint.  
Now the matter was then raised when you convened as 
Chairperson, the board meeting on the 23 r d itself, is that 
right? 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct, Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And did the Chairperson of the audit 
20 
and risk committee report to you that this correspondence 
had passed between him on behalf of his committee and 
the three individual employees, Saloojee, Mhlontlo and 
Afrika.  
MR MANTSHA:   Correct, Chairperson. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 274 of 361 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And did he report that the only 
representations that had been received from those three 
individuals was the letter that we have just looked at 
complaining that we do not have enough time? 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct, Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Now the board under your 
Chairpersonship then proceeded to deal with the matter 
and decided then to suspend them despite their protests 
that they have not been given enough opportunity, is that 
correct? 
10 
MR MANTSHA:   We dismissed the protest, it was 
disingenuous, the matter which the board or the audit and 
risk committee raised with them is the matter within their 
knowledge, they participated in the transaction, there was 
nothing they did not know so the board dismissed that 
because it was disingenuous on their part.  We dismissed 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that what the board thought before 
they made the decision?  What you have just said, does it 
reflect the board’s attitude to their request or their protest. 
20 
MR MANTSHA:   Well, Chairperson, if I can just give a 
context a little bit.  There was a lot of mediation because 
firstly, the three individuals had to sit with the audit and 
risk committee to try to find a way to handle this matter 
properly and that was not resulting to anything and the 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 275 of 361 
 
audit and risk committee gave a report to the board and 
gave the full account of what happened.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  May I stop you for a moment and I  
please beg your pardon for doing so.  I just want to make 
sure I am on the same page as you in understanding.  You 
say they submitted a report.  There was a written report, 
was there not, at page 449.  Is that the report that you 
have just referred to? 
MR MANTSHA:   Indeed, Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And at page 457, if I can read into the 
10 
record the conclusion, paragraph 7, the conclusion: 
“The audit and risk committee has considered the 
submissions 
made 
by 
the 
CFO 
and 
company 
secretary.  In light of their submissions we are of 
the view that matters raised in the letters which 
were 
given 
to 
them 
are 
matters 
within 
their 
knowledge 
and 
they 
are 
in 
possession 
of 
all 
relevant documents, there is no reason why they 
should not answer by today the request to have the 
response to the 30 September in unreasonable 
20 
under 
the 
circumstances. 
 
The 
committee 
recommends that the executive directors should 
tender their resignation with immediate effect and 
be paid one month, namely the month of October 
2015, for them to resign with immediate effect.” 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 276 of 361 
 
Then it says: 
“The audit and risk committee recommends the 
following: 
7.1 
The two executive directors be suspended 
with immediate effect.” 
Etcetera.  Is this the report that you were referring to that 
came before you? 
MR MANTSHA:   Indeed, Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And it was on the basis, am I right in 
understanding you earlier, you accepted the view of the 
10 
audit and risk committee that the request for a week’s 
delay 
for 
them 
to 
prepare 
more 
detailed 
written 
representation was unreasonable in the circumstances? 
MR MANTSHA:   Indeed, Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right, now …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, hang on Mr Kennedy, he was still 
answering my question. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I am sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You remember what my question or have 
you forgotten in the meantime? 
20 
MR MANTSHA:   If you can remind me, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you have forgotten, Mr Kennedy is 
responsible.  You have forgotten? 
MR MANTSHA:   Indeed, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  You had told me that the 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 277 of 361 
 
board dismissed their protestation that they needed more 
time because the board because you thought that they 
knew exactly, as I understood what you say and what you 
said and you must tell me if I misunderstood, they knew 
exactly what they had done, you know?  And therefore the 
board dismissed their protestation or protest.  So then my 
question was whether when you said that, you were 
reflecting the view of the board, so it was not just you who 
thought like that but the board who was exactly that, that is 
what I asked. 
10 
MR MANTSHA:   Chairperson, thank you, it was board. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Yes, Mr Kennedy. 
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
 
Thank 
you, 
I 
apologise 
for 
distracting, I do apologise, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, that is alright.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now – if I might just have a moment 
to find a reference? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let me ask this question while Mr 
Kennedy is looking at this documents.  According to the 
memo or note or letter that the three executives wrote to 
20 
the board on 23 September 2015, which is at page 445, we 
looked at it a few minutes ago, they say they were given 
about 24 hours or so notice to make representations why 
they should not be suspended.  Is that more or less correct 
in terms of how much time they were given? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 278 of 361 
 
MR MANTSHA:   Well, Chairperson, I would not really 
recall. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTSHA:   The time period. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTSHA:   Because it was it was the matter which 
was being handled by the audit and risk committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTSHA:   So I would not [indistinct – dropping 
voice] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But as I understand it, they were 
asked 
to 
make 
representations 
and 
if 
I 
understand 
correctly, they were asked to make those representations 
the following day, so maybe 24 hours is not off the mark.  
Is your understanding the same that when they were asked 
to provide reasons why they should not be suspended they 
were expected to provide their reasons the following day or 
is your understanding different or you cannot remember? 
MR MANTSHA:   Well, Chairperson, I really cannot 
remember because I was not handling that matter. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTSHA:   But what I can say to the Chairperson is 
that there were discussions between the members of the 
audit 
committee 
and 
the 
executive 
investigating 
the 
transaction and forgive me, Chairperson, to repeat myself 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 279 of 361 
 
again, it was a matter of a national crisis and as I said 
earlier, the board had no time.  When I sit here today, in 
fact I think the correct decision should have been to fire 
them at the spot, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You think there was enough evidence to 
fire them on the spot? 
MR MANTSHA:   More than enough, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, alright.  Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Now of course we 
know that Mr Saloojee later challenged the circumstances 
10 
of his termination of employment and took it to the CCMA 
but that dispute was resolved so there is no live dispute in 
any forum as to whether or not he was fairly treated, either 
in 
relation 
to 
suspension 
or 
the 
termination 
of 
his 
employment. 
MR MANTSHA:    Correct sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And we will get to these settlements 
of that a little later, but of course what is relevant for this 
Commission’s purposes is not so much the merits of a 
labour dispute which was resolved, but what was really 
20 
going on within the minds of yourself and your colleagues 
at the level of the Board in how Mr Saloojee and his 
colleagues were treated and that is why, I am just trying to 
explain to you why I am going into this in a little detail. 
MR MANTSHA:    I appreciate Chairperson. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 280 of 361 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And as I understand it from your 
remark a moment ago to the Chairperson this was a matter 
of national crisis which required immediate action to be 
taken. 
MR MANTSHA:  Indeed sir.    
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Would that explain why you didn’t 
feel 
that 
their 
request 
for 
a 
week 
to 
put 
in 
their 
representations by the 30 t h of September why you felt no 
that would be too long, we need to deal with this 
immediately, am I understanding your ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MANTSHA:    Correct sir. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Fine thank you very much.   Now if 
we look also at the same report from the Audit & Risk 
Committee that you have based your decision on, page 
456, paragraph 6 says 6.1: 
“The Audit & Risk Committee is of the opinion that 
the trust relationship between the board and the two 
executive directors is irretrievably broken down.” 
If I can just stop for a moment, presumably am I right in 
understanding 
their 
reference 
to 
the 
two 
executive 
20 
directors refer to Mr Saloojee and Mr Mhlontlo, they were 
both executive directors at the time. 
MR MANTSHA:    Correct Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Ms Africa wasn’t a director, she was 
a different role player as Company Secretary. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 281 of 361 
 
MR MANTSHA:    Indeed Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, so the Audit & Risk Committee 
are saying that the trust relationship is irretrievably broken 
down and then they give reasons why among other things 
so then they give a list of reasons which include for 
example that there were breaches of the PFMA in relation 
to the LSSA transaction and that they had misled the board 
as well as the ministers concerned. 
MR MANTSHA:    Correct Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And you presumably considered this 
10 
when you decided on their suspension? 
MR MANTSHA:    Correct Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, now Mr Mantsha can you – do 
you have any comment on the fact that the Audit & Risk 
Committee that were motivating for the recommended 
suspension and the basis why that suspension had been 
done, do you have any view on the fact that before any of 
these three employees had actually been heard by way of 
either written or oral representations your Audit & Risk 
Committee 
was 
already 
saying 
to 
you 
as 
Board 
20 
Chairperson we believe that the trust relationship has 
broken down.  Do you think it was appropriate for them to 
have said that? 
MR MANTSHA:   It was indeed on the facts before them it 
was correct Chairperson.     
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 282 of 361 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It was correct, and in fact you have 
indicated earlier that you felt that there was enough 
evidence right then and there on the 23 r d of September, 
more than enough evidence as you put it, to fire them on 
the spot. 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And are you also willing to accept 
that our Labour Law is a little more complicated and 
involved than that but it is not up to an employer whether 
the – a senior person like yourself as Chairperson of the 
10 
Board or anyone else, to take a decision to fire on the 
spot, you need to give, you need to have a hearing not so? 
MR MANTSHA:    Chairperson that is precisely why there 
was that kind of a process, I suppose Chairperson would 
know that the field of law ...[indistinct] most of us. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, now I would like in the same 
bundle please to go to page 460 and we have what appears 
to be the first of a long series of correspondence, I am 
only going to touch on a couple of examples of this, page 
460, do you have it? 
20 
MR MANTSHA:    Correct Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And that is a letter from Ms Zarina 
Walele who practices as an attorney, specialising in labour 
law, and this letter was sent on behalf of Mr Saloojee as 
well as the others, Nklontlo and Africa, and it challenged 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 283 of 361 
 
the suspension ending the disciplinary action, and she 
complained in this letter, it was actually addressed to you, 
that there was not a fair and reasonable opportunity to be 
heard before the decision was taken to suspend him.  You 
recall receiving this letter?  
MR MANTSHA:    Yes, we did receive it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And presumably you don’t agree that 
it was unfair, you felt in the circumstances it was fair 
because it was a national crisis. 
MR MANTSHA:    It was fair. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But of course I would expect you to 
concede that it couldn’t be fair for the Audit & Risk 
Committee to have made up its mind that the trust 
relationship had broken down even before they could hear 
what the executives, the employees, had to say, because I 
understood you a few minutes ago to accept that the Audit 
& Risk Committee had reached that point about the trust 
relationship 
even 
before 
the 
executives 
could 
show 
reasons. 
20 
MR MANTSHA:    Well Chairperson here we are dealing 
with a factual situation, documents, there were previous 
engagement between the Executive and the members of 
the Audit Committee.  As I said the Executive appeared not 
to take the members of the Audit Committee in confidence 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 284 of 361 
 
and Chairperson trust is earned and what we see here on 
the very first week, on the very first board meeting of my 
Board and at the very first meeting of the Audi8t & Risk 
Committee with the Executive preparing for the Board 
Meeting there are issues like this and the Executive were 
not coming forth and taking the Audit & Risk Committee in 
confidence. 
 
The trust relationship was never earned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but question is we do know that the 
executives were given an opportunity to effectively show 
10 
cause why they should not be suspended, to give reasons.  
That is an opportunity to be heard, okay.  
 
Now what is the point of doing that if you mean it, 
how can you mean that opportunity genuinely if you have 
already decided the trust relationship is finished? 
MR MANTSHA:    With respect Chairperson the Audit & 
Risk Committee was not a decision maker, it was a 
recommending entity. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTSHA:   A sub-committee of the Board. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTSHA:    The decision was of the Board and the 
Board alone. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTSHA:   It constituted as a Board. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 285 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTSHA:   So they rightly felt that the trust 
relationship has been broken. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MANTSHA:   And I say before you Chairperson the 
circumstances, the evidence was overwhelming that that 
trust relationship was broken.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MANTSHA:   I don’t see anything wrong for the Audit & 
Risk Committee to have even formed that opinion before 
10 
the two executives had made the presentation, because as 
I indicated earlier this transaction is the transaction which 
they presided in, they knew every single term, every single 
full stop, comma of this transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MANTSHA:  There was nothing that stopped them in 
the very same manner to say look this is what we have 
done, are you accusing us of not telling the Minister of 
Public Enterprise that the term sheet from five years has 
changed to six months, no, no, no this is the letter that we 
20 
have sent to the Department, this is our engagement with 
the National Treasury, there was nothing to stop them to do 
that.  It was a factual situation based on documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The Board consisted of about how many 
people, if you are able to remember. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 286 of 361 
 
MR MANTSHA:   Chairperson I can’t remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About ten/twelve, or is that too much? 
MR MANTSHA:   I think around ten or so, but forgive me if 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that is fine, I won’t hold you to it, 
I just wanted an estimate and would you have recollection 
of how many people the Audit & Risk Committee consisted 
of? 
MR MANTSHA:   The members of? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of the Audit and Risk Committee, would 
10 
that have been three people, four people, five people? 
MR MANTSHA:   If I am not mistaken Chairperson I think 
there were four members of the Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.   Would they have formed part 
of the Board later on when the Board made the decision on 
this issue or would they have recused themselves, do you 
know?  
MR MANTSHA:   Well they were part of the Board when the 
Board is fully constituted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  So I guess you and I can 
20 
agree that to the extent that they would have made up their 
mind on that, on the issue of the trust relationship being 
broken 
down 
that 
part 
of 
the 
Board, 
even 
if 
their 
representations came they had made up their minds, those 
were out of the committee. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 287 of 361 
 
MR MANTSHA:   Well they have made up their mind and 
they made a recommendation yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no that’s fine, that’s fine.   Mr 
Kennedy?  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  Mr Mantsha we have 
heard already that the three employees and later their 
attorney, Ms Walele, had complained at various times, both 
before 
and 
after 
the 
board 
meeting 
of 
the 
23 r d 
of 
September 
2015, 
about 
the 
process 
that 
was 
being 
followed.  Is it not correct that in addition to those 
10 
complaints one of your Board Members, Ms Mangindi, in 
fact expressed concerns about the process that was being 
followed.  You recall that she raised such concerns at your 
board meeting? 
MR MANTSHA:   I don’t remember, and I think she actually 
– I am subject to correction Chairperson, I think she left 
the meeting early.    
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR 
MANTSHA: 
 
 
Before 
the 
Board 
discussions 
commenced, that is my recollection Chairperson. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   In fact she has given evidence and if 
I can ask you please to turn to a letter that you sent you.  
If you could look please at Bundle 1, Denel 01, if you can 
just put the other bundle aside now.   
MR MANTSHA:   Bundle 1? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 288 of 361 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Bundle 1 yes.  Denel Bundle 01. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Kennedy can we take a short break 
while Mr Mantsha is looking, ten minutes this time. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Chair Mr Mantsha was about to show 
10 
you before the adjournment was taken a document from Ms 
Mandindi and Chair I understand you should have the bundle 
now placed before you by your Registrar.  It is in Bundle 1 
and it is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It starts at page 12. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Unfortunately for some reason the – the 
logistics people did not bring that bundle for the witness so 
my learned junior has made her bundle available to the 
20 
witness if that is in order. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  This is a letter Mr Mantsha dated the 
25t h of September two and a bit pages of a letter from Ms 
Mandindi.  She was a member of your board correct? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 289 of 361 
 
MR MANTSHA:  Indeed Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  One of the non-executive members of 
the board. 
MR MANTSHA:  Indeed Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And you recall that she sent you this 
letter? 
MR MANTSHA:  I do not necessarily have the recollection 
but probably she did send it. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You cannot dispute it? 
MR MANTSHA:  No, no. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You just cannot recall. 
MR MANTSHA:  No, no, no I cannot dispute. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay thank you.  And I am not going to 
take you through the detail of the letter but in essence she 
indicates a number of concerns and misgivings about the 
process that was followed leading to the suspension of the 
three senior employees and she says for example at the foot 
of page 13 right the fourth last line. 
“Finally Chair I do understand that it may be 
necessary to change the executive directors.  
20 
What I am challenging is the manner in which 
these things get done.  Is it possible to part 
in 
amicable 
ways 
leaving 
the 
dignity, 
reputation of those parties etcetera.” 
So she is making – making it clear that she is not saying that 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 290 of 361 
 
there may not prove to be a good reason to remove them 
eventually but she complains in the rest of the letter as to 
the speed with which it took place not simply from the point 
of view of the employees but even for her as an executive – 
sorry a non-executive board member. She says for example 
at the beginning page 12 she refers to the fact that this was 
not on the agenda – had not been given any documents, had 
not been given any opportunity beforehand to consider this.  
And then later in her letter she says well are we in a position 
as newly appointed members of the board including yourself 
10 
who was newly appointed to really be able to form an 
impression as to whether these individuals that we have not 
even had a chance to get to know properly should now be 
removed so suddenly.  That is the sort of complaint that she 
made.  Do you recall at least that sort of concern being 
raised by her? 
MR MANTSHA:  Well Chairperson that is what is raised in 
the letter.  Can I just say a little bit with – with respect to – 
to Ms Mandindi.  I must say Chairperson that she contributed 
a lot to the board and even when she left the board because 
20 
she was being appointed somewhere else we actually felt her 
absence.  But if you look at the first line of her letter of 
course she said I had left the meeting early so she of course 
did not get the benefit of all the discussion that happened in 
the board meeting.  
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 291 of 361 
 
 
So as Chairperson you well aware that in a board 
operates on democratic principles the majority members of 
the board take a decision and it becomes the decision of the 
board.  Unfortunately Ms Mandindi was not there to actually 
raise the issues which she has raised in this letter. 
 
I think post this situation because we worked very 
closely.  I think apart from the letter I think we probably 
discussed this between myself and her but with – with 
respect to her she – she made a very good contribution to 
the board.  Unfortunately the majority members of the board 
10 
who remained that day took a decision and convinced and I 
am still convinced it was a correct decision.  Thank you 
Chair. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right thank you Mr Mantsha.  In fact 
she gave evidence orally in which she told the Chairperson 
that she had in fact participated in some of the discussions 
not all she had to leave – she had a – had a commitment and 
there was a delay as a result of all of this.  But she said that 
she did try to raise issues such as the points that this is 
rushed and that she as a brand new member of the board 
20 
like the other members of the board would not be in a 
position to take such a – a sudden decision to suspend both 
the CEO and CFO as well as the Company Secretary there 
and then but she indicated that she did not feel that she was 
taken seriously.  That her advice was actually going to be 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 292 of 361 
 
followed and of course we know ultimately it was not 
followed.  Correct? 
MR MANTSHA:  Chairperson the decision of the majority 
was taken. The – as I said the issues raised in this it would 
have been appropriate if she had remained but unfortunately 
she could not remain – to have raised all these issues with 
other members of the board.  So I respect all she says here 
but as you know Chairperson there are rules and procedure 
and processes how decisions are arrived at.  And decision in 
these instances they bind every member of the collective as 
10 
a resolution. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes I do not think that Ms Mandindi was 
suggesting that this was not a binding resolution because it 
was taken by a majority of the board.  She accepted that but 
what she tried to explain to the Chairperson if I recall her 
evidence correctly is that she felt very uncomfortable about 
the fairness of the process and the fact that ultimately it did 
– the majority did go against her – her wishes but she 
accepted that it was a majority decision.  As you sit here 
now often with the benefit of hindsight and a lot of time 
20 
having gone by and having settled and so forth do you feel 
now in retrospect that – that Mr Saloojee and Mr Mhlontlo 
and Ms Africa’s process was unfair and unduly hasty or you 
satisfied that it was done correctly? 
MR MANTSHA:  I am satisfied under the circumstances it 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 293 of 361 
 
was done correctly. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  It was part of Saloojee and 
Mhlontlo’s evidences be that this process was in fact rushed.  
It was much too fast.  It was not fair and in fact they say that 
it is consistent with their version that they were actually 
being kicked out of the company through a sham of a 
process – through a sham of a charge relating to LSSA and 
that you was simply going through some –some motions and 
even when you were advised by one of your colleagues on 
the board do not move that fast you just steamed rolled 
10 
ahead and so Mr Saloojee and Mr Mhlontlo have suggested 
that well this bears the – their point that this was just a rush 
process with a hidden agenda.  Any comment on that? 
MR 
MANTSHA: 
 
Well 
– 
well 
Chairperson 
as 
also 
corroborated by the evidence given by the acting Chief 
Executive of Denel as we speak.  These was serious 
violations and the reports which I looked through the 
evidence of the current chair concurred that these were 
serious misconducts.  These were serious violations and if I 
can try to quote not verbatim he said they are actually 
20 
processing whatever form of action to try to see whatever 
they can recover as a result of this.  So – so this was not by 
any chance a smoke screen to try to get these people out of 
the company.  They were dealing with this transaction as 
early as 2014.  They knew everything.  As I said earlier they 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 294 of 361 
 
were advised by Nedbank according to my information that 
you are highly in debt you cannot afford these prices.  
Please ask the sovereign to put money for these things.  
That is why both ABSA and Nedbank were not willing to 
finance this transaction to an extent where ABSA demanded 
security of R400 000.00 and Nedbank when they realised 
they were not being given security then they converted the 
loan for six months or less period.  So you can imagine if 
your bankers are taking that position.  So it says to you that 
you have misrepresented to them.  So this was a serious 
10 
action – there was no rush.  The very same executive knew 
that at that stage collectively the debt to ABSA and Nedbank 
it was close to R8 billion.  In fact R4 million and all the debts 
collectively was around R8 billion.  And they knew very well 
the conditions given by the National Treasury that we had to 
get out of the guarantee.  So all I am saying to you is 
anyone who will suggest that taking action as we did was 
premature, 
was 
a 
smoke 
screen 
that 
is 
absolutely 
unfounded, not true.  It is not based on the facts. The case 
against them is clearly set out in the paper, is clearly what 
20 
the evidence before this commission there were reports 
which Denel commented about it with findings in relation to 
this transaction.  It was not a smoke screen. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright thank you.  Now can we take 
you please now to page 378 in bundle – back to – you can 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 295 of 361 
 
put away the Bundle 1 that I have just taken you to and can 
we go back to Bundle W4(B)?   
MR MANTSHA:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You talk about going back to Bundle 
W4(B)? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  B yes B for Barry.  It is the one where 
we had the RS numbers on the top right hand corner.  And 
Chair if you have that bundle may I refer the witness to the 
page? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It is RS378.  Do you have that Mr 
Mantsha? 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may keep your microphone on at all 
times Mr Mantsha.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Sorry Mr Mantsha did she ask you to 
put the … 
MR MANTSHA:  I do have Chairperson thank you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right thank you.  So at 378.  Chair may 
I just confirm you have the right bundle and page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got that.  Ja. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  378 is the letter on the Denel 
letterhead dated the 14 t h of December 2015 addressed to Mr 
Saloojeee.  Is that what you have in front of you? 
MR MANTSHA:  Indeed Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  If I can take you to the end of that 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 296 of 361 
 
letter page 383 it is signed with your signature and name as 
Chairperson of the Denel board, is that right? 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So if one reads the letter itself it is 
headed Misconduct in terms of Section 51(1)E.  This is in 
fact a charge sheet and a notice to attend a disciplinary 
hearing.  We see that in paragraph 1.  Correct? 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then it says: Gravon – Gravamen 
of the allegations.  And then you – then you say:  It is 
10 
contended that you have missed – that you have committed 
gross misconduct and then you set out some instances of 
that.  You were grossly negligent and or failed to comply with 
your statutory and or contractual obligations. 
214 you failed to conduct yourself in a manner which Denel 
expected of an employee that occupies the position of CEO. 
221 It is contended that you did not meet the applicable 
compliance requirements for the LSSA acquisition including 
the 
PFMA 
requirements 
and 
Denel 
Supply 
Chain 
Management Policies. 
20 
So here you were starting to explain what the charges were.  
This was a formal charge sheet that you issued as board 
Chairperson.  Correct? 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And would I be correct in understanding 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 297 of 361 
 
that the nature of these allegations is very serious in your 
view? 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And then paragraph 3 sets out a further 
charge that goes beyond just negligence it says; gross 
dishonesty 
alternatively 
gross 
negligence 
alternatively 
misrepresentation further alternatively failure to comply with 
Section of the PFMA 00:15:22.  Now you then set out details 
of that in a following few pages, correct? 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct Chairperson. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  For example on page 380 paragraph 
314 in that you have failed to disclose to the board and the 
shareholders the possible – sorry the potential implications 
of maturity of the Nedbank loan on the 20t h of September 
2015.  This was a material omission in disclosure.  And then 
on page 281 paragraph 318 another example.  You have 
mislead Nedbank and ABSA by refusing that they conduct 
due diligence on the financial position of LSSA as a 
standalone business etcetera. 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct. 
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So there is – there are allegations all of 
them seemingly very serious and they include not just 
negligence although negligence is part of it but also 
deliberate action, misleading, misrepresenting things both to 
you as the board and to bankers in particular Nedbank. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 298 of 361 
 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  And also elsewhere there is – 
there are allegations that there were misrepresentations to 
the various Ministers involved. 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And there had to be – there had to be 
submissions to the Ministers for compliance with the PFMA 
because this involved a financial transaction involving 
overseas funding etcetera, correct? 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct Chairperson. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Again it seems quite clear from this Mr 
Mantsha that you viewed these allegations in a very serious 
light. 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  And then on the last page of the 
letter 383 you refer to – in fact 382 you refer to the – the 
rights that Mr Saloojee would have in the disciplinary 
hearing.  This is paragraph 4 for the page 382 to 383 and 
paragraph 5 that this – that representations could be made 
through by himself or through his legal representatives 
20 
etcetera. 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  So here it was clear that you 
were going to follow the process for a disciplinary hearing 
laid down in labour law and in the disciplinary proceedings 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 299 of 361 
 
code of Denel, correct? 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  What happened then when you 
were issuing this to your point earlier that you actually 
believed on the 23rd of September 2015 before they had 
even made representations but there was more and -  more 
than enough evidence already to fire them on the spot. 
MR MANTSHA:  You will repeat yourself? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes certainly.  I am just repeating in 
question 
what 
you 
gave 
as 
evidence 
to 
the 
learned 
10 
Chairperson earlier.  On the 23rd of September 2015 you 
testified that when you decided to suspend these employees 
you in fact believed that there was more than enough 
evidence to fire them on the spot. 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And yet we have here three months 
later you are sending them a charge sheet for the – for the 
holding of a disciplinary process.   Presumably you did not 
fire them on the spot in – on the 23 rd of September 2015 you 
were persuaded that it has to go through the process of a 
20 
disciplinary hearing. 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  With all of these rights know what the 
charges are, have legal representation, be able to ask 
question of witnesses etcetera, etcetera. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 300 of 361 
 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  Why did it take three months – 
almost three months from the decision to suspend them and 
to – and to bring disciplinary charges against them as the 
Audit and 
Risk Committee 
had recommended 
in their 
memorandum to you that we have looked at – why did it take 
almost three months to actually get to the stage to issue a 
charge sheet and to give notice of a disciplinary hearing? 
MR MANTSHA:  Chairperson as I indicated on my earlier 
evidence the first time I came here the – the board was 
10 
overwhelmed with the question of gross default. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Of what sorry? 
MR MANTSHA:  Of gross default. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes. 
MR MANTSHA:  In case we do not service the laws. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry – I am sorry I think I am – I also 
missed that word.  Was overwhelmed with? 
MR MANTSHA:  With the possibility that there will be a 
gross default. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
20 
MR MANTSHA:  Across the state owned companies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR MANTSHA:  In the event Denel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANTSHA:  Cannot pay Nedbank the bridging finance or 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 301 of 361 
 
find suitable arrangements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MANTSHA:  So what then happened the Audit and Risk 
Committee they were – they were very busy with meeting 
Nedbank together with the executive to try to find a suitable 
arrangement.  It was – it was very difficult and – and those 
negotiations consumed the – the attention of the board.  As 
you know Chairperson the – these processes are run at 
administrative level.  The disciplinary processes are run at 
administrative 
level. 
 
There 
was 
an 
acting 
Company 
10 
Secretary to process all of this and I think they appointed 
lawyers to represent the company in this process.  The 
reason why it took the time as Mr Kennedy has indicted the 
attention of the board was consumed with the issue relating 
to the implication of gross default.  And we paid less 
attention to this because after the decision was taken it was 
up to the executive – the relevant people in the legal 
department of the company to process this process. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Can I take you now please to page 389 
which is another letter that you sent. This time it is dated 
20 
17t h of December 2015.  So this is in fact a day prior to your 
signing the letter to Mr Saloojee with the charge sheet 
because you signed that on the 18t h of December.  This 
letter is addressed to Ms Legwabe I think it is who was then 
the acting Company Secretary, correct? 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 302 of 361 
 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And you ask her in paragraph 1 to 
furnish you with the draft charge sheet so that we can settle 
it as we need to have the charges served upon the 
suspended employees before close of business tomorrow the 
18t h of December 2015.  Am I right in assuming that she then 
sent you the finalised charge sheet who – which you then 
finalised and signed and issued on the 18 t h. 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Then the next requested in paragraph 
10 
2.   
“We further request you to instruct our lawyers to draft a 
settlement proposal of three months’ payment in full and 
final to the three suspended employees.” 
Now is that correct – did you ask her to do that? 
MR MANTSHA:   It is correct Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And in fact we have in the docket – in 
the bundle of documents various letters relating to proposed 
settlements – settlement offers that were made and rejected 
by different parties, counter proposals and the like.   
20 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  What had happened to your belief on 
the 23rd of September 2015 that this – you had more than 
enough evidence to fire them on the spot and yet you leave 
three months to go by before you even start issuing them the 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 303 of 361 
 
charge sheet – you have tried to explain that a moment ago.   
But now you also say let us give them a full and final 
settlement offer to pay – pay them off for three months.  I 
mean surely these were very serious issues.  You have said 
that yourself. 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And I understand your evidence 
completely you are accusing Mr Saloojee and Mr Mhlontlo 
and 00:24:06 and to an extent Ms Africa of extremely gross 
and serious misconduct falsifying things, misleading the 
10 
board, violating the PFMA, misleading the Ministers to get 
approval.  Why did you not just have the courage of the 
strength of your – your case against them?  Why pay them 
off? 
MR MANTSHA:  Well what is – what is clear here 
Chairperson is there is – you can clearly see that these 
proceedings have moved 00:24:41.  And at that stage… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry you can clearly see what? 
MR MANTSHA:  Well the position when the settlement 
proposals were made as captured by this lady.  I think with 
20 
the experience of the Chairperson that I am sure Mr Kennedy 
as well in this field of flow you – you obviously try to take 
the better devil.  We were faced with a situation here where 
clearly these proceedings – these disciplinary proceedings 
give an attitude of the employees were going to be 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 304 of 361 
 
prolonged.  And on the other hand we talking with the 
bankers to say look let us have this kind of arrangement.  
And as you know the – the people you are dealing with in 
business are very sensitive as what authority do you have.  
So it was always in the interest of the board to have a 
speedy resolution of this matter.  So as we were preparing to 
go to the disciplinary hearing at the same time we were also 
ready to try to get this matter off the way so that we are able 
to continue to negotiate with the bankers, continue to 
negotiate with the investors with a team that the bankers and 
10 
the investors know that whatever decision they reach with 
them they will be there tomorrow and no one is going to 
come tomorrow in a foreseeable future to then change the 
decision and start all over from zero.  So it was always in the 
interest of the company, interest of the business of the 
company to always have the door to settle for the bigger 
interest of the company.  So that is why there is this 
paragraph in this letter. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Mr Mantsha I understand your evidence 
but let me – let me put to you a possible difficulty that one 
20 
can have with it.  A disciplinary inquiry was a process that 
could and should be handled by an independent chairperson, 
no so? 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  It could not be handled by you – you 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 305 of 361 
 
would not be chairing the inquiry. 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Firstly because it is not what the 
Chairperson of the board should do. 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Correct.  Secondly you had already 
formulated a view on the 23 rd of September 2015 that they 
should be fired on the spot there is more than enough 
evidence.   
MR MANTSHA:  Correct. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  And the intention was never to 
hold the disciplinary inquiry chaired by you or any other 
member of the board. 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct. 
MR MANTSHA:  Not so.  So why would the need for the 
board to be involved in negotiating with the bankers to try 
and solve the financial situation mean that the disciplinary 
process would be delayed. 
MR MANTSHA:  I think the point I am making clearly 
Chairperson is already the attitude of the employees was to 
20 
prolong this matter as much as possible.  And the company 
was not in a position to get drawn in a prolonged litigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that – hang on Mr Mantsha.  You just 
told me that the reason why it took three months before you 
moved was because the board was busy with whatever other 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 306 of 361 
 
matters.  You did not say it was because the executives, the 
employees were the ones who were delaying. 
MR MANTSHA:  I think Chairperson can I just try to correct 
the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MANTSHA:  The understanding of the Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR MANTSHA:  I think what I am responding to Chairperson 
here is the second paragraph of the letter which Mr Kennedy 
just read which say let us prepare a settlement for three 
10 
months as well.  This is the letter at the same time asking 
that please finalise the charge for a disciplinary hearing.  So 
what I am trying to explain I am trying to explain the basis of 
this paragraph that this paragraph the intention to put this 
paragraph was – there was always desire from the board to 
short circuit the prolonged disciplinary process for the bigger 
interest of the company.  So my explanation is confined to 
this paragraph number 2 on this.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But you – you accept do you not that up to 
that point the employees themselves had not done anything 
20 
to unduly delay the convening of the disciplinary inquiry. 
MR MANTSHA:   You obviously look at the – what is being 
contested. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, I am talking about September 
when they were suspended and mid-December when you 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 307 of 361 
 
wrote that letter.  I am talking about just that time not 
after. 
MR MANTSHA:   Well, Chairperson, already Mr Kennedy 
read a letter from the legal representative of these 
employees which already raised issues and you can clearly 
see that there are number of issues being contended.  So 
the process would be prolonged because there is dispute 
on a number of issues.  So it was informed by those 
considerations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But other than the fact that they raised 
10 
certain issues, had not done anything to unduly delay the 
continuing of this then inquiry at that time.  Is that right? 
MR MANTSHA:   Well, at that time they did not do anything 
to delay the proceeding. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR MANTSHA:   There is nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTSHA:   Because the proceedings were being 
controlled at the level of the legal department of the 
company. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you.  In fact, the legal 
department to the company at one stage involved Cliffe 
Dekker Hofmeyr, CDH, a reputable firm of attorneys with 
skills in labour law to handle the disciplinary process, not 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 308 of 361 
 
so? 
MR MANTSHA:   I think those were the lawyers appointed  
They were advising the company. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR MANTSHA:   So they were working with the legal 
department of the company. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes, indeed.  And as we will see a 
little later, there was a chairperson who was nominated, an 
independent chairperson, Advocate Nazeer Casim SC to 
chair the inquiry.  Are you aware of that? 
10 
MR MANTSHA:   Yes, I think the report was given, yes, 
Chairperson.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR MANTSHA:   Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   See those of us who practise in 
labour law know that frequently it happens that major 
corporations including state corporations sometimes have 
the need where there are very serious allegations that may 
result in a breakdown of trust, have a need to convene a 
speedy disciplinary process. 
20 
 
And they bring in attorneys like CDH to manage 
the process because of their knowledge of labour law and 
their experience of many similar matters such as this. 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And to brief independent counsel, in 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 309 of 361 
 
this case Advocate Casim SC to chair the process.  And we 
in labour law know that these processes, if management 
wants it, can happen very quickly. 
MR MANTSHA:   It is possible but it is also does not 
depend only on the management.  As you know, it is a 
dispute situation.  It can be prolonged by one party or the 
other. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I accept that some parties may 
prolong it but in this case you confirmed to the Learned 
Chairperson 
that 
there 
is 
no 
evidence 
that 
these 
10 
Executives delayed the process up to your receiving of the 
charge sheet on the 18 t h of December. 
MR MANTSHA:   Well, Chairperson, with the knowledge 
that I have since the matter was dealt with the legal 
department of the company, with the limited knowledge that 
I have from the outside, I do not know anything but maybe 
there was discussions between the lawyers since the 
company appointed Cliffe Dekker and the employees 
appointed the lawyer that you have read. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
20 
MR MANTSHA:   I have – I am not privy to the discussion, 
what were the issues raised between the two lawyers and 
what 
were 
the 
issues 
between 
the 
company’s 
legal 
department and the company lawyers at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Good.  But would it not be correct that 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 310 of 361 
 
CDH would have informed you as the chairperson of the 
board if there was – they believe that the employees were 
delaying the process at that stage?  Did they take not 
instructions from you as the chairperson of the board? 
MR MANTSHA:   No, with respect Chairperson, the legal 
department of the company deals with external lawyers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR MANTSHA:   So even the appointed of the lawyers to 
handle this, it was never a board issue.  We did not know 
...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR MANTSHA:   ...who are the lawyers.  So the company 
in terms of their database or whatever, they pick the lawyer 
for a particular case.  So they pick them.  We knew later 
that these were the lawyers.  So the lawyers were not 
reporting to the board.  They were reporting to the legal 
department. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the legal department, did they not 
take 
instructions, 
so 
to 
speak, 
from 
the 
board 
and 
chairperson in terms of decision?  In other words, was the 
20 
board not the client of the legal department in a certain 
sense?  In other words, the legal department could not just 
make decisions about what to do.  They needed to consult 
the board to say give us instructions, as it were.   
MR MANTSHA:   Ja, well, Chairperson... my intervention in 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 311 of 361 
 
this regard.  I sent the letter requesting this.  Of course, I 
realised time was going on and we were not getting 
anything.  But in terms of the reporting processes, the 
legal department reports to the Chief Executive Officer.   
So they do not report to either the chairperson of the board 
or the Company Secretary of the board. 
 
So under the circumstances, I then realised the 
process is getting prolonged.  So I sent the letters...  And 
at the same time, I then indicated that we are not ready to 
offer these because normally when you go to a disciplinary 
10 
hearing, you have got to flexible in terms of – if the parties 
want to talk settlement.  How much can you go?   
 
So this was in a way of trying to give them the 
mandate and it was done in consultation with other board 
members. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair.  I am going to deal 
later with whether you had a discretion to settle the matter 
such as this if there were some serious charges but let us 
leave that for a debate for a little bit later.  May I just 
20 
complete the reference to this letter?   
 
It says in paragraph 3: 
“The letter for settlement must be delivered 
tomorrow together with the charge sheet and 
further with a letter informing the suspension 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 312 of 361 
 
is 
extended 
until 
the 
finalisation 
of 
the 
hearing...” 
 
And as far as you are aware, that was done.  Is 
that right?  The charge sheet was sent on the 18 t h.  You, in 
fact, signed it on that day.  That went with a settlement 
letter, proposal, for three months.   
 
And it also went with a notification that their 
suspension had already started on the 23 r d of September 
2015, would now be extended until the finalisation of the 
disciplinary hearing.  Correct? 
10 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  Now if we reference in the 
evidence and I am going to come in a moment to paragraph 
4.  You made reference to a Dentons report and may I just 
read to you – remind you what you said?   
 
You further requested – this is to the acting 
Company Secretary... 
“You further requested to inform Dentons that 
their report is not accepted and request them 
to provide us with a report within 30-days and 
20 
kindly direct them to provide information to 
support the charges...” 
 
Now 
who 
at 
Dentons? 
 
Their 
firm 
of 
investigators? 
MR MANTSHA:   No, their firm of attorneys. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 313 of 361 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Attorneys? 
MR MANTSHA:   Their report, yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And they were instructed to prepare 
a report to do an investigation into the issues, allegations 
concerning the LSSA transaction. 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Is that right? 
MR MANTSHA:   [No audible reply]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   And they prepared their report 
...[intervenes]  
10 
MR MANTSHA:   The ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   ...submitted. 
MR MANTSHA:   They prepared a preliminary report. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And that was then submitted to 
you. 
MR MANTSHA:   Yes, it was submitted.  It served before 
the board. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes.  And is this the report that you 
refer to in paragraph 4? 
MR MANTSHA:   [No audible reply]  
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   “The Company Secretary must inform  
Dentons their report is not accepted and 
request them to provide us with a report 
within 3-days and kindly direct them to 
provide information to support the charges.” 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 314 of 361 
 
 
Is that the report that you are referring to, the 
Dentons report? 
MR MANTSHA:   Indeed. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Presumable the one that came 
...[intervenes]  
MR MANTSHA:   Indeed Chairperson 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   ...before you.  Now other witnesses 
have referred to the Dentons report including Mr Saloojee.  
And what is being suggested is that Dentons had been 
appointed as outside attorneys.   
10 
 
I think there is also reference in the papers to 
them being briefed to act together with, I think it was 
Ernest 
& 
Young, 
the 
auditors 
investigating 
firm, 
to 
investigate this.   
 
They produced a report that you refer to here but 
it was not to your liking.  And you said:   We are not going 
to accept your report.  Saying that:  We want something 
that actually supports the charges. 
MR MANTSHA:   I disagree Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But it is not exactly what you are 
20 
saying in your letter? 
MR MANTSHA:   The report that served before the board 
was very shallow and to be honest, the board was not 
convinced with, you know, the efforts made in that report.  
So it was not whether it said things that we wanted or not 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 315 of 361 
 
wanted.  It was just hollow.  It was empty.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But your instruction to the Company 
Secretary, she was going to have to convey this instruction 
from you to Dentons, correct?  That is what you are asking 
her to do. 
MR MANTSHA:   Yes, correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So your instruction that she must 
follow to give the instruction to Dentons would be:  We do 
not accept your report.  We provide – we want you to 
provide us with another report within 30-days and this time 
10 
you must time, you must provide information to support the 
charges. 
MR MANTSHA:   Well ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   It says so.  Let me just finish the 
question. 
MR MANTSHA:   Oh, sorry. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   So that I can put it to you.  It 
suggests that your problem was not that it was just 
shallow.  It suggest that it did not meet one objective on 
your side which was:  We need the bird.  We need the 
20 
evidence to support the charges, come what may.  And they 
have not given us serious evidence that will make these 
charges stick.   
MR MANTSHA:   It is absolutely incorrect.  As I have 
already indicated in the evidence.  As the charge sheet is 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 316 of 361 
 
set out, as the report from the Audit Committee is set, the 
evidence was there.  In fact, Chairperson, you have heard 
of the Dentons report by the current acting Chief Executive 
of 
Sadik. 
 
That 
report, 
eventually, 
was 
concluded 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Please just remind me because you are 
mentioning for the second time – you are referring to the 
current acting Chief Executive Denel for the second time.  I 
have no recollection of who that is.  What is his or her 
name? 
10 
MR MANTSHA:   Sadik.  Mr Sadik.  Talib. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, okay.   
MR MANTSHA:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now I remember.  Okay alright.  I am 
sorry, I interrupted you while you were giving your answer.  
Please continue. 
MR MANTSHA:   Well, in fact, he told the Chairperson that 
that report was completed and the findings of Dentons, I 
think they were read before the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They may ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR MANTSHA:   What ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It is just that I cannot remember now. 
MR MANTSHA:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR MANTSHA:   Yes.  I think Mr Kennedy read them into 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 317 of 361 
 
the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR MANTSHA:   So what I am indicating here Chairperson.  
The report did not deal with the terms of reference that we 
have given to them.  If you see what Mr Kennedy has read 
in the record when Mr Talib Sadik was testifying, those 
were the issues which we wanted them to look at it.   
 
Why the Dentons report?  It was important 
because as the Audit and Risk Committee was engaging 
the bankers, there were issues that there was a refusal to 
10 
do a due diligence report on the LSSA as a company.  
 
Chair, you have heard evidence that says the 
value of 855 was obviously exaggerated.  So there were all 
those sorts of issues where we expected them to engage 
more extensively on those issues and present the report.  
So this is what I am trying to explain here.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I guess what Mr Kennedy is raising 
with you, includes the question:  Why would you have to 
say to the acting Company Secretary that he or she, I think 
it was a she, should direct Dentons to provide information 
20 
to support the charges?   
 
In other words, at least that is what I assume, 
that 
the 
– 
what 
was 
expected 
of 
Dentons 
when 
investigating, was that they would investigate and come up 
with, whether it is findings, recommendations, to say, yes, 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 318 of 361 
 
this charge is supported by evidence, this one is not 
supported by evidence or all are supported by evidence or 
none of them of them are supported by evidence. 
 
They are supposed to know their job.  Why direct 
the acting Company Secretary to say:  Tell them to provide 
information supporting the charges?  I think that is part of 
what Mr Kennedy is asking. 
 
Their attorneys who just told us that they must 
taken to know their job.  Why tell them what to give you?   
MR MANTSHA:   With respect Chairperson.  The charges 
10 
as indicated from the Risk and Audit report was served on 
the board on the 23 r d.  The deliberation of the board, the 
suspension letters and the charge sheet.  
 
So the charges were clearly formulated.  What 
this letter was supposed to mean.  There were other 
peripheral issues which Dentons report was supposed to 
give us, not what we already know, because you know you 
have to get value for money.  
 
We already knew that the terms sheet has been 
changed from five years to six months.  There was no 
20 
ministerial approval.  So all those facts we knew but there 
were other issues which required in-depth investigation.   
 
The appointment of Nedbank as the transaction 
advisor 
for 
the 
equity 
partner. 
 
So 
there 
were 
all 
associated issues relating to the LSSA transaction.  And 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 319 of 361 
 
these were the issues we wanted them to investigate, not 
to tell us issues that we already know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you saying that the mandate give to 
Dentons was not to investigate objectively, whether there 
was evidence any one or more of the charges because the 
board already knew that there was evidence of charges? 
 
All they were being asked to do is put together 
that evidence that supports the charges because we know 
that the charges are properly founded.  Are you – is that 
what you are telling me? 
10 
MR MANTSHA:   I think Chairperson, you... as well 
because there were a whole range of issues related to this 
transaction.  So we had the fiduciary duty as a board to 
report other issues that we were keeping from the bankers, 
who were keeping from people who were invited to 
participate and the equity partners, we were keeping 
issues from the company that was picked as a possible 
equity...  
 
So there were a number of issues which we 
wanted clarity on but the main evidence has been already 
20 
clearly set out.  The document to support that evidence 
was clearly there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the answer to my question, I take it, 
was yes, but you wanted to add on top of that... 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct Chairperson. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 320 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   Mr Kennedy.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair.  But why were you 
worried that you needed to make sure that the Dentons 
report had enough in it to support the charges?  You were 
instructing that the charges were going to go out the next 
day which is what happened.  As a parallel process, you 
are asking the Dentons report must be rewritten so that it 
does support the charges.   
 
You are not saying:  Give them an opportunity to 
indicate what their professional view is objectively, as the 
10 
Chairperson has suggested to you. 
MR MANTSHA:   No.  Obviously, the interpretation you are 
giving to this part is not exact what was meant because 
when you look at this, the charges were issued the 
following day.  It was of course not possible that this letter 
was saying:  Look, give us the evidence.  The evidence 
was there as set out in the charge sheet ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But then... Dentons report at all.  If 
the evidence was there, why did the disciplinary inquiry not 
happen?  On the 23 r d of September... I am going to repeat, 
20 
I am afraid and I must apologise to you.   
 
On 
the 
23 r d of September 2015, 
you 
as 
the 
chairperson were convinced from a memo from the Audit 
and Risk Committee to which the Executives had not 
responded in any detail, you were convinced that there was 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 321 of 361 
 
more than enough evidence to fire them on the spot. 
 
Three months later, sees you in a situation 
where you have at state expense, I might add, public 
expense, employed an outside firm of attorneys, Dentons, 
to prepare a report, no doubt, to get together evidence for 
the disciplinary charges.  And they give you a report but it 
does not give you the evidence of the charges. 
 
So you say:  Well, let us carry on.  We do not 
charge them tomorrow anyway.  In the meantime, ask 
Dentons to rewrite their report.  This time to try and find 
10 
some support for the charges.  It is all back to front.  Is it 
not? 
MR MANTSHA:   Well, Chairperson, I think the logic is very 
simple here.  If you actually start the logic from the report 
of the Audit and Risk Committee, the deliberation of the 
board and all the documents which were sent to these 
employees. 
 
So 
their 
additions 
were 
consistent, 
clearly 
consistent.  And so I have indicated to the Chairperson, 
there were many issues involved in this transaction, 
20 
including allegations of corruption and bribery.   
 
So there were a number of things which Dentons 
was supposed to present.  The Dentons report was beyond 
this disciplinary hearing.  It was not only meant for the 
disciplinary hearing. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 322 of 361 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   But hang on Mr Mantsha.  I am sorry 
to interrupt but may ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Let – maybe let him finish.  Yes. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe let him finish.  Mr Mantsha, finish 
with your answer. 
MR MANTSHA:   So there were a number of allegations 
which were flying all over.  So the Dentons report was 
meant to address all of it.  It was not that we could not 
have disciplined these employees without their report. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  Okay well, that brings me to what 
you said if you look at logic.  Now one thing that does not 
seem to accord with my logic is that you have said as at 
the date on which the date on which the decision to 
suspend them was taken, there was clear evidence, it was 
strong and the documentation was there. 
 
Actually, the decision, they could have been 
fired on the spot, as far as you are concerned.  Now why 
do you need Dentons insofar as the formulation of charges 
for insofar as information supporting the charges is 
20 
concerned because you are satisfied it is there. 
 
And as I recall, your board did not just have you 
as a lawyer.  There were quite a few legally trained people 
as I recall correctly. 
MR MANTSHA:   Correct. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 323 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why not just hand over the evidence to 
CDH if they were supposed to prosecute, as it were, in the 
disciplinary inquiry?  Let them formulate the charges, run 
with the disciplinary inquiry instead of waiting for three 
months. 
MR MANTSHA:   Well, Chairperson, you can clearly see 
from the letter of the 18 t h that charges were formulated.  
So correctly, we did not need the Dentons report to 
proceed with the disciplinary hearings.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
10 
MR MANTSHA:   As I said and I repeat.  The Dentons 
report was to cover all range of issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MANTSHA:   That additional issues would serve before 
the hearing, probably, as possible charges. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR MANTSHA:   That is how far I can take the matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Thank you Chair.  I want to test your 
suggestion what Dentons were really required to do, was 
20 
not provide information for these charges because you 
already had it.  They had to provide information for other 
possibilities such as corruption and fraud and such.  But 
your letter which records the instruction that must be given 
to Dentons says, page 389, the same page, paragraph 4.   
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 324 of 361 
 
“You are requested to inform Dentons their 
report is not acceptable and requesting to 
provide us with a report, in other words a new 
report, 
within 
30-days 
and 
kindly 
direct 
them...” 
 
This is a shopping list for what has to be put in a 
new report compared with the old. 
“...provide 
information 
to 
support 
that 
charges...” 
 
Those are the charges that are subject of the 
10 
charge sheet that went out the next day.  It is not for any 
other potential charges.  It is not say:  Please Dentons, 
you have confined yourself to the charges that the Audit 
and 
Risk 
Committee 
indicated 
on 
the 
22 n d  of September 2015.  Nothing at all. 
 
You...  Effectively, you are saying:  We are going 
to charge them tomorrow.  By the way, also ask Dentons to 
go and find some more evidence that can show that we 
have a basis for the charges.  It is completely the 
opposite. 
20 
 
Surely, as any police officer, any prosecutor in a 
criminal context or any disciplinary lawyer would know, you 
find what the evidence is, you sift that evidence, you then 
determine whether the evidence show a proper winnable 
case to the effect that the employee may be guilty of 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 325 of 361 
 
something. 
 
Here you are saying:   Let us go for the charges 
and then let us ask Dentons to do – make a second effort 
to try and find any evidence for those charges.  It is back 
to front.  Is it not? 
MR MANTSHA:   Well, Chairperson, I think – I am 
repeating myself in terms of my explanation.  I respect the 
view that he is making forward but I do not want to 
continue to repeat myself but as I have said, we had more 
than enough evidence as set out in the documents, we 
10 
charge... 
 
So Dentons was appointed above other things to 
provide specific issues.  So as we sit here, we have got 
the benefit of a final report which they have presented and 
that follow report as it was read before this Commission, 
actually confirm what is set out in the charge sheet as 
correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Well, it is not quite as simple as that 
but I am not going to engage in a debate with you on that 
Mr Mantsha because I want to stick to the, what seems to 
20 
be the essential issue here and that is why you were so 
concerned not to accept the Dentons report and to require 
them to find more information to provide information to 
support the charges.   
 
I find it concerning, particularly as a legal 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 326 of 361 
 
practitioner.  When a client tells me, as this instruction 
seems to be directed to Dentons:  Dentons, you find 
incriminating evidence.  Not:  Dentons, find evidence which 
objectively tested and then give us a view as to whether 
we have a basis for charge or not. 
 
It is like asking an advocate to give an opinion 
but it must say that the client is right.  You understand the 
concern? 
MR MANTSHA:   I really appreciate your concern. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
10 
MR MANTSHA:   And Chairperson, I appreciate the 
concern but the evidence was there.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Right. 
MR MANTSHA:   The evidence was there.  The evidence 
should have been captured. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   Yes. 
MR MANTSHA:   And their report did not even capture that 
evidence because... it was not...  [Speaker ’s voice drops – 
unclear.] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR 
MANTSHA: 
 
 
So 
maybe 
the 
reading 
of 
these 
paragraphs do not clearly said what the clear intention 
was.  I suppose Chairperson, as you always in your career 
of many years, as you always seek to interpret either the 
legislation.  So there is always sometime the usage of the 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 327 of 361 
 
language which does not carry the real intention. 
 
It might well be that the usage of the language 
here did not convey exactly what we wanted but as I 
responded to the Chairperson, it was more than what we 
already had and what we already had was supposed to be 
professional, in our view, as we must get value for money, 
as you correctly say, public money.   
 
So when you give us a report, it must be a report 
that shows that work has been done and we were not 
satisfied.   
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:   I would like to suggest to you that 
the paragraph that we have been so long on, is in fact 
quite clear in its intention to really reconcile it with your 
own evidence.  Of course when I make remarks about the 
importance of ensuring that legal practitioners be given a 
free hand to give proper objective, independent advice, I 
am talking to you not simply as the former Chairperson of 
the Board of Denel, but of course as an attorney. 
MR MANTSHA:  I appreciate that.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Of many years’ experience, not so? 
20 
MR MANTSHA:  I appreciate that Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  We are aware that you were struck off 
the roll of attorneys in 2011 but then reinstated, not so 
thereafter? 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 328 of 361 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  At the time that you were the 
Chairperson of the Board here, had you by then been 
reinstated as an Attorney? 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So your being removed off the roll, 
struck off the roll was now over.  It had been reversed as it 
were.  
MR MANTSHA:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You did not appeal the original 
decision as I understand it, but you applied again later and 
10 
then succeeded in persuading the High Court to reinstate 
you on the roll of attorneys. 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Just to complete this reference to the 
Denton’s report, you say in paragraph 5, and lastly may 
you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Kennedy.  Mr Mantsha, I 
just want to put this and I am quite happy for you to 
respond and say something if you wish to, but if you feel 
you have given an answer I am quite happy that you say so 
20 
as well. 
 
This is the proposition, that in paragraph 4, when in 
paragraph 4 you say the acting company secretary must 
tell Dentons that their report is not accepted.  The reason 
why it is not accepted, appears ... seems to appear from 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 329 of 361 
 
the balance of the paragraph, namely what we were 
expecting from them.   
 
It is the report that gives us information that 
supports the charges.  The reason when you look at this 
without any other explanation you might give, when you 
just look at this, it is like the defect in the report is that it 
does not give us information that supports the charges.  
 
So I am just saying that is the impression I get 
when I look at this on its own.  You might be able to say 
here is my response to that or you might say I cannot add 
10 
to what I have already said.  
MR MANTSHA:  I think Chairperson, just a quick response.  
If you read this letter out of context of what was 
happening, you can probably come with that conclusion, 
but if you read this letter in the context of what was 
happening, so clearly you cannot come to that conclusion. 
 
So I am saying reading the letter in the context of 
what the evidence which was presented and the reports 
which were given, so this letter cannot mean that there 
was no evidence when the decision was taken.  If we are 
20 
reading this letter within the context, but if you take this 
letter as a standalone, then you can come to that 
conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Just in conclusion 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 330 of 361 
 
on this letter at the foot of the page, 389 paragraph 5, you 
say: 
 
“And lastly may you recall the stridulated 
Dentons 
report 
and 
make 
sure 
it 
is 
not 
circulated.” 
Now Mr Saloojee has suggested that this was 
again part of the smoke screen, part of the strategy.  He 
did not want a report that was neutral in favour of Saloojee 
and Nonhlonhlo to be circulated.  You were simply driven 
by the sole motive which was to concoct the parties 
10 
against each other. 
 
Any view on that? 
MR MANTSHA:  Chairperson, that is absolutely, absolutely 
incorrect.  There is a completed Denton report as we 
speak, which do find these two executive [indistinct] of 
various issues, including non- disclosure and other things.  
 
So there is a report as we speak now.  So I do not 
want to keep on repeating myself.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.   
MR MANTSHA:  So I completely disagree.  There was no 
20 
smoke screen.  The allegations as they were on the 23 r d of 
September, as they were at the time of the suspension and 
at the time of the serving of the charge sheet, is the same 
as it stands before this Commission as presented by Mr 
Talied Sadik, who took this Commission on the Denton’s 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 331 of 361 
 
report as it stands today as completed.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Right.  So that was your letter to the 
acting company secretary.  We know that the charges and 
the other documents were then issued the following day.  If 
I can now take you to page 385?   
 
In fact, sorry just before we get there.  One 
thing I missed on page 383 which was part of your 
notification of the disciplinary process including the charge 
sheet.  You have 383?  383, it is just a few pages before 
where we were.  
10 
MR MANTSHA:  Thank you Mr Kennedy. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Paragraph 6.  You say: 
 
“Please be advised disciplinary hearing will be 
held on the 25 t h of January 2016.  To be 
advised of the venue, etcetera.” 
 
So that was now finally scheduled for the 25 t h 
of January 2016, four months after the decision to suspend 
them and to subject them to disciplinary charges.  
MR MANTSHA:  Correct.  
ADV 
KENNEDY 
SC: 
 
Now 
Ms 
Walele, 
the 
attorney 
20 
representing the three, then writes on the 1 s t of January, 
sorry the 7 t h of January, page 385 and she writes she 
addressed her letter to Mr Adil Pathel who is a very senior 
and experienced labour lawyer at CDH, Cliff Decker 
Hofmeyr, and she writes to him, no doubt because he was 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 332 of 361 
 
already involved as part of the legal team, to prepare for 
the disciplinary inquiry. 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now she says in paragraph 1 that she 
will be assisted by senior counsel, in fact a later letter 
refers to that in brief Advocate Craig Watt Pringle SC, the 
representative for the Employee, and then she says in 
paragraph 2: 
 
“We are in the process for preparing for the 
disciplinary hearings scheduled for the 25 t h of 
10 
January 
2016 
and 
require 
a 
number 
of 
documents to adequately presents our client’s 
defence.” 
 
Then she asks for specific documents, set out on 
page 386 and then she says on page 387, paragraph 4: 
 
“We understand that Dentons have furnished 
your client with a report pursuant to the 
completion of their investigation.  Our clients 
have since been charged and would like to 
have access to the conclusions made pursuant 
20 
to the investigation.  We have reason to 
believe that the contents of the report are 
essential for our client’s defence and therefore 
request that same be made available to our 
client.” 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 333 of 361 
 
 
Now 
that 
Dentons 
report 
was 
not 
made 
available to Mr Saloojee, or Mr Nonhlonhlo or Ms Africa or 
their legal team, correct? 
MR MANTSHA:  Yes.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Why was it not [indistinct]? 
MR MANTSHA:  Well, Chairperson I and the Board, we 
were not handling the disciplinary process on behalf of, I 
must say this.  That we were very unhappy with the way in 
which the legal department was moving on the matter.  I 
think to a certain extent where I think we, the person who 
10 
was holding this position, I think had so much pressure and 
some breakdown and eventually approved.  She left the 
company.   
 
So we were not happy with the pace of this 
matter.  Yet we were pressed with saving the company as 
the company was sinking.  So we raised our concerns 
about the pace.  We were not happy about the pace.  We 
raised our concern about the maintenance report because 
it was not worth what we were paying for.  
 
So we raised those concerns and in our view I 
20 
do not know what served to us one can even consider as a 
report.  So that is why it was in the interest of the, 
complete the report and that report can be served to these 
Employees.  
 
I do not know whether they completed the report 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 334 of 361 
 
as it was testified here, whether it was given to the 
Employees, but we were particularly not happen.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Well, we do know and there has been 
evidence from the witnesses that they never received any 
Dentons report.  I would like to test your version for a 
moment please.  You have suggested, just remember 
please.   
 
My 
previous 
question 
was 
were 
they 
ever 
provided with the Dentons report.  You say you do not 
know.  We have heard evidence.  The Commission has 
10 
heard evidence that that was never provided.  The Dentons 
report was never provided, and when I asked you why not, 
your explanation seems to be well people were so busy, 
but people being too busy does not explain that why you do 
not ever report.  
MR MANTSHA:  I think that is not what I tried to answer 
with respect.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Then I apologise, just to clarify 
please? 
MR MANTSHA:  Yes, I repeat myself.  The report which 
20 
served before us was not, it was such a very shallow 
document, it was so incomplete, it was not a report you 
can serve and we requested that please talk to these 
people to finalize this report.  
 
I must also add that the appointment of the 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 335 of 361 
 
investigator of Dentons, it had of course nothing to do with 
the 
board, 
because 
these 
are 
all 
decisions 
of 
the 
management.  As the Chairperson I have never sat down 
with the Denton people. 
 
I think the members of Audit and Risk Committee 
had meetings with them and convey our unhappiness with 
the pace of the work.  I think they had some discussion as 
they were interacting with them, but yes we were not happy 
with the report and it was not served at that stage, 
because it was really not complete.   
10 
 
The report that we saw. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, the Employees who had been 
suspended were senior Employees.  Maybe the term 
executives is correct.  Are you saying that whether or not 
there should be an investigation such as the investigation 
that was conducted by Dentons, was not a decision that 
was made by the board? 
MR MANTSHA:  Well, the board made a decision to 
investigate that there are all sort of allegations.  There is 
allegations of bribery, there were allegations of corruption.  
20 
There were a lot of allegations.  They have inflated price 
what Denel has paid and all sorts of things. 
 
So we then say there must be an investigation.  
But in terms of the company protocol, the executive 
appoint service providers.  It is not the board that appoint 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 336 of 361 
 
service providers.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR MANTSHA:  So Denton was appointed to do this job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the management? 
MR MANTSHA:  By the management. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MANTSHA:  And as I said, I think I was never, I have 
never met them.  I think there were either two or I do not 
know 
how 
many 
meetings 
with 
the 
Audit 
and 
Risk 
Committee and members of Audit and Risk Committee of 
10 
course convey the displeasure from the board in terms of 
what we were seeing at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  Now we have just 
seen that the disciplinary hearing was supposed to take 
place on the 25 t h of January 2016, correct? 
MR MANTSHA:  Correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now that disciplinary inquiry did not 
take place on that date.  If I can take you to page 385, 
there is another letter from Ms Walele again addressed to 
20 
Mr Patel at CDH.  
 
That is the very date that the inquiry was 
supposed to start on the 25 t h of January and she says: 
 
 
“Your email with attached letter dated the 22 n d 
of January 2015, 2016 I beg your pardon and our telephone 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 337 of 361 
 
conversation of even date refers.  Please be advised that 
our clients will attend a proposed mediation process as set 
out in your letter and subject to the following terms.” 
 
Then she refers to the venue being the chambers 
of the counsel who had been appointed to try to mediate, 
Advocate Pretorius SC, and ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, I am sorry.  Where are you reading 
from? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Page 395.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you I found it.  
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  So what this letter indicated Mr 
Mantsha is that the disciplinary inquiry was now being put 
aside for a while, because instead what was being 
proposed on behalf of Denel was to go for mediation 
Chaired by a different counsel. 
 
They agreed to this subject to certain conditions, 
and were you aware that in fact there was a mediation 
exercise undertaken? 
MR MANTSHA:  Well, I am not preview to everything that 
was happening.   
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Were you aware or were you not? 
MR MANTSHA:  I might recall that maybe on the day I was 
informed that there will be mitigation of some sort, but I 
cannot really recall Chairperson. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 338 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you are not suggesting, are you, that 
in a situation where the board has suspended Employees 
pending a disciplinary inquiry, the management could take 
a decision to go to mediation and therefore not pursue 
what has been approved by the board, namely pursuing 
disciplinary charges, that they could do that without going 
back to the board to say you give, should we follow this 
mediation route because your decision as the board is that 
we must pursue disciplinary charges? 
 
You are not suggesting that they did that? 
10 
MR MANTSHA:  With respect Chairperson, I am not 
suggesting that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MANTSHA:  I think I will repeat myself again, the Audit 
and Risk Committee of the board was of course involved in 
this matter from the beginning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were managing this process. 
MR MANTSHA:  Yes, investigation and all sorts of things.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR MANTSHA:  So the correspondence from an attorney to 
20 
the attorneys of the company, the attorneys of the company 
would then talk with the legal department of the company.  
The legal department of the company would probably talk 
to the CE or the CFO, and then they would relay the matter 
to the committee that was dealing with it.  
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 339 of 361 
 
 
So all I am saying to you is I am not saying that 
the decision of having mediation would have been taken by 
the 
legal 
department 
without 
consulting 
the 
relevant 
committee of the board which was handling the matter.  I 
am not suggesting that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  Okay. 
MR MANTSHA:  So what I am saying to you, of course if 
there was then mediation, it was of course with the 
blessing of the relevant committee of the board which was 
dealing with the matter. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, the Audit and Risk Committee?  
The Audit and Risk Committee. 
MR MANTSHA:  The Audit and Risk Committee, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you.  Now the Commission has 
heard evidence from Mr Saloojee that the mediation 
session did in fact take place, Chaired by Advocate 
Pretorius SC.  It did not succeed in resolving the dispute 
and that what was conveyed to the executives and their 
legal team, was that Denel was prepared to look at a 
20 
settlement, but not on the basis that they would resume 
work.  
 
Do you know about that or if you do not know, 
just say you do not know? 
MR MANTSHA:  Well, I really do not know the contest of it. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 340 of 361 
 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay.  Now if I can refer you now to 
page 403, there is one of various emails.  Chair, I am not 
going to take him through every single one.  Just the ones 
that seem to be important. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  The top of page 403 sir, is an email 
from Ms Walele to Adel Patel from CDH, on the 16 t h of 
February 2016.  You see that? 
MR MANTSHA:  Yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And she says: 
10 
 
 
“Dear Adil.  Our request for documents from 
yourselves, have fallen on deaf ears.  Your failure to hand 
over the documents already requested, has impacted on 
our preparation of this matter.  You are dealing with 
complex issues and a large volume of documents that will 
oblige yourself to furnish our clients with same to ensure 
that they are adequately prepared for the hearing.” 
 
Now Mr Mantsha, the ...[intervenes]  
MR MANTSHA:  Correction sir.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Sorry, Mr Mantsha.  I beg your 
20 
pardon.  I was dyslexic and now I pronounced, you said it 
very different from everyone else.  I apologise, with no 
disrespect to you or to Mr Mantsha.  Mr Mantsha, this is 
one of a number of emails and formal letters in which Ms 
Walele repeatedly, right from her response as far back as 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 341 of 361 
 
the 
7 t h 
of 
January 
has 
been 
repeatedly 
asking 
for 
documents.  
 
You were not aware of that.  You cannot 
...[intervenes] 
MR MANTSHA:  Chairperson, I am not preview to those 
communications. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Yes, you see you suggested 
earlier in one of your answers to the Chairperson that the 
Employees may have been delaying things and then you 
backtracked from that.  What I want to put to you and I 
10 
want you to comment on it to say I agree or I disagree or I 
do not know.  
 
What I want to put to you is when one looks at 
all the correspondence, there is nothing in the papers at all 
that shows that the Employees and the executives or their 
legal team were delaying things unreasonably.  It happens 
all the time.   
 
But when one as a legal practitioner is briefed or 
instructed to represent a particularly a senior executive in 
a major corporation like Denel, one of the first things you 
20 
do is to ask for documents.  We have the charge sheet, 
now we would like to ask you for documents.  
 
So it is a perfectly normal request, and the 
complaint that has been laid by Mr Saloojee in his 
evidence and Mr Nonhlonhlo was that we kept asking for 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 342 of 361 
 
documents, we kept saying why is this disciplinary process 
taking so long, a concern that you have indicated you 
shared, and one of the problem was but they just do not 
give us any documents.  
 
Now if your concern at the top level of the board 
of Denel were anxious to ensure that the disciplinary 
process should be dealt with quickly, why was there no 
production of documents?  Do you have any explanation for 
that or is that beyond your knowledge? 
MR MANTSHA:  Well Chairperson, that is obviously beyond 
10 
my knowledge.  I have never dealt with the lawyers 
representing the company.  The legal department dealt with 
them.  So I am not even preview to this kind of exchange, 
but I must say the following to you Chairperson. 
 
We were obviously very concerned with the pace 
of this process and internally we had our own battles about 
it.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Well, 
I 
expect 
you 
to 
have 
been 
concerned and I am, I suspect that I do not have, I have 
not seen anything here that the delay had now reached 
20 
maybe about seven months of suspension and per month 
paying these three executives must have been quite a 
substantial amount.  
MR MANTSHA:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I would be surprised if you, the company 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 343 of 361 
 
was 
paying 
them 
altogether 
less 
than 
R400 000-00, 
R500 000-00.  Maybe I am even too conservative.  You 
have an idea how much Denel was paying per month each 
time, each month they were not working and then they were 
on suspension, more or less? 
MR MANTSHA:  With respect Chairperson, I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You have no idea? 
MR MANTSHA:  I have no idea about their salaries.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, because that becomes important, is 
it not?  When you look at the delay you know because you 
10 
cannot afford a situation where the company is paying a lot 
of money to Employees who are not rendering any service 
to it, and it is pending an inquiry and it is taking too long 
because it is untenable.   
MR MANTSHA:  Correct Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You have said that.  
MR MANTSHA:  And this is what happened here.  The 
Chairperson is perfectly correct.  We shared the same 
sentiment.  This was prolong and as this was being 
prolonged, of course there were a number of political 
20 
events taking place in the country. 
 
So we were not happy with how this matter was 
done.  With all respect to the companies attorneys who 
were handling this matter, but we just felt our internal 
people were not moving with speed, and at the same time 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 344 of 361 
 
as I said, we were so consumed with the bigger picture for 
the company, and of course that consumed a lot of our 
attention and we were more focused on those.  
 
I share the same sentiment.  We were not happy 
with the duration of this, so it is not like it is something 
that we were happy with.  Not at all.  We were not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair.  May I raise a 
question that flows from your own question Chairperson to 
the witness, about what it must have been costing the 
10 
company to keep somebody on paid suspension, month 
after month. 
 
As it happens Chair, it seems to be that your 
estimate was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Very conservative. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Pretty much spot on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  We are going to take you later in the 
20 
same 
bundle 
to 
the 
settlement 
agreement 
that 
was 
concluded between Denel and Mr Saloojee and that 
indicates that he was paid as part of the benefits, a so 
called ex gracia amount of 2.36 million rand which it says 
is an amount equivalent to 50% of the Employee’s annual 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 345 of 361 
 
remuneration. 
 
Now if you take 2.36 million and you double that 
to get the annual remuneration that gives you about 4.8 
million and if you divide that by 12 to get the monthly 
amount it is in fact spot on what the Chairperson guessed, 
but it was about R400 000-00 a month that you were 
paying Mr Saloojee. 
 
Mr Nonhlonhlo we can deal with separately.  He 
obviously earned a bit less.  But it was certainly hundreds 
of thousands of rands that were being paid for month after 
10 
month after month, in a process that was taking too long in 
your view.   
MR MANTSHA:  You are correct. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Correct.  Of course Mr Saloojee and 
Mr Nonhlonhlo suggest something else, which is that the 
reason why it was taking so long was that they did not 
capitulate when the three months offer was made to them 
in settlement [indistinct].   
 
They said bring it on, we want to defend 
ourselves.  You will see that in the Respondent’s email but 
20 
presumably you reject that version.  Correct? 
MR MANTSHA:  I am not ...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You thought you accepted a version 
that this was actually a smoke screen against them.  That 
you were battling to find a case.  If you had had a case, 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 346 of 361 
 
especially superbly efficient attorneys such as Mr Patel, if I 
may say so with due respect to him, would have had this 
disciplinary inquiry done and dusted within a matter of 
weeks.  
MR MANTSHA:  Well, I think Chairperson again I am going 
to be guilty of repeating myself.  Categorically, no.  There 
were charges.  There were serious charges.  There were 
serious violation that they have committed.  The hearing 
was never a smoke screen. 
 
I cannot sit here and talk for the Attorneys of the 
10 
company.  All I can say, I share the displeasure of the 
matter took too long.  Our members of Audit and Risk 
committee intervene where necessary and I cannot take the 
matter further than that.  
 
But it is not true that these charges were just by 
the way meant to get rid of these people, and again I refer 
you 
to 
the 
completed 
report 
by 
Denton 
which 
then 
confirmed these allegations and the evidence as we sit 
here is that a company is taking action, specifically against 
Mr Saloojee and Mr Nonhlonhlo. 
20 
 
That evidence is very clear here.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  
MR MANTSHA:  So if you take the logic from what was 
started in 2015 by my board, to what has happened in the 
current 
investigation 
by 
the 
company, 
clearly 
that 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 347 of 361 
 
allegation have been sustained and the current leadership 
of 
Denel 
has 
adopted 
from 
the 
evidence 
that 
was 
presented here.   
 
So to say this was a smoke screen, let us assume 
you can accuse my board of trying to put up together, but 
then you have got another board, then you have got 
another executive.  We have accepted it.  So and anyway 
at the nature of the charges, put the conditions of approval 
on one hand and what happened?  The approval was for a 
five year term loan.  The loan which these executives 
10 
signed for was a bridge finance for six months.  
 
We gave them an approval, because they must 
get the approval from the shareholder, the executive 
authority.  There was no approval, so to actually try to 
suggest that this was a smoke screen of some sort, whilst 
the evidence are clear.  
 
The approval conditions from National Treasury, 
the approval conditions from the Department of Public 
Enterprise is all there.  The action of the executive, it is 
there.  They were told please do not play the banks against 
20 
one another.   
 
What did they do?  They went to go and play 
Absa against Nedbank.  What did they do?  They let 
Nedbank run with no security, they gave Absa security.  So 
they have completely as is captured in the final report 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 348 of 361 
 
which you have presented to this Commission, that they did 
not follow the terms and conditions of the approval. 
 
That is the case.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, I am sorry Mr Kennedy.  I want to 
go 
back 
to 
Mr 
Kennedy’s 
earlier 
formulation 
of 
his 
question.  He later re-formulated it.  Are you in a position 
to deny or dispute the Employee’s version that throughout 
their suspension, maybe it is not throughout, but most of 
that 
period 
of 
suspension, 
their 
attitude 
was 
you 
suspended us on the basis that they were, we were guilty 
10 
of misconduct and there would be a disciplinary inquiry. 
 
Bring those charges on, bring that hearing on 
and they say when the offer of three months pay as a 
settlement was made, they rejected it because they wanted 
to clear their names at the disciplinary inquiry.  They say, 
if I recall correctly, even the mediation when it was put 
before them, they insisted that they wanted a disciplinary 
inquiry because they wanted to clear their name.  
 
They were satisfied that there was no evidence 
of wrongdoing on their part.  Now as I understand it, we 
20 
know that for the first at least six months, maybe more 
than that, no three months I am sorry, it is accepted that 
the delay in convening a disciplinary inquiry was not due to 
any delaying tactics on their part, one.  
 
Two, charges were brought and then they asked 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 349 of 361 
 
for documents.  A settlement offer was made which as I 
understand their evidence they rejected, they were not 
interested in it.  At some stage, I cannot remember what 
stage, a mediation proposal was made they say, and they 
say all of this comes from the Employer, not from them.  
 
You know, the settlement offer comes from the 
Employer. 
 
The 
mediation 
proposal 
comes 
from 
the 
Employer.  They say throughout we are saying bring the 
disciplinary hearing.  So are you able to say that is not, 
that was not their attitude or are you only able to say you 
10 
are not aware that that was their attitude? 
MR MANTSHA:  Well, Chairperson with respect, a lot of it 
will be rhetorical.  We are in a profession that every day 
we meet people.  Irrespective of the allegations but then 
they maintain certain positions, and probably some time to 
fight it on, while they know very well that I see we are 
spending a lot of time on this issue, but Chairperson, we 
sit with objective facts before us. 
 
I think with respect ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second, I am going to 
20 
interrupt you.  You have made the point about the final 
report.  I guess it is of the Dentons, but I am just wanting 
to establish whether with regard to what they said was 
their attitude, whether you are able to say it is not true, 
that was not their attitude or you say it is true, that was 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 350 of 361 
 
their attitude or you say I actually do not know whether it 
was their attitude or not.  
MR MANTSHA:  Well, firstly I was not part of the 
discussions between our lawyers and their lawyers.  So 
whether they were saying bring it on or not, but what I am 
saying with respect Chairperson, for me in the profession 
that we are in, that completely means nothing.  
 
So whether they said bring it on or not bring it 
on, but it does not address the serious violation.  It does 
not mean that the allegations against them, despite of the 
10 
brave face they were trying to put, were not strong and 
valid allegations against them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one aspect that I do not want to 
forget to raise with you.  Do you know whether Dentons 
actually interviewed them and got their version, their side 
of the story before preparing their final report? 
MR MANTSHA:  With respect Chairperson, I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  You have no knowledge? 
MR MANTSHA:  I have no idea because it seems from the 
evidence before this Commission, that these reports have 
20 
been finalized fairly after my departure.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR MANTSHA:  And after the departure of my board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR MANTSHA:  So these reports are serving I think in the 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 351 of 361 
 
current.  I really do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of course you would agree, would you 
not, that if and I say if because I am also not sure.  If 
Dentons report completed their report without interviewing 
these Employees, then their report would not carry the kind 
of weight that one would have attached to it, if they had 
interviewed and got their side of the story. 
MR MANTSHA:  Well, with respect Chairperson, the 
Commission led evidence of Mr Sadik on those issues, and 
I have got a transcript here with me. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR MANTSHA:  But what I do not see, I do not see that 
question Chairperson, that the Chairperson is raising now.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  
MR MANTSHA:  How good is the report.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe it is because of how you are 
presenting your evidence.   
MR MANTSHA:  Yes, and Chairperson with respect I think 
that question is being asked to a wrong person, with 
respect.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  
MR MANTSHA:  I have made copies of the various 
transcripts of evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR MANTSHA:  And that evidence is clear.  There was 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 352 of 361 
 
nothing that stopped the Commission to actually raise that 
question with you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR MANTSHA:  But my understanding when I read the 
evidence, the Commission placed certain reports to them, 
and those matters were not disputed and the questions 
which are being asked to me, were not asked.  I think it is 
unfair that I can answer something that has happened after 
my departure, but the records are here and these are the 
records of the Commission, and this is the evidence that 
10 
the Commission has placed.  
 
What comes out of it, is not for me to say 
Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair, may I just assist?  
In fact the evidence of Mr Saloojee and Mr Nonhlonhlo is 
that they were at one stage interviewed by Dentons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But what is clear is that there was no 
disciplinary inquiry. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  After which ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, that is ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  On which the witness can be cross-
examined. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 353 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, that is fine, ja. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright, thank you.  Mr Mantsha, may I 
now take you to page 405?   
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  405.  This is another letter from Ms 
Walele to Mr Patel and I will not take you through the 
whole of it, but she quotes a newspaper article, which 
quotes you as having said something before parliament, a 
parliamentary 
committee, 
select 
committee 
on 
public 
enterprises and communication. 
10 
 
You were quoted in the media, saying these 
officials referring to the executives were in breach of the 
law and they failed to observe the legal requirements of 
the PFMA.  Did you in fact say that to the parliamentary 
committee?   
MR MANTSHA:  I might have said that, correct.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  Now what she complains about, 
is firstly that you found them guilty even before a 
disciplinary inquiry is being held and secondly that there 
has been a delay.  The top of page 406, she says 
20 
paragraph 2: 
 
 
“Essentially our clients have already been 
found guilty by the Employer and as previously 
alluded to, had imputed to the view held by our 
clients that there was a concerted effort by 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 354 of 361 
 
your 
clients 
to 
terminate 
our 
client’s 
employment.  Your client by so doing have 
pronounced upon and have concluded that our 
clients are guilty before even having regard to 
their rights and fairness.” 
 
Is that criticism not a justified criticism in your 
view? 
MR MANTSHA:  No, not really Chairperson.  Again, it is 
one paragraph.  When you go to parliament, there are 
presentation that you, you do not just speak to parliament.  
10 
A presentation that you speak on, that you circulate to 
members of parliament.  
 
So just pick one line like this and say this is 
what the newspaper reported, is not saying this is what 
your client’s presentation stated.  So it is really not for me 
to answer what newspaper have written. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes, but Mr Mantsha you have 
accepted, you have admitted that you may have said this, 
and there has been no reply from Mr Patel or from your 
office or anybody else that we are aware of, that disputes 
20 
that you in fact said that to parliament, and you accepted 
you may have said it.  
MR MANTSHA:  No ...[intervenes] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I take your point completely that this 
is one sentence taken out of a lengthy address and so to 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 355 of 361 
 
be fair to you, there may be other statements that you may 
have made, but it does seem that right from the 23 r d of 
September 2015 where you believed Ben already before 
they had even been suspended, there was more than 
enough evidence to fire them on the spot, as you put it.  
 
Here, months later you are telling parliament 
these 
executives 
have 
breached 
the 
law 
and 
have 
breached the PFMA.  Now is it not appropriate rather to tell 
parliament there are allegations that they may have 
breached the law, and may be in breach of the PFMA, and 
10 
therefore we had a disciplinary inquiry.  
 
It is being convened. 
MR MANTSHA:  With respect Chairperson, I do not think 
we must get into a statement which is allegedly said by the 
newspaper.  So I make presentation to parliament, in the 
profession where I practice.  We speak of allegations.  So 
to then say I said this statement as it is, there are no basis 
to suggest that.  
 
To take this statement as a statement of facts, 
without producing the presentation which was given in 
20 
parliament, in my frame we speak of allegations.  Surely I 
would 
have 
indicated 
the 
allegations 
against 
these 
Employees is one, two, three, four, five.  
 
I am quite conscious of that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Now you seem to be disputing that 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 356 of 361 
 
you did say to parliament they were guilty of breaches of 
the law and the PFMA. 
MR MANTSHA:  No, with respect Chairperson, with respect 
the way this statement is worded, that is what I am saying.  
This statement allegedly speaks from the newspaper.  I am 
saying the presentation was made to parliament.  It was in 
a presentation form.  
 
Of course I do not remember all the statements 
that I have named to parliament, because we presented.  
So if Mr Kennedy was presenting me with a document 
10 
where we stated this, then I would appropriately responded 
to him. 
 
But I cannot respond to this alleged newspaper 
article that I have said this and that. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I understand.  There is no evidence 
though that any reply was received from Mr Patel at CDH 
or yourself, that you have been misquoted or that if one 
looked at the proper context, the quotation was misleading.  
MR MANTSHA:  With respect Chairperson, I was never 
party to this statement.  
20 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Okay. 
MR MANTSHA:  I was never even asked Chair, can you 
comment.  Allegedly you made this statement.  I was never 
consulted on it.  So I am seeing this as we are proceeding 
with everything.  So it is not something that I was asked to 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 357 of 361 
 
deal with. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Alright, may I continue with a few last 
points in the letter, page 406.  Paragraph 4, Ms Walele 
says: 
 
“Your client’s conduct towards my client ...” 
 
That is particularly your statement to parliament 
that they allege you made is regard, and that being 
...[intervenes]  
MR MANTSHA:  With respect Chair, can I be protected? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
10 
MR MANTSHA:  I think it is wrong for Mr Kennedy to say 
my statement.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
MR MANTSHA:  I think that is actually there are no basis 
to make that statement.  It is correct to say you alleged 
...[intervenes]  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I thought I said that.  
MR MANTSHA:  Which I have denied.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  I thought I have said that, but if 
I did not, I apologise.  
20 
MR MANTSHA:  Thank you. 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  The statement that was attributed to 
you, is then used as a basis for their allegation in 
paragraph 4, and please understand some of the remarks 
you made earlier suggest perhaps a misunderstanding of 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 358 of 361 
 
my role.  
 
I am here to put the version of Saloojee and 
Nonhlonhlo, 
and 
Ms 
Africa 
so 
that 
the 
Chairperson 
ultimately can come to a view if the, whether the issue has 
to be decided or not for purposes of this Commission and 
...[intervenes]  
MR MANTSHA:  I really appreciate Chairperson.  I really 
appreciate your role.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Just ...[intervenes]  
MR MANTSHA:  Thank you very much. 
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Just as I have raised issues that were 
put in your statement to other witnesses, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on just one second Mr Kennedy.  I 
see we are at what, eight minutes past nine.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I want to check, from what I have been 
told I thought I am sitting tomorrow, but I am told that I 
may have been mistaken.   
ADV KENNEDY SC:  You have? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I may have been mistaken to think I am 
20 
sitting tomorrow.  Now I am just checking in the light of the 
time, where we are and of course I am able to proceed, but 
I want to check whether by any chance we are all available 
tomorrow, in which case if that is the case we can explore 
whether we should adjourn now, because we are all 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 359 of 361 
 
available tomorrow, but obviously if we are not all available 
tomorrow, that then we can decide whether, how far we go 
from now.   
 
Maybe we go another 30 minutes, stop at half 
past nine and then if we are not done, arrange to continue 
one of the evenings again.  What is your situation Mr 
Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Chair, I believe I will just have to 
check my diary but I believe that I should be able to re-
arrange things, to make myself available. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  I do not know about my learned 
friends.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Cilliers? 
ADV CILLIERS:  May I maybe suggest that Mr Kennedy 
gives us an indication of how long he still need with the 
witness? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV CILLIERS:  Maybe that should be the starting point. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Ja, 
what 
is 
your 
assessment 
Mr 
20 
Kennedy? 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Chairperson, lawyers are always 
criticized for making estimates and I have been quite 
optimistic that we could finish this witness at least by ten 
o’clock tonight. 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 360 of 361 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But I am afraid that optimism has not 
borne fruit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  And I think in the nature, I have not 
interrupted the witness when he has rather tendered to go 
into reciprocal detail often in response to very limited 
questions, because obviously he must have a chance to 
have his full say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
10 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  But on that basis I suspect probably 
another four hours.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I think if the time that we still need 
in order to finish Mr Mantsha’s evidence was a short time.  
Like 30 minutes maybe we might have considered whether 
to just proceed and finish, but from what Mr Kennedy says, 
we need much more than that.  
 
That being the case, it may be that there is no 
warrant for us to proceed if we are not going to finish 
today anyway.  Maybe we should look at finding another, 
20 
either finding another evening or if tomorrow might work 
with everybody being available, we can explore tomorrow. 
 
Mr Cilliers? 
ADV CILLIERS:  May I suggest that you maybe adjourn for 
a couple of minutes that I just take instructions from my 
04 MARCH 2021 – DAY 355 
 
Page 361 of 361 
 
attorney and find out what their availability is.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV CILLIERS:  But my client did indicate that he may 
have 
difficulty 
in 
future, 
because 
he 
has 
some 
commitments.  I have a difficulty with tomorrow.  I am in 
court tomorrow.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, you are not available tomorrow. 
MR CILLIERS SC:  So I unfortunately am not available 
tomorrow during the course of the day.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
10 
MR CILLIERS SC:  Can I ask that you maybe or suggest 
that we maybe just take the three, four minute adjournment 
and then I can take it up with him.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay.  No, let us do that.  We will 
take a few minutes adjournment and then ...[intervenes] 
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Should we approach you in chambers 
Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes you can approach me in 
chambers, ja.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  In chambers. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
ADV KENNEDY SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, we adjourn.   
REGISTRAR:   All rise.
