CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Yes please administer the oath or 
affirmation.  I am not sure whether Mr Tsotsi is not too far

CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you; you may be seated.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Tsotsi welcome.  When – you agree 
with me please speak out do not nod your head for the 
purposes of the record and you will be addressing the DCJ 
– the Chairperson of the inquiry.  You have before you two 
bundles.  There is the thicker bundle marked Eskom Bundle 
20 
07.  Can you see that? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Exhibit U17. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You can see that?  Then you have as 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 6 of 236 
 
you heard earlier explaining to the Chairperson the thinner 
bundle Eskom Bundle 07.1 which is a continuation of the 
first one. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Mr Tsotsi. Mr Tsotsi you 
have provided the commission with your affidavit and that 
is found on page 1 of the bigger file – U17.  Go to page 1.  
Chairperson the – this – this bundle is paginated as you 
have indicated yesterday.  There is the black pagination 
and the red pagination. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Are we going to follow the red or 
black today – Pagination? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  We can follow the red Chairperson still. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I have asked them not to have pages 
duplicated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Can you see the red – the 
numbers Mr Tsotsi and the black numbers on each page at 
the top left and right? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes when Mr Seleka refers to a page he 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 7 of 236 
 
will be referring to the red numbers so you can disregard 
the black numbers.  He will only – he will not call the zero 
before for example if you go to the beginning of your 
affidavit he will – we will not say page 001 he will just say 
page 1 and on and so on and so on.  Okay? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Welcome back you are coming to the 
commission for the second time. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay thank you. 
MR TSOTSI:  Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi are 
you on page 1? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I am. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Aspects of your affidavit – certain 
aspects will be – will be admitted and I wish to focus my 
questions on some of the aspects arising from your 
affidavit.  So paragraph 2 of your affidavit deals with your 
20 
qualifications and your degrees. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you going to get him to just confirm 
his signature and confirm that it is his affidavit and letters? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ask me to admit it and then mark it 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 8 of 236 
 
Exhibit whatever. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Let me do exactly that Chairperson.  Mr 
Tsotsi the affidavit starts on paginated page 1 and it runs 
up to paginated page 28 and please concentrate on the red 
numbers at the top of – right hand top of the page.   
MR TSOTSI:  That is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes you see the last page there? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You confirm that this is – this is your 
signature in the middle of the page? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And that the affidavit is dated 13 
February 2020? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And you confirm that this is the affidavit 
you have submitted to the commission? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I do. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Mr Tsotsi.  So we go back to 
that page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You ask me to admit it?  Mr Seleka. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Indeed Chairperson.  I beg your 
pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You ask me to admit and have it marked 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 9 of 236 
 
exhibit what?  Eskom U7 – U17? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  U17 or now we have the file which is 
Point 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you can change that file maybe to  
ADV SELEKA SC:  17. 
CHAIRPERSON:  17A. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  A.  Indeed Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and then we can have – so let us say 
the smaller file which is a continuation of Eskom Bundle 
017 or was it 7.  The smaller file will be Bundle Eskom – 
10 
Eskom Bundle 07.8. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Point 8.  Alternatively – alternatively 
Chairperson we can mark the bigger one A and this one – 
the smaller one B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is another way.  Okay.  So the 
bigger bundle will be Eskom Bundle 07.A and the smaller 
one will be Eskom Bundle 07.B. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Tsotsi’s affidavit appearing at 
page 6 – starting at page 6 of Eskom Bundle 07.A will be – 
20 
is admitted and will be marked as Exhibit U17.  Do you see 
– do you want us to say U17 or U17.1 on his affidavit or 
Point 1 will be the following ones? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  U17.1 Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   It will be marked as Exhibit U17.1 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 10 of 236 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  17.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I think they might have made an error 
in the – in the smaller bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  As opposed to 07 it should have been 
17.  Is that correct?  Yes I gather that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the – now 0 something is for the 
name of the bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Oh I see. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I got you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So – Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Okay so that labelling is correct.  Thank 
you Chairperson.  So the affidavit of Mr Tsotsi dated 13 
February 2020 has been admitted as Exhibit U17.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Somebody should make the necessary 
markings on Mr Tsotsi’s bundles so that he has something 
that is similar to what we have. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Tsotsi 
may we proceed?  So in paragraph – if you go back to page 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 11 of 236 
 
1 Mr Tsotsi of the affidavit.   
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So paragraph you set out your details 
with the ID number.  Paragraph 2 you set out your 
qualifications and where you obtained them.  Paragraph 3 
you deal with your career.  You turn the page.  And 3.3 
likewise you deal with your service on various board as 
Chairperson.  I will read that: 
“I started serving on the Board of my own 
company as Executive Chairman in 1983.  
10 
During 
my 
stint 
with 
the 
Lesotho 
government I was appointed Chairman of 
Lesotho Electricity Corporation Water and 
Sewerage Authority and Lesotho Highlands 
Development 
Authority. 
 
In 
2004 
the 
Lesotho government set up the electricity 
regulator 
called 
Lesotho 
Electricity 
Authority and I was invited to become its 
first chairman.  On completion of this role I 
was 
appointed 
Chairman 
of 
the 
Eskom 
20 
Holdings in 2011.” 
 
Is that the Eskom in Lesotho or in South Africa Mr 
Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:  Eskom South Africa. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Eskom South Africa.  And then you 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 12 of 236 
 
carry on to say: 
“All the chairmanship appointments in the 
state-owned entities were non-executive.” 
 
Now 
in 
2011 
was 
that 
your 
first 
time 
being 
appointed on the – on the – as a Chairman of the Board of 
Eskom? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And how long did you stay in that 
position as a Chairman of the Board of Eskom? 
MR TSOTSI:  I was appointed around August 2011 until the 
10 
Board’s term completed on the 8 t h I think of December 
2014 when the new board was appointed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  December 2014? 
MR TSOTSI:    That is right. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  When the new board was appointed? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you get to be reappointed on the 
new board? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I did.  I was reappointed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  In what capacity this time? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  Once again as Chairman. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  As Chairman of the Board? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Non-executive? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Seleka. Can I go back to 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 13 of 236 
 
when you were … 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Appointed for your first term.  I see that 
you say in your affidavit that you were approached by Mr 
Siyabonga Mahlangu who was then the advisor to the 
Minister.  That is Minister Gigaba, is that right? 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 And 
he 
enquired 
if 
you 
would 
be 
interested in serving on the Board of Eskom.  You 
responded in the affirmative and ultimately you were 
10 
appointed, you provided your CV? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the second term Mr Seleka will deal 
with it but I see that for the second term you applied 
[00:16:15] saw an advert.  The first time you did not apply 
you were approached? 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you ever try to find out how it came 
20 
about that they showed interest in you out of the blue? 
MR TSOTSI:  No I did not specifically find out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Find out. 
MR TSOTSI:  From them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 14 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:  But I had an understanding of where probably 
they – their mind was living at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well it just occurred to me that 
later on you know that you were told by somebody that 
they put you in this position they could take you out. So I 
wondered whether that is connected with how you were 
approached.  Is that something you have reflected on and 
you think along the same lines or not? 
MR TSOTSI:  No Chair I do not connect my… 
CHAIRPERSON:  First appointment. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  First appointment with that statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes oh. 
MR TSOTSI:  You must remember that statement has other 
connotations but not in reference to my first appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes okay no that is fine.   
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Yes Mr Tsotsi 
you were dealing with the – your second appointment as 
the Chairman of the Board and I wanted to know from you 
20 
whether in that capacity were you an executive or a non-
executive Chairperson? 
MR TSOTSI:  I was non-executive. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now the Chairperson has asked you the 
other questions relating to how you became appointed.  As 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 15 of 236 
 
you say in your statement that you applied the second time 
around following a publication of an advert that the 
application be followed by interviews. 
MR TSOTSI:  In my case no I was not interviewed.  The – I 
suppose the Minister just took the decision that she did not 
need to interview me – I do not know.  But I was not asked 
to be interviewed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Could you tell the Chairperson when 
you say in your case are you aware that in other – in the 
case of other Board Members whether or not they were 
10 
interviewed? 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair no I do not.  I have not asked any of 
the Board Members if they were ever interviewed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now that is in December 2024 you say.  
We learnt yesterday from the witness of Mr Matona and you 
at present here as well, you confirm that – that you were 
present here as well yesterday? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I was present here yesterday.  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That the Board went through an 
induction, recall that? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well we did not – we did not get an 
indication of whether or not you attended that induction so 
I would like you to tell the Chairperson whether did you or 
did you not attend the induction? 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 16 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair I did attend the induction.  I was 
present. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And can you recall when in terms of 
date and month did the induction take place? 
MR TSOTSI:  The formal induction – there was an informal 
meeting of the new Board Members with the Minister in her 
office in – sometime in December.  Shortly after the Board 
Members were appointed whereupon the Minister indicated 
that she would like there to be an induction of the new 
board and that this would be taking place sometime in 
10 
January.  Because we were at the end of very much of the 
year and so there was very little going on and people were 
going on leave and holiday and so on.  So the induction 
was then arranged for January.  If I recall I think it was 
somewhere around the – if not the 16 t h January. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is January 2015? 
MR TSOTSI:  2015 yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So you attended the induction you 
20 
say? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So that is January 2015 does the Board 
then have a timetable for its meetings for the year of 
2015? 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 17 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes what normally happens Chair is that at 
the end of the previous year I normally sit down with the 
Company Secretary and work out dates for Board Meetings 
for the following year and this is done in consultation with 
the Board Members to make sure that they will be available 
for those days and once that is completed then this is 
published in the company roster.  So the dates are fixed at 
the end of the previous year for the following year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So in that case what was the first date 
10 
on which the Board would have its first meeting in 2015? 
MR TSOTSI:  The first Board Meeting in 2015 was 
scheduled for the 26 February 2015. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Could you tell the Chairperson whether 
that meeting took place? 
MR TSOTSI:  The meeting did not take place. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And what – what were the reasons why 
the meeting did not take place? 
MR TSOTSI:  What happened is that on the evening of the 
eve of the meeting 25 t h. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That will be 25 February? 
MR TSOTSI:  That is right.    At about eight, eight thirty in 
the evening I received a phone call from the then President 
of the country President Jacob Zuma and the President 
asked if I had – well first of all he stated that he had been 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 18 of 236 
 
trying to get in touch with the Minister – my Minister at the 
time 
being 
Minister 
Lynne 
Brown 
and 
he 
was 
not 
successful and he tried to find the Deputy Minister and he 
did not find the Deputy Minister either.  And ultimately, he 
found the acting DG at the time was Matsietsi Mokholo.  
And he then said to me that he has asked that the meeting 
tomorrow not take place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the 26 t h? 
MR TSOTSI:  On the 26 t h yes.  Then he said I will be 
contacted by the acting DG in regard to that.  But he is just 
10 
giving me like a – a forewarning if you like that the meeting 
is not going to take place.  So I simply thanked him for the 
call and waited for the phone call from the acting DG who 
then did call.  So I was told by the acting DG that the 
Minister had asked that the meeting be postponed.  And 
that is how the meeting got postponed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So were you given the reasons for the 
postponement or for that request to postpone? 
MR TSOTSI:  I did ask the acting DG what the reasons 
were for the postponement of the meeting because I would 
20 
need to give those reasons to the Board Members and she 
then responded to say that the Minister did not give her 
any reasons for the postponement of the meeting.  So she 
did not have any reasons for it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did you ask the former President Jacob 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 19 of 236 
 
Zuma for the reasons why he asked – he wanted the 
meeting to be postponed? 
MR TSOTSI:  No Chair I did not ask him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why not? 
MR TSOTSI:  The reason I did not ask the former President 
was because as Chairman of Eskom I really do not have 
any formal business with the President.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MR 
TSOTSI: 
 
I 
do 
not 
have 
any 
formal 
business 
relationship with the President. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But was that not all the more reason why 
you should have asked him? 
MR TSOTSI:  Well the way I saw it Chair was that my 
fiduciary responsibility rested with the Minister and I – I 
felt that I needed to ask the Minister if she does not give 
me any reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the Minister was not available and he 
did not phone you – or she did not phone you.  The 
President called you.  Was that not on its own strange that 
you have a plan for a Board Meeting?  The President is not 
20 
part of the Board.  The Board is coming – is going to have 
a meeting to discuss – to discuss its own business.  Why 
should you get a call from the President saying the 
meeting of the Board should not take place?  This is not a 
meeting of the Cabinet.  This is a meeting of the Board. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 20 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:  I would agree with you entirely Chair.  I did 
not understand the reason why I got a message from the 
President to this effect and my position I felt that I needed 
to raise that issue with the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but sitting there today do you see – 
do you concede that you should have asked the President, 
Mr President this is a meeting of the Board that has been 
planned why must it be postponed?  
MR TSOTSI:  I do concede Chair that I could have asked 
him. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Why the meeting – why he wanted the 
meeting postponed but I – I clearly would still have felt 
that in terms of my communication to the Board I would 
have had to have consulted with the Minister so that she 
can then show me exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course, even if the Minister call – 
were to have called you after the President had called after 
you had spoken to the President it would have – you would 
have known that the real person who wants the meeting 
20 
postponed was the President not the Minister.  Because 
from what you have told me the President had – was the 
one who was looking for the Minister in order to convey the 
message 
that 
the 
meeting 
of 
the 
Board 
should 
be 
postponed.  So the person who knew the reasons would be 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 21 of 236 
 
the President.  That is the person you should have asked. 
MR TSOTSI:  From my perspective Chair at the time I was 
dealing with the issue.  I wanted to be certain that I follow 
what I understood to be my fiduciary responsibility. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MR TSOTSI:  I wanted to follow what I understood to be my 
fiduciary responsibility. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  With the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but here is somebody who is not part 
10 
of your Board.  You are the Chairperson and you do not 
deal with this person.  You deal with the Minister.  He is 
calling you.  He is not scheduled to be part of this meeting.  
So it does not have to suit his calendar or his availability.  
He is calling you and saying the board meeting must not take 
place.  But it is not his business.  It is the board’s business 
that will be discussed.  So was it not strange in itself? 
MR TSOTSI:   It was strange, Chairman.  Let me put it to you 
in another way.  If, for instance, I had not communication 
with the DG who purportedly spoke on behalf of the minister, 
20 
I would have authorised – I would not have postponed the 
meeting.  Let me put it that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would not have? 
MR TSOTSI:   Postpone the meeting 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you did not get a call from the acting 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 22 of 236 
 
DG? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   Because my view would be that the president 
does not have any jurisdiction in terms of that determination. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   So my asking me, for me was neither here nor 
there, if only to learn perhaps what reasons he had.  But 
because I felt that he had no jurisdiction in my responsibility, 
if I had not heard from, as I say the DG, I would not have 
10 
cancelled the meeting.   
CHAIRPERSON:   The acting DG phoned you. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And did she say the minister wanted you 
to postpone the meeting or did she say the president wanted 
you to postpone the meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, she said the minister asked that the 
meeting should be postponed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And you asked her for the reasons? 
MR TSOTSI:   For the reasons, for it, yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And she did not give you any? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, she did not give me any reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Saying to me that she was not given any 
reasons why the minister has stopped this. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 23 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Did you not consider necessarily to 
say:  Well, I will phone the minister and find out what the 
reasons are because I cannot just postpone the meeting of 
the board without reasons. 
MR TSOTSI:   I did ask her if I can get in touch with the 
minister.  The whereabouts... the minister’s whereabouts.  
She said she did not know.  She tried the minister herself 
and she could not find her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  Was the minister scheduled to 
depart of this meeting of the 26t h of February? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I take it, she would not normally attend 
meetings of the board because she is not a member of the 
board? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, she was not part of the... she would not 
attend meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So she would attend by implication? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And on this occasion, the board had 
not invited her to be part of that meeting? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   No, she was not invited. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So she actually did not have the power, 
did she, to instruct you to postpone your meeting of the 
meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:   [No audible reply]  
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 24 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is your understanding?  Did you 
understand that she had the power? 
MR TSOTSI:   My understanding is that Chair, the MOI of 
Eskom 
does 
authorise 
the 
minister 
to 
request 
board 
meetings to be either postponed or changed or cancelled. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But how she could she have the power to 
postpone a meeting of a board that she is not going to be 
attending?  And if she is going to be attending, could she 
have anything other than a right to request, not a right to 
instruct the chairperson for a postponement. 
10 
 
If she is meant to attend and it is an important issue that 
she must discuss with the board but she has other 
commitments, then she makes a request for a postponement.  
But ultimately, the power to say yes or no, would lie with the 
chairperson of the board. 
MR TSOTSI:   Well, Chair I am not certain in terms of 
whether she can only request a postponement on the basis 
that she was going to attend the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  But she is certainly not part of the 
board, is that right? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  So simple on the principle that 
she is not part of the board, I do not think she can power to 
instruct that the board should not sit because the board, as I 
understand it, is a body on its own. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 25 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I do not have the capacity Chairman to 
make that analyses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  I understand.  You know, you 
might be able to say:  Look, I have never reflected on this.  I 
am not sure.  I am just giving you the benefit of what is 
going on in my mind.   
 
And you may or may not be able to comment on it.  I 
may be right.  I may be wrong.  But I am just thinking, if you 
are a body... 
 
Unless there is some specific legal provision that allows 
10 
somebody, who is not part of the body to dictate what you 
can discuss to just stand in your own meetings to dictate 
when you can have meetings or when you cannot have 
meetings. 
 
Unless you have that situation, normally it would be that 
body who decides when do we sit.  When do we not sit.  
What business do we discuss.  When do we discuss that 
business.  That the body that plans its own problems, you 
know. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   And somebody outside might be able to 
say at some stage I request that you discuss this issue.  And 
then the body can decide this is when it is going to be 
necessary for us to discuss that issue.  We will discuss that 
on that day.  But the idea that somebody from outside can 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 26 of 236 
 
instruct, just seems odd to me.   
MR TSOTSI:   I understand the point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You understand? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes.  No, thank you.  Mr Seleka, you 
may proceed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi, 
please let us go a little bit into that.  If you turn to page 10 
of your affidavits. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  For the sake of completeness, 
10 
let me make this point Mr Tsotsi.  The only reason I can think 
why somebody who is not a member of the board would have 
wanted the board to postpone its meeting when he or she is 
not part of the board and was not going to attend that 
meeting, is that she or she might not be wanting the board to 
discuss certain matters on that day.   
 
It is not convenient for whatever reasons for him or her 
to have the board take decisions on certain issues on that 
day.  That is the only thing I can think of.   
 
Otherwise, if the board is going to discuss matters in 
20 
which that person has no interest, why would they be 
wanting the board to postpone its meeting because they 
have no interest in the issues that would be discussed?   
 
But if they have certain interest in some of the issues, 
then I can understand.  But it does not make it proper 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 27 of 236 
 
necessarily but I can understand that.   
 
Or they do not want the board to make a decision at this 
stage on this issue and that issue.  That is why they want the 
board to postponed.   
 
Or if there is something that they are working on for the 
board from outside - again, you might not be able to 
comment.   
 
I am just giving you the benefit of what is going on in my 
mind as I hear this evidence about people outside of the 
board asking or instructing.   
10 
 
Because it looks like they were not asking that the 
meeting be postponed of the board and not caring to even 
give reasons.   
 
So it looks like they did not think the board would say:  
Well, we cannot just postpone.  We want reasons.  We need 
to verify that they are valid reasons for a postponement.   
 
It looks like they expected the board to just fall in line.  
They say:  Please, postpone.  The board would just postpone 
it without questioning.   
 
Because if otherwise they expected that the board would 
20 
want to know reasons, they would have had given the 
reasons to the... well, the president would have told you the 
reasons when he spoke to you.   
 
Or the minister would have given the acting DG reasons 
to tell:  Tell the chairperson that these are the reasons.  But 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 28 of 236 
 
they... it looks like they did not bother.  They did not think 
the board would insist on the reasons.  Rightly or wrongly.   
MR TSOTSI:   Ja.  I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi, 
page 10 of your affidavit.  If may consider this a little further.  
Because there you write in paragraph 11.4 of page 10... Are 
you there, Mr Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I am there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You say: 
10 
“Board meetings have different categories.  There 
are 
the 
ordinary 
board 
meetings 
which 
are 
scheduled throughout the year.” 
 
To this meeting of the 26t h of February had been one 
such meeting.   
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, it was. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    
“The draft schedule for these meetings is circulated 
to 
board 
members 
towards 
the 
end 
of 
the 
proceedings here for their comment.   
20 
Once dates are confirmed up, the final schedule is 
signed off by the chairman and published in the 
formal meeting roster of the company.   
None of these meetings may be cancelled because 
each one is designed to deal with specific aspects 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 29 of 236 
 
of the business which have to addressed at specific 
times.  
Examples would be shareholder contact, corporate 
plan, 
integrated 
report, 
auditing 
of 
financial 
statements, planning of general meeting, MRPD 
tariff application, et cetera.   
These meetings can, however, be postponed on the 
understanding that they will be rescheduled.   
This 
postponement 
can 
either 
be 
canvassed 
amongst board members for good reason or maybe 
10 
affected 
by 
the 
chairman 
under 
plausible 
circumstances or may be requested by the minister.” 
 
Now I see that you use the word postponement in this 
paragraph.  Do you see that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And this is not the same concept you 
used when you referred to your telephone call made by the 
former president to you.  You said the request was for you to 
cancel the meeting. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, essentially, what I was trying to convey 
20 
there was that the meeting should not take place but 
obviously I knew at the time that the only thing that will 
happen is a postponement because this one of the ordinary 
board meetings which has a specific purpose at that time of 
year and has to take place.  So needed that this meeting 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 30 of 236 
 
needed to be rescheduled.   
CHAIRPERSON:   In your first term at the Board of Eskom, 
had Minister Gigaba ever requested or instructed that a 
board meeting be postponed or cancelled? 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He had never done that? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Had the former President, Mr Zuma, called 
you or reaching to you to ask or to instruct that a board 
meeting be postponed or cancelled during your first term? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   No, sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It did not happen? 
MR TSOTSI:   Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So this was a new thing...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...when you got this call from the former 
president and when you got a call from the acting DG, saying 
the minister effectively wanted the meeting postponed or 
cancelled? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Yes, Mr Tsotsi, 
so you were explaining that you, by your own understanding, 
when this request is made to you, you need that the meeting 
would have to be postponed? 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 31 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But the request to you is that the 
meeting should not take place? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you recall what was to be discussed at 
this meeting of the 26t h of February or at least some of the 
matters? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, Chair.  At that time of the year, we would 
have just dealt with the mid-term results of the company and 
...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The what? 
MR TSOTSI:   At the mid-term financial results. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And the auditors would be preparing the 
financial statements for the company ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Because the financial was about to end at the 
end, in fact, the end of the following month of March.  So the 
board would have to discuss the financial result and it would 
be presented by the auditors. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja.  That is one of the key aspects.  The other 
thing was.  What Mr Matona had discussed yesterday.  There 
was a process which we started to engage the management 
to look at the strategic outlook for Eskom for the next 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 32 of 236 
 
several years.  And that occurred between the time of the 
resignation of the previous chief executive and the incoming, 
namely, Mr Matona.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   So he then arrived with some groundwork 
which have not been done and he then went on to work 
further on that exercise and he was going to present that to 
the board.  So that was to happen.  So some of the more 
important issues.   
 
There could have been also a discussion planned for the 
10 
tariff application.  I am not sure whether that year was the 
year for tariff application but there could have been.   
 
If indeed it was, that issue would have had to been 
talked about around that time as a continuation of what was 
determined in the previous year. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Out of the issues that were going to be 
discussed at that meeting, are there any issues that you 
though the president and the minister may have a particular 
interest in? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, to be quite frank.  No, I do not think so. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As far as you are concerned, the board 
could have met and discussed those issues and made 
whatever decisions they wanted to make? 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 33 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  That you could not see no reason why 
the minister or the president would not want the board to 
have its own meeting and discuss those issues? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, to the extent that I felt the idea for 
postponing the meeting was rather strange and rather 
sinister.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Yes, Mr Tsotsi, 
you say when was the financial year-end for Eskom? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   The financial year-end would be the 
31s t of March. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   31 March? 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And would you, in your explanation to 
the Chairperson, said one important – one of the important 
issues to 
be 
discussed there in the 
meeting 
of the 
26t h of February, were the financials? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And indeed, your FD at the time agrees 
20 
with you in that regard.  If you turn to page 117 of the bundle 
before you.  So the FD that is Ms Tsholofele Molefe to her, 
submitted an affidavit to the Commission.  Chairperson, that 
affidavit ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   When you say FD, do you mean Financial 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 34 of 236 
 
Director? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The Financial Director. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  If someone reads out the transcript, 
they might not know what you are talking about. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Having met with so many Eskom officials 
using the initials, you become accustom to their language, 
10 
Chair. [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The affidavit, Mr Tsotsi starts on page 
109.  Chairperson, we will have to mark it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the affidavit of Ms Tsholofele 
Molefe, is that right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say we must go to page 117? 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 117 of that affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Tsotsi, are you there? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now paragraphs 21 and 22.  And I will 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 35 of 236 
 
read 21 just to give context to what she says in paragraph 
22. 
“The G Forensic report highlighted that there was 
wrongdoing on the part of Mr Matjila, in that he did 
not have the delegation of authority to commit the 
company for a contract of this size without following 
the company’s governance process. 
The board then started to seek legal advice on the 
actions to take action against Mr Matjila who by then 
has stepped down as interim CEO. 
10 
And the new CEO Mr Tshediso Matona had taken 
office effective from 1 October 2014. 
As a result of this transgression of the interim CEO 
at the time, the auditors indicated that they would 
qualify their review opinion for the interim financial 
statements with an emphasis of matter paragraph 
regarding a report of an irregularity, I an executive 
authority.” 
 
Then paragraph 22: 
“What 
was 
important 
about 
these 
financial 
20 
statements was that we were preparing to go on a 
deal road show to raise an international point. 
Therefore, it was very important that the board 
approved the financial statements. 
However, what happened on the day that the board 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 36 of 236 
 
was meant to sign the financial statements which 
was a few days before the results announcement, Mr 
Tsotsi called me to say that he is going to cancel the 
meeting as he was receiving pressure from outside 
to cancel the meeting.” 
 
Let me pause there.  Do you have any recollection of 
what I have just read there in paragraph 22, Mr Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I do recall that there was an attempt for a 
road show which was typical around that time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   And I know that the FD was very keen to make 
sure that we make progress on the situation regarding the 
statements and I did speak to her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Please raise your voice a little bit Mr 
Tsotsi. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  I was saying Chair that I did speak to 
the FD.  And I think, if I remember well, I was trying to 
ensure that we will find time to go back and have the 
statements presented to the board for the board’s approval 
but because of this intend to cancel this meeting, this was 
20 
not going to happen on the 26t h.  
 
And she says here that that I was receiving pressure 
from outside.  I probably said to this specifically what had 
actually happened.  And she is maybe not putting it the way I 
put it to her.   
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 37 of 236 
 
 
I think she was being, I guess, modest in putting it this 
way.  And I understand that.  But at the end of the day, what 
happened was that the company secretary sent out a 
notification to all the board members indicating, you know, 
the formality.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  Just before that.  Would you not tell 
the Chairperson what words you used? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, I do not mean to be disparaging in any 
way but I did tell to Molefe that I felt that the president 
sounded like he was pressuring the board to take this 
10 
decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say, you told her that the president 
sounded like he was under pressure? 
MR TSOTSI:   He was pressurising ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Pressurising you? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
MR TSOTSI:   In other words – yes, in a kind of a bleak way. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is the conversation that I had with her. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is where the pressure came from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   But I am sure I told her that I finally got, you 
know, the contact from the Deputy DG, saying that the 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 38 of 236 
 
minister had asked that the minute meeting would be 
postponed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is from the acting DG? 
MR TSOTSI:   From the acting DG, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So when the acting DG spoke to you 
and told you that the minister had not given reasons for the 
request, if it was a request, for the meeting to be postponed.  
Did you say to her whether you would have the meeting 
postponed or you would talk to the members of the board?  It 
would depend what their attitude is.  Or what did you say to 
10 
her? 
MR TSOTSI:   Well, I told her Chair that in view of my 
understanding of the authority that the minister had, as I 
said previously, then we would go ahead and postpone the 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, yes.  Okay.  H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  I did not get 
that last part of your answer to the Chairperson.  The 
minister has what?   
MR TSOTSI:   I said in view of the – my understanding of the 
20 
authority that was rested with the minister ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes? 
MR TSOTSI:   ...to be able to ask that the meeting be 
postponed or cancelled, I exceeded to that request by her. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And you did mention earlier but let 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 39 of 236 
 
me ask you this.  Where would that authority come from?  
Will we find it in a document such authority of the minister? 
MR TSOTSI:   I think it is in the MOI of the company.  I think 
so.  I stand to be corrected. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  We... as ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry, you think it is in? 
MR TSOTSI:   The Memorandum of Incorporation of the 
company. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that the minister can request that 
meetings be postponed? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I think that is where it is stated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Could you recall whether it is 
put as a request that she has power to request or whether 
she can effectively instruct the meeting be postponed?  Or is 
it something you might not recall? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I do not recall precisely but my 
inclination it to say, it probably speak of a request. 
MR TSOTSI:   H’m.  H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  It would be interesting to know what 
the provision is.  Maybe a junior could look for that in the 
20 
meantime.  Or if you have got it, you can take it from there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, indeed Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi, the 
Commission 
has 
been 
provided 
with 
a 
copy 
of 
the 
Memorandum of Incorporation of Eskom.  It is in the smaller 
bundle. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 40 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Remember to raise your voice Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is in the smaller bundle.  Thank you, 
Chair.  Page 953.  You have it? 
MR TSOTSI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   You found it Mr Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, let us look at this document.  It is 
the Eskom Memorandum of Incorporation.  Authorisation 
date.  Can you see that block at the top of the page? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   9/20/14.  Do you see that?  On page 
953. 
CHAIRPERSON:   953? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   953, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Oh, I have gone much beyond that, 
Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I say I have gone much beyond that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I am right in the document inside 
20 
looking 
for 
anything 
about 
calling 
of 
meetings 
and 
postponements, so I have long found it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   You have not found it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I have long found it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, you have long found it? 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 41 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so I am busy trying to see were we… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We will do exactly that, Chairperson.  
Mr Tsotsi, you are – I wanted you to look at the document, 
look at the index, the table of contents just to refresh your 
memory that you are familiar with this document. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And let us see the part dealing with 
meetings of directors and you could assist us in that 
10 
regard, but I will go to the relevant paragraph for present 
purposes.  If you turn to page 972. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If you could please.  So we see there 
paragraph 12 deals with shareholders’ meetings.  Would 
you know offhand which paragraph will with the directors’ 
meetings? 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, directors is 13 at page 980. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Or turn to page 980.  Thank you, 
20 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  I am already at 982, Chairperson of 
the board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you see paragraph 13 deals with 
directors. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 42 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
And 
then 
page 
985 
deals 
with 
proceedings at meetings. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you see that, Mr Tsotsi?      
MR TSOTSI:   985? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I was trying to look for a provision that 
talks about the calling of meetings and postponements but 
they might not be specific provisions for postponements 
that would be incidental to the calling of a meeting.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Go to page 985? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   See whether you cannot find anything 
there under paragraph 13.9 dealing with proceedings at 
meetings of directors.  Well, let me say this to you, Mr 
Tsotsi, I have gone through this and maybe you can correct 
me.  I have gone through this and I could not find a 
provision that empowers the Minister to call for the 
cancellation of a meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I can say that clause 18.9.1 at 
page 985 seems to give the power to adjourn meetings to 
the directors.  It reads: 
20 
“The 
directors 
may 
meet 
for 
the 
dispatch 
of 
business, adjourn and otherwise regulate their 
meetings as they think fit.” 
That seems conclusive, that seems it includes adjourning.  
Now of course if you adjourn a meeting to another date it 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 43 of 236 
 
means you would discuss the business that you otherwise 
were going to discuss the business that you otherwise were 
going to discuss today to that fact, you will discuss it on 
that date.  Now if you like you can say we are cancelling 
today’s meeting but we will fix another date to meet and 
discuss the same business.  So whether you use adjourn or 
cancel, if the cancellation is not on the basis that the 
business that was going to be discussed will never be 
discussed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is not on that basis but on the basis 
that the meeting will discuss the same business on another 
date, you know, then it means the same as adjourn, you 
know?  So but here in clause 13.9.1, the memorandum of 
incorporation is clear that it gives the directors the power 
to meet or the right to meet and dispatch business of their 
business, adjourn and otherwise regulate their meetings.  
Regulate their meetings would certainly include a cancel, 
adjourn or whatever. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   So unless you are able to point to 
something else, it seems to me that the power – that the 
Minister had no power to instruct that a meeting of the 
board be cancelled or postponed, nor did the President 
have that power. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 44 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, it is evident that it is not explicitly 
stated here in the MOI, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you are not in a position to say you 
definitely had seen a provision that gave the Minister that 
power but you thought there was a provision along those 
lines but you might now be realising that no, it is not there. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I have always understood that there 
was such a provision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Whether it is in the Eskom internal 
10 
documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   That could be the case. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think …[intervenes] 
MR TSOTSI:   I have always understood that that was the 
prerogative the Minister had. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think what you should do in due course 
is check any other instruments that you think might have 
20 
something. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But I would have thought that the 
Memorandum 
of 
Incorporation 
would 
be 
the 
right 
instrument to have such a provision. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 45 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi 
may I also refer you to page 983, paragraph 13.7 of the 
same Memorandum of Incorporation.  Are you there? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   With the heading Powers of Directors 
and it reads, 13.7.1: 
“The management and control of the company shall 
be vested in the board which in addition to the 
powers and authorities expressly conferred upon it 
10 
by this MOI and the enabling legislation may 
exercise all such powers…” 
And I emphasise all such powers. 
“…and do all such acts and things as may be 
exercised or done by the company and are not, in 
terms of this MOI or by the enabling legislation, 
expressly directed or required to be exercised or 
done by the company in general meeting or with the 
prior written consent of the shareholder.”  
So that last part: 
20 
“…and are not, in terms of this MOI or legislation, 
expressly directed or required to be exercised or 
done by the company in general meeting or with the 
prior written consent of the shareholder.”  
It seems to me that if the shareholder interferes in your 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 46 of 236 
 
functions, for lack of a better word, or encroaches in your 
functions, it would have to be done in writing. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, sir. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Do you see that? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is what it says, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Otherwise all the powers in terms of 
this provision to manage and control Eskom vested solely 
in the board.  Do you see that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that seems to suggest to me that 
10 
the board would need to jealously guard against the 
usurpation of any of its control or powers by anybody.  It 
has got to realise that we are in control of this entity, we 
have to make decisions that have to be made provided we 
act lawfully and exercising our best judgment for what is in 
the interest of the company.  We should be left alone to run 
the company, the affairs of the company. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would feel – you would have the 
same sentiments of what it means for the board to be in 
20 
control. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    Thank you, Chairperson.  Well, on this 
occasion of the request you did not say anything in your 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 47 of 236 
 
affidavit about a request having been done in writing to you 
prior written notice to you by the Minister. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   There was not such. 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now this meeting that gets to be 
cancelled on the eve of the board having to deal with some 
of the important issues, as you say, one of them are your 
financials because you are nearing the financial year end, 
how do you - and the financial director is also, in your 
10 
case, about wanting the financials to be approved, how do 
you deal with that, as a Chairman of the board? 
MR TSOTSI:   Well, the right thing would be to find the 
earliest opportunity to do just that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To find what? 
MR TSOTSI:   To find the earliest opportunity, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes – ja, look this side, I cannot hear 
you.  Ja.  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   I am saying that the thing to do then in that 
situation is to find the next earliest opportunity to do what 
20 
was meant to have been done at that particular meeting 
that got cancelled bearing I mind the requirements, the 
timing, you know, of particular decisions.. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If possible, Mr Seleka, I would like us 
to wrap up on this meeting of the 26 t h and move on to other 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 48 of 236 
 
matters. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  But, Mr Tsotsi, it appears to me that 
your evidence is in effect that you agreed to postpone the 
meeting without knowing what the reasons were, is that 
right? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Why did you agree to postpone the 
meeting when you were not given reasons why it should be 
postponed? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, like I have indicated, it was my 
understanding at the time that the Minister did have that 
authority and that the Minister provide the reasons at some 
date, at some later date. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   So the board can have an understanding of 
what was happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Did you the approach other 
members of the board and relay to them – now I must just 
understand, did you understand this to be a request from 
20 
the Minister or did you understand it as an instruction? 
MR TSOTSI:   I understood to be a request from the 
Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Request.  Ja, okay, alright. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 49 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which the board could say yes or no to, 
I take it, if it was a request. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, the board could have said yes or no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. And so you approached members of 
the board and said I have received a call from the Acting 
DG who says the Minister requested we postpone this 
meeting, I have asked the reasons, the Acting DG said the 
Minister did not provide reasons but I suggest that we 
postpone the meeting.  Is that the sum total what you said 
to the members of the board? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Not to the same degree of detail, yes, but in 
essence that is what I said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  And what was their 
response? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, I …(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or the response of the majority. 
MR TSOTSI:   The majority response was yes, accept that 
the meeting should be postponed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Were there dissenting voices?  
Were there those who were not in favour or you cannot 
20 
remember? 
MR TSOTSI:   I would be hard-pressed to remember if 
there were dissenting voices. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot remember. 
MR TSOTSI:   They would probably have responded back 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 50 of 236 
 
to the company secretary. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  But the message you got 
ultimately was that the majority were agreeable? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  What I did get, Chair, was at the next 
time the board sat, there were some board members who 
expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that that meeting 
was postponed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Postponed at the last minute. 
MR TSOTSI:   Being given, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Yes, continue, Mr Seleka? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi, let 
me, just to wind up on this aspect, I will read to you further 
about Ms Molefe writes in her affidavit, turn the page 
please to page 118, paragraph 23, which reads: 
“Events leading to my suspension.” 
She says: 
I was suspended on the 11 March 2015 alongside 
three other executives.  Before we were suspended 
the newly appointed board had held two meetings.  
The first meeting was on the 9 March, the board 
20 
that had been deliberating on matters that I have 
stated above were replaced.” 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am sorry, Mr Seleka.  
Terribly sorry to interrupt you, maybe I did miss this, if you 
dealt with it.  Mr Tsotsi, Ms Molefe, if she is talking about 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 51 of 236 
 
the meeting of the 26 t h here – and you must tell me, maybe 
she is talking about another meeting.  
She seems to be talking about her being opposed to 
the postponement of the meeting and canvassing the views 
of other board members, the board members going along 
with her recommendation and the board members seeking 
to approve the financials.  
Is that another meeting, it is not the 26 t h?  Mr 
Seleka, you might be able to tell me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, let me assist.  Mr Tsotsi, that is in 
10 
the preceding paragraph.  The Chairperson is reading the 
preceding paragraph. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I see that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is another meeting, not the 26 t h? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, it is not the 26 t h meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   26 t h, that one, the majority at least 
agreed that it be postponed. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was postponed and then at the next 
20 
meeting some members of the board expressed concern. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About the fact that it was postponed at 
the last minute. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 52 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Going back 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I interrupted you while you were dealing 
with something else. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not a problem, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That paragraph 23. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   “The board that had been deliberating  
10 
on the matters that I have stated above were 
replaced in or around June 2014 with the exception 
of Tsotsi and Mabude.  The board meeting…” 
Well, I suppose June 2014 should be an error there, an 
obvious error. 
MR TSOTSI:   I am not so sure, what is the question? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She is saying: 
“The board that had been deliberating on the 
matters that I have stated above were replaced in 
or around June 2014 with the exception of Tsotsi 
20 
and Mabude.” 
So the previous board is replaced by a new board but she 
says it is in or around June 2014. 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That may be right, she may be talking 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 53 of 236 
 
about the board that – the first board that you chaired. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe talk about that board and it was 
then replaced – she made the meaning it was replaced, 
that first board, in June 2014 – or that must be wrong 
because the next board was appointed in December, is that 
right? 
ADV SELEKA SC:    That is correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So she might have got the month wrong. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that correct, Mr Tsotsi?   I think she 
must have gotten the dates wrong, instead of June it is 
December.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   There was not a gap between the new 
board and the old board. 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was there an intervening period? 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, okay.  Then she carries on: 
20 
“The board meeting of the 26 February which was 
on the annual board calendar had been cancelled.  
The importance of this cancellation meeting was to 
approve the business plan for the next cycle and 
recommend a funding plan and building programme 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 54 of 236 
 
to the shareholder for approval in terms of the 
PFMA.  Notice of a board meeting was sent to all 
board members by the company secretary via text 
message, SMS, on 8 March.” 
Now what I wanted to draw to your attention, and I am not 
reading the balance of that, was what she conveys to have 
been the importance of the meeting of the 26 February.  
Does that resonate with 
what you explained to the 
Chairperson earlier were the important issues to be 
considered in this meeting? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now this is an important meeting.  It 
gets cancelled and you said earlier then you would look for 
the next available date to discuss these important issues.  
Did you in fact do that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, we did. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And what as the next available date? 
MR TSOTSI:   It was the 9 March. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   How as the date of the 9 t h selected? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay, the meeting of the – you know, with 
the 9 March, I stand to be corrected, Chairman, I think it 
was [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The cancelled meeting was supposed to 
have been on the 26 February. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 55 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That one got cancelled. 
MR TSOTSI:   It was the 11 t h, not the 9 t h.  So two 
meetings, one after the other, the one that is in fact 
referring to the issues that Ms Molefe was talking about 
would have been the 11 March not the 9 t h.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So was that date of the 11 t h fixed by 
yourself as Chairperson or fixed that date? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, it was, it was, it was fixed by me 
because it was a request once again to deal with the 
10 
issues that were not dealt with as a result of the 
postponement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the 26 t h. 
MR TSOTSI:   Of the 26 t h, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Was the Minister asked whether it 
would be fine with her if the meeting that was to have sat 
on the 26 February sat on the 11 March? 
MR TSOTSI:   Minister was not consulted, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was not asked? 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  So it was just your decision 
the next meeting will sit on the 11 t h? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi, 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 56 of 236 
 
you mentioned the meeting of the 9 t h whether it was – in a 
statement in relation to a response to my question or not 
but let me ask you about – I mean, ask you a question in 
relation to that.  Was there a meeting on the 9 March 
2015? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, there was. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   How did that meeting come about? 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay.  Chair, that meeting came about as a 
result of my visit to the residence of President Zuma on the 
– I think the 8 t h, 7 t h or the 8 t h. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I guess let us go back.  You tell me 
about that meeting at – or your visit to Mr Zuma’s 
residence so that we can follow the sequence properly. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that fine, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is absolutely – thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, maybe let us go back to his 
affidavit. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that fine?  Let us see.  Well, in 
20 
paragraph – page 3 of your affidavit, paragraph 5, you deal 
with the relationship with the Ministers.  You do say that 
you seem to have had a good relationship with Minister 
Gigaba, is that right? 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct, Chair.  
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 57 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and you had scheduled meetings 
with him, regular meetings. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and then I seem to remember that 
you say somewhere that you struggled to have a same 
arrangement with Minister Brown to have regular meetings, 
to schedule meetings, is that right? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, that is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you tried but you did not succeed to 
have that arrangement with her. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and then you talk about your 
relationship with the Guptas in paragraph 6 of your 
affidavit.  If it is fine with Mr Seleka can you tell me about 
that relationship? 
MR TSOTSI:   With Minister…? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, with the Guptas.  Or does that 
precede the meeting or is after the meeting at Mr Zuma’s 
residence that I want you to tell me about. 
MR TSOTSI:   No, the issues that I raise …[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, if you want to intervene you 
please feel free.  Ja, okay, alright. 
MR TSOTSI:   The issues that I am raising, Chair, in 
relation to my relationship with the Guptas, are varied on 
that I simply point out where I met them, where the 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 58 of 236 
 
interactions took place and so on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   So …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You want to quickly deal with that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I can certainly do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, just do that. 
MR TSOTSI:   My first encounter with the Guptas I seem to 
recall was at the ANC January 8 t h statement which took 
place – or function, which took place in Nelspruit.  I see to 
recall it was 2014.  Maybe I stand to be corrected, I am not 
10 
sure hundred percent that it was 2014, but… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   In any case, at that function I happened to 
be seated – I was requested to sit at a table where the 
ANC’s top six were seated together with two of the Gupta 
Brothers, myself and Chairperson of the SABC because we 
were – we had provided some sponsorship to – or some 
support to the …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   To the meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, to that one, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And that is the first time I got introduced to 
two of the Gupta brothers, two of the older brothers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us just get that clear.  This 
was the ANC January 8 Rally. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 59 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:   It was a dinner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was a dinner? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, a fundraising …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which preceded the January 8 rally. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, already.  So the top six of the 
ANC were sitting at the main table, I guess. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you were invited to go and sit with 
them. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you say there were two Gupta 
brothers who were also sitting at the main table with the 
top six. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you remember which ones those are, 
those two Gupta brothers, or do you not remember? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I do, it was Ajay Gupta and Atul Gupta. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Atul, ja.  Now apart from the top six, 
yourself and the two Gupta brothers, who else was sitting 
20 
at the main table if you are able to remember? 
MR TSOTSI:   It was just us.  There were 10 sets and there 
10 people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the main table consisted of the top 
six of the ANC, then two Gupta brothers and then yourself? 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 60 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:   And the Chairperson of the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the Chairperson of the SABC? 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who was the Chairperson of the SABC 
at the time? 
MR TSOTSI:   It was Ms Tshabalala. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Tshabalala? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But do you know whether the SABC was 
also sponsoring the event or do you not know? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   I think so, Chair, because she spoke briefly, 
she had some brief words during that function. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  Now – okay, so you took your 
seat in the main table and what happened, continue? 
MR TSOTSI:   Well, we were introduced to one another 
because everybody had a name tag so whoever who you 
did not know you introduced yourself to that person.  So 
that represented the first time that I had a face to face 
encounter with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now I want to divert it but maybe you 
can answer this after the tea break. I know that it happens 
regularly, frequently, that state owned entities sponsor 
events of the ANC.  I want to know why it is proper for a 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 61 of 236 
 
state-owned entity to sponsor a political party’s event.   
So 
now 
that 
you 
have 
said 
that 
Eskom 
was 
sponsoring or was one of the sponsors of that dinner, I 
want to know why it is proper that that should happen.  But 
we will take the break.  You can tell me when you come 
back.  Let us take the tea break, it is quarter past, we will 
resume at half past eleven. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
10 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us continue.  Yes, Mr Tsotsi, what is 
the answer? 
MR TSOTSI:   Short sharp and quick.   Chair let me just 
reflect back Chair, you may recall in previous testimonies 
that were given here by myself and others when we talked 
about the TNA matter at this time Eskom had added into 
one of those TNA contracts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   So what happened was this – and this 
20 
normally happens when the – in the course of these TNA 
contracts; Eskom took an opportunity in consultation with 
the TNA people who were running the contract to showcase 
the 49M program and other Eskom issues at this particular 
gathering. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 62 of 236 
 
 
Now you may be aware Chair that at some of these 
gatherings what happens is that the ANC invites business 
people to take up spaces, to take up tables in an organised 
business environment where business people are then able 
to interact with government officials who attends these 
functions including members of the executive where there 
is this networking that goes on.   
          So essentially because the ANC is the governing 
party it is assumed that it is a networking opportunity for 
business people to network with the African National 
10 
Congress Ministers and other senior members of the 
organisation.  So it was from the perspective of the TNA 
contract and the opportunity to expose Eskom as part of 
the program that Eskom had including the M49 program.  
With that management asked me to attend and speak on 
behalf of Eskom at this function and in fact I address the 
function dealing with specific issues that were problematic 
at the time particularly the load shedding issues.   
          So though it would appear as if this contract was 
targeting support for the ANC the idea that we were 
20 
advancing and my understanding of what management was 
wanting to do was to give Eskom the opportunity through 
my presentation at this meeting, at this dinner and to 
profile the company and give the opportunity for us to 
reach our customers through the media that was provided 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 63 of 236 
 
by the SABC.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You say this particular dinner of January 
I guess it must have been January 7, I do not know.   
MR TSOTSI:     Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   2014, you say Eskom got onto the – got 
to participate through you in the dinner because of TNA or 
it got to participate in its own right without TNA the new 
age and you have referred to the breakfast and that in the 
breakfast were connected with the new age.   
MR TSOTSI:     What I understood at the time was that 
10 
Eskom was in fact and I say carrying out the contractual 
relationship between itself and TNA and this particular 
platform was one of this platforms that the TNA contract 
was addressing.  Whether it is a forum where someone 
from Eskom is able to participate and give a profile. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But this was an ANC dinner that is one 
thing sure, is it not?     
MR TSOTSI:     It was an ANC dinner, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, as I understand it other TNA or TNA 
breakfast because that is my understanding and I maybe 
20 
wrong but I never understood that those TNA arrangements 
that Eskom had, SABC had with TNA they were dinners.  I 
understood them to have been breakfast.   
          I maybe wrong but I do not remember hearing about 
dinners I just heard about breakfast.  Now you understood 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 64 of 236 
 
that in terms of the agreement between the new agent 
Eskom this was one of the forums, this was one of the 
functions which you needed to attend as Eskom.   
MR TSOTSI:     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but do you know for sure whether 
that was actually so because as I say I understood all the 
others to have been breakfast I may be wrong as opposed 
to dinners this was a dinner and the other ones if I recall 
correctly it is those about with which I have had evidence 
here have never been ANC functions.  They were basically 
10 
Gupta functions but business functions.      
MR TSOTSI:     Chair this might have been a breakfast 
itself I might be wrong myself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, well I can simply say from my own 
general knowledge I seem to have an understanding that it 
is usual for the ANC to have a dinner the evening before 
the January 8 statement…[intervene]    
MR TSOTSI:     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or January 8 rally.  So if you say it was 
a dinner that seems to resonate with what I have been 
20 
observing in the media over the years about the ANC.     
MR TSOTSI:     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it is likely to have been a dinner.   
MR TSOTSI:     Okay that is fine.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 65 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:     So Chair I think if you view it from the 
perspective of how the TNA breakfast themselves were 
being conducted it would seem to me that this was a 
similar format because the people who were predominantly 
present in this particular function were not necessarily 
ANC members.  In fact, there were a lot of business people 
who…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well it would be ANC members and 
supporters mainly, yes.    
MR TSOTSI:     So the idea then was this was another 
10 
forum where the TNA and – or the 49M contract then had 
an opportunity to express itself in the same way that it was 
doing so at the breakfast meetings you know that you are 
aware of.  So that was the essence of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But there would have been during your 
term I take it there would have been other ANC functions 
that 
Eskom 
may 
have 
sponsored 
which 
might 
not 
necessarily have been connected with the TNA, is it not?  
Like what is called buying tables or that functions or 
dinners or whatever.         
20 
MR TSOTSI:     I cannot really say for sure Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You cannot remember that is the only 
one that you can remember.  
MR TSOTSI:     That is the one that I can remember, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But even that I can understand private 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 66 of 236 
 
companies because some of them maybe wanting to have 
access to the executive to Ministers and so on and so on 
for good or bad reasons for their business.  But I cannot 
understand why Eskom would do that because they are a 
State-owned entity.   
          There is a Minister that represents you know 
government that they liaise with and there is nothing they 
want from government other than a lawful contributions if 
any for funding and so on and so on.  So when it comes to 
a private company I can understand somebody saying you 
10 
know I am going to buy table at that dinner because I want 
to meet the DG’s, I want to meet the Ministers you know for 
whatever purpose.  You have as Eskom access to the 
Minister you know all the time to a Minister who represents 
the government you are a State owned entity.  So why do 
you want to spend money in order to be at that dinner?             
MR TSOTSI:     Chair it is not about, it was not about the 
networking with business in our case. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MR TSOTSI:    We were leveraging you know the 
20 
communication opportunity that we had with our customers 
via the SABC network to be able to put across whatever 
messages we wanted to put across because of the 
availability.    
CHAIRPERSON:   But my difficulty for present purposes it 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 67 of 236 
 
is just doing it in a manner that quite clearly supports a 
political party.  Did you ever do any such things in DA 
meetings, in UDM meetings, in Inkatha meetings, in 
Freedom Front meetings.  Did you ever do any such - did 
Eskom ever do that? 
MR TSOTSI:     I do not know Chair; I would not - I have 
not heard of it.  I have not heard of any…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   It may be that there is justification that I 
just do not know because it seems to be something that 
happens and nobody seems to make issue of not just 
10 
Eskom I think other State owned entities where they seem 
to spend money on political parties’ functions like the ANC 
but I do not think they do the same with any other political 
party.  
MR TSOTSI:     Chair I do not believe that there was any 
specific benefit to the ANC in this process. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR TSOTSI:     There certainly was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well of course if you bought tables you 
know I am using bought in the way that they are used, that 
20 
term is used.  If you bought tables you made the function 
possible without the ANC spending its own money as I see 
it, I may be wrong.    
MR TSOTSI:     Yes, I do not recall that there was anybody 
other than me from Eskom who was present but I do not 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 68 of 236 
 
know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was the function not on the basis of 
buying so called buying a table?  I mean from what one 
reads sometimes these tables are bought for very large 
sums of money which always gives me the impression that 
the food that you are going to eat and everything that you 
are going to eat is going to be much less than the money 
you pay.  So the balance of the money goes to the ANC.    
MR TSOTSI:     Yes, that is a common practice, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because as I recall I am sorry I am 
10 
interrupting you, as I recall even the ANC leaders or some 
of them at least in the past when they give out these 
invitations or talk about them you as a company and I am 
talking now private sector your benefit that you derive for 
paying such a large amount of money when it is that you 
are buying a table is that you are going to network with the 
Ministers with people high ranking officials of a political 
party who happen to be also in government who are 
Ministers.   
          That to me that always sounds not right.  Why 
20 
should people buy, spend money if they want to talk to a 
Minister about something why should they not ask for a 
meeting to meet with the Minister and talk about it without 
paying money.  This is not a Minister acting as Minister 
this is now a Minister acting as a leader in a political party.           
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 69 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:     Yes, from our perspective Chairman what 
we saw was a platform for us to reach our customers which 
was...[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But why can you not reach your 
customers in another way without a political party.   
MR TSOTSI:     We do and we did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR TSOTSI:     But on this occasion I think the presence of 
the SABC was an advantage that we saw because we 
would ordinarily be charged by the SABC for them to give 
10 
us a platform.  So there was that benefit that we 
recognised. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MR TSOTSI:     But I say that was the thinking at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Mr Seleka this was just a detour.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   No it is fine Chair thank you.  Yes, I 
thought I had left it to the end but you brought it forth. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh then I am terribly sorry well it just 
shows we did not exchange notes; we are not exchanging 
notes.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No not at all.  Yes, well Mr Tsotsi this 
was 
indeed 
as 
you 
write 
in 
that 
affidavit 
a 
usual 
fundraising gala dinner and this is for the ANC.  You say 
that in paragraph 6.1.       
MR TSOTSI:     Yes.  
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 70 of 236 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The ANC had its usual fundraising gala 
dinner.  So the funds are being raised for non-other but the 
ANC.  
CHAIRPERSON:   The point being you as Eskom were 
helping the ANC raise funds.   
MR TSOTSI:     That is not correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is not correct? 
MR TSOTSI:     I think the interpretation of what is written 
here is not correct.  Let me correct it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what is the correct interpretation?  
10 
MR TSOTSI:     As I said Eskom was not there for any 
purpose other than to exploit the platform that the SABC 
provided for us to reach our customers.  That was the 
basis upon which I was asked to go and present at that 
function.  As far as I am aware there was no tables that the 
company had bought but I stand to be corrected.  I did not 
know of any such nor was I told that we had bought any 
tables but what I knew was that we had this TNA contract 
and the purpose of the contract was to be able to facilitate 
the use of and create an understanding in our customer 
20 
base of the use of electricity through the 49M program.  
So…[intervene]   
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Tsotsi that cannot be, it cannot be, 
what you are saying cannot be true.  You have to accept 
that such events are fundraising events for the ANC.  Are 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 71 of 236 
 
you not going to accept that proposition?    
MR TSOTSI:     It is a fundraising event for the ANC that is 
true. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so now the ANC is not going to 
allow you to come and sit at the main table with the top six 
as part of Eskom if you are not going to be helping them to 
raise funds.  Why should they do that?   
MR TSOTSI:     What is possible Chair, what is possible is 
that the ANC could have received funding from the 
contractor who is TNA themselves.  It could well be that 
10 
the TNA could have contributed some money as its own 
contribution and then in the process we then get involved 
as a partner of the TNA.  But I am not denying the fact that 
it could be that Eskom could have paid something. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.      
MR TSOTSI:     But I did not go there with the intention of 
supporting…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I do not know about that Mr Tsotsi.  
It is a fundraising function of the ANC.  It is publically 
known to be such, you are brought in to sit at the table, at 
20 
the main table with the top six of the ANC.  There are only 
what four people who are not in the top six of the ANC you 
are one of them.   
          It just seems improbable that the ANC is going to 
allow you to sit there if you are not adding to the purpose 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 72 of 236 
 
of the function which is raise funds and probably if they 
allow you to sit there it is because you have made a 
serious contribution to the purpose of the function.   
          Others 
who 
may 
have 
made 
some 
smaller 
contributions are sitting right there at the back you are 
right at the top.  You must have as Eskom contributed 
significantly to the purpose of the function.  What do you 
say to that?    
MR TSOTSI:     What I say to that chairman I am not aware 
of that I was never made aware of that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR TSOTSI:     I was never told that there was such a 
contribution.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  
MR TSOTSI:     And I think it’s possible that one can – this 
can be discovered in fact did it happen or not.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.    
MR TSOTSI:     But my thinking at the time was that the 
likelihood would have been that TNA themselves would 
have used the Eskom contract to contribute. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I have a suspicion that if the 
Gupta’s used their own money they would not be wanting to 
let you benefit from their own contribution.  They would 
want you to make your own contribution and they would be 
happy that they were at the main table themselves only 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 73 of 236 
 
because the money that they got was their money out of 
the TNA is it not.  
          It was not I say it – once you have paid what you 
paid it was their money it was not Eskom’s money 
anymore.  Ja, okay Mr Seleka if I have encroached on what 
you were going to do, I am terribly sorry it is just that some 
of these issues are quite important.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   No certainly Chairperson not to be 
sorry at all.  Chairperson I think we should explore that 
aspect to its limits and then we can go to where I wanted 
10 
to go earlier.  Mr Tsotsi well you write further there in 
paragraph 6.1 after you mentioned the tops, you said the 
ANC top 6 and two other.   
          All the Gupta brothers the table had name tags.  So 
those who did not know one another were able to introduce 
themselves.  This was the first and the only encounter I 
had with these Gupta brothers.  I never got to see or talk 
to them thereafter.  Now this is January 2014.  Is that 
correct?    
MR TSOTSI:     Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that could be January 2014.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   January 2014.  The next paragraph and 
I am trying to understand that concluding statement in 
paragraph 6.1 visa vie the next statement you make in 6.2.  
You say I was requested by Mr Tony Gupta to meet with 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 74 of 236 
 
him at their Saxonwold residence on some of three 
occasions and once at their Sahara Computers offices in 
Midrand.  Now my question is was Mr Tony Gupta one of 
the brothers you referred to in paragraph 6.1?      
CHAIRPERSON:   No he said those two were Mr Ajay 
Gupta and Mr Atul Gupta they are the two other brothers.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The two older brothers.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Tony Gupta is another one.  So it seems 
that what he means is on the occasion of that dinner he 
met the two namely Atul Gupta and Ajay Gupta but 
10 
subsequently the person that he had interactions with was 
Tony Gupta.    
ADV SELEKA SC:   I see, thank you Chairperson.  You 
confirm that Mr Tsotsi?  
MR TSOTSI:     Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So okay 6.2 refers to a different 
person a different occasion?  
MR TSOTSI:     Yes, a different person yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Different person different occasion.  
And having been requested as such did you attend at their 
20 
residence in Saxonwold?  
MR TSOTSI:     Yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   And what gets to be discussed in a 
nutshell on this – I see you say some three occasions.  
MR TSOTSI:     Yes. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 75 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us take the first occasion then go to 
the second and then go to the third.  
MR TSOTSI:     Okay the one occasion…[intervene] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry can you recall when was that? 
MR TSOTSI:     On this particular occasion it was 
sometime in 2014 it could have been around sometime in 
the middle of the year.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   2014? 
MR TSOTSI:     2014, yes it was sometime in the middle of 
the year. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay then you may proceed about 
what gets to be discussed in that meeting.  
MR TSOTSI:     What had transpired is that there was a 
request from our company that wanted to supply gas to the 
Eskom open cycle turbines which – are based in the 
Western Cape and the idea would be once Eskom has 
converted those units which were now firing with diesel 
into what they should be gas firing.   
          Then the idea will be to bring in gas into the 
Western Cape, get a contract with Eskom for the two units 
20 
to supply gas and use that as an anchor tenant to then get 
into the Western Cape’s business, gas business.  Now the 
evidence is here that Tony Gupta had that there was such 
an opportunity and I said to him look I do not know 
anything about that. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 76 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did he call you or you met or?   
MR TSOTSI:     Yes, we were talking face to face I met him 
at the Saxonwold residence. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes did he call you to set up the 
meeting?   
MR TSOTSI:     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what was the venue of the meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:     It was at Saxonwold.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh at their place.  
MR TSOTSI:     Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay and you say that would have 
been around mid-year 2014? 
MR TSOTSI:     Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay so he asked you to come and 
see him for a meeting and you came and so he talked 
about this issue? 
MR TSOTSI:     Yes, he wanted to find out if we can assist 
him with facilitating a contract with Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR TSOTSI:     So that they can supply gas to them. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR TSOTSI:     So when I then found out what was 
happening, I reverted back to him and…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well before you found out just tell about 
the discussion you are at the meeting now.    
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 77 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He puts this request tell me the 
discussion how the discussions, how the meeting – how 
you responded and how the meeting ended? 
MR TSOTSI:     Okay as I said he asked for the assistance 
for the supply of gas to the OCGT’s like I said and I said 
look I do not know anything about that and he in fact is the 
one who said that there is an opportunity for that business.  
So I said look I am not aware of that I can find out from 
Eskom what is happening in that regard and it was a very 
10 
brief discussion really to say look I do not know anything 
about it I can come and find out and get back to him.   
          I subsequently then enquired at Eskom and what I 
was told was that there was a company which had raised 
the same discussion at Eskom and they were then directed 
to speak to the Department of Energy because the way that 
process is done is through an MOU which MOU is signed 
with not with Eskom but with the Department of Energy.  
That I conveyed to him that that is the, as far as what 
Eskom gave me.  So it is not only that it is out of Eskom’s 
20 
hands it is a matter that he would have to raise with the 
Department of Energy, let alone the fact that it looks as 
though someone had beaten them to that.  So that was the 
one encounter which I had with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you had to go back to him was that 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 78 of 236 
 
by way of a telephone call or was there nothing... 
MR TSOTSI:  I think I called him yes I think I called him 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  I do not recall going back to – to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  I think I just phoned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes was there any special reason why 
when he wanted to meet with you you agreed to go to his 
house or home as opposed to him coming to you?  He 
10 
wanted a meeting with you.  Why does he not come to you? 
MR TSOTSI:  Chairman I cannot specifically say why he – I 
did not ask him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  To come to my office.  I do not recall that I had 
asked him to come to my office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well it is just – just strange that from 
the evidence I heard over the past two years in terms of 
people who met with them that mostly they got people to 
come to – to them rather than them going to people.  
20 
General Nyanda gave evidence here and said that when they 
sent messages wanting a meeting with him, he insisted that 
they should do like everybody come to his office.  They must 
go through the normal processes and come and have a 
meeting in the department – and no meeting ever happened.  
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 79 of 236 
 
It seems they – that they did not want to do that and he said 
well he was dropped from Cabinet.  That it looks like 
everybody just went to them whenever they wanted a 
meeting and nobody said well you want to have a meeting 
with me you come to my office.  So that is why I am asking 
you whether there was any reason why you went to him 
rather than him coming to you? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  You cannot remember any particular 
discussion around – around the issue of where you – the two 
10 
of you should meet? 
MR TSOTSI:  Well Chair there was no discussion in the 
sense that there was no debate as to whether he should 
come to my office or me go to his – his place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MR TSOTSI:  Because I knew that they – the tendency for 
them is to ask I know that the tendency for them is to ask 
that the meetings be held at their place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well Mr Themba Maseko gave 
evidence to the effect that he had a meeting with Mr Ajay

Gupta in the second half of 2010 and effectively Mr Ajay 
Gupta was saying something along the lines, we called the 
Ministers.  We – if they do not cooperate then we tell the – 
we report them to the President and he deals with them.  So 
– so I am wondering whether this whole idea that whenever 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 80 of 236 
 
they need to meet with people they do not go to those 
people’s places. They – the other people must come to them 
– they must come to their home.  You know. 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair it was – it was common knowledge 
amongst the government officials and people who had reason 
to interact with them that they certainly have the occasion of 
the President and were close enough to the President to 
threaten people with – with Baba as they call him.  They did 
the same to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  At some point.  So I suppose they felt that if 
they had that kind of leverage with the President, they could 
demand whatever they wanted to be done and that be done 
or else there might be consequences. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  That was common knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Now Mr Tsotsi a 
follow up question to that is – is given that he was making a 
business proposition to Eskom why did he seek a meeting 
20 
with you a Chairperson of the Board non-executive and not 
anybody else in operations at Eskom? 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair I got a very distinct impression that the – 
this 
guy 
specifically 
Tony 
Gupta 
not 
only 
had 
no 
understanding of processes but he had no appreciation and I 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 81 of 236 
 
think could not really care less.  All he is interest was is the 
person who he perceives to be in a position of authority and 
a position of power to deliver whatever details that they – he 
wanted delivered was the person he would focus on.  And 
the processes of approaching the organisation through the 
operational and correct channels he was not interested in 
that.  So it did not surprise me because he certainly had no 
regard for processes.  Especially when we talk about the way 
they responded when in fact I was unable to assist them in 
specific instances.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Well one has in mind for instance if 
you talking about persons in authority you have a CEO there 
he certainly one person in authority.  He is the face of the 
company. So why not him but you?  Do you – did you ever 
ask yourself that question? 
MR TSOTSI:  Well I did not really engage myself with that 
issue because I understood that they have this notion that 
they can operate with impunity at levels of government.  And 
so engaging them in process-oriented discussion about who 
they should approach and who they should not approach was 
20 
a useless exercise because they did not believe in that.  
They did not understand that and they were not interested in 
dealing in that way.  Of course, in my response to issues that 
they – for example I will give you another example just to 
deal with your question.  Chair there was a time when the 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 82 of 236 
 
same person Tony Gupta had wanted a particular individual 
to be employed by Eskom in a position in procurement.  
There was a position on the establishment list of Eskom of a 
Chief Procurement Officer.  And he wanted me to assist him 
to get – well that person to get that position in the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Around about when was this?  Was 
this still 2014? 
MR TSOTSI:  This is 2014 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So there was a vacancy for the 
position of Chief Procurement Officer at Eskom? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  So he thought. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he thought yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:  In fact he did not refer to it as a vacancy he 
said there is a position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  And he wanted that position for his – for his 
candidate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  So when I discovered … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was he talking to you in a meeting or over 
a phone? 
MR TSOTSI:  It was once again one of those visits I had at… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay was that the second meeting? 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 83 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  And if you estimate around 
about which month in 2014 would that second meeting have 
taken place? 
MR TSOTSI:  Well I know that it was…. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sometime during the second half of the 
year? 
MR TSOTSI:  Probably the second half of the year yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay alright.  Even if you cannot 
remember the date that is fine. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So he – this time how did that meeting 
take – come about?  Did he call you and arrange another 
meeting for you to come and see him? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes Chairman.  He called me to arrange 
another meeting to come and see him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Then you went there. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the meeting took place at Saxonwold? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he said there is this position I would 
like you to facilitate the appointment of this person to that 
position? 
MR TSOTSI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Are you able to tell the person’s 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 84 of 236 
 
name that he wanted to be appointed to that position? 
MR TSOTSI:  I do not recall the name but I know that he 
mentioned that the person was at the time working for MTN. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That person was working for MTN? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  What was your response to this 
request? 
MR TSOTSI:  I said to him, look I know nothing about that.  I 
mean I am not in operations so I would have to ask the 
people in operations if they can assist you.  And I said to him 
10 
ordinarily there would be an advert for that position and that 
your candidate would have to apply like everybody else.  I 
thought he was essentially looking for – what shall I call it? – 
some sort of support at the process where the candidate is 
now – has applied and is being considered – is being 
evaluated.  I thought that he was interested in that sort of 
support.  Well I discovered … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so you – what was his reaction to what 
you said namely I would have to find out but whether you can 
be assisted but ordinarily there would have to have been an 
20 
advert that went out and your candidate would have to apply 
like everybody.  What was his reaction to that? 
MR TSOTSI:  I do not remember specifically Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  But I was convinced that he was looking for me 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 85 of 236 
 
to pull strings for him so to speak. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  But I suppose not knowing what was actually 
the situation he maybe did not know what to say because I 
said, look I do not know the situation I would have to find out 
what is going on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. So the meeting ended on the basis 
that you would find out about this position he was talking 
about and revert to him? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then you went to find out? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes and what I established was that not only 
was the position on the establishment list of the company but 
the position was in fact not advertised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But was it vacant? 
MR TSOTSI:  It was not advertised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was vacant? 
MR TSOTSI:  It was vacant yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay but it had not been advertised. 
MR TSOTSI:  It had not been advertised. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.   
MR TSOTSI:  And that is what I told him.  I said to him well 
the position not been advertised and so there is no issue.  
You would have to wait until the position gets advertised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 86 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:  I stand to be corrected here Chairman but I 
think I subsequently heard much later after I had left Eskom 
that that individual did in fact go and work for Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is that so? 
MR TSOTSI:  That is what I understood. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But you have no party – you have no 
– do not remember the particulars of his name and what 
position he ultimately occupied at Eskom? 
10 
MR 
TSOTSI: 
 
The 
position 
would 
have 
been 
Chief 
Commercial Officer. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh he – from what you heard he 
ultimately got that position? 
MR TSOTSI:  That is what I ultimately heard yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well it would be interesting to 
establish as a matter of certainty whether it is the same 
person that you had been told about by Mr Gupta. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is one and two whether he 
20 
actually it is true he got this position that Mr Gupta wanted 
him for.  So I think if the legal team does not have that 
information please something must be done to just establish 
for sure what the position is and I assume that you might not 
remember the name but if you are told that it looks like that 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 87 of 236 
 
position was occupied – was filled by so and so you might 
recall whether that was the name that you have been told.  
And whether that person came from MTN that would link up 
with your thinking. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Yes Mr Tsotsi he 
– writing in… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was to tell us about the third meeting 
with Mr Tony Gupta.  He has told us – you have told us about 
two meetings. 
MR TSOTSI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Tell us about the third one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair the third one has to do with the TNA 
contract.  You will recall Chair the last time I was here that 
20 
we raised the issue of the irregular expenditure which 
occurred at the instance of Colin Matjila who was at the time 
the acting Chief Executive of Eskom.  This was now I would 
say around October – no it was a little bit before October.  
Just before Mr Matona came into the … 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 88 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja Mr Matjila preceded Mr Matona I think. 
MR TSOTSI:  That is right yes.  And on this occasion, I met 
– remember I met him at his Saxonwold office – I mean sorry 
his Sahara offices. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the Sahara offices? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes.  I was on my way to a meeting in Pretoria.  
And … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So each time you met you were the one to 
go to him? 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:  Then at this meeting he asked me what was 
the problem with the contract that Eskom had signed with 
them – with TNA?  He hears that there is a – some problem 
to do with this contract.  So I told him I said, the contract 
has been entered into irregularly and that there is an inquiry 
in fact a forensic audit to establish precisely what had 
happened and how to remedy that situation.  So he said to 
me, look you are the boss why – you can make thing go 
away.  And so once again it reinforces the mind-set that I 
20 
spoke about earlier that they have in terms of the structure 
of the organisation and how it works and processes and all 
of that stuff.  So I told him that in response that first of all I 
am not in operations and secondly even more importantly 
this particular incident irregularity that has been picked up of 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 89 of 236 
 
its own triggers a series of events which I would have no 
jurisdiction over such as you will be aware the audit trail and 
also the formality of reporting this incident not only in the 
financials of the company but also reporting it to the audit 
authorities.  So the essence I told him then that there is 
nothing I could do or anybody else for that matter could do 
to assist in this regard.  This issue has got to take its 
course.  And as I reported in the last time, I was here Chair 
that for the first time I noticed that he was visibly angry or 
upset. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Upset. 
MR TSOTSI:  Upset with me – with my response.  So that 
was one of the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR TSOTSI:  Occasions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may continue Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Thank you Chair.  Mr 
Tsotsi you have mentioned that they used the name Baba’s 
enemies – the concept of Baba’s enemies.  Let us look at 
paragraph 6.9 of your affidavit on page 6.  You say there: 
20 
“Tony Gupta made no secret of their intention 
to influence public servants to assist them 
with their business interests.  He easily 
spoke disparagingly of those who did not 
want to assist them and rendered them as 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 90 of 236 
 
Baba’s 
enemies. 
 
A 
reference 
to 
the 
President – to President Jacob Zuma.” 
 
I pause there Mr Tsotsi to go back to my question to 
you which is why were you the person approached being an 
executive Chairman of this entity Eskom?  And you said it is 
because you think they perceived you as being a person in 
authority – in a position of authority.  Correct? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And you have explained that you had this 
meeting with Tony Gupta on three occasions at their 
10 
residence 
in 
Saxonwold 
and 
their 
offices 
at 
Sahara 
Computers.  Why did you agree to going back the second 
time, the third time?  Why did you not rebuff them? 
MR TSOTSI:  Chairman this is an interesting question 
because you know the – as I said earlier that there was a 
well-known 
situation 
regarding 
them 
insofar 
as 
their 
relationship with the President.  And there were – I had 
heard 
of 
instances 
where 
people 
were 
supposedly 
threatened by them if they were not able to at least give 
them whatever assistance they felt that they needed and that 
20 
they would report them to the President whom they referred 
to UBaba.  And they seemed to have this authority about 
them.  And I think it is – I suppose something that if one 
looks at what influence they are capable of exerting then it is 
clear to me that responding to their requests and their needs 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 91 of 236 
 
whatever it is that they want to have done is something that 
would cause them to feel that a lack of such of response 
would be in a way once again disrespecting UBaba.  So the 
one operated with the thought that you were at the – the 
behest of people who if you are not able to assist them you 
are in fact going against the wishes if I may put it that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are going against the wishes of? 
MR TSOTSI:  Of the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The President okay. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes.  Because of their… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes if you – if you do anything that 
displeases them you would feel that you are displeasing the 
President? 
MR TSOTSI:  Essentially that is what it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  So I felt that meeting them was not a critical 
issue.  What was critical for me was whether I was in a 
position to subscribe to what it is that they wanted to do and 
whether in fact it was within my purview or my authority to 
do so.  That to me was really the critical issue. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Well I do not follow the reasoning 
but is that how you thought about it at the time? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Because in fact you do have another 
meeting according to you on page 7 of the affidavit – 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 92 of 236 
 
paragraph 7.3.  And again, on this occasion as the 
Chairperson has emphasised it is not them coming to you it 
is them calling you to come to themselves.  And you right if 
you go to page 7 please paragraph 7.3.   Just to put context 
to that.  It flows from your two preceding paragraphs which 
above which you say a day or two before the State of the 
Nation Address of February of 2015 – 5 February 2015 that 
is in paragraph 7.1.  You have an encounter with Minister 
Brown which you tell about there and paragraph 7.3 you say: 
“On the same day a day or two before the 
10 
SONA – State of the Nation Address in Cape 
Town Tony Gupta called and requested that 
we meet.  He suggested that the meeting be 
at their residence in Constantia to which I 
agree.” 
And this again goes back to my question that you 
seem amenable to attending – I mean to complying with their 
requests.  May I ask you this?  Did you – will it be a correct 
rather observation of your response given to the Chairperson 
that you felt intimidated by them? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  There is an element of intimidation yes that is 
true.  There is an element of intimidation considering the fact 
that they have the relationship they had with the President. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What was the fear of what could happen to 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 93 of 236 
 
you if you displeased them and therefore displeased the 
President?  Why did you have to fear anything about 
displeasing them if you said, you want a meeting come and 
see me in my office?  And that is the one point.  The second 
point is, maybe after the first meeting you say well, I met you 
at your venue the first time now you come to me.  Let us 
have a meeting in my office.  What could have – what fear 
could you have had of what would happen to you if you said 
that and he did not like that? 
MR TSOTSI:  Chairman I think it will be – it will be correct 
10 
for me to think considering what subsequently happened to 
think that I would have incurred the displeasure of the 
President if I had did not respond to them in the manner that 
I did.  And I think what might have happened is that I might 
have either been reprimanded by the President or might have 
been asked to assist them when they want assistance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:  Which I know had happened with – or 
supposedly it happened with one of the colleagues in 
government. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi let us 
seek could – could the answer not lie in what you say Mr 
Tony Gupta told you?  Let us go back to that paragraph 7.3 
which is the question the Chairperson is asking.  What did 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 94 of 236 
 
you fear would happen to you if you did not comply?  So you 
arrive there.   
“He suggested that the meeting be at the residence 
in Constantia to which I agreed.” 
 
Then you go on: 
“It turned out that the meeting was intended to tell 
me that I am not supportive of their business 
endeavours.  He went on to say:  Chairman, we are 
the ones who put you in this position and we are the 
ones who can take you out.” 
10 
 
Did the answer to the Chairperson’s question to you did 
not lay there, the fear of what could happen to you? 
MR TSOTSI:   Well, that was partly one of the things that, 
you know, rested in my mind because I heard of instances of 
people who supposedly because they did not cooperate, if 
you like, with them.   
 
They seemed to have had some difficulties.  And we 
have heard of stories of members of executive who had 
suffered their faith, supposedly.   
 
And, you know, people talk and the mill goes around and 
20 
they raise these issues.  So in a way, they had themselves a 
reputation of being able to use their position to jeopardise 
people’s positions in government to the extent where people 
may have – to be dismissed from their positions because 
they were reluctant to interact with them. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 95 of 236 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  You do say in paragraph 7.4, you 
remark there that: 
“What was ironical about this incident is that is 
occurred a mere few hours after my encounter with 
the minister who for all intense and purposes said 
the same to me.” 
 
What did she say to you? 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay.  At that meeting... Okay, let me just 
step aside and say.  Chair, this was about the time of the 
SONA in February of 2015.  And I was in Cape Town 
10 
attending the SONA.  It could have been a day or two before 
then.  
 
And sometime in the later morning or towards the middle 
of the day, I got a phone call from Minister Brown who asked 
me to come and see her in her office of which I did. 
 
And when I got to her office, she was in fact preparing to 
go into parliament or something or to another meeting.  And I 
did not even get a chance to sit down because we spoke and 
she was already about to leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:   This was at her house, at her office? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   At her office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  In Cape Town? 
MR TSOTSI:   In Cape Town. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   Then the minister then says to me:  Chairman, 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 96 of 236 
 
the reason I am calling you is I have received complaints.  I 
have received complaints about your conduct from the board 
members.  I have also received complaints from executives. 
 
And the nature of the complaints is that you are 
interfering in management.  So I was taken aback by this and 
I did not agree with the minister nor did I fully understand 
what she was saying.   
 
And I responded to her by saying that insofar as board 
members are concerned, they hardly know me because they 
are new to the board.  We had not really had a meeting and 
10 
we had not had a first board meeting. 
 
So I thought it would be unreasonable for them to 
accuse me of interfering with management.  And I said to her 
also, as far as management is concerned, from their 
standpoint, if trying to get them to be accountable to the 
board, constitutes interference in management, then I will 
continue to interfere with my... that is my position. 
 
Then when I said that, the minister then said to me:  
Chairman, I think there is no reason for you and I to have 
any meetings or any contact.  So I will go on to do what I are 
20 
going to do and you just carry on doing what you are doing. 
 
So I said:  That is fine, Minister.  I will carry on doing 
what I was doing.  So I got the impression that not only was 
she expressing her unhappiness with me but also that she 
was basically writing me off.  That is the impression I had. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 97 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is January 2015? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The new board at that stage had had its 
induction or you cannot remember? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, the board had its induction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it did not have its first meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And would it be correct to say therefore 
that as at the time that the minister she had received 
complaints from board members that there would not have 
10 
been any grounds for the board members to have any 
complaints against you because you have not started 
working with them? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is precisely my view, Chair.  There was 
no basis for them to have that attitude. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Because I have not started working with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  In terms of the management of the – 
of Eskom.  Would the CEO ordinarily communicate with the 
minister or would he communicate with you and you would 
20 
then communicate with the minister? 
MR TSOTSI:   The way the communication was set up is the 
DG and the chief executive would be the ones who would 
communicate.  And then I as chairman would communicate 
with the minister.   
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 98 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   That was the setup. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it would ordinarily be out of order for 
the CEO to communicate directly with the minister on Eskom 
matters as opposed to communicating through you or is that 
not correct? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, there would have to be some 
exceptional situation ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...for the CEO to communicate directly. 
MR 
TSOTSI: 
 
 
That 
would 
be 
under 
exceptional 
circumstances.  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Of course, if the CEO wanted to complain 
about you to the minister, one would understand not going 
through you.  Is that right? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  But at that stage the Eskom had a 
20 
new CEO that was Mr Matona who had started on the 
1s t of October. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if the position is that Mr Matona had 
not conveyed to the minister any complaints about you, then 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 99 of 236 
 
if the minister got complaints from anybody else from 
management, that would be even strange because ordinarily 
anybody below the CEO, I imagine, has no business 
communicating directly with the minister? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The CEO has got to go through but we 
understand that if he has complaints about you that he was 
going to convey to the minister, that he might not go through 
you in that case. 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, as it turns out, at the time when the 
10 
minister called me to come and see her, I was in fact with Mr 
Matona in a meeting of the portfolio committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Numbers.  We were having sort of a 
workshop. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you left that meeting to go and see the 
minister? 
MR TSOTSI:   I left that meeting to go and see the minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and left him in the meeting, Mr 
Matona? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   I then went back to that meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And of course, I then seized the opportunity to 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 100 of 236 
 
ask Mr Matona what is going on.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   And he knew nothing about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He had never complaint to the minister? 
MR TSOTSI:   He had never complaint to the minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi, let 
us go to... I think what you were relating in regard to your 
encounter with the minister, can be found in paragraph 7.1 of 
you affidavit, page 6. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And you said you had a conversation.  
She had summoned you to her office.  And the second 
sentence is: 
“The substance of our conversation was as follows.  
Chairman, 
I 
have 
received 
complaints 
from 
management and board members that you are 
interfering in management.  Please refrain from 
doing so because if you do not, I shall have to find 
someone else to do your job.” 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that what she told you? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is precisely what she said to me.  That is 
pretty much what happened, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So you have the minister telling you 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 101 of 236 
 
that you might lose your job ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ..if you do not stop what she was saying 
you must stop. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then a few hours later, you have Mr Tony 
Gupta saying they put you into this position, they can take 
you out. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is what you say you found very 
10 
strange? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Now just to go back. Did you have any 
idea of what it is she might have talking about that she 
referred to as interfering in management?  I guess, the 
meant in the management of the company operational 
20 
matters. 
 
Is that something that you had been dealing with the 
management that you could link this to? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, I will have to preface my response 
to you by saying that I do not have any concrete evidence 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 102 of 236 
 
that I can that this is what happened but deductively I can 
piece together where this came from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do that.  Just piece it together. 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay.  The way I reasoned this is that 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just switch on your mic.  Your mic is off, 
ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR TSOTSI:   There is a time when I had received a letter 
10 
from a company called Sumitomo when I was chairman to 
Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A company called? 
MR TSOTSI:   Sumitomo. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Sumitomo.  Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   Sumitomo, yes.  And this would have been 
around the beginning of Ms Brown’s term, I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would have been around the second 
half of 2014 ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   June/July.  Somewhere around there. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   2014? 
MR TSOTSI:   2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And Sumitomo had – what they were – they 
addressed the letter to me as chairman, requesting my 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 103 of 236 
 
assistance in dealing with the matter with Eskom which they 
were at a point they felt they are not making progress with 
Eskom in the matter.  That is a matter to do with the 
reconstruction of transformers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Reconstruction of? 
MR TSOTSI:   Of transformers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, transformers.  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  This is a Japanese company. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And as usual, when something like this 
10 
happens, I ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sumitomo wanted to get a job in – relating 
to the transformation – construction of transformers? 
MR TSOTSI:   What essentially was happening was that 
Eskom had asked Sumitomo to construct or to build 
transformers for them for a specific purpose and that they 
would then give Sumitomo a permission to go ahead at a 
certain point and this was not happening, apparently.   
 
So in the interactions with Eskom, Eskom was not able 
to come to an agreement with them about proceeding with 
20 
the contract or proceeding with the construction of these 
transformers. 
 
Then when they wrote to me, they asked for my 
assistance in trying to resolve the issue with Eskom.  So as 
normal, I then spoke to the chief executive and I said there 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 104 of 236 
 
is this letter from Sumitomo and the person who is 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   It was Mr Matjila at that time, the CEO. 
MR TSOTSI:   It was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or was it Mr Matona already? 
MR TSOTSI:   I cannot remember where it was Brian Dumas 
or it was Mr Matona.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Whoever was the CEO or acting 
CEO at the time. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  Then I asked the legal people who were 
10 
in my office.  I told them that this is what had transpired.  I 
have asked the organisation through the chief executive to 
give me a response.  
 
So I then had a conversation around that issue with 
Engineer, Matshela Koko.  And then it was him who was 
taking responsibility to respond to this matter. 
 
Now in the course of this whole programme and the time 
to respond, there was some delay that was occurring and I 
did not understand what the delay was all about. 
 
Eventually, I received a response from Mr Matshela Koko 
20 
which response I then gave to the legal department and 
asked them:   Can I sign this letter?  Would this letter not 
create a particular difficulty for the organisation if I sign it? 
 
They took it, they had looked at it and they said:  No, 
Chairman this letter does not commit or create a situation 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 105 of 236 
 
where Eskom would have difficulty with.   
CHAIRPERSON:   This was now – this would have been your 
response to ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:  Sumitomo.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Sumitomo.  Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   And then I responded, signed the letter and 
the letter went off.  Subsequent to that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   And in effect, the gist of your response 
was what in the letter? 
MR TSOTSI:   The gist of my response was that the - if I 
10 
recall well now, is that Eskom would has reviewed the 
Sumitomo situation and would be getting in touch with them 
in terms of what the next steps will be including the 
possibility of sending someone there to go and see what is 
actually going on. 
 
Now what then happened subsequent to that was that 
one of the individuals who was involved in this matter – and I 
got to understand this simple because of the incident that 
took place – was a man called Mayisela(?) Sekasindi(?) 
[00:20:37]. 
20 
 
He got suspended.  He was suspended by his then boss, 
his name – by the name of Matjila, of course, for reasons 
which purportedly are that he irregularly assisted and drafted 
a letter for me to sign which he should not have done.  That 
was the essence of that. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 106 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Now this process took some time and by the 
time letter gone off, I think by that Mr Matona was in the 
office. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who was the CEO? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  So I then subsequently heard that I was 
being blamed for this matter and that I had a hand in it and 
there was a complaint which was raised with the minister.  
Now 
the 
minister 
did 
not 
specifically 
addressed 
this 
particular issue with me. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
She 
did 
not 
give 
you 
particular 
...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
...as 
to 
which 
interference, 
what 
interference she was talking about?  
MR TSOTSI:   No, she did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR TSOTSI:   So when I tried to piece everything together 
because I have been told that this complaint was raised by 
Matshela with her.  It is at this point when I realised that the 
20 
possibility is that the source of this particular issue is 
Matshela Koko.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And there was no other transaction 
or matter in which you had interacted with the management 
where you could think the minister – which the minister you 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 107 of 236 
 
thought was talking about, in saying you had been interfering 
with management.  This was the only one you could think of? 
MR TSOTSI:   It was the only one I could think of, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Alright. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  So as I say, that is my piecing of what 
could have transpired. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Of course, there is something a little 
strange with what the minister said to you, namely, she was 
10 
objecting to you interfering in management.  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is something strange about the fact 
that both she and Mr Tony Gupta were effectively threatening 
you with dismissal if you did not do what they wanted you to 
do. 
 
And what is strange is that on the one hand, Tony Gupta 
effectively wanted you to interfere in management and 
operations. 
 
But the minister was saying:  I am told you are 
20 
interfering in management.  And on the face of it, one would 
think she does not want interference.  You interfering in 
management.  Is that right? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the threat is the same but the reason 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 108 of 236 
 
for the threat seemed to be different.  That is on the face of 
it.  Unless saying you must not interfere with management 
did not mean what one would think it means.   
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You understand what I am saying? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you appreciate it? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I see we are two minutes to one but you 
might want to ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me just canvas this point with Mr 
Tsotsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Tsotsi, the minister or former 
Minister, Lynne Brown, has provided the Commission with an 
affidavit after being furnished with your affidavit and she 
speaks specifically about this issue in a paragraph in her – 
or certain paragraphs in her affidavit.  It is in your bundle 
20 
and that is on page – the paragraphs that I want to refer to, 
they are on page 445.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that 445? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   445.  Correct, Chairperson.  You will see 
that ...[intervenes]  
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 109 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...the beginning of... the beginning of 
this affidavit is on page 434 and it is titled Supplementary 
affidavit of Miss Lynette Brown.  And if you go to page 445, 
starting at paragraph 100, she writes.  The heading is:  “My 
exchange 
with 
Zola 
Tsotsi 
in 
his 
interference 
with 
management matters.” 
“Question seeks of Annexure SA2, reproduces (I 
think it should read an extract) attributed to Mr Zola 
Tsotsi about a conversation I allegedly had with him. 
10 
For ease of reference I restate the passage.” 
 
And she does which is what we have read a day or two 
before the SONA of February 2015.  So I will not read that 
passage.  We have seen it from your affidavit. 
 
Then paragraph 101, she says: 
“The only related conversation I remember having 
with Mr Zola Tsotsi related to his interference with 
management or operational issues as opposed to 
directorate issues. 
In his oral testimony before the Commission, he 
20 
confirms this, referring to me, he says where upon 
the minister had well in this instance, she was not 
happy about the fact that I was said to be interfering 
with management.” 
 
Now you will deal with that in your response Mr Tsotsi.  
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 110 of 236 
 
Paragraph 102: 
“There had been complaints about Mr Zola Tsotsi, 
both from the executives and the directory.  What 
comes to mind in particular was that one of the 
executives came to see me in person, complaining 
about Mr Tsotsi’s interference with the operational 
issues, producing a letter allegedly by Mr Tsotsi to a 
Japanese company about buying oil or some other 
fuel.  I decided I had to intervene.” 
 
She says: 
10 
“This is why I invited Mr Tsotsi, reprimanded him 
and directed him to refrain from interfering with 
management.  As to the verbatim exchange, I cannot 
recall.  I do recall that the meeting was tense.  The 
exchange could have been interpreted.” 
 
Now I am pointing you to this because you were saying 
she did not give you the specifics in regard to the alleged 
interferences.   
 
Is it not your recollection - is it not a natural fact that 
she did not tell you any specifics or could you have forgotten 
20 
that she might have told you this specific incident she is 
referring to?  
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, I am absolutely certain she did not 
tell me the incident.  But deep down I knew what was going 
on. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 111 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Because of what I described just now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And the irony of it is that, the person who 
raised the complaint to her is the very author of that letter 
which I was then cleared to sent to Sumitomo.  So I am just 
baffled.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   The last question before we take the 
adjournment.  Who did you say was the author of this? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   It is Matshela Koko who in his capacity as the 
Executive for Commercial and Technology, he was at the 
time the Executive for Commercial and Technology, so it was 
in his area that this matter was fixed. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson it might be an opportune 
time, I suppose the other, we could finalise the point after 
the adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, on that is fine, we will have to take 
the lunch adjournment, we will resume at five past two. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairman. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 112 of 236 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi, 
when 
we 
adjourned, 
we 
were 
dealing 
with 
certain 
paragraphs arising from Ms Lynne Brown’s affidavit in 
regard to your meeting with her two or three days before 
the State of the Nation address in February 2015.  I think 
we have exhausted that aspect insofar as it is relevant.  
Do you have anything to add to it? 
MR TSOTSI:   To this? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, to that exchange or the Minister ’s 
response to you. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, I think that I stand very firmly by what 
I had said in terms of the engagement with the Minister 
though I see in her affidavit she says that she cannot recall 
the – what the exchange was about and I also must 
immediately correct what I see here in her statement on 
102 where she says …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Paragraph 102, you say? 
MR TSOTSI:   Paragraph 102, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja? 
MR TSOTSI:   Where in the middle of the sentence it says: 
20 
“Complaining about Mr Tsotsi’s independence of 
operational 
issues 
producing 
a 
letter 
allegedly 
penned by Mr Tsotsi, the Japanese company about 
buying oil or some other fuel.” 
Now this has got nothing to do with buying oil or some 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 113 of 236 
 
other fuel.  This has got to do with purchasing equipment 
for Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   In the form of transformers.  So I think 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So she may have got confused? 
MR TSOTSI:   That might have some other connotations, 
other [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Mr Tsotsi. Ja, you will see, 
10 
for what it is worth, we could complete this, paragraph 104, 
still on that page, the Minister – former Minister writes: 
“I must also say that I did not have the best of 
relationships with Mr Tsotsi, we did not really get on 
well with each other.  I let know that I abhorred his 
excesses in particular the fact that as an Executive 
Chairman who probably would have meetings four 
times a year, a staff complement of 11 and a 
fulltime driver were unjustified excesses.”  
I am going to quickly read through. 
20 
“The relationship became even more rancid after he 
had resigned.  In public platforms, especially in the 
media, he would tarnish my name.  In the beginning 
I would respond as the media houses and radio 
stations would ask for comments from me.  In the 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 114 of 236 
 
end 
it 
became 
an 
exhausting 
an 
emotionally 
draining exercise so I let it go and stopped 
commenting in the media.” 
Any comment on that, Mr Tsotsi?  
MR TSOTSI:   Let me go back to 104, Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And state very categorically that the Minister 
is uninformed in respect of the staff complement in my 
office.  I had one individual who I brought into my office as 
a senior general manager, I had a PA and those were the 
10 
only people who were directly reporting to me.  I had the 
entire organisation at my disposal, so I could have had – I 
could have been accused of having the entire management 
and my behest.   
But the fact of the matter is, all those people had 
their own reporting lines but I had access to them because 
I was Chairman of the company.  So I did not have 11 
people, I had two people in my office.  The rest of the 
people were people who were availed to me through the 
office of the Chief Executive because that is who, in the 
20 
main, the people I dealt with reported to and so whenever I 
needed something, the Chief Executive would make it easy 
and at times would simply – I would simply contact them 
directly 
and, 
of 
course, 
just 
later 
inform 
the 
Chief 
Executive what conversations I have had with these 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 115 of 236 
 
people.  So this is not correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Mr Tsotsi. 
MR TSOTSI:   I was not even an Executive Chairman, for 
that matter. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I was about to ask that question. 
MR TSOTSI:   The other one, Chair, in 105 in regard to the 
media.  Well, I think the less said about that, the better 
because I expressed my opinion in a media interview and I 
would like to refer to that particular matter when we come 
to it, Chair, because we will come to it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, that is fine. 
MR TSOTSI:   Because it has a bearing on my removal 
from Eskom. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But just please make note of it, Mr 
Tsotsi. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I will certainly remember. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now we touched on this aspect this 
morning about the cancellation of the meeting of the 26 
February 2015 and that on your version it was on the 
20 
minutes does request or at least that is how you conveyed 
it to the board.  Correct? 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The Minister has – or former Minister 
has touched on that in her affidavit, the very one in front of 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 116 of 236 
 
you.  If you go to page 442, for context we could start at 
441 at the bottom half, page 441.  On what page are you, 
Mr Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:   I am page – 441, sorry? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   441. 
MR TSOTSI:   Sorry.  Yes, 441. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   At the bottom of the page, paragraph 
65. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It reads: 
10 
“Questions 8 and 9 of annexure LBSA probe the 
cancellation 
of 
the 
Eskom 
meeting 
that 
was 
scheduled for 26 February 2015.  I share what I can 
remember about the cancellation.” 
If you turn the page?   
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   She says: 
“I do recall having...” 
Oh no, 66: 
“Above 
I 
have 
discussed 
the 
country’s 
load 
20 
shedding woes during late 2014.  These woes 
spilled over to 2015 and I remember distinctly that 
we had load shedding even on the day of the 
Opening of Parliament in January that years.” 
67: 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 117 of 236 
 
“I do recall having conversations with the then 
President, President Zuma, about the dire situation 
of load shedding.  He was concerned that the war 
room was not receiving accurate information, i.e. 
the executives were feeding the wrong or inaccurate 
to the war room.  He was also distressed by the 
impact of load shedding on the country and the 
economy.  We were facing a threat of downgrade 
because of Eskom’s illiquidity problems.” 
Then she goes on on other matters.  Paragraph 68, what 
10 
specifically we are dealing with, what is contained in your 
affidavit in regard to the cancellation of the meeting.  
Says: 
“I do not know why this meeting was cancelled.  I 
remembered that I got to know that it was no longer 
proceeding.  I do not recall specifically having a 
conversation with the then President, President 
Zuma, about the cancellation of this meeting.  It 
may have happened, I simply cannot recall.  I 
cannot 
imagine 
that 
the 
then 
Acting 
Director 
20 
General of the DPE…” 
That is Department of Public Enterprises. 
“…Ms Matsietsi Mokholo, would speak about me 
having requested her to inform the Chairperson, Mr 
Zola Tsotsi, that the meeting must be cancelled.  
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 118 of 236 
 
This may have happened.  This meeting was 
rescheduled for and held on 11 March 2015.  I 
would not know the process that was followed to 
reschedule this meeting to 11 March 2015.  Eskom 
is better placed to explain that process.” 
Paragraph 71: 
“In the meeting the board members asked me why 
the meeting of 26 February 2015 cancelled, I in turn 
relayed the question to the Chairman, Mr Zola 
Tsotsi, he replied that he had sent a memo to me.  I 
10 
do not recall ever receiving such a memo.” 
Do you have any comment, Mr Tsotsi, briefly on that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  Chair, the assertion by Minister Brown 
in item 67 where she says she does not have a recollection 
of a conversation with the then President Zuma – or was it 
68?  I am sorry, about the cancellation of this meeting.  I 
cannot really speak for that but what I am certain about is 
that I was called by Ms Matsietsi Mokholo, speaking on 
behalf of the Minister.  So I think …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that was after the President himself 
20 
had called you? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And said he had been looking for the 
Minister and the Deputy Minister. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 119 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And could not find them that is why he 
was phoning you directly. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he said that it was about – well 
effectively he talked about the meeting being postponed or 
cancelled. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So both what the President said to you 
and what Ms Koko – not Ms Koko – the Acting DG said to 
you, seemed to connect? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the Acting DG said it was the 
Minister who sent her to call you. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   So I think the onus is one former Minister 
Brown to check up on the communication between herself 
and Ms Mokholo.  That it is really I can say in that regard. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then she mentions …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Unless, of course, the President ended 
20 
up speaking to the Acting DG after speaking to you and 
then – but the strange thing is that the Acting DG did not 
say it is the President who asked her.  She said it is the 
Minister. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, absolutely. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 120 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  The other thing which I just want 
to make a comment about is this statement she makes 
about when she turned up at the meeting, the board 
meeting, when the board invited her. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, we will deal with that.  The memo that I 
sent to her is in fact dealing with the whole question of 
formality that I would – I had requested her to put it down 
10 
in writing that she had in fact asked that the meeting 
should be postponed.  That is what this memo is about.  I 
just – it reminds me actually now that I remember that is 
what I had written to her about and asked her to formalise 
the postponement of the meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    I see. 
MR TSOTSI:   This was specifically on the advice of my 
own team that that is what would be required to do.  I 
suppose then that would be addressing what is in the MOU 
there. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Have you shared that memo with the 
investigation team? 
MR TSOTSI:   Oh, their lawyer, so they must have known, I 
mean, they look after this.  
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
No, 
sorry, 
I 
am 
saying 
the 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 121 of 236 
 
Commission’s investigation team. 
MR TSOTSI:   Oh, I do not know, I would not know what it 
is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   I would gladly share it but I would not know 
what it is. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you recall when in relation to the 26 
February you would have sent that memo to the Minister?  
Would that have been soon after the 26 February of would 
10 
that have been just before the meeting of the – just before 
the 11 March or would it have been after the 11 March? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, the possibility is that I would 
have been advised by my team to immediately write to the 
Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   You know, to confirm that she had said I 
should postpone the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   So in all likelihood it could have been on the 
20 
very same day of the meeting, that same Friday when the 
meeting was supposed to have taken place or whatever the 
date was.   
ADV SELEKA SC:    Yes.  So that is the cancellation of the 
meeting of the 29 February and then you mentioned the 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 122 of 236 
 
meeting on the 9 March.  I would like you to tell the 
Chairperson whether the meeting of the 9 March, was it a 
normal scheduled board meeting or not? 
MR TSOTSI:   Can I ask, are we back to my affidavit now 
or will we stay with this one? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We will be going back to your affidavit. 
MR TSOTSI:   Oh, okay.  Chair, the meeting of the 9 t h has 
a particular history. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  
MR TSOTSI:   Now I would have to detail how the meeting 
10 
came about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, do so. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   But before [inaudible – speaking 
simultaneously]  The Chairperson say also, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ja, if he says…[intervenes] 
MR TSOTSI:   To answer your question as to what is the 
nature of the meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am sorry, if there is 
something you would like him to deal with before he does 
20 
so, you can ask him to do it. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair. 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay, so the answer to the question was it – 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 123 of 236 
 
what kind of meeting was it, it …[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Whether it was a scheduled board 
meeting. 
MR TSOTSI:   No, it was not a scheduled board meeting, 
most definitely. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, tell us how it came about now. 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, what happened was that on or 
about the 7 t h or so of March 2015, I received a phone call 
10 
from Dudu Myeni and Dudu Myeni said to me that the 
President, Jacob Zuma, requests an audience with me and 
that audience is to be immediately at his residence in 
Durban.  I recall very distinctly because I was due to travel 
out of the country to – some invitation I had the very next 
day and unfortunately, I had to cancel those plans in order 
to attend this meeting.   
 
I would like to say right from the onset that I 
understood Dudu’s communication with me as that of 
someone who has been sent to ask me to appear at the 
20 
President’s residence for an audience with the President.   
 
I then asked her what is this about?  She then 
declines to discuss it over the phone and said I would hear 
about it when I get there.  Then I – it was fixed for – I am 
assuming the 8 t h, it was a Sunday.  The 8 t h was a Sunday, I 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 124 of 236 
 
am not sure.  It must have been a Sunday. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson, if I may, for your 
convenience and the witness’s convenience, I have copies 
of the calendar for the relevant month for 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh yes, ja.  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I will beg leave to hand them up, not 
as exhibits but simply to facilitate the witness’s testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  When you received Ms Dudu 
Myeni’s call, Mr Tsotsi, at that stage on the 7 t h, there was 
no meeting of the board scheduled for the 9 t h, is that right? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay, so that then – I then made my way to 
Durban on the 8 t h and I arrived at the Presidency.  
CHAIRPERSON:   What time was the meeting schedule for 
on the 8 t h? 
MR TSOTSI:   It was for around – it was in the early 
afternoon, very early afternoon. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Could have been around one o’clock or so. I 
20 
arrived there and I found Ms Myeni there together with her 
son, a young man named Talent. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Talent, ja, something. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, it was her son and Nick, a gentleman 
named Nick Linnell and we then were briefed by Dudu 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 125 of 236 
 
Myeni as to what the purpose of the meeting was. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you arrived were they there – or 
everybody that you have mentioned was already there?  Mr 
Linnell and Dudu Myeni? 
MR TSOTSI:   To my recollection, Chairman, I am saying I 
found Nick there but I see his affidavit, he says that he 
found me there.  So I… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, it does not matter, I just wanted to… 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, anyway …[intervenes] 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, but certainly the other two were there 
when I arrived. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you met and the meeting started? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  Well, she then made the statement to 
the effect that there is a concern about the performance of 
Eskom, 
the 
technical 
performance 
and 
the 
financial 
performance of the company and that there needs to be an 
inquiry into these problems at Eskom and further to that, 
20 
that there are complaints from the war room that Eskom is 
not providing accurate information and data to the war 
room, that information is chopping and changing and in the 
process it is advisable that certain executives within the 
company be suspended in order for this inquiry to proceed 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 126 of 236 
 
unencumbered by their presence. 
 
I was hearing this for the very first time, I was just 
totally shocked and I expressed my concern to her that 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And this was now after the meeting?  
The meeting had started now or was she just still briefing 
all of you ahead of the official start of the meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:   The meeting had not started. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Had not started. 
MR TSOTSI:   She was just briefing us ahead of the – it 
10 
had not started yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   So I was quite taken aback by this and I 
protested about the idea of the suspension of executives 
and that really was my – centre of my concern.  The idea of 
an inquiry was not new to me for the simple reason that I 
myself had at some point in the previous year mentioned it 
to some of my colleagues, the board.  I did not really 
discuss it as a board issue but we were – I think we were 
at some breakaway somewhere, I cannot remember, where 
20 
we were sitting as board members in a social environment 
after the board meeting where I was saying, you know, it 
could be something to think about, that we need perhaps 
an independent assessment of what is actually going on at 
Eskom just so we have, you know, the benefit of someone 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 127 of 236 
 
who is not involved in the business to tell us what it is that 
they think is happening.  
 
So it then says that I was not opposed to the inquiry 
but I was taken aback by the way the whole thing came 
about.  Okay, Nick made some statements, comments as 
well, to the effect that, if I can recall, Chairman, that – in 
fact it is Dudu who mentioned that Nick had supported at 
SAA, as she was then Chairman of – Chairperson of SAA, 
and he is available to do the same thing for Eskom.  So I 
was then at this point anxious that we should have this 
10 
meeting that we were called for just so I can get a sense of 
really where are we, what is going on.   
 
We then went into the meeting, the President joined 
us as we sat there waiting for him and then the meeting 
commenced.  Again Ms Myeni introduced the subject and 
the discussion was primarily led by her as to what are the 
issues that are causing the concern with the performance 
of Eskom.  She seemed to have some knowledge of what 
was transpiring at the company at the time.  Nick also 
came in, in terms of his experience, what he could offer in 
20 
the situation and I was concerned, and I raised the concern 
again of the impact of having to take the drastic action of 
suspending the executives in a situation like this because 
you want them not to impede the process or at least that is 
the rationale. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 128 of 236 
 
The 
President 
was 
not 
very 
engaging 
in 
the 
meeting, he asked a few things, why the call – one of the 
things he asked and hopefully Nick, when he comes here, 
will also be able to assist with the recall.  What I do recall 
was that the President asked if I knew who the people were 
or are who are to be suspended?  So I said well, the 
names of the people were mentioned by Dudu Myeni and 
she mentioned the names of three people.   
At that point she mentioned the name of Tshediso 
Matona the Chief Executive of Eskom, who was here 
10 
yesterday.  She mentioned the name of Dan Marokane.  
Marokane who was the executive responsible for what we 
call Group Capital, that is a new-build programme and the 
name of Matshela Koko who, as I said, was the executive 
for 
Technology 
and 
Engineering 
–Commercial 
and 
engineering, sorry.   Or commercial and technology it was 
called at the time. 
Then I then interceded  at some point to say I would rather 
that we explore some methodology within the HR system of 
Eskom of recusal rather than outright suspension, because 
20 
suspensions have other consequences, and perceptual 
issues about them, the reputational issues about them and 
so on, so I was very concerned that in the light of no 
apparent wrongdoing even at that point on the part of the 
people whose names were mentioned that there could be a 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 129 of 236 
 
reputational problem occurring. 
 
So, the meeting concluded with the President 
saying that they would like me to go and test this proposal 
with the Board as soon as possible and that he would 
inform the Minister about this and that.  So that was really 
the sum total of the meeting that took place at the 
presidency. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well just go back to when the President 
entered the meeting or came to the meeting, now I don’t 
know whether it’s what I read in your affidavit or whether 
10 
it’s what I read in Mr Linnell’s affidavit, but one of you 
seems to say, after he came into the room where the 
meeting was held that he said something to – along the 
lines of, what are we meeting about or something like that 
and then it was Mr Dumiyeni who explained – who then 
explained, is that your recollection or…[intervenes]. 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman that comes from me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because that gives the impression of 
somebody who didn’t know what the meeting was about and 
that’s strange if he had asked Ms Myeni to call you to the 
20 
meeting, the meeting was being held in his residence, if 
he’s like he doesn’t know what the meeting’s about. 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman there is something that I observed 
in the way the President style of communication it was not 
the first time that I noticed this, I noticed this in some 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 130 of 236 
 
other occasion, I think, when I was in his presence, I think, 
in a meeting. He normally goes through some pleasantries 
at the beginning, he’s a very affable person as you might 
know and then in this instance for example, after that, he 
then asked [African language]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, just say that in English as well. 
MR TSOTSI:   Which say, what are we going to be talking 
about today…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think I must have got it from your 
affidavit, ja. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, which I have observed is a manner of 
communication that the President engages in, for whatever 
reason, I don’t know but it’s a style issue, I think, that I’ve 
noticed with him that it would be as if he does not know 
what it is that we are going to be discussing and I would 
want to think that he would not accede to a meeting unless 
he knows what it is that’s going to be talked about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in this case, according to Ms 
Myeni’s call to you, he was the one who was inviting you to 
come and see him. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, now for the rest of the 
discussions, apart from saying, what are we going to talk 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 131 of 236 
 
about today at the beginning and then that was explained 
by Mr Dumiyeni, apart from that, up to the end of the 
meeting what was his contribution to the discussion, as far 
as you are able to remember? 
MR TSOTSI:   As far as I can recall Chair, as I said, he did 
ask, certainly if I know who the people are and as I said 
towards the end of the meeting he intimated that he would 
inform the Minister and he would request that I go and deal 
with this and that or test the Board’s interest in doing this 
exercise.  I don’t recall very much, it’s been such a long 
10 
time, I don’t recall very much else of what he said, I’m 
hoping that the next affidavit or when he comes to present, 
he’ll be able to assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was Chairing this meeting, or was 
there no Chairperson, nobody was Chairing this meeting?  
MR TSOTSI:   I would say – it’s not that, that meeting was 
an obvious Chairperson, you know, the President came in 
and he sat down and he did more listening than anything 
else. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   And Dudu spoke most of the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Most of the time? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   So, I can’t really say there was a specific 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 132 of 236 
 
person Chairing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, would there be a basis, in your 
view, for somebody to say, it was like Ms Myeni, this idea 
of an inquiry was Ms Myeni’s idea in terms of the 
discussion of the people who were in the meeting or did it 
seem like it was from the President it was his idea because 
obviously Mr Dumiyeni knew before the meeting, before 
you came that the idea was that there should be an enquiry 
and the idea was that there should be Executives to be 
suspended.  So she, either had that idea in her own mind 
10 
or she must have discussed the idea with somebody and 
maybe with the President because otherwise how would 
she call you and say the President wants you to come to a 
meeting to discuss these matters if she had not discussed 
them with the President? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman, first of all, I am inclined to think, 
and I don’t know what makes you reach there maybe, that 
the President must have been privy to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   There’s no doubt in my mind really, that he 
20 
must have been, it’s unlikely that he would sit in such a 
meeting not having been privy to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and this idea that he didn’t know what 
the meeting was about is not reconcilable with what Mr 
Dumiyeni told you on the phone? 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 133 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:   No certainly not and also, I think from Ms 
Myeni’s perspective I was very surprised that she didn’t 
know much about what was happening at Eskom and that – 
proposing, making such a radical proposition is something 
that she could have come up with, I don’t believe that – it 
originated with her, definitely, I don’t believe so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Prior to Ms Myeni giving you a call about 
this meeting, had you had any interactions with her in your 
capacity as Chairperson of the Eskom Board? 
MR TSOTSI:   With Ms Myeni? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   No – well let me put it this way, the only 
interactions we had were the exercises that were organised 
by the previous Minister, Minister Gigaba, where on, once 
every sort of quarter or so he would call all the heads of – 
the Chairpersons of the and the Chief Executives of the 
parastatals under his, what have you, that’s the only real 
interaction we’ve had. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR TSOTSI:   But otherwise, no, we didn’t normally have 
20 
any interaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that’s about the meeting at the 
President’s residence. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 134 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you said the meeting was concluded 
on the basis that the President asked you to test this 
proposal of an inquiry with your Board. 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As well as the idea of the suspension of 
Executives. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so that’s – and then he said he 
would inform the Minister? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s how the meeting ended. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, take it from there. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Tsotsi, what did 
you then do with what is asked of you by the President? 
MR TSOTSI:   When we left I had a conversation -  we 
were out of the meeting, I had a conversation – I must 
indicate also, something else that has just come to mind 
now.  Nick, amongst the things he was saying in the 
20 
meeting was that he has the experience of having worked – 
assisted at SAA and that he would be ready to put together 
a motivation for the inquiry and that it will also contain – 
he would also do a resolution for the Board to resolve to 
carry out this inquiry.  So, I then said, look I will try the 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 135 of 236 
 
best I can to see if we can have a meeting as early as the 
following day which was Monday the 9 t h and when I got 
back, Nick had prepared these two documents we’re talking 
about and I then communicated with the company secretary 
to say, look, I’d like to invite Board members to a special 
meeting of the Board to deal with this matter and then he 
then 
circulated 
the 
invitation 
to 
the 
different 
Board 
members for the meeting the following day.  So that’s how 
the meeting of the 9 t h came about. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was so urgent about these two 
10 
proposals that this could not wait for the meeting of the 
11 t h which had already been fixed? 
MR TSOTSI:   Actually Chair, I had thought of using that 
meeting of the 11 t h but then I realised that it will be good 
to at least get the Board – because my intention was, when 
I left the meeting in Durban was to make certain that the 
Minister ’s, views are heard on this matter because this is 
something that will impact on the shareholder.  So, I 
wanted to test to make sure that the Board is onboard with 
this so that we can get the shareholder to come and 
20 
address the Board as soon as possible and possibly on 
that meeting of the 11 t h.  So, I thought, let me fast track 
and let’s meet on the 9 t h to sound the Board out and then 
find out if we can get the Minister to come on the 11 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 136 of 236 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chair.  Mr Tsotsi, a couple 
of things arises from what you are saying because what we 
understood from Mr Matona yesterday was that the meeting 
on the 9 t h with the one agenda item was actually short-
lived because Board members expressed displeasure with 
what had been proposed to them, which is slightly different 
from – maybe you can correct, you having the intention to 
arrange that meeting in order to prepare for the meeting of 
the 
11 t h. 
 
What 
will 
be 
your 
explanation 
to 
the 
Chairperson? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, I think you – he’s a bit ahead of me 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay you can go back sir. 
MR TSOTSI:   Remember that on the 8 t h, this was now the 
Sunday, that is the day that we circulated the documents 
and the invitation to this Board meeting on the 9 t h which is 
the Monday.  Now, what Mr Matona was talking about was 
what he observed had transpired in the meeting itself. Now 
I have not addressed, personally, what I saw in the meeting 
what actually transpired from my perspective, which is 
20 
what I’m doing now to say, Board members came for that 
meeting and they were not – let me just say the overall 
impression Board members had was that they’d been asked 
to do something that is very big and very, shall I 
say…[intervenes]. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 137 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
That 
could 
have 
far-reaching 
consequences. 
MR TSOTSI:   Might have far-reaching consequences 
without really having adequate time to think about it and 
investigate it and equally importantly for them, they need 
to have the shareholders ‘views on this matter. Now, I was 
very sympathetic Chair, in respect of those views and I was 
one of the people who did say that when I thought about 
this after I’d been to that meeting in Durban, I was of the 
view that the first port of call should be a meeting with the 
10 
shareholder to share this because this is something that 
was important for consideration, even by the shareholder.  
So, yes indeed, there was a lot of discomfort about making 
any kind of decision on this matter and I accepted that 
because I thought it was the right thing to do so that 
people have more clarity and get a feel for what this may 
entail given the fact that they only heard about it that very 
morning.  So, that’s then what happened, hence the 
meeting of the 9 t h, was a short-lived meeting like Mr 
Matona said, and I agree with him entirely that, that was 
20 
the sentiment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I want to just go back to the meeting of 
the 8 t h.  Did you, at any stage, query Ms Myeni’s 
involvement in Eskom affairs? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chairman this is a question which I did not 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 138 of 236 
 
address at that meeting but it’s something that preoccupied 
me for some time, to the extent that I actually decided to 
call her, to ask her – well actually what’s going on, where 
is this coming from, how do you come into this picture, 
what’s the deal and Dudu did not avail herself for us to talk 
about it.  So, I just said to myself, well I take the view that 
even though she was the messenger in this instance, it’s 
still material as to how it is because she’s not conducting 
herself as a messenger in the actual meeting itself. Though 
at the time she, purportedly, was speaking on behalf of the 
10 
President to say we should come to the meeting.  Her 
conduct in the meeting was someone who had more of an 
involvement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean based on what you have said in 
terms of – or the discussion at that meeting of the 8 t h it 
seems to me that if it could be said that the initiator of the 
idea for the inquiry and the suspension of the Executives 
was in that meeting, it seems that one would say it’s Ms 
Myeni but maybe she was not but because the President 
comes there and says [African language] what are we 
20 
talking about and she is briefed by Ms Myeni, she’s the one 
who called you the previous day, she’s the one who briefs 
you when you arrive and she is the one who does most of 
the talking throughout the meeting from what you have told 
me. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 139 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, that logical sequence does make a lot 
of sense Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   I mean there’s a lot of credence in what 
you’re saying because just analysing it that way, leads one 
to the conclusion that she’s the architect of this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Though I still do not believe that she is in 
my own…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well it might be somebody outside the 
10 
meeting, it might have been somebody who was not in that 
meeting. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s one possibility another is that the 
initiator was inside that meeting and that she was the 
initiator, another theory might be, it was the President.  Of 
course, it would just be strange that if he initiated the idea 
and he called the meeting that he should come to the 
meeting and say, what are we talking about, what is this 
meeting about. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So – ja, okay. 
MR TSOTSI:  No, I’m with you there.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi you 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 140 of 236 
 
relate at that meeting, in your affidavit on page 12 and 
page 13 of the affidavit, I could refer you to the paragraph 
but the purposes of the wording that the DCJ, I mean the 
Chairperson is postulating there.  Page 13 paragraph 12.8. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If you could read that first line. 
MR TSOTSI:   “After some pleasantries, the President  
enquired what was up for discussion, which I 
translated from Zulu, whereupon Ms Myeni began by 
saying that the performance of Eskom financial and 
10 
technically is deteriorating to the extent that there 
is a serious concern that the company could fail to 
meet its obligations to supply electricity to the 
nation”. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   May I just stop you there.  I mean is 
that – that enquiry by the President that you say it is an 
enquiry what was up for discussion, I mean, in your 
assessment of your further engagement in the meeting, I 
know you tried to explain that he’s mannerism – is that a 
rhetorical question or is it a question to find information? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   My assessment is – it’s not a rhetorical 
question, I mean the President knew what the discussion 
was about. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So rhetorical, I mean, it’s not a 
question that requires an answer, I know what the answer 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 141 of 236 
 
is. 
MR TSOTSI:   Oh, from that perspective yes, I hear you 
okay, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, why would he ask a rhetorical 
question at the start of that meeting, why would he ask a 
rhetorical question?  He’s asking what is the meeting about 
or what are we going to be discussing, now that’s – 
anybody who asks that question at the beginning of the 
meeting wants to know what the agenda is or what the 
issues are. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, that is why I was saying that, I did not 
believe that the President did not know what was to be 
discussed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that’s one thing, whether you 
believe him or not but certainly I would think that he wants 
those that hear his question to tell him what the meeting’s 
about because otherwise why is he asking, what are we 
going to be talking about here?   
MR TSOTSI:   I can’t say. I can’t really say Chair, because 
as I said that is the way I’ve observed his manner of 
20 
dealing with situations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean, you can’t have a situation where 
a meeting takes place in your residence, obviously this 
meeting takes place with your blessing it involves people 
that don’t live in your residence, they come to your 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 142 of 236 
 
residence.  So before you gave the blessing, you must 
know what the meeting’s about, either you called the 
meeting or somebody made the request, they made the 
request to you and you approved and you would have 
wanted to find out, why do you want a meeting in my place, 
in my residence and you would have been told and you 
must have been satisfied that whatever needed to be 
discussed was something that, you know, justified having 
the meeting in your residence at the time it speaks for. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I hear what you’re saying.  If I put 
10 
myself in the President’s shoes, maybe if you came along 
and asked me, did I know about what was to be discussed, 
I turn around and say, well I asked what the discussion was 
about, so I did not know.  I don’t know, I’m just playing it 
back in my mind to say, maybe that could be the approach, 
I don’t know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well maybe you should have responded 
and said, but Mr President, Ms Myeni told me that you 
wanted to see me, so I expect that you know what you 
wanted to talk to me about. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I hear you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Mr Tsotsi, given what 
we’ve read from the memorandum of incorporation this 
morning and what you would have known about the position 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 143 of 236 
 
of the Board, that the management and control of the 
company vests in the Board, how did you find the 
President’s instruction to you, to go test this with the 
Board, that there should be an inquiry, that three people -
three Executives should be suspended, how did that sit 
with you? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair I was, as I said very uncomfortable 
with the idea of suspending the Executives and secondly I 
felt that it’s one thing for me to listen to what the President 
has to say in this regard but it’s another for me to exercise 
10 
my fiduciary duty as a Board – as a Director of the 
company and that’s exactly what I elected to do.  I decided 
that this matter has got to past the test of reason by the 
Board and if the Board had decided flat out that, we’re not 
going to have anything to do with this, that’s the end of the 
story, that would have been the end of the story because 
that’s where my fiduciary duties reside, irrespective of 
what someone else, including the President might have 
asked, to be done. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I’m sorry Mr Seleka and Mr Tsotsi, that 
20 
I’m kind of taking you back to this meeting on the 8 t h, 
actually in your affidavit Mr Tsotsi, paragraph 12.10 – well 
12.9 you say, Ms Myeni said – pointed to discussions that 
she said were going on in the war room on the company’s  
poor performance and said that even the war room was 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 144 of 236 
 
very dissatisfied with the company’s performance, at that 
time you obviously knew what the war room was? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you know the people who were 
involved in the war room? 
MR TSOTSI:   From our Executives, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and other people, other than from 
the Executives.  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I did, most of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you know whether Ms Myeni was one 
10 
of the people who were part of the war room? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She was not? 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you see, she seems to – from what 
you say here, she seems to know what discussions were 
going on in the war room, that’s what you say, she said at 
the meeting, 12.9, she pointed to the discussion that are 
going on, on the company poor performance saying that 
even the War Room is very dissatisfied with its performance.  
20 
Then 12.10: 
“She then arrived at the conclusion that there 
needs to be an external inquiry into the 
performance of the company.” 
 
That line suggests that the idea of an inquiry came to 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 145 of 236 
 
– came from her in terms of what she said at the meeting.  Is 
that – am I right? 
MR TSOTSI:  Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Am I right? 
MR TSOTSI:  Expels the idea. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja am I right to say what you say here 
means that what you heard from her is that she is the one 
who concluded that there should be an external inquiry. 
MR TSOTSI:  She drew that conclusion yes. 
Yes.  Yes.  So that looks like she initiated this idea of an 
10 
inquiry that she was now presenting at the meeting on the 
8t h.  Am I right? 
MR TSOTSI:  Chairperson – yes.  She presented the idea I 
am not exactly certain whether she – well maybe I do not 
understand quite the – your interpretation of initiating. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me assist you.   
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And again, it is what you have written here 
and you must tell me if I am misunderstanding what you say 
here.  You are relating here what Mr Myeni said at the 
20 
meeting on the 8t h okay? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say after the President had enquired 
what was up for discussion Ms Myeni began by saying that 
the performance of Eskom financially and technically was 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 146 of 236 
 
deteriorating to the extent that there was a serious concern 
that the company could fail to meet its obligations to supply 
electricity to the nation.  12.9 you then continue and say: 
“She pointed to the discussions that were 
going on in the War Room on the company’s 
poor performance saying that even the War 
Room was dissatisfied with the company’s 
performance.” 
12.10 you then say: 
“She then arrived at the conclusion that there 
10 
needs to be an external inquiry into the 
performance of the company.  She then 
proposed that three executives be suspended 
to make sure they do not impede this 
inquiry.” 
 
So I am saying that what you are telling the reader of 
your affidavit is that she said I looked at the discussions that 
were going on in the War Room.  I looked at the 
dissatisfaction of the War Room with the performance of the 
company and I concluded what is needed is an external 
20 
inquiry.  So if that is what she said I am saying she 
presented to the meeting the idea of an external inquiry as 
her idea. 
MR TSOTSI:  I hear you Chair and... 
CHAIRPERSON:  If what you say is correct that is how I 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 147 of 236 
 
interpret it.  Is that the same how you understood the 
position or [00:03:24] [Mr Tsotsi talking over Chair] 
MR TSOTSI:  My interpretation Chair is the following.  Whilst 
Ms Myeni is not the architect of this idea. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  She is now the exponent of the idea. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exponent ja of the idea. 
MR TSOTSI:  And she is communicating the idea which has 
been given… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja to her. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  To her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  So from that perspective. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  She can be seen to be the person who initiated 
the proposals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  After all we have not heard from the original 
architect of this in my view. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Of course, from the paragraphs that I 
20 
have read and you might be dealing with that elsewhere you 
have not said about any – you have not said anything about 
anybody except what she is telling you. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At this meeting.  Okay no I just wanted to 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 148 of 236 
 
go back to that point because earlier on I talked about who 
the initiator was. 
MR TSOTSI:  yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then I picked this up.  Ja. Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Tsotsi quickly still 
on that meeting and you have seen Mr Nicholas Linnell’s 
affidavit which you have referred to earlier.  It is also 
contained in your bundle.  It is on the relevant pages I want 
to refer you to. It is on the first bundle – the bigger one page 
148 and 149.  Okay.  Okay now as you turn there because Mr 
10 
Linnell places another person in that meeting one called 
Jabu and he further explains later Maswanganyi.  So Chair 
from paragraph 14.  Could you tell the Chairperson whether 
you have any recollection of that person because I did not 
hear you mention him. 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair I have – I saw this and I have been 
wracking my brain as to why it is that I do not recall that 
Jabu was at this meeting.  Because I know Jabu.  I would 
have known if I walked in here obviously, I would know him.  
But for some reason… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which Jabu are they talking about do you 
know? 
MR TSOTSI:  Maswanganyi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Oh you know him? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I know him yes. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 149 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he was not in the meeting or you are 
not sure? 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if you know him you would be sure? 
MR TSOTSI:  I do not recall seeing him in the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  For some strange reason I just do not recall.  
When I saw this from Nicks affidavit I was taken aback and I 
would have – I would certainly have – have noticed him.  I do 
not recall.  I do not even know whether he had anything to 
10 
say according to Nick.  I do not know.  I have not scrutinised 
the affidavit just now but I do not recall that he was actually 
in the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja because if you look at paragraph – on 
page 149 paragraph 15. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Linnell writes: 
“I attended a meeting in Durban on Sunday 8 
March 2015.” 
20 
 
So I presume that is the meeting you were referring 
to in the President’s residence? 
“Yes when I arrived at the President’s Mr 
Tsotsi and Ms Dudu Myeni were there.  In 
attendance was also Ms Myeni’s son and 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 150 of 236 
 
another person introduced as Jabu.  At that 
time I knew nothing about Jabu’s role at 
large.  While Ms Myeni’s son played no 
active role in the meeting Jabu provided 
information 
about 
the 
state 
of 
Eskom 
including 
allegations 
of 
wrongdoing 
and 
reasons for business failure some of which 
was in the public domain.” 
And he goes on to say: 
“To the best of my recollection Jabu had a 
10 
number of documents that dealt with alleged 
events at Eskom.   These were largely from 
unidentified sources and unverified content.  
These were things that an investigation 
would identify and where background in 
context but in part some of the allegations 
did 
provide 
some 
value 
in 
scoping 
an 
approach to the investigation.” 
 
So he seems not to have been a passive person in 
that meeting. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  Quite.  Chair I can – looking at this I cannot – 
it just mystifies me that I do not remember his involvement in 
the meeting.  You know there could have been a situation 
where he was not in the meeting with the President.  He 
might have been in the meeting we had with Dudu – the 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 151 of 236 
 
briefing meeting outside.  So I do not know what – which of 
these two meetings Nick is referring to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you would remember that – that as 
well. 
MR TSOTSI:  That I do not remember either. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you saw him at the President’s residence 
that day whether at the pre-meeting briefing or at the 
meeting you would remember that he… 
MR TSOTSI:  I would remember yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That he – if it is somebody that you know 
10 
quite well. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes.  That is what vexes me I just do not 
understand why.   I do not.  Especially if he happened to 
have documents from Eskom.  I mean I would have been 
very curious to find out how he got hold of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  But certainly I just do not remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja.  Anyway, then the following 
paragraphs Mr Linnell gives certain details about how he 
20 
came to know that a gentleman called Jabu was Jabu 
Maswanganyi. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Paragraph 18.  Then he specifies again 
in paragraph 18.2.  Then he goes on to paragraph 19 to say: 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 152 of 236 
 
“That the group at the meeting referred to 
above discussed their intended inquiry.  How 
it would take place and what it would seek to 
achieve.  After a period, we – we joined the 
President sorry – after a period we joined the 
President.  The President was clearly familiar 
with the purpose of the meeting and we 
provided a summary of what was proposed 
arising from the earlier discussions referred 
to above.  These included a number of key 
10 
principles.” 
 
And then he sets them out.  You see that? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Well how do you reconcile that statement 
that Mr Nick Linnell says the President was clearly familiar.  
Now you say the President entered and enquired what was – 
what was up for discussion. 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair there is no reconciliation.  I said the 
same thing that I am certain that the President knew what 
was to be discussed. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I see.   
MR TSOTSI:  But… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well what you say the President said 
namely what was up for discussion is not indicative of 
somebody who knew what the meeting was about.  That of 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 153 of 236 
 
course might not mean that he did not know.  It just depends 
what explanation he would give for making a statement that 
suggested he did not know what the meeting was about if 
indeed he were to say no I knew what the meeting was 
about.  And still admit that he made the statement and 
maybe there would be an explanation.  But you – you say 
your belief was that he knew what the meeting was about.  Is 
that right? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  That is my belief. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he made the statement or put this 
question which suggested that he did not know what the 
meeting was about which was strange. 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well I see that Mr Linnell in the 
affidavit Mr Linnell actually indicates that Ms Myeni was at 
the Presidency in Pretoria on the 6 t h.  So – and that is where 
they met – well Mr Linnell it seems was invited by Ms Myeni 
to the President – to come to the Presidency on the 6t h and 
20 
he travelled to Pretoria.  And he was called by Ms Myeni and 
they had a prior working relationship at SAA.  She says – he 
says on paragraph 5: 
“I was contacted on the 6 March 2015 by Ms 
Dudu Myeni and asked to travel the same 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 154 of 236 
 
day to Pretoria to attend an urgent meeting 
with the President.” 
 
That is at page 148.  Ja and then she says on 
paragraph 6. 
“At that time I was well known to Ms Myeni 
who had been a client of mine from time to 
time over a number of years on various 
projects in her representative capacity.  At 
this time I was engaged in a merger project.” 
 
Paragraph 7. 
10 
“On arrival at the Presidency sometime after 
midday that is on the 6t h I met with Ms 
Myeni.  No-one else attended the meeting.”  
 
Paragraph 8. 
“While the SAA matter might also have been 
discussed in the context of this deposition 
Ms Myeni informed me that the President was 
concerned about the state of Eskom and 
wanted an in-depth investigation into its 
affairs. 
 
She 
had 
recommended 
to 
the 
20 
President that I would be suitable for that 
role.” 
 
9. 
“Ms Myeni proceeded to brief me on the 
background for an inquiry.  Included in this 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 155 of 236 
 
discussion 
was 
reference 
to 
some 
documentation that Ms Myeni had.  The 
President did not join that meeting as I 
understood he was unexpectedly otherwise 
engaged.” 
 
11. 
“To the best of my recollection it was then 
agreed that I would need to travel to Durban 
on Sunday the 8 March to meet with the 
President 
to 
complete 
this 
briefing 
and 
10 
mandate.” 
 
So – so Ms Dudu Myeni was according to this at the 
Presidency in Pretoria on the 6 t h and was concerned with 
Eskom matters calling Mr Linnell to come to Pretoria for a 
meeting with the President same day.  So it means saying 
leave now come and be here this afternoon or something like 
that.  And in connection with Eskom matters.  Then there 
was some discussion.  If Mr Linnell’s evidence is correct 
there had been prior discussion between Ms Myeni and the 
President about Eskom matters where the President had 
20 
expressed some unhappiness about certain matters relating 
to Eskom.  So it is strange that if the President has issues 
he is discussing them with the Chairperson of SAA of the SA 
Board.  He is not discussing them with the Chairperson of 
the Eskom Board is it not? 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 156 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:  Indeed Chair it is – it is strange. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And is the Chairperson of the SAA Board 
who is busy coordinating a meeting to discuss Eskom issues 
with various people and the President.  He calls Mr Linnell 
on the 7t h he calls you and on the 8 t h you all meet in Durban 
at the President’s residence.  And at the meeting she is one 
doing the talking most of the time. 
MR TSOTSI:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And yet you are the Chairperson of the 
Eskom Board but she seems to be you know discussing 
10 
these and making all arrangements, exchanging views with 
the President about what should happen at Eskom.   
MR TSOTSI:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Mr Tsotsi who headed the War Room? 
MR TSOTSI:  The War Room was headed by the then Deputy 
President who was the current President.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  So did he at any stage call you to raise 
20 
concerns of the War Room with you? 
MR TSOTSI:  No he did not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were there some – would the Minister of 
Public Enterprises have been part of the War Room? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes definitely. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 157 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. But the Minister as at the 7t h March 
when you got this call from Ms Dudu Myeni had never 
spoken to you about any inquiry at Eskom or had she? 
MR TSOTSI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She had never spoken to you about any 
inquiry at Eskom? 
MR TSOTSI:  Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.  Just to complete the 
paragraphs that the Chairperson… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  You said there was Mr Talent 
and Myeni at the meeting of the 8t h.  Did he make any 
contribution to the meeting?  Do you know why his presence 
was necessary at that meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:  I do not know why he was – he was at the 
meeting.  No he did not make any contributions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He did not make any contribution? 
MR TSOTSI:  No. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  To complete 
those paragraphs the Chairperson was reading out to you Mr 
Tsotsi paragraph 14 says: 
“During the following day Saturday 7 March 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 158 of 236 
 
Mr – 2015 it would be – Mr Tsotsi either 
called me or I was provided his contact 
number but I requested from him company 
documents 
and 
policies 
which 
will 
be 
required for proposing the inquiry and its 
terms.  During that exchange it was evident 
he would also be at the meeting in Durban on 
Saturday 8 March 2015.” 
 
Your comment on that Mr Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:  I think Nick must have gotten my number from 
10 
Dudu because I did not have a number of his.  And I do not 
know about this business of – I do not recall him asking me 
for documents nor would I have given him in any case.  So I 
am not sure where he is going with the idea that – I do not 
recall him asking me for documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you recall that – do you recall whether 
when you met him at the President’s residence in Durban on 
the 8t h you were meeting somebody with whom you had 
discussions before or not?  Or you were meeting somebody 
that you really did not know? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  No as far as I was concerned I was meeting 
him for the first time.  I do not recall having had any 
discussions with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:  I do not recall him even calling me because I 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 159 of 236 
 
did not have his number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Well I see that he also says 
that Mr Talent Myeni did not play any active role in 
paragraph 16. He says: 
“While Ms Myeni’s son played no active role 
in the meeting Jabu provided information 
about the state of Eskom bla, bla, bla.” 
 
So I think the two of you are agreed that Mr Talent 
Myeni played no active role in the meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Seleka. 
MR TSOTSI:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Tsotsi Mr Linnell has 
provided also a statement to the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please raise your voice Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Has provided also a statement to the 
Parliamentary Portfolio Committee along the lines of his 
affidavit that statement is also contained in this bundle.  It is 
on page 123.  Yes.  And there is just two paragraphs I want – 
I want to refer you to on page 125.  Oh page 125. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  125? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  125 yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So he says in paragraph 7. 
“The President listened to these views and 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 160 of 236 
 
asked one or two questions then he agreed.  
He undertook to speak with the Minister and 
Mr Tsotsi would speak with the Board.” 
 
That is in regard to what had been proposed the 
inquiry and the suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I see that it does appear that what Mr 
Linnell says about the role played by the President at the 
meeting seems to be consistent with your version.  On your 
version there is not much that he said at the meeting.  He 
listened most of the time but he did ask you whether you 
10 
knew the executives who were to be suspended.  And at the 
end of the meeting he asked you to test this proposal of an 
inquiry with your Board and you would talk to the Minister. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – and Mr Linnell says in paragraph 7 
the statement. 
“The President listened to these views and 
asked one or two questions then he agreed.” 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  And your… 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long – I am sorry.  How long did you – 
do you think that meeting lasted at the President’s residence 
in Durban? 
MR TSOTSI:  The actual meeting with the President could 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 161 of 236 
 
have been about forty minutes or so.   
CHAIRPERSON:  About forty minutes? 
MR TSOTSI:  Something like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.   
MR TSOTSI:  Not more than an hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And most of the time was taken by 
Ms Myeni doing the talking. 
MR TSOTSI:  Ms Myeni – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chair.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It must have been strange to be in that 
meeting as Chairperson of the Eskom Board.  You sitting 
here with the – with people and the President but the person 
who was doing the talking – most of the talking about your – 
the company which you chair is somebody else and like you 
know saying well this is what – that needs to be done and so 
like she knows what needs to be done and she needs to – to 
just sell the idea to you to say, here is an idea. 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair I was in a state of semi-shock most of 
the time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Because I just could not believe what I was 
hearing.  So I – I was just flabbergasted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:  To say the least. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 162 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  So do you also 
recall Mr Tsotsi the President ending or concluding the 
meeting by saying he will speak to the Minister? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes certainly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is correct. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So then Mr Linnell says:  
“As a matter of urge – as the matter was 
10 
urgent, I would travel to Johannesburg the 
following day and be available to the Board 
as and when required.” 
 
Now we know the following day would have been the 
Monday 9 March 2015. 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you would have then Mr Tsotsi called 
a meeting of the 9 March after this meeting of the 8t h? 
MR TSOTSI:  Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Now have you ever had to call a meeting 
20 
at such short notice before? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes certainly the first time Chair. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So Mr Linnell then says: 
“Overnight I drafted the proposed Board 
Memorandum proposed resolutions and an – 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 163 of 236 
 
a memoire on suspensions.  I forwarded 
these to Mr Tsotsi attached.  I assume this 
was subsequently circulated to the Board.  
This included …” 
 
And he gives the details there.  Now can you recall 
him forwarding all that to you Mr Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I do recall Chair which is how I got to 
forward the documents to the Secretariat for them to 
circulate to the Board Members. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  He has attached those to his 
10 
affidavit and that is on page 165 of the bundle before you – 
we are busy with.  See whether you recognise this email? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 155? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  160 I beg your pardon Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Page 160 Mr Tsotsi.  It is an email from 
Mr Nick Linnell sent on Sunday 8 March 2015 at 6:37 pm.  It 
is sent to an email ztsotsi@liquifier.biz.  The subject line is 
The 
Board 
Memorandum 
and 
Resolutions. Attachments 
Board Memorandum and Resolutions. 
20 
“I 
recall 
this 
email 
being 
referred 
to 
yesterday to Mr Matona.” 
 
Do you recognise the email? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Is this then what Mr Linnell would have 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 164 of 236 
 
sent to you? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
Now 
that 
email 
address 
Ztsotsi@liquifier.biz is that an Eskom email address? 
MR TSOTSI:  No, no this is not an Eskom email address. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Ja can you explain to the Chairperson if 
it is not Eskom? 
MR TSOTSI:  No that was my own private email address not 
Eskom’s. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Does anything turn on the fact that an 
10 
Eskom email address was not used by your private? 
MR TSOTSI:  I did not get the beginning of your question. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Does anything turn on the fact that 
Eskom 
in 
their 
address 
was 
used 
to 
forward 
these 
documents about your own private email address. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there anything of that? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, I did not make anything of it.  What was 
important for me was the formal communication that I needed 
to make to the board.  That is what was important to me. At 
this point in time, Nick was merely telling what he is thinking 
20 
he ought to do.   
 
So there was no significance in using Eskom email here 
because he was really addressing himself to me and you 
know, I then would have escalated to the communication to 
Eskom once I was satisfied that that is what we are going to 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 165 of 236 
 
do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Mr Tsotsi.  Now the following 
pages, page 162.  You may turn there.  And page 164.  
Starting with page 162.  I presume that is the memorandum 
referred to in Mr Linnell’s email to you.  Do you see that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And on page 164, it is a resolution. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   This would have also been a document 
10 
attached to Ms Myeni’s... 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So these documents, you then 
circulate... or shall I ask you rather?  You said earlier you 
forwarded then to the company secretary.  Correct/ 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct, yes.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the company secretary at the time, 
is who? 
MR TSOTSI:   It is Phukubje Malesela.  Malesela Phukubje. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And your request to him is to call for the 
20 
meeting on the 9 t h of March? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   2015.  So when would you have because 
Mr Linnell’s email to you is 06:37 p.m.  When in time or date 
would you have forwarded it, the information to Mr Phukubje 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 166 of 236 
 
to call the board meeting on the 9 t h of March? 
MR TSOTSI:   It would have been – maybe there is a receipt 
of this docket. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I beg your pardon? 
MR TSOTSI:   I would have been Chair on - upon receipt of 
these documents.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that will be on the same date, 
8 March?  On Sunday, 8 March? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, same day.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   So take us into the meeting of the 
10 
9t h of March.  Well, you have and the meeting was short-
lived, or rather, let us expedite the process.  The meeting is 
short-lived, the resolution is that you as the board wanted to 
meet with the minister.    
MR TSOTSI:   Correct? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is that what was decided? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was the meeting on the 11 t h a scheduled 
board meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:   It was a rescheduling of the meeting of the 
20 
26t h of March.  So in that sense ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   26 February? 
MR TSOTSI:   The 26t h of February, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay.  Now in that meeting of the 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 167 of 236 
 
11t h of March or before then.  If it is rescheduled.  So you 
were in the board meeting resolving to have the minister 
invited to the meeting.  Do you make contact with the 
minister for that purpose? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I made contact with the minister.  
Whether it was on the 9t h or the 10t h, I cannot exactly recall 
but I made contact. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Regarding the meeting on the 11 t h? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, regarding the meeting of the 11t h. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And did the minister... ja, the minister.  
10 
Was the minister ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   Lynne Brown. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was the... why did the board wanted the 
minister want to meet with the minister before they could 
consider this proposal of an inquiry? 
MR TSOTSI:   The reason Chair was that the board surmised 
that the action that are being contemplated in this resolution 
would have had far reaching effects on the organisation and 
would impact on the shareholder’s role in different ways.  
20 
Primarily 
because 
the 
War 
Room 
was 
a 
government 
initiative.   
 
So in order for us to not to conflict with the work of the 
War Room, we knew to be certain that the shareholder will 
support us doing what – not quite essentially what the War 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 168 of 236 
 
Room was doing. 
 
But certainly not of contradicting or undermining the 
work of the War Room but that, this was a separate but 
terrible exercise that Eskom wanted to undertake.   
 
So there were those sort of, if you like, policy issues.  If 
I may use that word.  Or let me rather, protocol issues which 
we needed to... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr 
Tsotsi, it has just been drawn to my attention.  If you please 
quickly in the smaller bundle, page 1086.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ten...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   86. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  The smaller bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The smaller bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Eskom Bundle 07.B. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  1086. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On that page is an email Mr Tsotsi from 
Malesela Phukubje. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   On Sunday, 8 March 2015 one minutes 
after eight, 20:01.  The email is addressed to a number of 
people.  There you are CC’d in it. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The subject is:  Board to Memorandum 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 169 of 236 
 
and Resolutions, 9 March 20156.  You are familiar with this 
email? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I am familiar with the email. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It says: 
“Good evening, board members.  The shareholder 
has, seeing that you are a person of the board, 
requested that we convene an urgent board meeting 
to consider and make a decision on the issues 
contained in the attached documents.   
Urgent meetings are catered for under Clause 19.4 
10 
of the Eskom’s Memorandum of Incorporation.  It is 
proposed that the meeting commence at 10:00 in the 
boardroom at Megawatt Park.   
Board members who are unable to attend in person, 
may participate by either video or telephone.   
Kindly revert with an indication of your availability 
for purposes of confirming whether there is a 
quorum or not.” 
 
So is this the email that would have been sent out in 
your instructions to the members? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   When you call or made contact with the 
minister, is it by telephone in regard to now the meeting of 
the 11t h? 
MR TSOTSI:   It is probably... I think it would have been a 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 170 of 236 
 
letter, I think.  That would have been the cause of action, we 
want the minister come to the meeting.  We would ordinarily 
write.  I would have – I cannot exactly remember but that 
would have been the position. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  And to your recollection, was the 
minister surprised by the invite or was she expecting the 
invite? 
MR TSOTSI:   I think the minister was expecting the invite.  
The reason I say so Chair is because, when the minister was 
leaving the meeting, I accompanied her out of the billing as I 
10 
ordinarily do.   
 
And she said to me:  Look, I know that this is a difficult 
exercise that you people are embarking upon and I will be 
available to you right through the day should you need to 
talk to me on this subject.   
 
So I think the minister has decided - because she knew 
this was coming – decided to avail herself just so that she is 
available.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  So when the minister arrives at the 
meeting on the 11t h of March 2015, what does she and the 
20 
board talk about? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, there are two things that I recall that 
the minister herself would wanted to talk about with the 
board.  She took the opportunity to raise them.  And I 
remember very well, one of them was the security of board 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 171 of 236 
 
meetings.   
 
Look, as our board meetings were being typed and so 
she made some queries around this.  I cannot remember 
exactly what else but the minister would tell us.  But there 
was one or two other issues that she dealt with before going 
into this particular matter.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Did the board or was the agenda of the 
meeting of the 11t h amended to include the latest of the 
issues the board wanted to discuss with the minister, given 
that the meeting of the 11t h had to be meant to have discuss 
10 
matters 
that 
should 
have 
been 
discussed 
on 
the 
26t h of February? 
 
In other words, did you then intend at that meeting of 
the 11t h would deal with both the issues that you needed to 
deal with the minister and the issues that you had intended 
to deal with in any event before there was this meeting of 
the 8t h, for instance? 
 
Or did the board just say let us start with issues that 
require the minister’s presence and then they discussed that 
and later they postponed the other issues to another date? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, what happened then – what was trying 
for that the board meeting to discuss the company matters 
would be the first order of the day from the morning and we 
anticipated that we could complete Eskom’s business by the 
time the minister arrives.   
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 172 of 236 
 
 
So we planned to have the minister come into the 
meeting close to lunch time.  And I if I recall well, 
substantive issues were dealt with before the minister 
arrived.  And of course, it is an in-committee meeting that 
the board had with the minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi, we 
have been provided with the minutes of that board meeting.  
If this will assist your recollection.  On page 671 of the 
smaller bundle, Eskom Bundle 07.B. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   07...? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, by the way we changed to... ja, 07.B. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Point B. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I may have said point 1 earlier on.  Okay 
so what is the page? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Page 671. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
MR TSOTSI:   The small bundle starts at 900 and something, 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you are right, Mr Tsotsi. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It starts at? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, six something must be the in the other 
– in the bigger bundle.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   In the other, in the first one.   
CHAIRPERSON:   671? 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 173 of 236 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, 671. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m.  So we have on the big bundle. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that is... Mr Tsotsi, let us see if that 
will assist your recollection.  It is the minutes of the Eskom 
board meeting with the Minister of Public Enterprises held on 
the 11t h of March 2015 that the board room is mentioned, 
10:00 is the time.  Stent, strictly confidential.  Present, the 
Chairman is yourself Mr Tsotsi. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And the list of other members there.   
10 
“Mr Matona, Ms Mabuda and Ms Naidoo, Ms Klein, 
Ms Carrim, Mr Naidoo, Mr Pamenski, Ms Molefe and 
Mr Baloy, Dr Ngubane and Mr Xhosa and Mr 
Khumalo.  Also, in attendance is Miss L Brown, the 
Minister of Public Enterprises, Ms M Mokolo, Director 
General DPE (acting) and Mr Phukubje, Company 
Secretary.   
Board In-Committee Session.  After introductions and 
formalities, the minister raised the issue of the 
location of a bugging device which was found in the 
20 
board room at the Eskom Megawatt Park.  
She also noted that the fact that no investigation into 
the matter had been initiated and pointed out that it 
is a very serious matter over which action should 
have been taken. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 174 of 236 
 
The CE responded by explaining that the matter was 
being dealt with and that a number of new procedures 
had been introduced in order to stem the possible 
repetition of a similar matter.   
It was standard procedure that the board room is 
swept for the existence for recording and transmitting 
devices a day before the meeting, as well as the day 
after the meeting.   
He, thereafter, reported that he is still awaiting a 
report by the service providers about the origins and 
10 
the exact nature of the device.   
The minister stated that the matter needed to be 
investigated urgently and that it should be recorded 
as necessary urgency which she is not detecting from 
the actions taken thus far.   
At this point, the CE and the FD... 
That is the Chief Executive Officer and the Financial 
Director.  Correct, Mr Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    
20 
“...were excused from the meeting at 10:34.” 
 
Now you heard Mr Matona yesterday, his recollection 
that it was the minister who asked... well, firstly that the 
managers were said they should be excused.  And he said, 
he sat, he remained behind because he thought he is not 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 175 of 236 
 
part of the managers to be excluded - to be excused from the 
meeting. 
 
And then he said the minister said:  You should also be 
excused.  Does that accord with your recollection? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then you were trying to recall and 
relating to the chairperson what the board and the minister 
discussed on that day.  If you could give us the points or you 
could look into the meeting to assist you in your recollection.  
I see there are certain points made at the bottom of page 
10 
672. 
 
But let us see, if I may just quickly?  The paragraph just 
below where the CE and the FD are excused.  It says: 
“The minister continued and stated that she has no 
right to instruct the board on any matter regarding 
the conduct of Eskom’s business. 
She stated further that meeting is an informal one 
and then proceeded to note a number of negative 
developments.” 
 
Now that statement is a curious one and I would like you 
20 
to explain to the Chairperson why do you think it was made, 
if it was made at all? 
MR TSOTSI:   You are talking about ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That I have no right to instruct the board 
on any matter. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 176 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, I am the understanding the minister to 
say that in accordance with the way she understands her 
relationship with the board, it does not permit her to give the 
board an instruction.   
 
I am not so – I do not know.  I think that is what it 
meant.  I cannot imagine that she would say that without 
trying to emphasise the fact that she does not have the 
authority to instruct the board.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  It is because, if we suppose, prior 
knowledge of something she might have – she might have 
10 
been told the board would engage her on, if her starting 
point was, I have no right to instruct the board.   
MR TSOTSI:   In other words, as a prelude to what she is 
likely to say in relation to say this matter that she is aware 
of? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [No audible reply]  
MR TSOTSI:   It could be.  I cannot really say, Chair.  It 
could be.  It does not give me any specific thinking that that 
could be the case. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Could it be that in your communication 
20 
to her to invite her to this meeting, you would have indicated 
what the board requested her to come and deal with the 
board about? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  Oh, yes certainly.  She knew what the 
meeting was about.  No question. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 177 of 236 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that is why I am saying, the 
statement made there, proposes prior knowledge of what 
was going to be discussed.  You understand what I am trying 
to say? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I understand where you are coming from.  
Yes, definitely.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did the minister discuss the inquiry, the 
establishment of the inquiry with the board? 
MR TSOTSI:   The minister did discuss the establishment of 
an inquiry with the board, yes. 
10 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Did 
the 
minister 
support 
the 
establishment of the inquiry? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, Chair the minister supported the 
establishment of the inquiry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did the minister discuss the suspension 
of the executives with the board? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, the minister did discuss the suspension 
of the executives with the board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Did she support the suspension of the 
executives? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   She supported the suspension of the 
executives.  In fact, more than just that.  She added one 
more executive to the list which ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it the financial director? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 178 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   OH, and that was a name that was not 
included in the names that were discussed at the meeting of 
the 8t h.   
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Did they 
change the position you articulated to the Chairperson, Mr 
Tsotsi and in your affidavit that you were in fact before the 
president and Ms Dudu Myeni opposed to the suspension of 
10 
the executives even though you were amenable to the 
inquiry? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, it did not change my thinking.  I was 
definitely opposed to the suspensions to the extent that, I 
recall I wrote a summary of the discussions in the board 
because there no minutes that have been taken.   
 
I asked one of my staff to make a summary of what was 
being discussed.  And throughout that time, we were making 
reference.   
 
And this was now to circulate to the board members.  
20 
This was – we emphasised the fact that the idea is for these 
board members to step aside.   
 
And in fact, the meeting that followed the minister’s 
meeting was really the crucial meeting in respect of the 
matter of suspensions which I will certainly get into if you 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 179 of 236 
 
will allow me. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, certainly.  Are these board 
meetings recorded? 
MR TSOTSI:   The normal board meetings are recorded, yes.  
But in-committee meetings are not recorded.  That has been 
the practise in the company.  But minutes or notes are 
normally taken by someone who we asked in the meeting to 
take notes because the normal recording infrastructure is not 
available for recording because people are excused from the 
meeting. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Could you tell the Chairperson whether 
the meeting with the minister was recorded? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, I am... that meeting was not recorded 
to the extent of the – when I say recording, we are talking 
about the audio recording. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   A digital recording, yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   A digital recording.  No, it was not.  There 
were just notes which I also say, as I say, I also produced of 
the meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the minutes we have read out from 
20 
would 
have 
been 
produced 
from 
handwritten 
notes 
...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   Absolutely. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   ...of somebody who took the minutes at 
the time? 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 180 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then the meeting, you said it 
commenced before the minister arrived, you had your 
schedules meeting with the board? 
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Was that meeting recorded? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, that meeting was recorded. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The meeting then after the minister had 
left, are you aware that that meeting was also recorded? 
MR TSOTSI:   Hold on.  The meeting after the minister had 
10 
left? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   That would have been the people in the 
governance meeting in the afternoon. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well, I would not know but you were 
saying you could go to a meeting where the suspension of 
the executives was decided upon. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Which meeting was that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay that was the people in governance 
20 
meeting and that was not recorded.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   That was not recorded? 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We have the recording.  As you would 
know, this is a Commission of Inquiry. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 181 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So the Commission has done, in the 
process of its investigation, obtained information.  It has a 
recording of the minutes before the minister arrived. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And a recording of the meeting... sorry, I 
said the minutes.  Of the meeting before the minister arrived 
and of the meeting immediately after the minister arrived. 
MR TSOTSI:   Oh, so there is a recording of the people in 
governance meeting? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Even of that as well.   
MR TSOTSI:   Oh, I was not aware. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now I asked the question - just before I 
go to those audios and I will take you to the transcriptions of 
those audios.  I asked you a question, whether did the 
minister show of support of the inquiry and of the suspension 
of the executives, even as you say adding the fourth 
executive on the list of those to be suspended, changed your 
view that you were opposed to the suspension of the 
executives? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Oh, I understand the question now. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   I did not understand it at the beginning.  You 
are asking me if the meeting with the Minister changed my 
view about whether we should suspend executives or not. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 182 of 236 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   No, it did not change my view in my 
recollection.  All that happened, Chairman, was I insisted 
on some methodology of recusal. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You insisted on…? 
MR TSOTSI:   On some other methodology or some other 
process 
of 
recusal 
of 
the 
executives 
rather 
than 
suspension because I felt suspensions were not a good 
idea. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so that had been view also at the 
10 
meeting of the 8 t h? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the President’s residence. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, ja.   
MR TSOTSI:   And it turns out that there is not – there was 
not the process at Eskom which would ensure that the 
executives do not have the normal access they would have 
to the offices other than precautionary suspension. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why was it thought the continued 
20 
presence of the executives would be problematic or would 
interfere in any way with the inquiry or its investigation?  
What was the factual basis for thinking that they would 
interfere, indeed that they would not be helpful? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, I think the feeling amongst board 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 183 of 236 
 
members was that there is no way of knowing whether in 
fact interference would have happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but is that not a problem?  Based on 
what Mr Matona said yesterday in his evidence, he was 
told that the basis of the suspension was not that there 
was any wrongdoing on his part. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So why was it thought that somebody 
who had not done – who was accepted as not having done 
anything wrong would not cooperate and actually assist 
10 
this investigation or if he remained present? 
MR TSOTSI:   As far as I know, the executives would 
expect to assist with the inquiry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but why would – how could they 
assist if they were suspended? 
MR TSOTSI:   The idea was that they would be subject to 
some interview on specific issues that come out in the 
process of the inquiry.  That was the idea. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But what was the basis for thinking if 
they 
continued 
and 
the 
investigation 
continued 
and 
20 
whenever they are needed to answer anything or handover 
information that they would not cooperate. 
MR TSOTSI:   Well, it is difficult to say, Chair, what was 
living in people’s minds about that but there was a general 
acceptance that it is easier and more justifiable that they 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 184 of 236 
 
not be present at the time of the inquiry so that you do not 
attribute anything that you may find to them or to their 
having interfered.  There is a possibility that – or this is 
what would have been in people’s minds, I would have 
thought, that they could have either prevented access to 
certain information  or they might have interfered with their 
staff in terms of what the staff can and cannot say or that 
the staff would have felt inhibited to express themselves 
about what they know about the business if their bosses 
were there.  This is the kind of thinking I believe must have 
10 
motivated that approach. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, we are at nearly quarter past 
four. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us talk about how long we… 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We [indistinct] 5.13. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m?  Ja, how long, how much more do 
you need to conclude Mr Tsotsi’s evidence? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
 
Thank 
you, 
Chairperson, 
I 
…[intervenes] 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I know that the issue of the meeting, the 
activities of the 11 t h and subsequently there is a lot to be 
…[intervenes] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To cover. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That I accept.   
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 185 of 236 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But how long was your estimate? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Chair, we could take a five 
minute adjournment with your leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And I could make a judgment call. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, that is fine, I take it that, Mr 
Tsotsi, you are still available to continue?  
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes and all legal representatives, I 
10 
am sure there are no problem?  Yes, okay, alright.  We will 
take 
an 
adjournment, 
let 
us 
make 
it 
15 
minutes 
adjournment. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And depending on what you say we 
could continue from half past four.  Maybe if we take an 
hour we should finished but you will reflect and you will tell 
me when you come back. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, I will consider my notes, 
Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And indicate to the Chairperson before 
we resume. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is fine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that the Chairperson knows prior to 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 186 of 236 
 
that on the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is fine.  We will adjourn then 
and resume at half past four. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:    We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s get going. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.  Mr Tsotsi we 
were on the meeting of the 11 t h of March 2015, the Minister 
10 
has left and you were saying you could take us into the 
meeting after the Minister has left.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Just to conclude on the meeting between 
the Board and the Minister, what were the decisions taken 
in that meeting, if there were any decisions? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair the decisions ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Or conclusions. 
MR TSOTSI:   The decision pertaining to the matter at 
hand were that SMS does support the inquiry to proceed 
and that we should seek an independent company or 
20 
contractor and that she agrees with the suspension of the 
executives concerned. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And she added one more name? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes she mentioned, she also added the 
name of the FD. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 187 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   She mentioned the name of the FD. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now in the discussion with the Minister 
or between or from the 8 t h to the commencement of that 
meeting between the Board and the Minister, had you had 
any discussion with the Minister as Chairperson of the 
Board?  In other words, prior to her arriving at the meeting 
on the 11 t h, between the meeting in Durban and the 
commencement of the meeting on the 11 t h had you had any 
discussion with the Minister? 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair no I did not have any discussion with 
the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, did you write anything to her? 
MR TSOTSI:   Oh, okay in terms of requesting her to come 
we did make a memo to her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Did that memo tell her about this 
proposal 
of 
an 
inquiry 
and 
the 
suspension 
of 
the 
executives and give motivation for the inquiry, and the 
suspension of the executives? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair I know there was talk about the inquiry 
20 
but I can’t recall exactly whether there was mention of the 
suspension of the executives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR TSOTSI:    I don’t really. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in any event the President had 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 188 of 236 
 
indicated that he was going to speak to the Minister, you 
were going to speak to the Board and he was going to 
speak to the Minister?   
MR TSOTSI:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So when the Minister came to the 
meeting did she appear to have a good understanding of 
the proposal and reasons for the proposal 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, to me she definitely appeared to 
10 
understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Everything yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that is fine.  Then you may 
continue in regard to the meeting after that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.   Yes Mr Tsotsi 
you were saying you could take us into that meeting but I 
would like to go ahead of you if I may, because as I said 
the Commission has obtained the audio recordings of that 
meeting, the transcript of that audio is contained in the 
20 
bundle before you.  I believe you have already opened to 
it, you can help me with the page number there at the top 
of the page. 
MR TSOTSI:    It is 692.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   692, thank you Mr Tsotsi. There are – 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 189 of 236 
 
there’s four different recordings the Commission has 
obtained and I am going to focus on two of those 
recordings, I will take you there now, let me just explain to 
you, the one, the first recording in the transcript is the 
meeting 
of 
the 
Board 
before 
the 
Minister 
arrives.  
Chairperson I am going to give the page numbers, which 
can 
be 
written 
down, 
that 
is 
on 
page 
811 
to 
8 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I am sorry, you said we must go to 
692 and I went there, are you still there? 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I am there Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay the page numbers you have 
given us are for what?  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are the – there’s four meetings, 
recordings in respect of four meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So I am going to give you the bigger 
picture before I go into the detail. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is fine, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So you will have the first meeting 
20 
without the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   The transcript thereof is on page 811. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   If you jot it down Chairperson for 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 190 of 236 
 
present purposes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But do I need to note that down now 
because aren’t you going to give it to me when we go there 
anyway? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, because I want to confine myself 
only to two of those recordings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, yes, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So it is 811 to 865 
CHAIRPERSON:   811 to 865, okay that is the first 
...[intervenes]   
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the first meeting before the 
Minister arrives. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay that is the meeting of the Board 
without the Minister. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Without the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then the Minister arrives and we don’t 
have a recording of that as Mr Tsotsi has correctly 
indicated but then there is a recording of the meeting after 
the Minister has left and the transcription of that is on 
20 
page 866 to 906. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What are the page numbers again, 8? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   866 to 906, nine zero six. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, that first meeting that the 
recording is 811 to what? 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 191 of 236 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   865. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so this one is 866 to? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   906.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
906, 
that 
is 
now 
the 
recording 
...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   After the Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...of the Board meeting after the Minster. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then there is a board meeting where 
10 
Mr Nic Linnell is introduced, the transcription of that is on 
page 692 to 787. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 692? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   692 to 787. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is – these are all on the same 
day? 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
This 
is 
all 
on 
the 
same 
day 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  All on the same day. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, but they are regarded as 
separate meetings? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  They are indeed separate meetings, 
one after other. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, so this last one is the meeting of 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 192 of 236 
 
the Board ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:  With Mr Nick Linnell.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Where Mr Linnell is introduced? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Is introduced. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   And then the last one Mr Tsotsi 
referred to as the P & G meeting is page 787 to 808. 
CHAIRPERSON:   787 to 808.   What meeting is that? 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That’s P & G meeting, People & 
Governance committee.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So I want to start at the meeting after 
the Minister which is on page 866. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:    I have arranged with the IT technician 
to assist us in that regard Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Your voice. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I have arranged with the IT technician 
to assist us in that regard Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Tsotsi the audio will be played and 
during the course of that I would ask you to identify to the 
Chairperson the speaker at each given moment.  Audio clip 
911. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the transcript starting at page 866 is 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 193 of 236 
 
a transcript of the recording that we are going to listen to 
now? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV 
SELEKA 
SC: 
 
Chairperson 
my 
– 
the 
legal 
representative for Mr Tsotsi says he wishes to address you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Maybe he can address me 
from where he is if it is going to be quick. 
COUNSEL:  It is rather short, thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
COUNSEL:   I have been at pains to try and avoid what I 
have no choice but to do now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
COUNSEL:  Firstly, we just want to place on record that 
Minister Lynne Brown’s statement was not provided or at 
least had not been received by either Mr Tsotsi, the 
witness, before he started his testimony, nor us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
COUNSEL:   Secondly consistent with Mr Tsotsi’s evidence 
so far ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
COUNSEL:   He is not, he was not aware that there is a 
transcript of recording for some of these meetings that now 
we are going to get into. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 194 of 236 
 
COUNSEL:   Let alone that neither he or I are aware that 
there will be a recording that is going to be played 
invariably where he would be asked to comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
COUNSEL:   Now there is no issue from where I am sitting 
of that happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
COUNSEL:  The only problem is that we expected that he 
would at least be given an opportunity to go through 
statements and recordings that he would be expected to 
10 
comment on. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
COUNSEL:   So that he does not run into the temptation on 
responding to an issue out of context if he had the benefit 
of reading the entirety of the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
COUNSEL:   And therefore, jerk his memory properly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
COUNSEL:  So hence I am rising at this stage to say in all 
fairness my submission would be that he be granted that 
20 
opportunity to go through and then this exercise that is 
intended can then be proceeded with at least with the 
benefit of having looked at the statements. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well what if we do this, let’s run it, if he 
is asked any questions and there’s a problem, he says so 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 195 of 236 
 
and we take it from there, in case whatever he is asked he 
has no problem with? 
COUNSEL:   I am happy Chairperson for ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So in other words, we deal with each 
problem on its merits as it arises, if any problem arises at 
all. 
COUNSEL:   I am happy with that approach, the only 
challenge I anticipate, which I am trying very hard to avoid, 
for me to feel the need to have to jump up and object, I 
hate that when it is done to me, I don’t want to do it. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, no I understand. 
COUNSEL:  I must make this point, whilst you took the 15 
or so adjournment I was at pains to try and rush through 
the recording which my client clearly indicates not only was 
he not aware that it was recorded, he sees this for the first 
time, I could not myself finish it in that period, let alone 
that he had to go to the bathroom, so where I am sitting 
and I will be guided by the Chairperson, it could assist the  
Commission’s work much swifter if he simply was given 
chance to read and then prepare himself and help my 
20 
colleague as he leads the evidence by being just on point 
on the issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no I understand what you mean.  
Do you want to say anything Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chairperson my response would be 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 196 of 236 
 
that the best evidence in this case is the audio itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is a recording of the Board’s meeting 
where Mr Tsotsi was the Chairperson, he will hear himself 
and nobody else speaking, he will hear his colleagues at a 
time speaking, I am not sure what will be surprising to Mr 
Tsotsi in the audios, so he will have, if there is any 
correction to be made in the transcription make the 
correction by reference to the audio. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   Okay I think what we will do let’s 
10 
go ahead and when Mr Tsotsi is asked to comment or ask 
any question if there is a problem he will raise it and we 
will look at it at that stage, and if his counsel thinks there 
is a problem we can look at it at that stage.  It may well be 
that there will be no problem and we go, everything will go 
smoothly. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  That is also my anticipation Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson.  So we are on 
page 866, audio file 9.1.1.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are the technicians not ready?  Should 
we – if they are going to take long should we deal with 
other matters and they indicate to you when they are ready 
so that we don’t waste time? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Chair may I proceed? 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 197 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I thought you said they were ready from 
the morning? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja, that’s what they assured me 
yesterday already. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Well Chair I am going to leave them to 
sort it out. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, they must indicate to you when they 
are ready.  Well, maybe your junior should be there to 
make sure that she can see when they are ready so that we 
10 
don’t waste time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now Mr Tsotsi despite your opposition 
to the suspension of the executives, we know from Mr 
Matona’s testimony yesterday that four executives were 
ultimately suspended.  I think you have switched off the 
mic. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you the only one in the meeting 
20 
who was concerned that they should not be suspended but 
some other form of absence be agreed upon?  There may 
have been ...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:  Chair I honestly I cannot recall ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:    ...a few others ja. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 198 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:   I don’t recall ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
But 
was 
your 
concern 
the 
label  
suspension what effect it would have when it is conveyed 
to the outside world of the executives but you also had the 
same thing in mind in terms of substance, namely they 
should not be at work for a certain period of time? 
MR TSOTSI:   I was very concerned Chair about their own 
personal reputations. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And the damage it might do to their careers 
10 
and a lot of things around perception. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   And even though we readily said that they 
are not being accused of having done any wrong but 
perceptions are perceptions and individuals suspended 
people will always attribute that to something even though 
there is no ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes you know sometimes people say 
somebody 
is 
on 
special 
leave, 
that 
is 
saying 
on 
suspension, is that what you had in mind? 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   That is the sort of thing that I had in mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which would be a label because when 
somebody says you are on special leave and somebody is 
on suspension they are both absent from work for a certain 
period of time, but one label has certain implications, 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 199 of 236 
 
another one has different implications, so in other words in 
substance you also had in mind that they should be absent 
from work for a certain period. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes on the basis of something like special 
leave, but the impression I got was that Eskom does not 
have that sort of ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   That kind of a label, ja, okay, alright. 
MR TSOTSI:   So I mean I related then and it is important 
for me to state Chair that I relented because I had the 
absolute confidence that for as long as I am there, I will 
10 
make sure that they return, that they are not prejudiced in 
any kind of way.  That was the sort of back-stop for me in 
my mind to say that I will make sure that nothing untoward 
happens to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   Because I was convinced that – and by the 
way another thing that is important to note at the time 
when we were dealing with this matter there was no 
intention of even investigating the executives themselves.  
This was – I don’t know exactly where this was made clear 
20 
but I recall that we had the understanding that at no point 
is there an intention to investigate them in the course of 
this inquiry to stick to the terms of reference which deal 
with the objective condition of Eskom in terms of the 
issues 
that 
are 
problematic, 
and 
not 
individuals 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 200 of 236 
 
themselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I got the impression, or ja I got the 
impression in terms of Mr Matona’s evidence yesterday and 
maybe reading some of the affidavits and documents that 
while they might not have been accused of any misconduct 
but what was being investigated included how they were 
managing the company, in other words their performance, 
were they managing the company properly, to meet with the 
challenges, to deal with the challenges that the company 
was facing, that is the impression I got, but if you say the 
10 
idea was not to investigate them that seems to be 
inconsistent 
with 
my 
understanding 
because 
my 
understanding seems to be that while the Board might not 
have been saying they have done anything wrong, but it 
seems that it wanted to investigate whether the way in 
which they had been running the company, or managing the 
company was the right one.  
 
Of course there was this allegation that the war 
room was being fed with wrong information, inadequate 
information, obviously that must relate to the executives. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what do you say to that. 
MR TSOTSI:   Well Chair in that respect let’s not forget 
that ultimately after I left Eskom, as a matter of fact at the 
time I was dealing with my departure at Eskom already the 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 201 of 236 
 
terms of reference, and Nick was out of the picture and so 
they then put a set of terms of reference I knew which I 
was not involved in at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mmm, mmm. 
MR TSOTSI:  So the possibility for me is that some of 
these issues could have then been brought in at the time 
when I was not involved in the consideration of the terms 
of reference, I never attended a single meeting because 
these things happened after I left. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well except that Mr Matona was also not 
10 
there after you had left, so he was talking very much about 
what was conveyed at the meeting, was conveyed to him 
on the 11 t h and I am saying that based on what he was 
saying it seem to me that your Board was saying this 
inquiry would – what it would look into included how the 
management – how the executives, maybe not just these 
but how the management of Eskom was dealing with the 
challenges that the company was facing and then there 
was this issue that the war room was being fed wrong 
information and I would imagine that the person to approve 
20 
any information that was being sent to the war room would 
be the CEO I would imagine. 
MR 
TSOTSI: 
 
 
So 
the 
discussion 
was 
about 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
Executives, 
as 
against 
any 
misdemeanours so to speak. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 202 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no what I – effectively what I am 
saying is you can’t – it is difficult to say you can speak 
about the performance of the company without talking 
about the performance of the executives who are running 
the company. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because they are the ones who make 
certain decisions which either enhance the performance or 
you 
know 
make 
decisions 
that 
end 
up 
with 
poor 
performance by the company, but I am just testing your 
10 
idea that before you left the idea was not to investigate 
these executives and I am just saying but how could this 
inquiry not include investigating these executives because 
the inquiry was alleged to be about the performance of the 
company and they were the top people running the 
company. 
MR TSOTSI:   Okay so we – I would have made the 
differentiation personally between their management style 
in terms of what they are able – for example the decision 
making typically for example the head of Generation or the 
20 
Chief Executive decided okay we are not going to do the 
maintenance 
for 
three 
months 
because 
there 
is 
a 
requirement 
that 
we 
must 
analyse 
on 
under 
any 
circumstances. 
 
Now that decision was their decision, would the one 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 203 of 236 
 
that would reflect on its capacity to handle the job. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   Whereas I was talking myself and in my 
mind was the thought that there is no malfeasance per se 
in that it is just a question of not making the correct 
decisions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no, no, if you – if what you meant 
was that there was no - that the inquiry would look into 
whether they had misconducted themselves. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – that I can accept. 
MR TSOTSI:  Otherwise I do agree with you.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  But otherwise in terms of how they did 
their job. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether they made the right decisions and 
they appreciated the challenges of the company that would 
be part of the inquiry. 
MR TSOTSI:  That would be part of it yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Yes alright. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  Yes Mr Tsotsi a 
couple of things. Let me start with the first one and it is just 
about the War Room and the allegation of apparently 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 204 of 236 
 
inaccurate or inadequate information being provided to the 
War Room.  Were you aware of that being a concern? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I was aware of that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Where did the Board raise that as a 
concern with the Executives such as Mr Matona in this case? 
MR TSOTSI:  The Board would have raised that I cannot 
exactly precisely say at which sitting of the Board. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  You heard him say yesterday that that 
was never raised with him. 
MR TSOTSI:  Probably I just say I do not know which sitting 
10 
it would have been.  Maybe it was not at the sittings that Mr 
Matona was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the … 
MR TSOTSI:  I cannot remember right now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But remember Mr Tsotsi the 11 t h March was 
the first sitting. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of this Board for all intents and purposes 
to deal with the business of Eskom because the meeting of 
the 26 February was postponed to the 11t h. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then on the 9 t h they met briefly about 
something else.  So it seems to that there would not have 
been any meeting prior to the 11t h at which the Board would 
have raised such an issue with – with Mr Matona. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 205 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:  That will be correct Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And if – if the matter was raised with 
him it may have been – it could only have been maybe by 
you as an – as Chairperson if this had come to your attention 
and you raised it with him outside of the Board Meeting.  Do 
you remember whether you did raise it outside of a Board 
Meeting?  He said yesterday that… 
MR TSOTSI:  I do not recall – I really do not recall having 
raised it with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:  But certainly, I agree with you the fact that the 
only substantive Board Meeting dealing with Eskom’s facts 
and issues. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Was one on the 11 March and that did not 
come across. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and the concern about inadequate 
information exactly what is it if you are able to articulate it?  
Was it that the executives were being asked a certain 
amount 
of 
information 
and 
they 
provided 
the 
right 
20 
information but not enough?  Was it that they were providing 
poor information – bad information?  What was the exact 
nature of the concern? 
MR TSOTSI:  From what I understood the War Room was 
interested in as current information as possible.  And a lot of 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 206 of 236 
 
the stuff had to do with what is going on with the load 
shedding.   
Now I do not know if you recall just to give you an 
example of the kind of complexity that they were dealing 
with.  The incident that occurred where the previous – most 
recent previous Chairman 
of the Board Jabu Mabuza 
supposedly gave information about load shedding to the 
Deputy President or President I am not sure and things 
changed and he was said to have misled the President or 
Deputy President.  Now it is that sort of things.   
10 
There were so many changes occurring in the 
organisation that when executives present information which 
they believe represents the true situation then something 
else comes along and changes so they have to go back and 
change the information.   
So for them to explain I guess or rather for the War 
Room to understand which is part of the problem with War 
Rooms.  The understanding of the complexities of the 
operation of Eskom.  It was difficult – the engagement was 
very difficult because the majority of the people in the War 
20 
Room were government officials.   
There were DG’s and of course Ministers.  So there 
was that gap in my – in my view until they started to bring in 
people who were technically conversant to support the War 
Room.   
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 207 of 236 
 
Things got better at that point because you know the 
technical people began to understand what the difficulties 
were. 
 
But 
at 
the 
beginning 
those 
were 
the 
gaps 
understanding the complexities and the – you know the 
sudden changes that occur in operations in the organisation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  But I think that – that I understood where the 
problem was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is – I mean I can understand a concern 
that may have emanated from the War Room that would say 
we are concerned that the current management is not up to 
the job because these are the difficulties we are having and 
we have been having these difficulties for a certain period of 
time.   
Maybe it is like they do not appreciate exactly what is 
needed to be – what we need to be given to us in order for 
us to try and find a solution.  But then I would expect that 
that would be put to them save to say you have a – there is a 
20 
problem.   
You are not able to satisfy us in this way so therefore 
we are going to have this inquiry and we ask you to take 
leave or you will be suspended because we want to look into 
this.  But this idea there will be an inquiry.   
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 208 of 236 
 
But this thing about inadequate information seems to 
be just a peripheral issue it is – you know it does not come 
to the fore in the manner that one would have thought it 
would.  You understand what I am saying? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I understand what you saying. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Because then if it had been 
presented like that they would know also okay – there is a 
concern that are we able to really assist in finding a solution 
if we are not able to provide information adequately bla, bla, 
bla.  But you know it seemed like an inquiry and then this 
10 
thing about information being provided to the War Room is 
like a peripheral issue.  Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:  Ja I understand what you say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Thank you Chairperson.  So Mr Tsotsi 
just for a quick reference in your affidavit on page 17 to 
page 21 the bottom of page 17.  Paragraph 15.  Under the 
heading Board Meeting of 11 March 2015.  Yes? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So you do say that the Board Meeting of 
20 
the 11t h was twofold.   
“The first papers was intended to make up 
for 
the 
26 
February 
meeting 
that 
got 
postponed. 
 
Secondly 
the 
Minister 
had 
indicated that she was available to attend on 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 209 of 236 
 
this day.”  Turn the page you carry on on 
page 18. 
“Mr Linnell spoke on the resolutions which 
stemmed from the memorandum he had 
developed.  The resolutions were circulated 
to Board Members in the meeting of 9 
March.” 
 
You carry on.  15.5 says: 
“The Minister joined the Board Meeting of 11 
March by invitation from the Board. She was 
10 
already aware of the idea of an inquiry and 
she supported it.  She gave the board the 
authorisation to proceed with it.” 
 
That is as you have already testified.  You say the 
minutes of this meeting are missing.  In fact, I referred to 
what seems to be the minutes earlier of that very meeting.  
What we do not have is the audio of those minutes of that 
meeting.  You recall that? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes I – I prepared this in February so at the 
time I was [00:10:34]. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:  I appreciate that.  And 15.6 says: 
“The Minister mandated the board to carry 
out suspensions of the executive even had 
the name of the financial director who was 
not part of the original executives identified 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 210 of 236 
 
in the meeting at the President’s residence. 
She further mandated the board to carry out 
the inquiry.  The board deliberated on how 
the inquiry should proceed.  It gathered on 
the need – it agreed on the need to have the 
executives 
whose 
area 
of 
responsibility 
would be inquired into and be set aside for 
the duration of the inquiry with a limitation of 
Human Resources, Rules demand that the 
executives 
would 
have 
to 
be 
under 
10 
precautionary suspension as there was no 
other method of recusal available.” 
 
Now is this paragraph 15.7 and 15.8 are those 
deliberations after the Minister had left? 
MR TSOTSI:  Let us just see.  It would be after.  This would 
be the pre-MG meeting. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  Now I have read the minutes and 
affidavits 
of 
various 
witnesses. 
 
I 
grapple 
with 
the 
understanding of knowing and I would like you to explain this 
to the Chairperson if you can because you were in this 
20 
meeting.  What did the Board resolve to do in respect of this 
executives?   What is the concept that was applied and 
ultimately effected to have them stay away from work?  What 
did the Board resolve? 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair the Board deliberated on the issue of 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 211 of 236 
 
whether the executives should not or should be away from 
their offices during the course of the inquiry.  And if I 
remember well the idea of them not being present resonated 
with most of the Board Members.   
ADV SELEKA SC:  Did it resonate with you Mr Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:  The idea of them not being present in their 
offices resonated with me but under conditions which were I 
think reasonable that would not prejudice them in their 
positions or in their work. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  What did the Board con – what was given 
10 
as the reasons that resonated with the Board for them not to 
be present? 
MR TSOTSI:  The Board as I said earlier Board Members 
were concerned that there could be influence.  There could 
be influence brought to bear by the executives when they are 
in their offices on the issues that are being inquired into. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Could you tell the Chairperson whether 
was that a concern of the Board?  A very concern of the 
Board. 
MR TSOTSI:  In my view it was a concern of the Board.  
20 
Hence the Board a decision that they should not be available 
at their offices. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes now how do you say that with 
conviction when the Board has not even had a meeting with 
the executives prior to 11 March 2015?  This is a new Board. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 212 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:  I – I cannot speak for them because they have 
made their views clear in the meeting.  So I – the question 
you are asking me I really cannot answer because they 
engaged the meeting and they gave their views.  I can only 
assume that they have had experience elsewhere where they 
have been of this sort of thing.  So I am not assuming that 
knowing the Board Members and person or maybe knowing 
how they work was a consideration on their part.  I do not 
necessarily think that could have been the case because 
they expressed themselves quite clearly. 
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:  So what would be the answer in regard to 
yourself because you also say there is reasons resonated 
with you? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes as I said I personally felt that I do not 
want to see a situation at the end of the inquiry or in the 
course of the inquiry where there are questions that have 
been raised that certain information was not available 
because individuals were not in a position to provide that 
information as a result of some influence that is brought on 
brought to bear on them by their bosses.  So you know when 
20 
we said precautionary suspension, I understood literally that 
we are being precautious in terms of ensuring that nothing 
would be impeding the work of this – of this exercise.  The 
work of the inquiry.  That is – that was my understanding – 
my view. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 213 of 236 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  At the same time I was comfortable that the 
executives have nothing to lose because not in terms of what 
may occur when they are not in their offices and that – as I 
said Chair that this was a temporary situation where I felt 
that they would be able to come back and after that and sure 
that they come back to their offices at the end of the inquiry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:  Yes.  So how does – how does the 
commission ascribe – how does it understand the idea that 
the Board was the one saying the executives should be 
10 
suspended for these and the other reason the inquiry should 
not be impeded when the commission and the information 
you yourself has provided is shown that Mr Linnell is the one 
who drafted this resolution and it did not originate from 
within the Board. 
MR TSOTSI:  The resolution was discussed and Board 
Members had very specific views about it to the extent that 
in the meeting the Board agreed to have Mr Linnell assist the 
two different committees.  The PNG committee in working on 
the suspensions and on the Audit and Risk committee on the 
20 
Terms of Reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a very strange thing that the Board 
that is supposed to be in control – have exercise control 
over the entity – it is a new Board.  The only thing that has 
happened before this meeting where they – they seem to be 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 214 of 236 
 
so much in favour of an idea that comes from outside the 
Board of an inquiry and suspension.  It is their first meeting 
really.   
I know about the meeting of the 9 t h but it is their first 
meeting. An idea comes from people outside of the Board 
and not from management either they run with it and 
somebody that has been obtained or provided by somebody 
from outside of the Board namely Ms Myeni providing Mr 
Linnell is now allowed to get quite involved in the affairs of 
the Board [00:20:43] resolutions and this Board just lets that 
10 
– that – allows that to just happen.   
It is very strange to me.  I would have thought that if 
I joined a body like a board of a company you know that is 
not the kind of thing I would do at the first meeting because I 
still want to make my own assessment of the situation before 
I can engage in decisions that could have far reaching 
consequences for the entity.  It is just very strange.   
I mean we know that this idea did not come from 
within the Board and did not come from within management I 
think from what I have heard.  It comes from outside.  You 
20 
get called to Durban as Chairperson of the Eskom Board.  
You meet at the President’s residence.  You meet with the 
Chairperson of another – the boar of another SOE.  You are 
surprised what she had to do with Eskom’s affairs but she is 
here.  She seems to run the show even when the President 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 215 of 236 
 
is here in the meeting.  The President is listening to her.  
She talks most of the time.   
There is somebody that is said to have assisted her 
somewhere else he has provided to you to say he can assist.  
He gets involved.  He is drafting resolutions.  And the Board 
does not even say hang on if we go along with this idea, we 
will look for our own advisor or whoever to assist us.  They 
just run with the idea.   
It makes you wonder where – whether the information 
they have is limited to the information that they got at the 
10 
meeting.  Or whether they have got other information from 
other sources or other people about this inquiry and the 
suspension of the executives.  It just seems quite strange to 
me. 
MR TSOTSI:  Chair I found myself in exactly the same 
situation that you were addressing now at one point – from a 
certain point onwards. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  I can just – Chair if I may just quickly deal with 
that? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:  I do not know whether in this recordal there is 
a discussion of what happened when we – at the beginning 
of this meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 216 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:  If what I saw – the little I saw reflects the 
beginning of the meeting then in terms of the recordal that 
was not the actual beginning of the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  But to the best of my recollection Chairman 
when I arrived – what happened was this.  I took the Minister 
out.  She left.  I came back.  I went to have lunch and I was 
behind because most of the people had had lunch already.  
And the meeting started about half past two and I came to 
the meeting a little bit late maybe about ten or so minutes 
10 
late. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSOTSI:  When I came into the meeting the meeting was 
chaired by it is either Chwayita Mabude or Xhosa one of the 
two I cannot exactly remember but in my affidavit I thought it 
was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is now the people in governance 
meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is now the people in governance 
20 
committee meeting. 
MR TSOTSI:  People in governance yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:  I thought it was chaired by Chwayita or it could 
have been chaired by Mr Xhosa.  When I arrived at the 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 217 of 236 
 
meeting the discussion that I found was about the executives 
who were supposed to act. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  Now I discovered that there was a list of 
executives that had been produced from somewhere and 
these were the people who said it was said would be acting.  
The first thing I did was I asked where do those names come 
from.  And I was told by Ben Ngubane that these names 
came from the Minister.  Now I protested because I said 
none of you people know who these people are.  I am the 
10 
only person in the room who knows who the people –  
CHAIRPERSON:  [not audible]. 
MR TSOTSI:   Who would be in a position to act.  And I said 
clearly wherever these names come from the Minister would 
not know either.  They can only come from within the 
executives ranks.  So somebody in the executive must have 
given these names to whomever and they have ended up in 
this meeting.  So there was this predetermination except for 
the acting Chief Executive there the suggestion was that 
Xhosa should act as Chief Executive. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:  He admitted that he felt that this was – he 
could not handle that responsibility.  So I – I said look there 
is no reason why you should if you feel that you cannot do it.  
But at the end he did become the acting Chief Executive. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 218 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  How did that come about in circumstances 
where he himself said he thought this was too big a job of 
something like that? 
MR TSOTSI:  Because the committee decided that no he will 
be – he will take the position that he needs to and he must 
take it.  So I think he relented on the insistence of Members 
in the committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now just to clarify.  This meeting we are 
talking about now which was discussing the names of people 
to act in the positions of the suspended executives was a 
10 
peoples in governance committee? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the – the other sessions which up to  
now were being calling board meetings were they also 
peoples in governance committee meetings we just wrongly 
called them board meetings? 
MR TSOTSI:  No Chair this is a board sub-committee 
meeting.  The meeting on the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  With the Minister was with the Board? 
MR TSOTSI:  Was with a full board. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and the meeting that took place before 
the meeting with the Minister was a board meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:  It was a full board meeting as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the meeting after the Minister had left 
was not a meeting of the full board but a governance and 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 219 of 236 
 
peoples and governance committee. 
MR TSOTSI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so was there after the meeting of the 
peoples 
and 
governance 
committee meeting after that 
meeting was there another board meeting on the day or had 
the board meeting end when – before the peoples and 
governance committee started? 
MR TSOTSI:  The board meeting had ended with… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  The suspension. 
MR TSOTSI:  No.  Was recommending suspensions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes recommending suspensions. 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes and also mandating the people in 
governance committee to carry out the suspension process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And… 
MR TSOTSI:  Which is what the meeting was about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And also to decide on the people to act. 
MR TSOTSI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so the board meeting ended before 
20 
the peoples and governance committee meeting started? 
MR TSOTSI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the governance and people – the 
peoples and governance committee meeting started but it 
had the mandate to get and to appoint or to recommend 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 220 of 236 
 
whatever the position was on who should act in the positions 
of the executives? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And for the rest of the day, it is only the 
people in governance committee meetings that we are 
looking at from that time on for that day? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There was no further board meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  So after lunch, you joined 
10 
this people governance committee meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you found them already dealing with 
names of people to act in the positions of the executives? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say to them, amongst other things, 
none of you know these people. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am the only that was... And that was 
because you have been around. 
20 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know, for quite some time.  What do 
they say to you when you say that, these people in the 
meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:   Well, they told me, as I said, Mr Ngubane 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 221 of 236 
 
indicated Chair to me that these are names that were 
provided by the minister.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, and they were just going along 
effectively. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They do not know the people because the 
minister 
gave 
the 
names. 
 
They 
seem 
to 
want 
to 
rubberstamp, it seems from. 
MR TSOTSI:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is correct, ja. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Mr Seleka. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  So should the 
Commission ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I see I have twenty-five to six.  Shall we 
just go on and see where we are at six o’clock?  I think 
nobody has a problem.  Let us review the situation at  six. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  Should the 
Commission Mr Tsotsi then accept that this board ultimately 
succeeded through the demands of the then president or Ms 
20 
Dudu Myeni, and/or? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Demand/request or proposal. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct.  Thank you, Chairperson.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Or instruction. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Or instructions.   
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 222 of 236 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Effectively, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So this Commission should... yes, 
understand that to be the position.  Thank you, Chairperson.  
You see we are talking about the new board and when we 
take it from yourself.   
 
What you say was your response to Minister Brown on 
the 
15t h 
of 
February 
2015, 
when 
she 
says 
to 
your 
management and board members are complaining that you 
10 
are interfering with management.   
 
And 
remember, 
your 
response 
was: 
 
Most 
board 
members hardly know what I look like.  Let alone, not having 
worked with me yet.  Do you recall that? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, I do.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Does that not similarly apply to the 
executives? 
MR TSOTSI:   Quite certainly.  That the board members 
would not know the executives.  They did not know it at the 
time. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Mr Tsotsi.  Chair, I believe 
the recording is ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, that is fine.   
ADV SELEKA SC:   I hope we get to play.  We were 
...[intervenes]  
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 223 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   They must just be able to get on with it so 
that we do not waste time. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct.  I want to – because Mr Tsotsi 
says he went on lunch and came back to find that the PMG 
meeting had started.  Or I could start with that but maybe I 
will put the point on it Mr Tsotsi.  Let us go back to that page 
I had given, page 866.  And that is audio 9.1.1.   
[Audio 9.1.1. play on record] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Okay, can he pause it? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Rewind.  Could you please rewind to the 
beginning? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   To the beginning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 866. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Are you fine, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
[Audio 9.1.1. play on record] 
CHAIRPERSON:   You said we are going to page 866? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   866. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Okay.   
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   866. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I have got it.  Have you got it Mr 
Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 224 of 236 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   YOU found it, Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you can go ahead. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.   
[Audio 9.1.1. play on record] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Please pause.  Mr Tsotsi, please identify 
to the Chairperson whose male voice was the first? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is my voice. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is your voice? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We hear a female voice coming on.  Can 
10 
you play it, please? 
[Audio 9.1.1. play on record] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Have you been able to identify her? 
MR TSOTSI:   That is Ms Carrim. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, just come again? 
MR TSOTSI:   [No audible reply]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   What is the first name? 
MR TSOTSI:   [sigh]  I... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We showed you the minutes earlier. 
MR TSOTSI:   Oh, it is in the minutes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sure there is  page which has got a 
list of the names of the board members.  If you tell him 
where that page is, he will see the... 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Even if he does not remember the first 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 225 of 236 
 
name. 
MR TSOTSI:   It is an N Carrim.  I do not know whether it 
is... 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the name? 
MR TSOTSI:   The initial is N. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And the surname? 
MR TSOTSI:   It is Carrim.  C-a-r-r-i-m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   C-a-r-r-i-m? 
MR TSOTSI:   I think so, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Are you confident that this is the 
10 
person? 
MR TSOTSI:   Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   Because the other ladies, I would... yes, there 
were only three ladies in the meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There were only two ladies in the 
meeting? 
MR TSOTSI:   Three. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Three? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Yes? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you.  Can you...? 
[Audio 9.1.1. play on record] 
MR TSOTSI:   That is Norman? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Mr Norman Baloyi? 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 226 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Mr Tsotsi.   
[Audio 9.1.1. play on record] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So is that your voice, Mr Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you. 
[Audio 9.1.1. play on record] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, ,no, no.  Just so far.  Pause.  Sorry, 
I think that was your voice and then somebody else 
interrupted. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Whose voice was that?  Let us play it 
again. 
[Audio 9.1.1. play on record] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Carry on.  
[Audio 9.1.1. play on record] 
ADV SELEKA SC:   What I hear Mr Tsotsi is your voice 
saying Mr Ambassador. 
MR TSOTSI:   It sounds like Dr Ngubane, yes.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Sorry, is.. was Dr Ngubane being 
20 
referred to as the Ambassador? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, I just call him the Ambassador. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh. 
MR TSOTSI:   A lot of people referred to him as the 
Ambassador but... I called him that. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 227 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   I cannot hear. 
MR TSOTSI:   Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who was referred to as Ambassador? 
MR TSOTSI:   Dr Ngubane. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright.  Okay.  Because had been an 
ambassador at some stage before? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
10 
MR TSOTSI:   So he... that is the next voice, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
[Audio 9.1.1. play on record] 
MR TSOTSI:   That is Mabuda. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is who? 
MR TSOTSI:   Ms Mabuda. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Mr Tsotsi, just before we carry on.  
You heard, what you say, is Mr Norman Baloyi speaking 
there. 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   He sounds or have sounded to have 
expressed 
reservations 
about 
forging 
ahead 
with 
the 
decision propose particularly in regard to the suspension of 
the executives.  How did you as the board deal with his 
reservations? 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 228 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:   [Indistinct]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Oh, your microphone sir. 
MR TSOTSI:   Sorry.  As the board, I would not know 
because I do not believe that the board dealt with his 
particular ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I guess is supposed to have sent – 
supposed to have said the people in governance committee 
...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because is it not what we... is not where 
10 
we are? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not yet, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, not yet? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Not yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.  
ADV SELEKA SC:   But I think the question is relevant to the 
board because they make the decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, I understand that I thought that 
20 
we 
were 
already 
at 
the 
governance 
and 
the 
people 
governance committee? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are at the meeting immediate after the 
minister had left? 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 229 of 236 
 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is where we are? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  And that is the board 
meeting? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.   
MR TSOTSI:   This is a people governance committee 
meeting and Mr Baloyi’s objection were not raised.  He did 
not raise any objections during the board meeting when the 
10 
issue of suspension was discussed.   I think it is the first time 
that anyone is hearing from him about whatever reservations 
he may have.  He is expressing them in this meeting.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, let us sort that out Mr Seleka.  Are 
we at the people and governance meeting this recording or is 
it at the board meeting after the minister has left?  Because I 
hear Mr Tsotsi says this is at the people and governance 
...[intervenes]  
MR TSOTSI:   Oh, I am sorry, Chair.  So this recording is of 
the board in-committee meeting.  Okay, no that is fine. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay alright. 
MR TSOTSI:   I did not realise that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, okay.  Alright.  Alright. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   It is correct, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it is correct. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 230 of 236 
 
MR TSOTSI:   It is correct. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So that is the board meeting. 
MR TSOTSI:   I cannot say specifically Chair whether the 
board had any – took any particular – maybe it will come out 
as we go ahead with this.  But I do not recall there be any 
particular focus on his views about what should happen.  I 
think he was expressing his views like anybody else. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  No, correct.  But what I am asking 
is.  Based on your recollection, having been part of the 
meeting and hearing one of the board members expressing 
10 
reservations in regard to the decisions that are about to be 
taken by the board, because this is at the moment of 
deliberations, the word used in your affidavit.  How did the 
board deal with his reservations? 
MR TSOTSI:   The board did not deal with his reservations.  
The board just expressed... Norman must just express his 
own view. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The discussion continued. 
MR TSOTSI:   The discussion continued. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR TSOTSI:   As they were saying different things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR TSOTSI:   And he was one of the people who had a view. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR TSOTSI:   Which was expressed to the board. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 231 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he did insist on somebody answering 
his concerns? 
MR TSOTSI:   I do not recall that.  And we will find out as we 
go ahead what happens. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Thank you, Chairperson.  You may 
proceed. 
[Audio 9.1.1. play on record] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Seleka, I do not want us to listen to the 
recording on everything.  
10 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because there is a transcript. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I want us to only listen to parts of the 
record in regard to parts that you regard as important. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Correct, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that 
we 
must 
not 
go through 
everything.  And if those have not been identified by way 
making sure that really listen to what you regard as quite 
important, then maybe that can be done after we have 
20 
adjourned so that when we get to it is much quicker. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ys. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We get to – so we know if there is a 
discrepancy on the version even by any witness as to what 
was discussed or decided and the recording does bring that 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 232 of 236 
 
up, then we can just go there and you zoom in.  We listen to 
that.  We stop.  We move on. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And we listen only when there is 
something quite important. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Let me go to the section where it goes 
into the PMG Committee, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we are at five to six.  Where are we?  
10 
How much more time we need? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe what we should do to the extent 
that Mr Tsotsi has not... I do not know whether the transcript, 
you had a chance to read? 
MR TSOTSI:   No, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have not had a chance to read? 
MR TSOTSI:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe what you should do Mr Seleka is 
we should adjourn now.  That is point one.  Point two.  Mr 
20 
Tsotsi 
should 
get 
the 
opportunity 
to 
go 
through 
the 
transcripts and listen to the audio and make notes that will 
help with the identification of the people who are talking in 
the audio.  He will be looking at the transcript at he listen 
and he can make notes.  Where it says female voice or 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 233 of 236 
 
something like that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He can write who that is and so on.  And 
that will assist because when he comes back you will know 
in advance – you will have spoken to him – where the – who 
the speakers are and the transcript can appropriately be 
amended. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To reflect the names of the people who 
will speak at different parts of the transcript.  And one, they 
10 
can indicate whether he substantially agrees that the 
transcript reflects the discussions at least for the time that 
he was at the meeting.   
 
And where – then after that we can just focus on the 
important things.  And if there is something to listen to on 
the recording, we just go straight to that.  We listen to that. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How is that?  Is that fine? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is perfectly fine, Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is fine, yes. 
20 
ADV SELEKA SC:   That is the way to do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now, if we adjourn now, preferable 
we should be finished with him before we move to the next 
witness. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I would say so. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 234 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   And would you be available to continue 
tomorrow morning, Mr Tsotsi? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You would be available? 
MR TSOTSI:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And counsel, you are available? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   So think that is what we should do.  If he 
can be given the audio to listen to it in the evening.  I am 
sure tomorrow when he comes back then the whole job can 
10 
be much easier. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes.  Chair, I could not agree more. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think the latest development most of 
the audio required. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   So it was intended to be played in 
respect of Mr Tsotsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Ja.  So we should be very brief on that, 
20 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay.  So bearing that in mind, what is 
your estimate of how much time you might need with him 
tomorrow morning? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   I think I would need 45-minutes, Chair. 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 235 of 236 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So let us... should we start at ten or half-
past nine? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Or 09:30 if it suits the Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The witness who will come after him, how 
long is he or she supposed to be? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   We were scheduling her for the morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and then there will be another one. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Then there will be another one at two, 
10 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And the other one at tow, likely take 
how much? 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Again, until the beginning of the next 
day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Oh, so maybe let us start at half-past 
nine. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that fine? 
COUNSEL:   It is fine, Chairperson.  I just need to indicate, I 
20 
intimated to my learned colleague that I will require with your 
permission to re-examine Mr Tsotsi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  No, that is fine. 
COUNSEL:   And secondly that to the extent, if possible, that 
these 
statements 
that 
we 
have 
not 
had 
sight 
of 
08 SEPTEMBER 2020 – DAY 263 
 
Page 236 of 236 
 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   You can be given those? 
COUNSEL:   So that when we come tomorrow, at least he is 
ready. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ja.  No, just arrange with Mr Seleka.  
Those can be given. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Indeed, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so ...[intervenes]  
ADV SELEKA SC:   Now... ja.  It is fine.  Because my 
understanding was that Miss Lynne Brown’s statement had 
10 
been emailed to Mr Tsotsi together with the statement of Ms 
Dudu Myeni. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because if... they confirm they have the 
one but not the other. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV SELEKA SC:   Because I understood they were in one 
email but we will provide them with ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No, that is fine.  Okay then we are 
going to adjourn and then tomorrow we start at half-past
