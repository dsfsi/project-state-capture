PROCEEDINGS ON 15 APRIL 2019  
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Chair.  Morning Mr Mc 
Bride. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Morning Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair just two matters before we 
commence with the evidence once more.  The first is we have referred 
in evidence to two reports, the preliminary or first report fro m the IPID 
to the NPA and the second or final report which – both of which have 
been a matter of some controversy particularly the differences between 
10 
the two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The first report appears at page 
191 that is the January 2014 report of the bundle, Exhibit Y.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Exhibit Ya. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Ya yes.  And the second one 
appears in the same bundle or same exhibit at page 227.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The second matter that required 
mention Chair is on Friday I said that I would consult with the witness 
20 
in order to determine at what level of detail it was necessary to 
continue and whether matters of general import and general principle 
could be dealt with in such a way as to exclude debates about the 
rights and wrongs of the many issues raised by the witness.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 3 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  On consideration and because 
there is no fixed determination made clearly by yourself yet Chair nor  
by the legal team as to what actually occurred and why it occurred and 
because of the need to hear all the evidence first and then only make 
an assessment as to why Law Enforcement Agencies acted as they did 
whether they were deliberately, actively or pas sively part of any state 
capture project that you might find to exist.  It is necessary to hear the 
detail first and not to cut out any of the detail so that all the facts are 
before you when you need to make a final assessment.  There are 
various possible explanations for what occurred but first we have to 
10 
show in details what did occur because what is beyond doubt Chair is 
that the acts or the lack of action on the part of Law Enforcement over 
the past ten years at least to central to the inquiry that you  must make.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine.  I think we have had a number of 
people including some of the witnesses who have testified saying that 
the Law Enforcement Agencies had lost credibility and that they have 
no confidence in them that is why th ey did not report or do certain 
things and – and the nation might need to know whether there is a 
basis for that in regard to the Law Enforcement Agencies or whether 
those beliefs and perceptions really had no basis because Law 
20 
Enforcement Agencies plays s uch an important role in society.  So we 
might have just – I think you are right to say let us hear all the details 
it might be a quite a challenge but it may be necessary if a credible 
determination has to be made at the end one way or another.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 4 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So all we know for the moment is 
that the evidence that has been given under the rubric of Law 
Enforcement Agencies is critical to the terms of reference to 
understand what happened and why it happened and how it could be 
prevented from happening again.  And – but in order to determine the 
precise nature of the role without any pre -conceptions we have to hear 
all the evidence in its detail sadly and you will bear with us in tha t 
regard Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no, no, no that is fine. It also – the role of Law 
10 
Enforcement Agencies exactly what they did and what they did not do 
and to what extent they may been influenced or affected by state 
capture might also be relevant to the question of the levels of 
corruption that have happened where we are.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because if they are not acting the way they should 
act in regard to corruption then corruption may have reason because…  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of among other things the fact that they were not 
acting, they were not seen to be acting or people who were busy with 
20 
acts of corruption knew that the Law Enforcement Agencies were not 
going to enforce the laws. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes that is precisely the point 
and that is particular reference to 1.5 and 1.9 which directs the Chair 
to examine the nature and extent of corruption.  
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 5 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Across a range of state owned 
entities and at all levels of government.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr McBride if 
we could go to paragraph 43 of your statement it is on page 9 of Exhibit 
Ya.   
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  I have it Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We – we will deal with the 
Werksmans Report as part of your evidence this morning in such detail 
10 
as may be appropriate but before we do that you will recall at 
paragraph 36 of your statement you raised the issue of the failure of 
communications between Werksmans on the one hand and yourself on 
the other. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I have been given two emails by 
the representative of Werksmans I presume in response to those 
allegations and the allegations regarding the incorrect addresses which 
were used as you state in paragraph 36.  Chair these will be handed 
up, copies will be made in due course and they will be included in the 
20 
bundles.  Just by way of background when you physically le ave the 
offices of IPID in 2015?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  It was the – my last day was the 24 
March 2015. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Prior to that any communication 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 6 of 170 
 
addressed to you at IPID would have been received had it been 
correctly addressed? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The communications you 
referred to in paragraph 36 of your statement.  When would those have 
occurred? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Well… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Or not occurred becaus e the 
communications were never received by you because you say incorrect 
addresses were used? 
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  These would have occurred for I was 
suspended because after I was suspended I would not have access to 
any documentation. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  So the two emails that 
were handed to the legal team are dated respectively 13 April 2015 and 
2 April 2015.  Just for the record would you look at them please and 
see if those are addressed correctly subject to of course the next 
question which is; were you there at all?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:   Thank you very much.  Thanks Chair.  
The one dated 13 April is directed to the acting executive director and 
20 
executive assistant and they are the correct email addresses.  And the 
one dated 2 April is addressed to me and it is a correct address of 
course but I am not there at this stage.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes you were no longer there.  
But it is shortly after that that you actually had an interview with 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 7 of 170 
 
Werksmans? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So the incorrect communications 
that you refer to in paragraph 36 would be relevant the period before 
you left? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct Chair.  It would have 
been helpful if copies of that email were sent by Werksmans.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The second issue I would like to 
deal with before we start again with your statement you testified to a 
press statement made by yourself in conjunction with Mr Pillay and Mr 
10 
Dramat? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Would you look at the documents 
now being shown to you please. Chair I will again hand up a copy to 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It will be included in the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We may deal with this at some 
stage or we may just place it on record and deal with it in submissions 
20 
or you may be recalled at some stage to detail the analysis that is 
begun in this article.  But in this article I understand there is an 
analysis of the state of play within Law Enforcement Agencies the 
similarities in various fields of investigation or non -investigation and an 
analysis of the possible causes and directions that the acts  of NPA are 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 8 of 170 
 
talking? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Much of it you already 
mentioned in your evidence but the question asked by the Chair which I 
ask you now is – is this a direct recording of your statement or is it 
extracts including commentary by the reporter?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Chair is a verbatim statement that was 
released by the three of us.  It is not commented on it is just – it is just 
published on this website.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Now is the one that we are talking about?  I know that 
10 
I have been given some document and the witness has been given 
some document.  I do not know if it is the same document, do we have 
the same document? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is the same document Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is the same document. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  About which you raised 
questions earlier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is there it will be paginated 
and included in the bundle. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But just to highlight some 
aspects of the article.  On the first page of the article the comment is 
made: 
“The events that the Directorate for Priority Crime 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 9 of 170 
 
Investigation DPCI or Hawks IPID the South African 
Revenue Service, Crime Intelligence and the SAPS, 
the State Security Agency, Denel and the National 
Prosecuting Authority are not unrelated.  There 
appears to be a remarkable coincidence in the 
methods 
used 
to 
remove 
officials 
from 
these 
institutions and the players involved and their 
intersecting interests.”  
Do you stand by that view?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It continues: 
“In our view a tax on individuals in these institutions 
are 
aimed 
at 
undermining 
the 
fight 
agai nst 
corruption.  A key part of all our mandates was to 
investigate cases of corruption.  In reviewing our 
individual experiences over recent weeks we have 
discovered a convergence in the cases that we were 
working on.” 
Do you stand by that? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes I stand by that Chair. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  A few lines on – well let us just 
continue that paragraph before we get to the next:  
" 
“A common thread is that cases under investigation 
involved individuals or entities with questionable  
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 10 of 170 
 
relationships to those in public office.  Most of these 
cases involve state tenders of some kind that were 
awarded 
due 
to 
patronage 
within 
influential 
individuals in public office.”  
Do you stand by that thesis?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes that is correct. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  The next paragraph reads: 
“The manner in which officials were removed has 
followed a similar pattern.  Internal documents or 
allegations from within institutions are leaked to 
10 
selected 
journalists 
working 
in 
tandem 
with 
anonymous sources, facts are distorted in the 
media.” 
Now we dealt with that briefly last time you gave evidence on Friday 
but I take it and there has been and will be evidence that there were 
press releases in relation to the rogue unit relevant to SARS, in 
relation to the Cato Manor incident.  Mr Booysen will testify to that and 
you have testified to the rendition saga that is three examples.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is that correct? 
20 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then you state that it is 
incorrect – it is uncertain how the leaks happened.  Over the page you 
say in paragraph 5: 
“In all institutions cited here the affective top 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 11 of 170 
 
leadership 
was 
removed 
and 
replaced. 
 
The 
replacements then institute  far reaching structural 
and operational changes in the institutions.”  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In the next paragraph: 
“But one it continues where matters have gone to 
court the courts have consistently found  in favour of 
the affected officials with cost orders against their 
institutions only for them to be suspended again and 
investigated on a new slate of allegations.  This was 
10 
so in the matters of Robert McBride, Ivan Pillay, 
Peter Richer, Anwa Dramat, Shad rack Sibiya, Johan 
Booysen and Glynnis Breytenbach amongst others.”  
And then towards the bottom of the page the analysis continues:  
“Corruption is the biggest threat to our constitutional 
democracy.  This cancer has turned former comrades 
against each other.  People who shared the same 
trenches in the fight for liberation are now at each 
other’s throats for the sake of protecting corrupt 
activities.” 
20 
Is this statement one you stand by and is it consistent with the analysis 
that the three of you engaged upon ? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes indeed Chair and I would go further 
and say a lot of what happened in this period that we identified has 
continued and is still continuing.  
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 12 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Now of course this is a 
high level analysis that you together with Mr Pillay and Mr Dramat have 
embarked upon.  It is something that the commission is investigating 
and will only make its own conclusions at the conclusion of all the 
evidence that it is to hear.  Insofar as your assistance may be req uired 
or the assistance of any other witness I take you quite happy to 
cooperate with the commission?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Absolutely. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we know that at the very 
least Mr Dramat and Mr Booysen together with many others to give 
10 
evidence in relation to the same theme of conclusions?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes indeed Chair including my own 
colleagues – former colleagues from IPID in particular Mr Khuba and Mr 
Sesoko. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well in the end an analysis of various events that 
occurred and why they occurred, the way they did and why they 
occurred at the time that they occurred you know will be important 
particularly in relation to the Law Enforcement sector.  I do not know 
what I will make of this analysis at the end but I am quite interested in 
20 
the analysis that was made by people who were involved in the events 
in one way or another at the time.  So Mr Pretorius has said that you 
may be – you may have to be of assistance I think that it will be 
important at some stage that as a witness who was party to the writing 
of this analysis that I get the benefit of hearing how you saw things and 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 13 of 170 
 
you be questioned on your analysis and you are able to defend it if you 
want to defend it and engage in a discussion of how justified that 
analysis is because I think it is quite important.  Of course as Mr 
Pretorius says there may be other who – who were party to writing it 
the same would go for them.  It would be important at some stage to 
look into – into those issues and – and give an opportunity to discuss 
the analysis and see how justified it was and you all get a chance to so 
to speak defend it or promote it or advance it so that at the end of the 
work of the commission it can be taken into acc ount in the knowledge 
that it is – it has been tested. 
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Thanks. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  And in the meanwhile we 
have to test the patience of the Chair and the public out there and deal 
with the detail. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If we can refer then to your 
statement before Werksmans and the statement is contained in one of 
the bundles; it is bundle B I think is it?  Exhibit Yb Chair.  We had 
begun with your statement on Friday and we we re busy dealing with 
extracts from your statement before Werksmans.  You raised a number 
20 
of points which we have already traversed Mr McBride.  And amongst 
those points was the propriety or lawfulness of the investigation as a 
whole and you have told the C hair your views in that regard.  Some of – 
if not all of which were vindicated by the constitutional court judgment 
which later followed.  But for the present let us just deal with page 888 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 14 of 170 
 
of Yb.   
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Thanks Chair have it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You talked about his statement did you mean the 
interview? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  My apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It was – this is a transcript of 
the interview which it seems common cause as a correct transcript.  Is 
10 
that correct Mr McBride?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Up to page 888 as you have told 
the Chair and just to place your further evidence in cont ext you have 
raised two issues.  One was the issue about communications between 
yourself and Werksmans prior to your conducting this interview or 
agreeing to this interview with Werksmans.  The second appears on 
page 888 where you say at line 8: 
“Then also the fact that a private law company is 
investigating a government investigative agency 
20 
albeit an independent one before the NPA had made 
a decision.” 
And then you expanded on that.  Do you recall?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes, yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You said:  
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 15 of 170 
 
“In essence IPID is accountable to parliament.  It is a 
constitutionally 
independent 
organisation 
and 
disciplinary proceedings may not be initiated by the 
Minister and that is – that principle is dictated by 
your constitutional independe nce.”   
And your further issue that you raised was:  
“That this is not an official state agency of oversight 
making the investigation but a private company.”  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Those were the issues you  
10 
raised.  If we can go then please to the judgment of the constitutional 
court to see how Acting Justice Bosielo came to his conclusions and to 
give an overview of the conclusions he reached in the constitutional 
court judgment in regard to the independenc e of IPID and the powers of 
the Minister.  It is bundle C Chair, page 1301.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Exhibit Yc I should say.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the page number again?  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  1301.   
CHAIRPERSON:  1301? 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  1301.  1301 Chair.  It was a 
unanimous judgment of the constitutional court.  The cover page is at 
page 1301.  I do not intend to take the Chair through the whole of the 
judgment but to go to paragraph 8 on page 1309.   Paragragph 8 read: 
Central to this applica – well perhaps we should just remind all 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 16 of 170 
 
concerned of the nature of the application.  It was an application in 
which you were the sole applicant, is that correct?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes at that stage but a t the genesis it 
was the organisation and myself.  This will become important the 
distinction I make now. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  About that.  So it was IPID and myself. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And the respondents 
were the Minister of Police and the Minister for Public Service and 
Administration? 
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Because it is not clear at all 
times what power the Minister was relying on, is that correct? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes that is correct and also that the 
Public Service and Administration regulates departments within the 
public service. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And as friend of the court 
amicus curiae the Helen Suzman Foun dation was also a party that 
made submissions? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It dealt with your challenge to 
your suspension, is that correct?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  If we could go to 
paragraph 8 then.  Paragraph 8 reads:  
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 17 of 170 
 
“Central to this application is a crisp question 
whether in the light of the applicable statutory 
framework IPID enjoys adequate structural and 
operation independence as envisaged by Sectio n 
206(6) of the Constitution to ensure that it is 
affectively 
insulated 
from 
undue 
political 
interference.” 
The background then is set out in paragraphs 9 and following.  
Paragraph 9 is summarised or summarises some of the background.  It 
reads: 
10 
“At the time when Mr McBride took office on 
3 March 2014 there was a political storm brewing 
over 
the 
alleged 
unlawful 
rendition 
of 
four 
Zimbabwean 
Nationals 
in 
November  2010 
and 
January 2011.  Lieutenant General Anwar Dramat 
the then head of the Directorate for Pri ority Crime 
Investigation and Major General  Sibiya then the 
Provincial 
Head 
of 
Gauteng 
were 
allegedly 
implicated in these unlawful renditions.”  
Correct? 
20 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you have stated that the 
investigations were first initiated under Crime Intelligence?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 10: 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 18 of 170 
 
“IPID initiated an investigation into this matter 
overseen by Advocate Mosing of the National 
Prosecuting 
Authority 
assisted 
by 
Mr Innocent Khuba 
the 
Provincial 
Head 
IPID 
Limpopo.  On 22 January 2014 IPID issued its first 
report the January Report which concluded that 
General Dramat and General Sibiya were involved 
in the illegal renditions of the Zimbabweans.  It 
recommended that criminal charges be brought 
against them.” 
10 
That is qualified by your evidence which says that prior to the 
investigation 
by 
IPID 
Crime 
Intelligence 
had 
conducted 
its 
investigation? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then paragraph 11: 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Actually as I understood you they kind of 
handed over to – Crime Intelligence handed over to IPID to say 
continue? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes Chair.  I think for the purposes of 
the judgment and the Constitutional challenge the exact details were 
20 
not brought. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Intervenes]. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Before the court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  And hence Judge Bosielo is raising the 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 19 of 170 
 
issues as is evident and in front of you.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no that is no that is fine.  I think, I think 
Mr Pretorius and I were not asking because we were saying this is no 
accurate but to say we have had the benefit of more details from you.  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 11 reads: 
“Mr Khuba explained in his affidavit that because he 
regarded the January Report as provisional he 
continued 
with 
his 
investigations. 
 
His 
10 
investigations gave birth to a second report dated 
18 March 2014.  The March Report which was 
signed by Mr Khuba, Mr Matthews Sesoko Chief 
Director 
IPID 
Investigation 
and 
Information 
Management and Mr McBride.  Contrary to the first 
report the second report concluded that there was 
no 
evidence 
implicating 
General Dramat 
and 
General Sibiya in the illegal renditions of the 
Zimbabweans.  As a result it recommended that no 
criminal charges be brought against them.  This 
20 
report was submitted to the National Director of 
Public Prosecutions for a decision on possibl e 
prosecution on 13 April 2015.” 
Is that correct? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 20 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You have testified in addition to 
the matters dealt with by the Constitutional Court with the distinction 
between the report on the one hand and the statements contained in 
the docket or case files on the other?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We do not need to address that 
again. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Although the report being the 
March or second report differed from the first report.  All the underlying 
10 
evidence remained unchanged in the case file or docket?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 12: 
“Faced with the glaring discrepancies in the two 
reports the Minister suspected serious tampering.  
As a result he commissioned Werksmans Attorneys 
to investigate the two reports.  Relying on the 
January Report and the investigation by Werksmans 
the Minister invoked th ese powers in terms of 
Section 66 of the IPID Act, the Public Service Act 
20 
and Chapter 7 of the Senior Management Services 
Handbook and placed Mr  McBride on precautionary 
suspension on 24 March 2015.  Acting on the 
strength of Section 66(A) of the IPID Act read with 
the provisions governing disciplinary proceedings 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83

under 
the 
Public 
Service Act 
and 
the 
IPID 
Regulations the Minister served Mr  McBride with a 
notice to attend a disciplinary inquiry.”  
And then reference is made to the High Court judgment and the findings 
made by the High Court which to a greater or a lesser extent were 
confirmed by the Constitutional Court.  Paragraph 13 reads:  
“The Minister’s actions stung Mr  McBride into a 
defensive mode.  Mr McBride instituted an urgent 
application before the H igh Court firstly for an 
interim interdict to restrain the Minister from 
10 
suspending him and secondly for an order declaring 
certain sections of the IPID Act.”  
Well let me read directly. 
“Section 63(A) and Section 66 of the IPID Act, 
Regulation 13 of the IPID Regulations, Sections 
16A(1), 16B, 17(1) and (2) of the Public Service Act 
only insofar as they apply to the Executive Director 
of IPD.” 
And I am going to elide the quote a little.  
“Certain paragraphs of the SMS Handbook declaring 
20 
them constitutionally invalid and setting them aside.  
In addition Mr McBride sought an order to review 
and set aside the decision by the Minister to 
suspend him as the Executive Director of IPID and 
to institute disciplinary proceedings against him.  
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 22 of 170 
 
The Minister then opposed the application.” 
Paragraph 15 if we can skip a few – at least one paragraph. 
“The High Court found that the independence of 
IPID 
is 
expressly 
guaranteed 
and 
protected 
guaranteed and protected under 206(6) of the 
Constitution which is significant and decis ive.” 
That is a quote from the – the words significant and decisive are a 
quote from the High Court judgment.  
“Furthermore the High Court reason that given that 
IPID performs overlapping anti-corruption functions 
10 
with the DPCI – that is the Hawks – it must be 
afforded at least the equivalent protections that the 
Constitution requires for DPCI.  In Glenister – that 
is another judgment of the Constitutional Court – 
Glenister II this court found that the independence 
of 
the 
DPCI 
was 
an 
implicit 
constitutional 
requirement 
flowing 
from 
Section 
2 
of 
the 
Constitution and the threat to South Africa posed by 
endemic corruption.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Section 7(2) Mr Pretorius. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I am sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you read Section 2 flowing from Section 2. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did I?  It is Section 7(2).  I am 
sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Section 7(2), ja. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 23 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  “The High Court found 
that inasmuch as the DPCI is independent despite 
there 
being 
no 
expressed 
constitutional 
infringement of its independence by parity off 
reasoning 
“the 
effect 
of 
the 
constitutional 
infringement of the independence of IPID is that the 
operational and structural independence of IPID 
must be at least as strongly protected a s that of the 
DPCI.”” 
Do you see that? 
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You have given evidence 
Mr McBride of a range of incidence and occurrences which the legal 
team will consider and your contention is that on several fronts the 
independence of IPID was interfered with both in respect of 
investigations of IPID and in respect of proceedings instituted against 
yourself and other officers of IPID.  Is that correct?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that was the basis upon 
which you went to the Constitutional Court?  
20 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Specifically in this case in 
relation to disciplinary proceedings?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct.  Against in particular 
myself. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 24 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then paragraph 16 reads: 
“The High Court went further to hold that IPIDs 
constitutionally guaranteed independence requires 
more stringent protection.  This is because unlike 
the DPCI which is situated within SAPS – the South 
African Police Services – IPID is institutionally and 
functionally independent from SAPS.”  
And then at the end of paragraph 16 the Constitutional Court makes the 
following further comment on the High Court judgment.  
“In this regard the High Court held that IPIDs 
10 
oversight role over the DPCI would be compromised 
and might create room for political interference to 
seep through and render the DPCIs independence 
nugatory.” 
It appears that the observation made by the High Cou rt quoted by or 
referred to by the Constitutional Court was that the independence of 
IPID on the hand and the Hawks on the other are interrelated and 
functionally both need to be protected in order to guarantee the 
constitutional independence of each of th em.  It that correct? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
And 
then 
paragraph 
17:  
crucially the High Court held that the various sections of the various 
pieces of legislation I have referred to are inconsistent with Sec tion 
206(6) of the Constitution in particular and I quote once more:  
“This was based on the fact that the impugned 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 25 of 170 
 
sections do not provide for parliamentary oversight 
in relation to the suspension, discipline or removal 
of the Executive Director and that t hey afford the 
Minister unilateral powers and the sole discretion to 
terminate the Executive Directors tenure.”  
Apart from the more general observations that is a narrow issue 
considered by the Constitutional Court.  Then if we can move to 
paragraph 24 where the Constitutional Court made the following 
remarks: 
“IPID is an independence police complaints body 
10 
established in terms of Section 206(6) of the 
Constitution.  Section 4(1) of the IPID Act requires 
it to function independently of the South African 
Police Services.  This is to ensure that IPID is able 
to investigate cases or complaints against the 
police without any fear, favour or prejudice or 
undue external influence.  Section 4(2) of the IPID 
Act requires that each organ of state assist the 
Directorate to maintain its impartiality and to 
perform 
its 
functions 
affectively. 
 
Importantly 
20 
Section 2 of the IPID Act requires IPID to play an 
oversight role over SAPS and municipal police 
services.  Given the nature, scope and importance 
of 
the 
role 
played 
by 
police 
in 
preventing 
combatting and investigating crime IPIDs oversight 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 26 of 170 
 
role is of cardinal importance.  This is aimed at 
ensuring accountability and transparency by SAPS 
and the municipal police services in accordance 
with the principles of the Constitution.” 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And your evidence if it is to be 
summarised in a single concept is that that independence was on a 
number of occasions testified to by you.  It did not occur?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then if we can go through to 
10 
paragraph 39 please?  The Constitutional Court remarks here:  
“To subject the Executive Director of IPID which the 
Constitution demands to be independent to the laws 
governing the Public Service to the extent that they 
empower the Minister to unilaterally and interfere 
with the Executive Director’s tenure is subversive of 
IPID’s institutional and functional independence as 
it turns the Executive Director into a public servant 
subject to the political control of the Minister.”  
Paragraphs 40 and 41 which I intend also to read onto the record 
20 
expand upon this point.  Paragraph 40 reads:  
“Without adequate independence, it would be easy 
for the Minister to usurp the power of the Execu tive 
Director under the guise of exercising political 
accountability or oversight over IPID in terms of 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 27 of 170 
 
Section 206(1) of the Constitution.  In this case 
acting 
unilaterally 
the 
Minister 
invoked 
the 
provisions of Section 16A(1) of the Public Service 
Act and placed Mr McBride on suspension and 
instituted disciplinary proceedings against him.  
Undoubtedly such conduct has the potential to 
expose 
IPID 
to 
constitutionally 
impermissible 
executive or political control.  That action is not 
consonant with the notio n of the operational 
autonomy of IPID as an institution.  Put claiming it 
10 
is 
in 
consistent 
with 
Section 
206(6) 
of 
the 
Constitution.  It follows that it is invalid and must 
be set aside.” 
It may be and we will address this issue and it may be rather an 
obvious conclusion to draw that the Werksmans investigation which we 
are dealing with at present fell within the ambit of those suspension 
and 
disciplinary 
proceedings 
and 
should 
accordingly 
also 
be 
disregarded 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
obeying 
the 
constitutional 
independence prescripts of the Constitution.  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Absolutely. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that was the point you 
raised? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 41 reads: 
“All this should be seen against the extensive 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 28 of 170 
 
powers IPID has to investigate the police.  Section 
28 of the IPID Act authorises the Directorate to 
investigate a whole variety of matters.”  
They are then mentioned.  You have testified to those in your evidence.  
It continues further down: 
“Section 28(1)(g) authorises the Directorate to 
investigate 
corruption 
within 
the 
police 
while 
Section 
28(2) 
empowers 
the 
Directorate 
to 
investigate systemic corruption within the police 
force.  There have in recent years been alleged 
10 
instances of police brutality and killings perpetrated 
against civilians.  Undoubtedly these are very 
serious matters which affect the public.  Naturally 
the public has a direct interest in seeing these 
matters being vigorously pursued and properly 
investigated.  IPID has given this responsibility.  It 
is cast in the role of a watchdog over the police.  It 
is therefore necessary to its credibility and the 
public confidence that it be not only independent 
but that it must also be seen to be independent to 
20 
undertake 
this 
daunting 
task 
without 
any 
interference actual or perceived by the Minister.”  
Then if I may go finally to paragraph 43 Mr  McBride.  It reads: 
“To my mind the accumulative effect of the 
impugned sections has the potential to diminish the 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 29 of 170 
 
confidence the public should have in IPID as the 
amicus curiae emphasised in its submissions both 
the independence and the appearance of an 
independent IPID are central to this matter.  The 
manner in which the Minister dealt with Mr  McBride 
demonstrates 
without doubt 
how 
invasive the 
Minister’s powers are.  What exacerbates the 
situation is that he acted unilaterally.  This destroys 
the very confidence which the public should have 
that IPID will be able without undue political 
10 
interference to investigate complaints aga inst the 
police fearlessly and without favour or bias.  IPID 
must therefore not only be independent but must be 
seen to be so.  Without enjoying the confidence of 
the public IPID will not be able to function 
effectively as the public might be disinclined o r 
reluctant to report their cases to it.”  
The conclusion is based on the above exposition and this is paragraph 
44.  I conclude that: 
“The impugned sections do not pass constitutional 
20 
muster.  It follows that the order of constitutional 
and invalidity by the High Court must be confirmed.”  
And then as a result of that analysis in paragraph 58 certain sections of 
the various statutory provisions or statutes were declared invalid.  
Paragraph 4 on page 1329 of EXHIBIT YC reads:  
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 30 of 170 
 
“It is declared that the decision  of the Minister of 
Police to suspend Mr Robert McBride from his 
position as Executive Director of the Independent 
Police Investigative Directorate is invalid and is set 
aside.” 
And paragraph 6 reads: 
“It is declared that the decision of the Minister of 
Police to institute the disciplinary inquiry against 
Mr Robert McBride which was to commence on 
21 May 2015 is invalid and is set aside.”  
10 
That was the outcome of the judgment.  So insofar as the disciplinary 
proceedings instituted as the consequence of a dec ision by the Minister 
– the relevant Minister were set aside that would inevitably cast a 
shadow over the part of the investigations leading up to your 
recommended dismissal conducted by Werksmans at the instance of the 
Minister. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is that your understanding of the 
matter? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If we can then return then to 
your statement or rather the transcript of your interview before 
Werksmans.  You say - it is recorded that you say in the paragraph at 
the bottom of page 888 and we are back now (advocate moves away 
from mic). 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 31 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, I have got it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  On page 888 of the transcript 
you are recorded as having said: 
“On my appointment I had asked for a briefing on 
all high profile cases including the matter of Sibiya 
and Dramat, the rendition saga.”  
You see that? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct, yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You explain that to Werksmans, 
Mr July as you have already testified to the Chair.  Is that correct?  
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At the bottom of page 889 you 
and because these are your words perhaps you should place them on 
record.  What did you tell Werksmans concerning the investigation by 
Crime Intelligence?  If you could just read the first few lines of the last 
paragraph on page 889 of EXHIBIT YB.  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  The second issue. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No, the first issue. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Okay. 
“My issue in the briefing…”  
20 
And I cannot remember the exact sequence of events.  
“…was firstly Crime Intelligence was involved in the 
case from the beginning.  [Intervenes].”  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The second issue you raised. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  “The second issue was that 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 32 of 170 
 
my predecessor acting Ms  Mbeki had told Khuba – 
Mr Khuba just report directly to me.  Do not report 
to.” 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Do not report to. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  And. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  There is a word missing.  What 
would that word be? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Sesoko. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and then at line five you 
make certain further remarks. 
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE: 
 
“So 
for 
me 
already 
independence in the investigation was compromised 
the way it had been said.  In other words bypassed 
ahead of investigations.  Those were my issues 
immediately that was my concern.”  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So right at the outset it appears 
you raised two issues before Werksmans.  The one was the general 
complaint really a constitutional issue as it turned out.  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That the Minister should initiate 
20 
these proceedings against you at least furt her to the extent of 
employing a private law firm – Werksmans – to conduct the 
investigation. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Thanks Chair and also just to say in the 
interview with Mr July I am reporting on my first meeting with Mr  Khuba 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 33 of 170 
 
and the immediate concer ns that I raised with him when being brought 
up to date with the circumstances in which this case arrived at IPID.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So not only are you 
raising the – let us put it – the external concern that the Minister had 
initiated this whole process. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we have dealt with the 
Constitutional Court judgment in that respect but also the receipt by 
you of issues that concerned you about the internal independence of 
the whole investigative process not only the fact that Crime Intelligence 
10 
had conducted the investigation as we know into its own members and, 
but secondly that even within IPID the independence of the 
investigation seemed to be compromised.  All those issues were placed 
before Werksmans? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And what you are also saying to 
Werksmans as I understand it is that when you asked for your report 
and you received the report on your assumption of office t hese matters 
were related to you and they were of some concern to you about the 
proprietary of the whole investigation that led to the issuing of what 
20 
may be termed the first report.  Am I correct?  That is the remark you 
have just made. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes.  That is my, my concerns about 
how the document reads, the docket reads.  IPID, how it was prepared 
by Crime Intelligence and the involvement of Crime Intelligence and the 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 34 of 170 
 
exclusion of the National Head of Investigations and sinister secrecy 
attached to what was expected of Mr  Khuba which Mr Khuba raised also 
with me initially that he himself was concerned but was put under 
undue pressure. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then you raised a further issue 
at the top of page 890.  Would you place tha t on record please?  From 
line 2. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes. 
“This is what I was told.  Then also that…”  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  By Khuba? 
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes.  That is right sir. 
“Then also that he must work with the Crime 
Intelligence guy and the Crime Intelligence guy also 
linked him up with Advocate  Mosing.  So for me 
already independent investigation was compromised 
the way it had been said.  In other words bypassed 
the Head of Investigations.  Those are my issues 
immediately.  That was my concern.” 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Continue then at line 10. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE: 
 
“I 
was 
also 
concerned 
20 
because it became apparent that Crime Intelligence 
operatives were involved in the arrest of the 
Zimbabweans themselves.  They were als o involved 
in the illegal repatriation.  Those are my concerns.  
Then I questioned because there were many people 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 35 of 170 
 
involved who was involved at what stage in this 
crime that you mentioned to me and to what extent.  
I also asked what crime has been committed  by who 
and who was involved in it.  What are the elements 
of that crime?  That is what it was.  Basically that is 
what it was.” 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just before you go on it appears 
as we have already remarked to the Chair that Crime Intelligenc e were 
in effect investigating their own members?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Have any of the members of 
Crime Intelligence being arrested?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  They have been arrested prior to this 
incident. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  By whom? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  By some of those making statements 
which were brought to IPID had been arrested by General  Sibiya on a 
previous occasion when General  Mdluli was appearing in court 
subsequent to having been  arrested by General Sibiya.  General Sibiya 
and his team then arrested some of the same Crime Intelligence people 
20 
who were dressed in plain clothes and were putting the DPCI Team 
under surveillance and they were then approached by General  Sibiya 
and his team and were arrested on suspicion of about to commit a 
crime. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
Right. 
 
So 
against 
the 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 36 of 170 
 
background of what you were told by Mr Khuba in relation to the 
independence in various respects of the whole investigation relating to 
the rendition or saga and your concerns about the independence of the 
IPID investigation and the proprietary of the investigation you then say 
to Werksmans you decided to go back to square one as we said last 
week and deal with the essential elements of any c rime that might have 
been committed to do two things, one to review the whole investigation 
to date, arising from your concerns, and two, to complete the 
investigations by reference to further evidence including an analysis of 
the cell phone data, is that what you in effect told Werksmans?  
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes I also indicated to them, I’m not 
sure where it is in the transcript that I had asked that Cecil could be 
involved in all aspects of the supervision of the review and completion.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Then if you go to page 891 at 
line 4 what did you tell Werksmans there?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  891 we were dealing with the General 
Piyaga matter, and on this matter of the Hawks Rendition and Crime 
Intelligence, if my memory serves m e correctly there was some 
outstanding statements or warning statements at the stage when they 
spoke to me.  If I’m not mistaken it could be Sibiya’s warning 
20 
statement. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   And then against line 15 you 
are asked a question by Mr  July, what was that question?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  He says can I also clarify this, in that 
meeting did Khuba indicate to you that on the 22 n d of January I 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 37 of 170 
 
submitted the report to the NPA.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   And your answer? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  I answered as follows: 
“No, no, no, no what he did tell me was that he was in 
discussions with Advocate Mosing.”  
No he didn’t tell me and I don’t think he would have, and I don’t want to 
think on his behalf because the investigation was not com plete as there 
were outstanding statements.  In face I think there was a statement 
from Jenny Irish Koboshiyane in that thing.  I can’t remember the 
context of it ...(intervention)  
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   You don’t have to go on 
because that’s not entirely central to the questions that we need to deal 
with.  At the bottom of page 892 you make a remark concerning your 
knowledge, at least at the time about whether you would see each and 
every report or whether the Executive Director would see each an d 
every report that goes through to the NPA, would you just explain the 
position then, I’m referring to your statement at line 22.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Chair if I can just go back to the 
previous one, I am already expressing to Mr July the absurdity of  
placing reliance on a preliminary report when there are still outstanding 
20 
statements and other evidence to be included in the docket.  In that 
891 in the way I answer there, it’s – that’s why I’m actually giving him a 
long explanation, it was already obvi ous that the fact that there was an 
existence of another report and that it was changed removed the basic 
common sense from all those who had been involved in it, in 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 38 of 170 
 
investigating this investigation, that actually everything that had taken 
place was lawful and that the changes that were later made in the 
report did not affect the evidence in its totality in the docket, but there 
seems to be an obsession with the existence, the mere existence of 
another previous preliminary report.  It was for me – and it blinded 
people from seeing that actually of that was in order and that the 
additional evidence had to be put in.   
 
Basic issues even myself not as a lawyer know that all 
evidence has to be considered in its totality, and other people who are 
lawyers were just missing it. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Alright.  You – what is the 
position with reports, is it true that on occasion Provincial Heads in 
IPID would send reports directly to the NPA without them going past 
you? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Chair often they don’t – they wouldn’t 
even reach Mr Khuba because the Provincial Heads within the Province 
are appointed there precisely to engage with the NPA in completion of 
investigations and the regulations and the SOP’s I can’t remember 
...(intervention)  
ADV 
PAUL 
JOSEPH 
PRETORIUS 
SC : 
 
 
Standard 
Operating 
20 
Procedures? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Procedures yes, which one specifically 
deals with this, but Provincial Heads must then submit to the NPA.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   But how does that then gel with 
the statutory requirements that the Executive Director must sign 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 39 of 170 
 
reports.  It seems that there’s a mismatch there.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Ja, the issues relates to when it’s an 
investigation driven from the National Office, then the appropriate 
person to send it to the NPA would be me, in terms of the regulations 
and part of the Act, and if it involves more than one province as was 
the situation in this case. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   I must say I didn’t when we 
dealt with the statutory requirements di dn’t understand the statutory, to 
make that distinction between Provincial and National Report, it 
seemed to be a blanket provision that all reports to the NPA and I 
10 
presume that means final decisive reports, must go through the 
Executive Director, that’s as I read the statute, but perhaps I’m wrong 
and perhaps you can correct me. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes the issue says the Provincial Head 
or the Executive Director, as the case might be, that’s the legislation in 
the Act, or it’s – Regulation 5 ja, it mentions both. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   We will just check that.  Then 
on page 893 you deal with further material before Werksmans in regard 
to your knowledge of what reports provisional or otherwise had gone 
through to the NPA and at line 5 ...(inte rvention)  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry Mr Pretorius I don’t know whether maybe it 
might be worthwhile just mentioning what the statute says in regard to 
that issue because at least Section 7(4) to the extent that that is the 
provision we are talking about, it doesn’t also refer to a report, it 
simply says the Executive Director must refer criminal offences 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 40 of 170 
 
revealed as a result of an investigation to the National Prosecuting 
Authority for criminal prosecution and notify the Minister of such a 
referral.  Would that be the provision that we are talking about when we 
talk about the requirement that the Executive Director is the one who 
must refer matters to the NPA, or that would be another one?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Chair indeed it is that provision that is 
within the Act and the relevant regulation.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  And the Standard Operating Procedure 
read together so there’s a specific one dealing with that.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Including reports, talking about reports for example in 
terms of the regulations or that’s where reference to reports might be.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct Chair, on my first day of 
testimony we covered it, and I read it out that provision which deals 
with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  And also to understand the practicality 
of every report come through the Executive Director, it will be a bottle 
neck. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  And hence that’s why the Provinces 
deal with the relevant DPP. 
ADV 
PAUL 
JOSEPH 
PRETORIUS 
SC : 
 
 
How 
many 
reports 
approximately per year would the IPID transfer to the NPA?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  It would be thousands Chair, it would 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 41 of 170 
 
be thousands. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Alright but the overall duty to 
refer or to ensure that referral takes place I suppose possible to read 
into 74 is that of the Executive Director?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes correct.  In fact if I can just clarify, 
the Werksmans’ report for whatever it’s worth, extracts that particular 
provision that it, I think it’s a Regulation 3 (5)(i) in the report which 
deals with this aspect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Ja, so we dealt with it on my first day of 
10 
testimony. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   And the regulations which 
appear at page 62 talk of the investigation of criminal matters, that’s 62 
of Exhibit YH.  The investigation must be done in accordance with 
regulation 5, the Executive Director or the relevant Provincial Head 
must designate an inspector and then regulation 4(e) reads:  
“If the Executive Director or relevant Provincial Head as the 
case may be determines that a full investigation is warranted 
the investigator must as soon as is practicable but within 24 
20 
hours after determination ...”  
And then I go to (e): 
“after collecting all evidence, statements, technical and expert 
reports...” 
And I stress  
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 42 of 170 
 
“after collecting all evidence, statements, technical and expert 
reports if applicable submit a final report on the investigation 
to the Executive Director or the relevant Provincial Head as 
the case may be containing recommendations regarding further 
action which may include disciplinary measures or criminal 
prosecution of a member.”  
So it appears that as far as the regulations are concerned the 
Provincial Head may act in addition to the Executive Director being 
obliged to submit referrals in terms of the legislation.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  And that would be specifically with 
10 
offences committed within that specific Province.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Right.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBR IDE:  It’s not clarified like that but it’s taken, 
that’s the purpose of the Provincial Head.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   In any event quite separately 
from that you were making two points to Werksmans, in fact in 
accordance with your evidence more but the two principal points for the 
moment were that you weren’t aware of an original or provincial report?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  At that stage? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   At that stage. 
20 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   So you became aware later.   
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   The second point you make is 
that at the time you received your report from Khuba in January of 2014 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 43 of 170 
 
you were satisfied that the investigation was not complete.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Just ...(intervention)  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   You ordered a review and the 
procurement of further evidence?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Ja, that was in March upon my arrival, 
in March 2014.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Sorry March 2014, that was 
when the report was made, my error.  Then in paragraph, well the first 
paragraph on page 893 from line 5 what did you say to Werksmans?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  So I’m doing this interview with 
10 
Werksmans in 2015, 17 t h of April and I say to them at this stage what I 
know is there’s one report I have seen which I have signed, the only 
issue on that report was that it was badly written, there was spelling 
errors, grammar and stuff like that, there were no other issues.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And then the question put to 
you at line 14 what was that question?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  This is Mr July? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:   
“Let’s make this supposition, if you knew about the existence 
20 
of the report which had been given to the NPA would you have 
asked for that report which had gone to the NPA?”  
My response: 
“Well the investigation was not completed.”  
That was my impression, if you recall from the papers we had briefed 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 44 of 170 
 
Minister Ntetwa on the status of various of these high profile cases, it 
was just a status report and it was soon afterwards, I think I indicated 
it in that report that these cases were in the process of being finalised.  
It’s in that information note that you will see, just as my me mory serves 
me now, as you ask me questions I am being reminded, therefore the 
investigation was not complete because in the info note I mentioned 
that the investigations were in the process of being completed.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Then again you are asked a 
question at line 7, what was that, of page 894?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Okay, Mr July: 
10 
“If Khuba says the investigation was completed but there was 
new evidence that came up would he be right in that?”  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Aside from the logic in that 
question just continue. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Ja, he said and he quotes Khuba now:  
“I had completed the investigation but there was this new 
evidence about the cell phones in relation to Sibiya which 
needed to be tightened up.”  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   And then your answer? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Chair he is actually contradicting 
20 
himself in his question, because he is saying:  
“Khuba says the investigation is complete, but there’s other 
evidence that needs to be dealt with.” 
Therefore whatever Khuba said, whatever Mr July says Khuba says the 
investigation cannot be complete if there’s still additional evidence to 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 45 of 170 
 
add to it, it’s just illogical.  I’m not sure why such a stark contradiction 
is not picked up. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Yes that’s – it says what it says, 
and in the first sentence Werksmans say to you:  
“Khuba says the investigation is complete but there’s new 
evidence, the investigation is complete but I’ve got to 
investigate further matters.”  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Ja.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  We will see what Khuba said in 
due course and if necessary hear Mr Khuba, but the logic is open 
10 
...(intervention)  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Chair ...(intervention)  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  ...at least on the face of it to 
question. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Chair it’s painful to look at this because 
the more I go back to it I see it was quite obvious even to Mr July, it 
should have been, that actually what they were on about was an non -
event.  Why they still persisted becomes stranger and stranger, as I go 
back through this transcript. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it possible to look at it this way, that Mr Khuba 
20 
when he submitted the first report regarded the investigation as 
complete at that stage, and that whatever  new evidence came up, came 
up later, which might strictly speaking have meant that once there was 
new evidence it should thereafter no longer have been regarded as 
complete, but from his point of view prior to new evidence coming up is 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 46 of 170 
 
it possible that that’s what they are talking about, you know the 
situation much better than I do because you’ve looked at all of these 
things and dealt with them. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Chair in my engagements with Khuba 
initially on the first day and subsequently and eve n until recently he 
has never on one occasion told me that that January report was a 
completed report.  He also has indicated to me that he made this known 
to Mr Mosing, but one has to place it in the context of being pressured 
by Nxlamesa and by Mosing an d even though indicated to Mosing it 
hasn’t been signed by my Executive Director Mosing insisted that it 
10 
comes to him.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hmm, hmm. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  So that has been Khuba’s position for 
ever since the first day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so these, so what Mr July was telling you I think 
he started by saying suppose, I’m not sure whether that’s – but to the 
extent that he was telling you that Mr Khuba’s version was that that 
first report the investigation and that first report was final and tha t 
investigation was complete to the extent that that’s what he was saying 
Mr Khuba told him that was news to you.    You had not  heard that from 
20 
Khuba or anybody before?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Chair not only was it news to me, I had 
not heard that, I immediately became suspicious because I had never 
been told that, I last came across this strategy of but they said this and 
if they said this which would be to put a falsity to you, I last came 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 47 of 170 
 
across this while I was being detained and tortured under Secti on 29 in 
1986, is to force a confession out of you on a false supposition which is 
then put to you so that’s what it reminded of and my suspicion became 
heightened, by why say something to subsequently a number of issues 
which Mr July put to me about that Mr Khuba said, Khuba actually in his 
various statements subsequently says he didn’t say and actually draws 
our attention to aspects in his interview with Mr July where he says 
things  which are opposite to which Mr July put as purporting to come 
from Mr Khuba to us, so that was a major concern during the interview 
and it’s ... 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  You just for reference purposes 
Chair you deal with this at page 1018 at one of your affidavits where 
you say in the court application, to which we’ve referred at paragraph 
32, to avoid overburdening the papers in this matter I do not attach 
copies of the full transcripts of the interviews conducted by Werksmans 
with Khuba, Sesoko and Mosing, I attach only the pages that I re fer to 
in this affidavit and then you offer to provide the full transcript to the 
Court, but then in paragraph 33 you say:  
“In the light of the facts attested to by Khuba and Sesoko and 
20 
regardless of what Mosing, Mokanqwe or Khub a may have 
believed at the time it is clear that the January 2014 report 
was not a final report.”  
This is because, and you talk about the outstanding evidence, warning 
statements 
and 
other 
matters, 
including 
compliance 
with 
the 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 48 of 170 
 
regulations.  Those are all summarised there, we’ve ref erred to them I 
think in evidence, but what I want to do is go to page 30, page 1020 of 
the same affidavit and that 1020 is in Bundle ...  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr McBride say it’s Exhibit YC.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  YC correct Chair, paragraph 34. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What’s the page again? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  1020. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1220? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  No 1020 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1020, okay thank you.  Yes?  
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Reference is made to what 
Mosing said in his interview with Werksmans but can you recall from 
your own memory of reading the transcript, we’re going to check the 
transcripts now and there may be a discrepancy between what is said 
here and what Mr Mosing said and we are checking that and we will 
deal with it after the tea adjournment but you say in paragraph 34 here 
of the affidavit: 
“Mosing explained in his interview with Werksmans that he 
wrote the word “draft” on the January report on receiving it 
from Khuba because the report was not complete and you 
20 
attached the relevant pages of the transcript as RJM3.”  
Do you recall anything about that?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes, I remember that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Was it not an earlier October 
report that Mosing was referring to?   
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 49 of 170 
 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  I think the issue here is the January 
report at all times for the query, and it is that report, so Mosing 
advances this, he volunteers that he wrote draft on it, why  he 
advances it I’m not sure.  The moment you write draft on anything it 
means it cannot be a final report, whatever it is, whatever creative 
explanation he gives, he volunteers, I’m not sure, he should answer 
why he volunteered it but he wrong draft on the report and he then goes 
on to explain why he wrote draft in quite a creative way, but in any 
event from his explanation from memory on that interview he is dealing 
with additional evidence or statements, whilst he understates them in 
10 
his explanation he does give an explanation that something is 
outstanding.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETOR IUS SC:  In any event ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry Mr Pretorius, Mr McBride you are 
emphasizing the status of that first reports quite a lot, and I just want 
you to confirm that you emphasize its status as having been a 
preliminary report or not a final report, or the investigation relating to it 
not having been completed because the part of the point you make is 
that the moment it’s accepted that that report was not final, the moment 
it’s accepted that that investigation was not complete this  whole thing 
20 
about the charging of people falls away, and should have fallen away, 
the problem is why it was not recognised that that investigation was not 
complete and that that report was a preliminary report, that’s part of 
the point you make. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Chair that is part of the point, the 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 50 of 170 
 
second point would be, and this is hypothesis, assuming it was 
regarded by some people and I make it in this affidavit, as completed, 
the fact that there was additional evidence which was not factored in  
the first one, and that the changes that were made to the report, and 
not the evidence in the docket, were lawful and were proper and were 
necessary, also escapes all this range of lawyers in the process.  
 
 
If you take the factors perhaps in an isolated fashion each of 
the reasons that we are speaking about one could come to some 
reasonable but not acceptable explanation.  If you put the sequence of 
events together for me in my opinion there is a determination to find 
10 
guilty, or to find scapegoats so that  you can deal with your original 
aspect of getting rid of Dramat, so ultimately that’s the plan, whether 
everybody downstream knew exactly what the higher level plan was it’s 
up to them to explain and I think it would be helpful if they do explain, 
but if you take all these different aspects into account and the 
sequence of events and the failure for proper common sense to kick in 
with legally trained minds for me it’s problematic it’s difficult to find, to 
even understand perhaps an unacceptable explanatio n. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Perhaps it is correct Mr 
McBride that we are focussing too much on the extent to which other 
people focussed too much on the word “draft” or “provisional” or “final”.  
The truth of the matter is you raised when you were briefed in March 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 51 of 170 
 
2014 serious questions about the independence of the IPID report that 
was then in existence but – or the investigation rather that was then 
being conducted.  You say you were not aware of a formal report.  But 
notwithstanding the existence of a formal report – you had concerns 
which you have raised now which we have dealt with from time to time 
in your evidence. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And those were serious concerns 
about the independence of the investigation and the manner in which it 
was conducted.  You therefore ordered a review of the investigation and 
10 
the finalisation of the investigation in r egard to warning statements and 
in regard to cell phone record analysis, correct?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You then signed a report that 
took account of the further investigations directed under your 
command, is that correct?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then you submitted that.  So 
it seems that it is at least arguable that whatever the status of the so 
called first report or provisional report by whomever  it was signed and 
20 
whatever its purpose all including Advocate Mosing knew that there was 
further work to be done?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Absolutely. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And whatever opinion was 
recorded in the various reports it is still incu mbent upon the prosecutor 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 52 of 170 
 
to make his or her own decision not on the basis of IPID’s opinion but 
on the basis of the original evidence and the report?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Absolutely Chair absolutely. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Or in the file.  And that was 
never interfered with? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  In fact to go further Chair is that the – 
all statement including the dodgy statements as I refer to them that 
could not be substantiated were included in a docket.  So all evidence 
incriminatory and also the exculpatory evidence, so all was there and a 
prosecutor applying their mind could have come to a decision based on 
10 
what was there.  And none of that was altered.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And would have been obliged to 
come to an independent conclusion? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Absolutely. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Given the responsibilities of a 
prosecuting authority? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did any – did anybody ever say to you including Mr 
July or challenge or question your right to ask Mr Khuba to do further 
20 
investigations when you asked him after your appointment as Executive 
Director? Did anybody ever question whether there was anything wrong 
in you saying to Mr Khuba ‘just do further investigations here’, as you 
understood then? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Chair nobody questioned my right but 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 53 of 170 
 
nobody in all this process reflected on it.  That would be a normal 
common sense thing to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  To get an update on what are the key 
investigations this independent investigative directorate is busy with.  
It is – it would – it is logical.  Somewhere along the lines in the tone or 
whatever there was some dissatisfaction and a reading i n at least in 
their minds and in which I interpret it as that Khuba was called to my 
office almost as if it was as if me coming in – I summons people to my 
office and it was not right for a number of reasons including the fact 
10 
that Mr Sesoko had Mr Khuba’s  number.  I did not even have Mr 
Khuba’s phone number and I spoke – I arranged for Mr Khuba to come 
to the office via Mr Sesoko.  So that is what happened.  But there was 
this notion of Khuba says he was called to the office but the tone from 
memory was here was this new guy just ordering people about.  
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see it would have been important it seems that at 
least Werksmans, Mr July they look at that question whether you were 
entitled to ask Mr Khuba to do further investigations because if one 
20 
accepted that you did have that right and Mr Khuba did further 
investigations whatever he got out of that investigation – further 
investigation whether it was against General Dramat or in his favour in 
terms of prosecution had to be taken into account.  In this case you say 
it happened to be in his favour and if it was in his favour it had to be 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 54 of 170 
 
taken into account as well. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I imagine that there is an argume nt to say to the 
extent that Mr Khuba may in his earlier report have reached a 
conclusion that was inconsistent with the outcome of the further 
investigation.  He may well have been entitled to say well I cannot 
maintain that position in the light of what I have found out now. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the question is, if the minds were directed to these 
issues maybe certain conclusions would not have been reached and the 
10 
question is, I think from what you say is why they were – they escaped 
these issues as [indistinct] people?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  So thanks Chair.  I just want to – I want 
to add something else.  There was – and I even feel uncomfortable to 
say it now.  There was this notion that myself and Dramat are from the 
same background therefore I felt a sense in me to want to help him 
whatever the circumstances or merits of the investigation.  Where that 
sense or allegation came from I do not know.  When I said to them I 
myself I do not know Dramat, Dramat was on Robben Island  he was in 
prison with my father.   I then found later – read in a newspaper as like 
20 
innuendo here – in fact McBride’s father and Dramat were together on 
Robben Island.  And that is how it was said.  So every time you said 
something to show that actually b ear this mind whatever you think the 
way you put it that I actually personally do not know General Dramat.  
And I think I make the point in the interview.  I met him when I was – 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 55 of 170 
 
for the first time at IPID and in engaging with him as a – as an official 
in an assisted department.  That is then taken and misconstrued and 
fed to journalists as if it is still a sin and an offence to have been part 
of the liberation struggle.  So there was this – I do not know if it was 
the only way to say it and I say it on day s when I am not so irritated 
about it.  I say it is like some people got struggle envy.  I cannot help it 
if people were not born at different stages.  I mean I cannot have 
Rivonia envy.  I was not born here yet when former President Mandela 
and them decided to embark on that.  I – for me I revered them.  They 
gave us light.  But for me to start having resentments about them would 
10 
– is a foolishness and a sense of inadequacy that I can – I cannot 
understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair is this a convenient time 
and may I ask that because I need to traverse a  particular issue that 
has now emerged as to what Advocate Mosing might have said about 
the earlier report being a draft report.  I just need to check som ething 
with the witness if I may in relation to transcripts and the bundle.  I do 
not want to spend too much time on the detail of the label attached.  
CHAIRPERSON:  If you can avoid it. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To the first and second reports.  
What is clear is that further investigation needed to be done and if it 
had not been done there would have been a serious problem laid at Mr 
McBride’s door.  But I do want to just place one piece of evidence in 
this regard before you and then move on.  
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 56 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Are you asking for…  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The short adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A longer tea break? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Say twenty minutes Chair or 
twenty-five minutes? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Twenty minutes. Twenty-five minutes altogether? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes please. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  That will take us to twenty to twelve?  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will adjourn until twenty to twelve.   
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  We had to extend our break by a further 10 minutes 
at the request of Mr  Pretorius so that he could attend to something 
relating to the evidence.  Thank you.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Let us go to 
page 894 please. 
20 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Thanks Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of EXHIBIT YB.  This is a 
continuation of the transcript of your interview with Werksmans.  At 
page 894 line 14 you say what further investigation or work needed to 
be done.  That was a new analysis or an analysis of cellphone records.  
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 57 of 170 
 
Was it an analysis of a new analysis of cellphone records?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  In essence to make the distinction it 
was specifically an analysis related to towers.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  As to the. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But an analysis had to be done.  
I do not want to go into too much detail.  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And additional statements and 
warning statements you say?  
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the emphasis behind Mr  Pretorius earlier 
question may have been to seek to establish whether what was new 
was an analysis of information that had been in existence already or 
whether it was new information with new analysis.  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Chair it was – if I can put it this way - 
as far as I am aware there was, there was not any information related 
to cellphone analysis yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  In the docket. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  But some cellphone analysis was done 
but it involved as to who called who.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  But the issue relating to the towers.  
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 58 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is where this phone was on a 
particular day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Or on a particular set of dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Had not been done.  It now had been 
obtained and needed to be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Thank you. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then on page 896 you are asked 
- I just want to clarify this point.  At one stage you gave the docket  to 
the Minister and you say yes 14  April 2014.  Is that correct?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Ja.  During the interview I, I might have 
got the, the actual date wrong.  We are still awaiting the date of 
confirmation when the [intervenes].  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well you say 14 April 2014 the 
date it was signed.  Is that the docket?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you say later down the page 
20 
that it was in November  2014 that it was given. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That it was given to the Minister yes.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then over the page you say 
at line 10 that is page 897 of EXHIBIT YB that of course later on it 
became clear that the Minister disagreed with your report and that the 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 59 of 170 
 
Minister said as much in Parliament and we know said as much to IPID 
itself in March 2015. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And it was in Parliament that you 
told the Chair earlier last week that you approached the Ministe r and 
said that you had made a mistake and there was a way to deescalate 
the issue? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Not in Parliament.  It was at the 
stadium on [intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At the stadium in Cape Town.  
10 
Alright.  Whatever Mr  Khuba or Mr Mosing - Advocate Mosing - might 
have said to Werksmans we deal with separately.  They can account for 
what they said, but your evidence is or your interview with Werksmans 
is summarised at page 900 lines 3 to five.  Where you say:  
“All I know is three is one report with one set of 
dockets which I signed.  There is only one report I 
know.” 
You see that? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  (No audible reply). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Page 900 lines 3 to five.  You 
20 
see that. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes, I got that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That is what you said to 
Werksmans.  Is that correct?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct yes. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 60 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is that correct? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then at the bottom of the 
page it is put to you: 
“What you are saying you had with you at the time 
was an inclusive report.  You then say no, no I am 
not saying that.  Mr July please let us be honest 
with each other.  I did not say that.  I said I got the 
one final report or I got – I said I got one final 
report which I signed.  I did not say it was an 
10 
inclusive report.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Inconclusive hey? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  “I did not say it was 
inconclusive report.”  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So let me just repeat.  I may 
have got it wrong or not being clear.  It is put to you at the bottom of 
page 900: 
“What you are saying you had with you at the time 
was an inconclusive report and you say no , no I am 
20 
not saying that.  You have got one final report 
which you signed.  I did not say it was an 
inconclusive report.”  
There seems to be a possibility of confusion there about final or 
inconclusive reports in between the first and the second report.  
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 61 of 170 
 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  I am not sure why Mr July was 
confused at that stage and why he put it to me that I spoke about an 
inconclusive report that I had signed.  It is a – it does not fit in the 
context. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then if we can go to page 
904 please.  On several occasions during this interview you make it 
clear that you were aware at the time of a single report which was in 
your view the final report which you signed which contained the 
additional investigative results which you ha d directed.  That you 
repeat several times but on page 904 line 10 you say in relation to a 
10 
question from Mr July which reads as follows at line 4 on page 904:  
“In the same breath then we cannot ask you about 
the inconsistencies that exist between the two 
because you do not know anything about that.”  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Chair if I can just come in here.  That 
is very critical about the confusion of time and its passage because 
what I had indicated earlier is that in March on arrival in IPID I did not 
know about the report.  A year later Mr  July suggests to me well then a 
year later after everything and after signing the final report you cannot 
speak about inconsistencies between the two reports.  Whereas a year 
20 
later I would have seen all relevant repor ts relating to the subject but I 
think his, his question there is - basically expresses his confusion with 
the passage of time which I made a point on, on I think Friday to that 
one must be conscience of the passage of time and different things 
happen at different stages. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 62 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well as at the time of the 
interview 17 April 2015. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You do say at line 10 on page 
904: 
“I do not even think there are inconsistencies.  
There is additional evidence.  One report is longer 
than 
the 
other. 
 
One 
report 
has 
additional 
information to the other one.  One report has an 
analysis of cellphone records and it has warning 
10 
statements which is a normal thing.  So I would not 
say inconsistencies.  I would maybe say a change 
of analysis.  I know in one case they had to send a 
statement to be analysed to say whether the guy 
was truthful or not because of evidence which came 
out from a cellphone.”  
And it goes on. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At the bottom of the page 904: 
“Then they had to look at other people’s statements 
20 
again and analyse.” 
It should read then.  It is correct that aside from the additions or 
further evidence the final report which you signed differed from  the first 
report in that witness statements were quoted in the second report and 
those quotation differ from the quotes in the first report.  Am I correct?  
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 63 of 170 
 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Those are fully analysed in the 
Werksmans Report in a spreadsheet.  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You are aware of that? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The statements themselves you 
have repeatedly said remained in their original form?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It was an analysis of the 
10 
statements contained in reports?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Exactly and particularly what was the 
evidentiary value against the background of the new evidence.  So what 
had been said initially could – no reliance could be placed upon it.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So were certain quotations in 
the first report omitted from the second report?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What was the reason for that?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  According to Khuba they were of no 
evidentiary value. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and we will see what 
Khuba says about that. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes and even now if you read what was 
removed it is of no evidentiary value in terms of the.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Can you give one example to 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 64 of 170 
 
illustrate the point?  I am not going to go into a full analysis of all the 
transcripts. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  I think in one. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Because we made the general 
points about the report. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Ja, in one statement someone reports 
about someone going to a liquor store to buy some liquor.  In the 
scheme of things it is kind of irrelevant.  So Khuba leave it out and 
adds more relevant stuff.  So in terms of just stating from the original 
statements taking large, large chunks of quotations.  In the second 
10 
statement he is more particular about what the value is and stuff that 
sort of adds up the report with no evidentiary values removed.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We can put away that bundle for 
the moment then. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you do that can I just establish was it ever 
established who had made the alterat ions on that first report?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  I. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or you do not know? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  No, it is established. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Mr Khuba said he had made the 
necessary changes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Based on the new evidence.  So it was 
never in doubt that Mr Khuba said he had worked with Mr  Sesoko. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 65 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  On Mr Sesoko’s. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not Mr Sesoko.  Mr Sesoko?  I thought he had been 
given instructions not to. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Oh, in the first. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the first one.  I am talking about the first one.  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  [Intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one that was said to have been altered.  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  I am not aware of that.  That the first 
one. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let me repeat.  Maybe I have confused you.  
You know when we talk about alterations to a report, to the report here.  
As I understand it that is a reference to what we have referred to as the 
first report or preliminary report.  Now that is the report that had been 
done by Mr Khuba? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you were appointed Executive Director.  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I seem to get at some stage w hen I read some of 
the documents that it seemed to be unclear as to who may have 
20 
effected certain alterations on that first report.  So my question was 
whether as far as you know it was ever established as to who had 
effected those alterations. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  I think it is common cause between 
Mr Khuba and Mr Mosing. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 66 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That they would send the reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Of those preliminary reports to each 
other and on occasion Adv ocate Mosing would send it back to Khuba 
again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  With some alterations on whatever the 
issue was at that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  But it is not in dispute that that was 
taking place and that there was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, I accept – I understand that because you did say 
that I think last week insofar as one talks at a general level.  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am just talking about the specific alterations that 
Werksmans and the Minister were talking about which were from the 
basis of you being charged to say certain alterations were made.  They 
were made with a certain motive or intention whatever.  So those 
specific alterations those are the ones I am talking about whether i t 
20 
was established whether Mr  Khuba had made them or Mr  Mosing or was 
it never – was it in dispute as to who had effected them as far as you 
know? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Thanks Chair.  If I am understanding 
you correctly it would be - and to respond – it would be the report that 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 67 of 170 
 
was done during, after the review and the addition of the new evidence 
is the, the second report which Mr  Khuba then changed the analysis – 
the emphasis of analysis on the report under the supervision of 
Mr Sesoko and they had worked on Mr Sesoko’s computer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So, but the actual alteration was said to be on 
which report? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Well in essence the first report, 
preliminary report was changed. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  By Mr Khuba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  To accompany the docket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So it was the first report?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That was - that was changed, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but it was changed after there was the final 
report? 
20 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  The final report effectively changed.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That preliminary report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In that regard perhaps we could 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 68 of 170 
 
go to page 1237 of EXHIBIT YC.  This is a statement by Khuba on 
affidavit in the litigation to which you have referred.  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  I have it Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 21 reads: 
“After Sesoko and I were tasked by McBride with 
finalising the report.  I would visit the Pretoria 
Office from Limpopo whenever I could.  I would sit 
at Sesoko’s computer to make changes to the draft 
as we discussed them.  Sesoko and I, we evaluated 
all the evidence and debated what findings could 
10 
reliably and sustainably be made on the evidence.  
I would then effect the changes to the report on 
Sesoko’s computer.” 
Paragraph 22: 
“Sesoko’s input was important because he has a  
prosecutorial 
background. 
 
So 
has 
a 
good 
understanding of what findings a prosecutor would 
accept as sustainable.  He also brought a more 
objective perspective to bear on the evidence 
because 
he 
had 
not 
been 
involved 
in 
the 
20 
investigation.” 
And the next paragraph reads: 
“In finalising the report and presenting the final 
report to McBride for authorisation we thought to 
conduct a thorough critical and objective review of 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 69 of 170 
 
the totality of the evidence and to present only 
recommendations that were supported by credible 
evidence.” 
And then he goes on to contest the views of the Minister who criticises 
the acts of IPID in regard to the amendments.  If they could be called 
amendments to the first report.  Is that consistent with your 
understanding of the [intervenes]? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You would bear with me Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The first or the cover page of 
that affidavit just for record purposes is in Bundle YC – EXHIBIT YC at 
page 1225.  Just go to 1145.  Also in Bundle YC at page 1145 is 
Khuba’s statement during the course of the Werksmans interview that 
he held where he said at line 15: 
“The issue there was not even a single time where 
McBride said to me change the report to suit 
Dramat.  He might have made input.  He might have 
queried how things were done.  Sometimes the 
issue most especially the issue of having a Crime 
20 
Intelligence member he had a concern about it to 
say are you people not independent.”  
It seems that what Mr Khuba is saying there is that you took Khuba to 
task in relation to the independence of the investigation and he is also 
saying that you never told him to change the report to suit Dramat.  
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 70 of 170 
 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is that correct? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then in paragraph 43 of your 
statement if we can go back to page 9 at last you say:  
“A critique of the Werksmans Report was filed with 
my 
papers 
when 
I 
challenged 
my 
unlawful 
suspension in the High Court.”  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  One second Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 43 page 9 Bundle A. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you going back to the statement?  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Bundle YA page 9. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does that mean you are done with the Werksmans 
Report or you will come back to it?  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well that depends on the answer 
to the next question. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  No that is fine.  Then I will wait.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But we may have to go to. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Beginning page 1017 which is 
still in Bundle C.  So perhaps if you could keep it at hand Cha ir.  The 
affidavit that you prepared for the purposes of the High Court 
application which later was dealt with by the Constitutional Court is 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 71 of 170 
 
Annexure G in Bundle YC and I am referring to not your founding 
affidavit for present purposes, but I am referring  to your replying 
affidavit because in the answering affidavit the Minister relied to a 
large extent on the Werksmans Report.  So if you could go to page 
1007 of Bundle YC please. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  I have it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please repeat the page number Mr Pretorius on 
EXHIBIT YC. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Page 1007. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1007, thank you. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Do you have that affidavit before 
you? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes sir. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To place this replying affidavit in 
its proper context it appears that in the answering affidavits in the 
matter before the High Court where you challenged your suspension the 
Minister had relied to some extent on the contents and findings of the 
Werksmans Report. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And in reply then you dealt with 
20 
the Werksmans Report? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now we have dealt at some 
length with issues related to the Werksmans Report and your critique at 
a high level and at a detailed level with the contents of that report.  
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 72 of 170 
 
Perhaps it may be necessary at some stage to do a thorough analysis 
of the record, because the record is there as it stands.  We have been  
provided by Werksmans with all the transcripts of evidence save of one 
person who is Advocate Mosing.  Is that correct?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  No that is not correct Chair.  It is 
Mr Sesoko’s entire interview and transcript has always been absent 
from the Werksmans Report. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright, sorry.  I got that wrong.  
It is Mr Sesoko’s transcript that is not contained but other than that we 
have been provided with the terms of reference, the report and the 
10 
transcripts of evidence of all who participated in interviews save for 
Mr Sesoko? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Ja.  In fact with the - during the 
litigation period we relied on Mr  Sesoko’s own recording he made which 
it was transcribed and authenticated and we made use, use of that but 
Werksmans does not refer to it at all.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  And they do not supply it even though 
Mr Sesoko was interviewed by them.  
CHAIRPERSON:  As a matter of interest do you know whether there is 
20 
a reason why a transcript for interviews with other people are available 
but the one with him is not available or is that something that was not 
canvassed - they were not asked? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  I do not remember it in detail now 
Chair, but Mr Sesoko is, Mr Sesoko is very legally minded and very 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 73 of 170 
 
direct.  So he would have put legal status of everything immediately on 
the table and from memory he indicated to me and I might have seen it 
in a transcript – he inquired to Mr July as to whether he was a suspect 
in anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  And Mr July replied in the negative. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Which would reflect very poorly on 
Mr July. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  On the fact that Mr July makes 
recommendations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Subsequently at the end of his report to 
indicate that Sesoko should be amongst those charged and disciplined.  
I’m not sure what the ethical aspects of that is, but Sesoko reported 
that to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you also referred to the use of some recording 
that Mr Sesoko himself had made, was that a mechanical recording or 
just notes that he took, do you know, do you remember?  
20 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes I do remember Chair, it was a 
electronic recording, either on his phone or on a dictaphone or 
something. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, but you say that was transcribed.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes sir it was. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 74 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, alright, thank you.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   To get back to your replying 
affidavit and your critique of the Werksmans’ report, we have dealt with 
a number of issues both in detail as regards to the particular 
submissions or contents of the interviews as well as your high level 
critique of the fact that there was an inv estigation by Werksmans at all 
under the direction of the Minister.  Your critique is recorded at page 
1017 and following of the replying affidavit, it’s a matter of record.  Is 
there anything you wish to add to that?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Chair I think it’s sufficient as it is 
10 
captured in the affidavit I’m sure that Mr Khuba and Mr Sesoko will give 
further details which will held the Commission come to its conclusions.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   But to put it at its highest you 
were critical of the content of the report, the analysis of the evidence 
and the outcome of the report, is that correct?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Chair I don’t know if you require 
us to go into further detail on that, it may become relevant later as 
matters progress but then we can address it then but to go into it page 
20 
by page analysis of all the evidence, all the detail, I think will not be 
productive at this stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that’s fine.  Mr McBride during your interview 
with Mr July in whatever way or terms you may have put it, did you ever 
say or ask him something along the lines, what’s the whole point about 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 75 of 170 
 
this alteration of the report when there is new evidence, what’s the 
whole point, you know, if it’s altered because there’s new evidence 
what’s wrong with that?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  I think Chair just to respond directly 
and from what I can recall, my last – amongst my last statements of the 
interview I indicated to him, in an attempt to answer your question, that 
I stand by the report that I signed and I also made the point that no 
court in South Africa will, based on the evidence, that I’m aware of, will 
ever be able to convict General Sibiya or Dramat and I expressed it  as 
a confidence we had in the analysis and the exculpatory evidence 
10 
which, in April 2015, I was now aware of fully and I expressed that to 
him but it did not resonate at all.  With the team that was sitting there 
the moment I said I stand by my report tha t I signed everybody started 
feverishly writing, taking notes, they exchanged glances and started 
writing, as if somehow I admitted shock and horror some unspeakable 
deed.  For me that was an indication of some kind of prior 
misunderstanding because for the first time they exchanged glances 
with each other, when I said I stand by the report that I signed and I 
don’t know what – they can explain for themselves but that’s what I 
picked up and I express throughout the interview, subsequently in 
20 
testimony here also that it was just crazy from the beginning the fuss 
that was made about it.  So I have expressed it specifically with Mr 
July, I’m not sure if I specifically said it but I had indicated it yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Did Mr July or anybody who may have formed part of 
his team where during his – your interview with him, did they – did 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 76 of 170 
 
anybody ever say, but the recommendations you people made in the 
final report are not justified by the evidence that you are relying on or 
anything to that effect or did they expre ss criticism of the final report 
based on evidence that was available?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Chair no, at no stage – at all stages 
including in the written report was just a fact that a report 
recommendation and opinion had been changed.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  No criticism of the final report, in fact, 
increasingly – well it’s now common knowledge that all charges against 
10 
General Sibiya and General Dramat were withdrawn on this matter.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  So even the NPA who decided to 
prosecute us for the recommendation we made in the final report, now 
has withdrawn charges against General Sibiya and General Dramat.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   If, just for the sake of 
completeness we could then go to Bundle YD – yes YD at page 1443 
and subject to any need that might arise for a more in -depth and 
complete analysis we can end here to repeat the finding and comment 
20 
on it para 645 of the Werksmans report.  
CHAIRPERSON: Did you say the pages 1443?  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Yes of Exhibit YD. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, you may proceed. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Paragraph 6.4.5 is the 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 77 of 170 
 
recommendation that concerns yourself it reads, “In the absence of any 
information as to which  of the three co-signatories were responsible for 
the deletion of information from the first report we recommend that 
Khuba, McBride and Sesoko be charged criminally for defeating the 
ends of justice or obstructing the administration of justice and that 
disciplinary charges be brought against them in their capacity as 
employees”.  Just a number of remarks arising from your evidence and 
then we’ll conclude this part of the evidence Mr McBride, it seems that 
what Werksmans concentrated on was the deletion of portions of the 
statements quoted in the reports.  So not the deletion of the original or 
10 
any alteration of the original statements which remained intact but 
those passages that were quoted in the first report and the second 
report. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   You’ve explained to the Chair 
that an analysis was done, and we’ve referred to Mr Khuba’s evidence 
in that regard with the assistance of Mr Sesoko, because we now know 
that Mr Sesoko was assisting for  the first time, he had been excluded in 
relation to the first report. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Chair I don’t mean to be flippant but I 
20 
think I need to make a point that even if the second report was 
completely taken and torn up and thrown into a bin and o nly the docket 
submitted with all the evidence there would be nothing unlawful about 
that.  So even if we removed the entire report, did not add a report and 
we threw it in the bin and only sent the docket with all the evidence, 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 78 of 170 
 
there would be nothing unla wful or untoward.  SAPS detectives do that 
every day when they submit their dockets to the NPA they don’t attach 
opinion recommendations. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   There are no findings here it 
seems, in relation to the necessity for the additional i nvestigative 
results contained in the second report it simply seems to concentrate 
on the deletion of information in the report.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes that’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   What if it is put to you that the 
deletion of the information was deliberately calculated to mislead the 
10 
recipient of the report or the second report?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  All the evidence is in the docket, none 
of the quoted statements in the report were designed to mislead or to 
misdirect anyone.  The key element and difference of the two the 
reports as I indicated earlier, was the conditions in which they were 
done.  It would be thumb -suck to say – and there would be no basis on 
which to say the removal of quotations in a report from a statement 
there was anything untoward about it or improper it’s just whoever 
invented that, clearly didn’t understand processes that are involved in 
the situation and it appears that, that misunderstanding, wilful or 
20 
inadvertent permeates the entire process downstream that eventually 
led to us getting suspended and criminally charged and it just seems to 
have its own infectious nature about that misunderstanding, it appears 
to be contagious. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   It seems then, in summary what 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 79 of 170 
 
you are saying is that to accord the so-called first report with a quality 
that it can never be changed or commented on or subjected to a further 
investigation is factually and legally incorrect you say?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Secondly you say that the 
assessment that gave rise to the report in its final form including the 
decision as what quotes to retain and what quotes to omit from the 
witness statements, is a matter of judgement by the authors of the 
second report and there was nothing untoward in the exercise of that 
judgement, that’s how I understand your evidence.  
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  I’ll go further Chair and say it’s a 
matter of professional judgement and opinion.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Yes and that Mr Khuba makes 
clear because he consulted with Mr Sesoko and they can come and give 
their evidence about that. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Absolutely and they have experience in 
doing this. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Right, thirdly you say that had 
you not done the work in relation to the investigation that resulted in 
the production of the second report, you would have been acting 
20 
improperly and unlawfully. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So Mr McBride as far as you can recal l, and I didn’t 
pick this up on the Werksmans report but you have looked at it much 
more closely I think over some time.  As far as you recall it never 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 80 of 170 
 
addressed or addresses the question of saying, if the alteration came 
about as a result of the further i nvestigation that was done, what was 
wrong with it, what was – was there anything unlawful about changing it 
in order to be in line with the later investigation, it doesn’t address that 
as far as you recall? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  No Chair it’s completely ignored, that 
aspect. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You know it’s – by the way we’ll hear, you know, 
other witnesses but you mustn’t feel bad about emphasising some of 
the points you have been emphasising about this report because if 
10 
anybody is going to recommend, you know, that people be criminally 
charged they really need to apply their minds properly to issues 
because people being charged criminally is not a small matter.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   You’ve already made it clear to 
the Chair in that regard that as far as IPID is concerned that although it 
makes its own comments and gives its own opinion the duty on the 
prosecutor to determine the fate of a persons, whether they should be 
charged or no would be, obviously to examine the full contents of the 
docket and those were never tampered with.  
20 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Finally if I could just ask you to 
look at – and I mean finally for this aspect of the evidence at p age 1152 
of Bundle YC, you will recall that the attitude of the Minister the 
attitude of those that took IPID to task including yourself was the first 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 81 of 170 
 
report somehow had a status that could not be tampered with it 
appeared that, that might have been well t he motivation of Werksmans 
and making its recommendations but would you look at 1152 please.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  I have it Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   This is a communication from 
the Director of Public Prosecutions Gauteng Local Division, a Mr 
Roberts SC. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   It’s dated the 23 r d of April 2015, 
almost a year after the second report was filed.  
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE: Yes.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   And it’s addressed to the actin g 
Executive Director Independent Police Investigative Directorate.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   That would have been who at 
the time? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  It would be Mr Kgananyane. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETOR IUS SC:   And in relation to the rendition 
cases are these the same rendition cases or are they different?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  It’s the same case Chair. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Right, it says in paragraph 1, 
“the following further investigatio n must be taken or must be done 
before a decision can be taken”, and then there are a number of sub -
paragraphs which talk about an expert analysis of cell phone data in 
relation to Major General Sibiya in relation to his alleged presence at 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 82 of 170 
 
the crime scene, it talks about transcript of sms messages sent or 
received by Lieutenant Colonel Malaleke, Major General Sibiya and 
Lieutenant General Dramat during the period of the operations.  It talks 
about further cell phone records and on page 1153 is a long list of 
other matters to be investigated.  The letter concludes at paragraph 2 
on page 1154, “the matter must be regarded as urgent as the 
investigation must be completed on or before 12 May 2015”.  So that it 
seems that despite everything and despite all the a llegations and 
evidence including those that led to your suspension and criminal 
charges being laid against you that even on 23 April 2015 the 
10 
investigation was hardly complete.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  But Chair there’s an additional problem 
which has only struck me now a lot of with what Advocate Roberts is 
asking for should have been in the docket there and it was part of the 
docket and if from memory, and Mr Khuba can – at this stage Mr Khuba 
and Mr Sesoko are not yet suspended, Mr Angus takes over the case 
under the direction of Mr Kgamanyane but it appears that some – the 
point that you are making that even then after I’m gone, they’re still 
looking for additional information, I’ll agree with that but it appears that 
some of the information they’re loo king for from memory was in the 
20 
docket.  As I look at them, I hadn’t looked at them line by line and 
these are issues that Mr Khuba had included so there’s an additional 
problem in addition to the one which you raised to me that it was not 
yet complete after I’ve been suspended in any case.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   On the moment – for the 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 83 of 170 
 
moment rather the letter seems to indicate that further investigations 
were necessary before a prosecutorial decision could be made but you 
add the concern that cer tain information may have been removed from 
the docket but the best person to comment on that would be Mr Khuba I 
presume? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes sir, that’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   In paragraph 44 you repeat 
aspects of your critique  in relation to the report and you then talk 
about...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you back to the statement?  
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Back to the statement sorry, 
paragraph 44 on page 9 of Exhibit YA.  You talk about the costs to the 
state of the whole rendition saga and you estimate the cost to the state 
to being in the region of 17million rand according to a reply to a 
parliamentary question put to the Minister in 2017, is that correct?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE: That’s correct yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   You say in paragraph 46 on 
page 9 that Khuba and Sesoko were suspended by Kgamanyane, the 
then acting Director of IPID on 21 May 2015.  You say that, that was on 
the instructions of the Minister is that correct?  
20 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes Chair, just to add that Mr Sesoko, 
on his suspension and being informed by Mr Kgamanyane made a 
recording of Mr Kgamanyane saying that he’s been given instructions, 
which instructions can only come from the Minister to suspend him.  In 
so in Sesoko’s application or preparation of papers, at a stage when we 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 84 of 170 
 
ran out of funds to challenge the decisions that Kgamanyane took, Mr 
Sesoko has a recording and a transcript of that conversation with Mr 
Kgamanyane. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   You were suspended for what 
period of time? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  I was suspended from the 24 t h of March 
2015 and I returned to work on the 19 t h of October 2016, so it’s 
approximately 18 months. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Right in broad summary what did 
you find on your return in relation to issues relating to restructuring, 
10 
transfers, dismissals and appointments?  Don’t go into the detail yes 
we’re going to go into the detail but just to introduce this topic in a line 
or two. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  I think just for context and the purpose 
I should start by saying that one of the first decisions taken by Mr 
Kgamanyane was to terminate IPID’s brief to lawyers to challenge the 
Minister Constitutionally so immediately that brief was withdrawn.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Is that why you explained that 
in the Constitutional Court it was only you, prior to that it was IPID?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   IPID and you? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes, so the issue is, his first dec ision 
as Executive Director was to ensure that IPID does not act in the 
interest of protecting the independence of itself, that’s the first 
decision he took as acting Executive Director.  Now the rest of the stuff 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 85 of 170 
 
was a lot of bazaar transfers, suspensions ...(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Before you go – you deal with those Mr McBride, just 
to understand because you did mention earlier also that you and I think 
Mr Sesoko ran out of funds at some stage.  Now the application that 
you made to the High Court yourself and later the matter went to the 
Constitutional Court, the applicants there were reflected as yourself 
and IPID is that right or was it only you?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  It was only me sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At the time you went to the Constitutional Court was 
it only you? 
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In regard to that same matter about which you went 
to the Constitutional Court were you the only applicant at the High 
Court level as well? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes I was the only one and then I was 
joined by the Amicus. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Amicus okay but wasn’t there an application that was 
brought by you and IPID, there was such?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes during the urgent application on 
12 t h of March 2015. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay but that’s how far IPID went?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the protection of the independence for IPID that 
ultimately the Constitutional Court confirmed is effectively protection 
that was confirmed, not just for y ourself but also for future Executive 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 86 of 170 
 
Directors of IPID and for IPID on your own so to speak without the 
institution itself? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you paid for all of that. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And IPID did not pay. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  No IPID did not pay, I’m including the 
Labour Court aspects, the disciplinary, in the Labour Court matter we 
approached the Labour Court for an interdict to stay the disciplinary 
until the Constitutional Court had made its pronouncement on the 
10 
matter and that also was from my pocket and the process of the initial 
disciplinary – so all of that it was... 
CHAIRPERSON:  Out of your pocket.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes and so the same issue with Mr 
Sesoko and Mr Khuba and their disciplinaries and they are still in the 
process of paying back money now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, in regard to the matter that went up to the 
Constitutional Court I would imagine you got reimbursed went a cost 
order was made against the Minister?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes there was a reimbursement. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  For that matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For that month? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  And after taxation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 87 of 170 
 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  We then received the afte r taxation I 
think is a legal term. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Subject to taxation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes we did receive it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Now – it would be okay if the matter left 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Chair but we also had the need to 
utilise money in the criminal case.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  To defend ourselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Which it is only now that IPID is 
considering reimbursing Mr Sesoko and Mr Khuba.  I have never been 
reimbursed for the criminal case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’m. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  So – and that is the – I mean that is…  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  The tragedy of all of this . 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Mr McBride perhaps it needs a 
slight degree of clarification.  The original Notice of Motion and the 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 88 of 170 
 
application to the high court concerning your suspension is at page 143 
of bundle of Exhibit Ya.  But let me just put the sequence as I 
understand it from a review of all the papers.  An urgent application 
was brought in regard to the suspension to which you have referred.  In 
that application there were two applicants, the Independent Police 
Investigative Directorate and yourself?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That application had two parts.  
Part A for interim relief on an urgent basis regarding your suspension.  
Part B a declaration of unconstitutional ity and we have been to – into 
10 
that detail.  Part A the urgency the judge found that it was not urgent?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  The judge reasons if I – was that I had 
not been suspended yet.  It was in pending there is no harm done, one 
of his reasons. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes but anyway Part A relief was 
refused? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That was the application for 
urgent relief? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Quite how it was phrased.  It is 
not necessary to debate that now.  Part B then continued later and at 
that stage you were the only applicant, is that correct?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Chair let me just go back.  In Part B in 
the judgement of Judge Fabricius he indicated th at Part B words to the 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 89 of 170 
 
effect ‘stands a chance, it has merit’ and which he said which he did 
not have to say.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  But he did say it in his judgment in 
turning down the urgency. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  So it was identified at first go by Judge 
Fibricius even though he turned down the urgency aspect.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  But Part B eventually 
ended up in the high court. 
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then went onto the 
constitutional court. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But when Part B was determined 
you were the only applicant?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.   
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to Part B was IPID – or let me first ask.  In 
pursuing Part B were new papers prepared or was use made of the 
20 
papers that had already been filed in the urgent application, do you 
remember? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  I cannot remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Exactly now ja, ja. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 90 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but it was one applicant and that was you.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Leaving out the amicus and so on? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct because…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  By the 1 May – by the 1 April IPID if I 
remember the dates correctly IPID had – had terminated its brief.  So I 
think we only submitted in August or Septem ber the final papers for the 
high court. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Of that year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Again just to complete that line 
of questioning.  In the original application in which IPID and  yourself 
were applicants your founding affidavit traverses all the issues that 
finally came before the constitutional court?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That affidavit is at page 148 of 
bundle Ya.  But let us return to the point which we have arrived at.  You 
say you were suspended for a period of eighteen months.  You came 
20 
back and you found that things had changed?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you are now going to tell the 
Chair of how they had changed particularly in relation to restructuring 
appointments and dismissals and transfers, am I correct?  
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 91 of 170 
 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  In your absence how 
many senior managers were suspended or transferred?  You deal with 
that in paragraph 47. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  It is at least… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Suspended or transferred?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  At least eight senior managers. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I am sorry.  I interrupted you I 
am sorry. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Chair ja in terms of at least eight senior 
10 
managers were affected in one or another either by transfer or a 
suspension.  It might – it might even be more than the eight.  Because 
some were transferred mainly to fill gaps that were left at those – of 
those who were transferred seemingly for what – let… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We will come to the detail later.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Or some detail later. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just a question before the long 
adjournment.  Do you recall the analysis that you did together with 
20 
Messrs Pillay and Dramat?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The notion that a senior officer 
bearing some responsibility in a state institution is removed and that is 
followed 
by 
an 
overall 
restricting 
and 
other 
dismissals 
and 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 92 of 170 
 
appointments.  Was that unique to IPID?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  No Chair it – we had noticed the same 
pattern in DPCI and we had noticed the same pattern in SARS.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Chair may we adjourn?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we will take the lunch adjournment and we will 
resume at two.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed Mr  Pretorius. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS 
SC: 
 
Chair 
during 
the 
long 
adjournment we gave consideration to the necessity perhaps to clarify 
one or two issues in regard to matters dealt with before the long 
adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  My apologies Mr McBride.  If I 
can take you back please.  The Werksmans Report appears at page 
1371 of Bundle YD that is EXHIBIT YD.  Would you turn to that please?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  I have it sir. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You will recall just by way of 
20 
background to my question which follows that at all times we have 
spoken of a provisional or first report signed by Mr  Khuba and a second 
report signed by yourself, Messieurs Sesoko and Khuba.  Is that 
correct? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 93 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The second report differed from 
the first report? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Now that - an analysis of 
those differences appears at page 1404.  Leave aside the additional 
matters about which Werksmans makes comment as to whether it was 
necessary or desirable at all.  That is a different issue, but at 1404 is 
analysis of what is referred to as IPID Rep ort 1 and IPID Report 2. Do 
you see that? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes, which is incorrectly titled “Deletion 
10 
of Evidence” at paragraph 1 on top of the page.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  No evidence was ever 
tampered with or deleted?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  No. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The evidence always remained 
in the form of witness statements in the docket?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Absolutely and perhaps it is instructive 
from this why they misunderstood what was going on or that is.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  A possible reasonable explanation.  
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Because they saw the report and the 
changes in the report and the omission of certain aspects of the r eport, 
their opinion as evidence. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right but in any event it appears 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 94 of 170 
 
from page 1404 that the statement of Ndanduleni  Richard Madilonga 
had been quoted in the first report?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the quotes from that 
statement in the second report differed.  Correct?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  (No audible reply). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And Khuba explains that in his 
affidavit.  I will come to that in a moment.  The same category of  
observation is made in the report right through to page 1415.  Do you 
see that? 
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  [Intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  From 1404. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To 1415.  Now I am not going to 
go into the detail.  At a particular level we will be here for several 
weeks if we do that. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes sir. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Save to say the issue taken by 
Werksmans appears properly regarded not to be any a lteration to 
evidence but merely to what Mr Khuba and Mr Sesoko thought as 
20 
relevant quotations to the report.  What is your explanation for these 
“changes”?  Just at a general level.  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  The changes according to Khuba, to 
Khuba as I said earlier is based on in terms of his analysis what was 
removed was no of evidentiary value and served no real purpose 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 95 of 170 
 
according to him for the changes at that stage.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well here is a starting point where any inquiry into 
what the Minister had asked Werksmans should have started.  In the 
terms of reference which from the Minister to Werksmans which is 
quoted in the Werksmans Report at page 1375.  The first term of 
reference which is 5.1 says: 
“Your terms of reference in the investigation are th e 
following:  5.1 who and under what circumstances 
was the original report altered or how the second 
report came about with both reports signed by the 
10 
same person.” 
It seems to me that what follows in 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 is all 
[indistinct] on whether the original report was altered.  Who and under 
what circumstances was the original report altered?  Now my 
impression was that if you go to the – what he refers to as the original 
report which is the first report or preliminary report.  If you went to the 
first report prior to the so called alteration you would have found it to 
look in a certain way.  If you went to it after the alteration you would 
then find that it looked different – differently because some sentences 
maybe had been deleted from it or had been crossed out or some things 
20 
had been added to that report by somebody.  Now the evidence that has 
been given and some of the things seem to suggest that that may not 
necessarily be correct.  Now can you clear that?  When there is talk of 
the alteration of the report we can see from the terms of reference that 
the Minister ’s concern was about the alteration of what he calls the 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 96 of 170 
 
original report which we said is the first report.  So forget about the 
second report.  Was there – did the first report physically look different 
in terms of what it contained after the alleged alteration than it looked 
before the alteration? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Chair to answer your question I think I 
now understand your earlier question.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  On this issue which perhaps I did not 
answer correctly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Or specifically to answer your question.  
There are a number of reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Which start from perhaps what I am  
aware of is 2013, October. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Then it changes in November. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Because things are added or and. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  It is sent to Mosing, sent back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  By the time it comes to January, the 
22 n d the so called first report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 97 of 170 
 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  It has already had some evolution in it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Because of the discussion between 
Mosing and Khuba. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  And their working together. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  And presumably acquiring. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  For the statement. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  So it will be between Khuba and 
Mosing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  And perhaps Moukangwe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  It is in a period where Sesoko was 
forbidden to be part of the  process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  And it is in a period where I had not 
20 
arrived yet at IPID/ 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  So it is between Khuba, Mosing and 
Moukangwe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 98 of 170 
 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Who would know exactly who and I do 
not know if they will be able to recall after so many years who changed 
what when and the rationale for it.  In that report that became now – is 
now known for sake of convenience as the first report and I am not sure 
what the Minister means by the original report in his term of reference.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But in terms of – I mean you know what the 
discussions were between yourself and Mr  July during the interview.  At 
least assuming that what they were talking about reflected what the 
Minister had in mind.  When they talked about the alteration as you 
understood the position were they talking about a report that contained 
10 
certain things at a certain time but after a period those things or some 
of those things had been altered in that re port as opposed to different 
views or recommendations being made in another report.  In other 
words if a report was one page were they talking on a basis that look 
this report which is one page before it had this sentence.  It now does 
not have that sentence.  Before it had this paragraph now it does not 
have that paragraph.  Before it did not have this sentence but it now 
has a new sentence.  That is what I am trying to establish whether this 
reference to alteration because that is the meaning it gives me as 
opposed to a situation where you say somebody has in a certain report 
20 
– let us call it in a first report has expressed certain views and then in 
another and later report he has expressed different views.  Now if you 
ask me if a person expresses differen t views or recommendations in a 
second and later report.  Views that are different from the ones he has 
expressed in the first report.  That is not altering the report.  That is 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 99 of 170 
 
expressing different views in a later report but for me that is not 
altering the first report.  I mean it is true that – it may be true that the 
effect is that recommendation A which was in the first report is no 
longer the recommendation that stands but that is not because it is 
being altered in the first report.  It is because it is over written by a 
later report where there is a different view.  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am trying to establish whether in truth there was 
ever any alteration of the first report in the sense that I understand 
alteration to mean as opposed to there were simply a change of views, 
10 
a change of mind on the part of for example Mr  Khuba who might have 
expressed a certain view before in the first report. In the second report 
he associated himself with a different view or recommend ation because 
of a new investigation and then when it comes to – when it came to you 
and Mr Sesoko you had never expressed any view in regard to the first 
report you were expressing your views and recommendations for the 
first time in the second report. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is that is correct.  An example off 
the top of my head was that some stuff of the so called first report 
would be repeated in the second report.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  But some qualification added on to it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  To say this can no longer be the case 
because we have not proven X, Y and Z.  For example I remember a 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 100 of 170 
 
success report.  Did the success – someone sent a success report to 
amongst others General Dramat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  And therefore from the information that 
was available then without the benefit of analysis and review was at 
somehow by sending the report to Dramat he therefore knew something 
was going on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  It later transpired that it is not even 
clear whether the report was actually sent.  There is an electronic copy 
10 
on someone’s computer but whether it was actually sent or not is not, is 
not known.  Whether it was actually received and whether it w as 
actually read and whoever – if he had knowledge of it was, was of any 
consequence at all of the arrest. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  The success report is to the arrest.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, but to go back to my question.  Is it your 
understanding that what was an issue was never really about anybody 
going to the so called first report and changing sentences and crossing 
out somethings and adding somethings into that report as such?  As far 
20 
as you recall what was an issue was that in the secon d report in - the 
final report views were expressed your recommendations were made 
that differed from the views and the recommendations made in the first 
report.  Is that your, is that your understanding of what the whole issue 
was about? 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 101 of 170 
 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  For me my understanding is that there 
was a change at all to the first and that anything [intervenes].  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry just repeat that sentence.  Just repeat that 
sentence.  Your view is that there was a change or no change?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  The obsession with Werksmans the 
Minister and all the advisors was that there was a change of the first 
report and they elevated the first report to a status which logically it 
could not enjoy and that it was inviable.  It can never change unde r any 
circumstances. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but hang on.  I am sorry to interrupt you.  
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your understanding, is your understanding that one 
nobody could talk about you or Mr Sesoko having changed your views 
or recommendations about anything because you never participated in 
the first report.  Is that correct?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You never participated.  You had no role to in the first 
report? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Absolutely none. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the extent that anybody could talk about a change 
20 
of recommendation or anybody changing his view or her view that would 
only apply to Mr Khuba because in the first report he had expressed 
certain recommendations.  Those recommendations were different from 
the recommendations made in the second report which he co -signed? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct yes. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 102 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is correct.  So, so I am trying to establish 
whether this whole thing was about why Mr  Khuba changed his view 
that these people must be prosecuted.  Was it about – why did he 
change his view or was it about why did he go to the first report 
physically and cross out certain sentences or paragraphs or add things 
that were not there physically?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  From the evidence and from the 
affidavits and from engagement Mr Khuba is on record as saying he 
sent a draft at some stage in 2014 to Mr  Sesoko’s computer and it is on 
that draft whatever it was whether it was the same a correspondent to 
10 
the first report or not they worked on that draft and that is where there 
were changes.  If I would say that the second report is perhaps an 
enhancement on the facts or emphasis that was contained in the first 
report.  So that is all I can say.  I am not sure what transpired between 
– to give rise to the existence of the first report and whatever changes 
took place there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  And what was in the first report at the 
stage when I co-signed with Khuba and Sesoko and now known as the 
second report. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well perhaps without any 
presumption what the DCJ is putting to you is this.  The first report was 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 103 of 170 
 
always there on file? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No one took that first report 
added, deleted, changed the recommendation, threw the original first 
report away and put the second report on file.  Two reports were always 
on file.  One in one form, the other in the other form.  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Thank you Chair.  In fact when the 
Minister requested all of this information both reports were given to the 
Minister. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  So there was no attempt to mislead the 
Minister by only showing one, one report.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Both reports are with the bundle that 
was sealed and given to the Minister on 26  November 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay and what appears to have 
escaped perhaps the Minister ’s attention and Werksmans attention is 
the fundamental issue you raise with the first report that it was largely 
the project – the product rather – of the Crime Intelligence 
20 
investigation. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And so that first report far from 
being incapable of alteration or supplementation or being subjected to 
another view it is arguable that no regard should been had to it and you 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 104 of 170 
 
should have started again. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Which Chair is indeed what Khuba 
proceeded to do to review everything that was there at that stage and 
the relative evidentiary value.  The way it – it can never stand up in 
court now that all the facts are – it could never ever based on – of the 
shenanigans that took place before it arrived at IPID in any event.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If necessary the report maybe 
subject to further analysis and debate but just to highlight the approach 
of Mr Khuba it appears at 1236 of EXHIBIT YC.  You have testified that 
Khuba was doing an investigation into the rendition saga under the 
10 
supervision of Mr Mosing – Advocate Mosing – of the NPA? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:   That is correct yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And Khuba had inherited the 
docket for want of a better word from Crime Intelligence?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Khuba had a number of concerns 
which he highlights in his affidavit but in paragraph 19 on page 1236 he 
says: 
“While I convey these concerns to Mosing he told 
me that I must nevertheless sign the January  2014 
20 
Report and send it to him as the investigation had 
been going on for two long.”  
He states elsewhere that he was under pressure from the NPA to 
produce the report. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 105 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Leave aside whether that also 
interferes with the independence of IPID or not.  His explanation is 
summarised in paragraph 20.  He says:  
“I firmly deny that there was any improper motive 
on my part, Sesoko or McBride in the changes that 
were made to the Renditions Investigation Report in 
March 2014.” 
He also is caught up in the, in the use of language that refers to 
changes in a report rather than the production of a second re port.  He 
said: 
10 
“There was no attempt on our part to exclude any 
material evidence from the report.  The changes 
were made to reflect what we considered to be 
credible evidence that would withstand scrutiny in 
court.” 
Is that your understanding?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct, yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In paragraph 23 over the page, 
1237 he says: 
“In finalising the report and presenting the final 
20 
report to McBride for authorisation we sought to 
conduct a thorough, critical and objective review of 
the totality of the evidence and to present only 
recommendations that were supported by credible 
evidence.” 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 106 of 170 
 
That is his explanation.  He will come here to tell the Chair about that.  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But as far as you are aware that 
was the correct approach?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In any event to just make it clear 
what Werksmans found at page 1427 at paragraph 5.1.5 they find:  
“In the absence of a valid explanation for the 
deletions by the cosignatories the only logical 
conclusion 
which 
can 
be 
drawn 
from 
the 
10 
circumstances detailed above is that the second 
report was created for the purpose of exonerated 
the higher ranking officials specifically Dramat and 
Sibiya who were implicated in the first report.”  
The implication and that is EXHIBIT YD page 1427 and paragraph 5.1.5 
is somehow that evidence was created or fabricated for an ulterior 
motive.  Was that ever put to you?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The reference to deletion there would be more 
accurate to say they are actually talking about a failure to include in 
20 
the final report something that was in the first report as opposed to 
deleting 
something 
that 
is 
in 
a 
certain 
doc ument, 
on 
your 
understanding? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  On my understanding it would be a 
conscience decision not to include after review anything that was of no 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 107 of 170 
 
evidentiary value. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  And if somehow non-evidentiary value 
quotations crept in initially there was a conscience decision not to 
include them, but in any event whatever was there in the first report 
was known because it was included with the package given to 
Minister Nhleko and there was no attempt to hide anyt hing or remove it 
for ulterior motives or anything like that.  I cannot take it much further 
than that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it may well be, it may well be that if you have 
10 
got a hard copy of the first report but you have got the same report in 
electronic form and in preparing the second report you use the 
electronic version of the same report and then what you want to include 
in the second - in the final report you delete somethings and maybe 
that is the deletion they are taking about the deleting what is in  the 
electronic form as opposed to deleting what is in the hard copy.  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Chair the way you put it now would be 
accurate is what I expect would have happened.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  I do not expect that they would have 
20 
started a report from scratch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  When there are some objective facts.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That do not affect it either way. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 108 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  So they would have cut and paste it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, but the difference of course would be this, 
that as long as the hard copy, if there was a hard copy, I assume there 
was a hard copy that had been given to the NPA, if that hard copy 
remained as it was it represented what had been given and it had not 
been interfered with and what you had produced by copying and pasting 
if you want was another report, but you – that hard copy still stood as it 
was before? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes, and just to take it further, to sh ow 
10 
that there was no – there wasn’t any untoward motive.  The case in all 
its facets was discussed with Mr Ngwasana, the pro’s and con’s and 
suppositions and scenarios, and different aspects and the consensus in 
discussion with him is that you cannot susta in a case on Dramat and 
Sibiya, it is just impossible, and all possible angles were covered. Now 
I note in the Werksmans report, they take issue that Mr Ngwasana 
refused to speak to Werksmans.  My view is that Mr Ngwasana was 
right he was protecting the in dependence of the Prosecuting Authority 
and as to why Mr July will take offence to that and, basically suggests 
that Ngwasana was the only one who could do something and therefore 
20 
some disciplinary processes must take place on this issue, indicates a 
clear lack of understanding of – and for the Minister of Police to 
suggest decisions taken by the NPA are his business at all, I don’t 
know if we can blame that on lack of knowledge of importance of the – 
of Constitution – the Constitution and the Constitutional Democracy and 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 109 of 170 
 
independence of institutions or whether it was wilful ignoring of 
whatever principles that underpinned this democracy, I don’t know.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Let’s perhaps change the focus 
of debate to a higher level and I don’t mean  any (indistinct) judgement 
on the debate that’s taken place but what you deal with now is in fact 
what happened as a result of the whole rendition saga and the manner 
in which it was handled, leave aside whether it was dealt with properly 
or not you’ve given your evidence but you now tell the Chair of the 
outcome the demise of certain officials, the changes in personnel in the 
IPID and of other consequences that occurred as a result of the manner 
10 
in which the rendition saga was handled.  Firstly let’s go t o paragraph 
50, what post did Mr Sesoko hold prior to his suspension as a result of 
the renditions investigation?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Thanks Chair, he was the National Head 
of Investigations or I would say Chief Director of Investigations and 
Information Management, he was the head of all investigations 
conducted by IPID. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Did he support your application 
to challenge the Constitutionality of certain sections of the IPID Act and 
other sections when you challenged your susp ension? 
20 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct he supplied a 
confirmatory affidavit or supporting affidavit.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Right when was he suspended, 
do you recall? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  A few weeks after he had supplied the 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 110 of 170 
 
supporting affidavit. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   And he was also charged with 
altering what we now refer to as the first report, is that correct?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  No I’ve never mentioned Mr Sesoko in 
sections of the first report...(intervention).  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Well look at line 5 – 4 & 5 of 
paragraph 50 of your statement. Remember that Werksmans made a 
recommendation that you and Sesoko as well as Khuba be charged 
because they didn’t know who did what?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Ja so – yes but the way you phrased it 
10 
he was altering the first report which...(intervention).  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   No I don’t want to get caught in 
the same terminology and to give any validity to the substance of the 
charge but what was the nature of the charge against Mr Sesoko?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  He was charged with altering the 
report. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Right leave aside whether that 
charge was properly formulated in the light of the evidence and 
questions that have now transpired in your evidence here, that was the 
nature of the charge, correct?  In fact the charge reflected the views of 
20 
Werksmans and the Minister in relation to the fact that there was one 
report that was the final report and you couldn’t actually do anything 
about that through later investigation or analysis, correct?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Who came in as the acting 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 111 of 170 
 
Executive Director under your suspension?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  It was Mr Kgamanyane. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   What did – to your knowledge 
what did he do as soon as he took office, you deal with this in 
paragraph 50? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  He asked for a number of cases 
including the Panday case, he also enquired from Mr Sesoko about  the 
cases involving Ntlemeza and General Mabula.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Alright now before you go on, 
tell the Chair briefly, there will be evidence to follow your evidence, but 
10 
very, very briefly what was the Panday case all about?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Panday case involved corruption 
relating to the 2010 world cup in which a number of police officers were 
in a corrupt relationship with a businessman in Durban and police 
officers also involved the Provincial Commissioner.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Right now that case, was it 
investigated by IPID? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  It initially was investigated by DPCI...  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   General Booysen? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  General Booysen at some stage we 
20 
received a complaint from General Booysen about interference in the 
case 
its 
– 
I 
think 
it 
could 
have 
been 
roundabout 
2014 
October/November when we received a complaint.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Right and did IPID then do 
some work in relation the case?  
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 112 of 170 
 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Ja IPID did work right until the time I 
was suspended and until time that Sesoko and Khuba were suspended.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Right you tell the Chair that 
your successor or acting successor called for that file or case?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes that’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   We will deal with that in more 
detail but was that case ever put on the Court role for prosecution?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  To my knowledge there was one 
appearance on one of the cases, there w ere about four cases relating 
to Panday but the one which we worked on together with the National 
10 
Prosecuting Authority in preparation for trial was a very simple one, it 
was the one relating to bribery and all accompanying evidence was 
made available and Advocate Gerrie Nel was appointed to prosecute 
the case by Mr Ngasana and the case was supposed to be enrolled, and 
in fairness there was a request at some stage, I’m not sure for which 
particular case that the accused make representations on the bribery 
case because the decision was that the bribery case is quite clear cut 
and if the bribery case is successfully prosecuted, the question is 
therefore 
begged, 
what 
was 
the 
bribery 
about 
which 
would 
automatically lead to the bigger corruption that was taking p lace. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Involving police officials?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes that’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Right just before we continue, 
you have told the Chair that the case file was requested by your acting 
successor Mr Kgamanyane and that, as I understand your evidence, 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 113 of 170 
 
there has not been a successful prosecution, despite your view that 
there is evidence on file?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE: Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  There’s been no successful prosecution or there has 
been no prosecution at all or what is the position?   
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  There’s been no prosecution on the 
bribery case yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the bribery case there’s been no prosecution?   
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes, on one of the other prosecution 
cases Chair, on one of the other corruption cases there was one 
10 
appearance at some stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Could we put it another way, no 
case involving the issues to which you’ve just referred has been 
finalised. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Absolutely not. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   And then you refer to other IPID 
investigation files that were requested and you mentioned Major 
General Mabula and is it General Ntlemeza?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes, the one of Ntlemeza, Mr 
20 
Kgamanyane travelled to Limpopo, Mr Khuba was already suspended.  
Mr Kgamanyane called Mr Khuba back from suspension to discuss the 
Ntlemeza case that IPID had begun investigating.  In relation to 
General Mabula case which involved the death of a suspect in c ustody 
and by the evidence that was available it involved torture.  Mr 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 114 of 170 
 
Kgamanyane requested documentation about that case from Mr Sesoko.  
On my return to the office ...(intervention).  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   After your suspension? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  After my suspension an important piece 
of information that had been given to the Provincial Head of North West 
– of IPID went missing could not be located, it was a recording of a 
conversation where a suspect admitted involvement in the torture wh ich 
led to the death of a suspect which, against the background of these 
changes it was very strange.  Fortunately a copy was kept of it so the 
case was then resuscitated upon my return and all the evidence and 
10 
dockets and evidence put together – because there was some trick in 
the way the case was reported also.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Who was the official within IPID 
who was dealing with all these cases, Panday, Ntlemeza, Mabula and 
the like? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Before his suspension it was M r Sesoko 
ultimately that would be in charge.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Right, we get now at notionally 
to paragraph 51 of your statement but I don’t want to deal with it now, I 
need to intervene Chair to deal with a matter that has received 
20 
considerable publicity and to clarify from our point of view what we 
understand the position to be notwithstanding what has appeared in the 
press.  To take a step back Mr McBride made certain comments in his 
statement in regard to the findings of your younger broth er Advocate 
Mxolisi Zondo in relation to the disciplinary hearing of Mr Sesoko, not 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 115 of 170 
 
his disciplinary hearing Mr Sesoko.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   In his statement Mr McBride 
expresses a very narrow opinion of what occurred at that enquiry in 
relation to sick notes submitted to Advocate Zondo on Mr Sesoko’s 
behalf and whether these should or shouldn’t be taken into account, 
there’s an opinion expressed.  When this matter was raised before you 
at the beginning it was stressed to you t hat there’s a record, that the 
record is complete and comprehensive, the record involves, not Mr 
McBride but another witness and any assessment of that record can, in 
10 
due course be made by whomever might be appropriate. In relation to 
those circumstances, really what Mr McBride can or cannot say 
amounts to no more than an opinion and doesn’t really count for 
anything other than Mr McBride’s view.  Presented to you was a 
comprehensive piece of research and documentation prepared on 
behalf of the legal team. That was the only written submission you had 
before you, it was placed before you and never detracted from because 
I recall saying at the very end, that when this matter comes to be 
considered finally, we will deal with the issues and the report presented 
to you or the submissions presented to you rather would remain intact 
20 
and relevant and as I understand it you accepted that at some state you 
would reconsider or consider all those elements in that report or those 
submissions placed before you on behalf of  the legal team. 
 
Now I – in order to allow the evidence to proceed I intervene 
to say, well it’s an opinion it’s no more than an opinion you could hear 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 116 of 170 
 
that and in due course you could make a decision in regard to your 
attitude towards this and other evidence and that was where it rested.  
I might have said I was speaking on behalf of the legal team, I did say 
that all the views were not...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:  I don’t think you said you were speaking on behalf of 
the legal team, I think you said the views expressed in the document 
that you put up were not unanimous.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Yes that’s what I said and I took 
it upon myself to offer a way through, I didn’t purport to change what 
the legal team had said, in fact it remained (in distinct) before you and I 
10 
think you understood it...(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON: Well it remains before me it’s available to me to read, 
I have – before that I had a look at least parts of it and you did say it’s 
not 
unanimous 
and 
you 
did 
– 
whatever 
you 
said 
is 
on 
record...(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Yes but I did offer a way 
forward for which I take full responsibility and that was because of the 
nature and extent of the evidence because there’s a full and 
comprehensive record it’s not necessary for you to make any final 
decision now, you can make a decision later and to hear the opinion of 
20 
an individual who was not directly involved in a factual basis would not 
detract from any decision that you might make in the future but the 
situation has now become more complicated Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay maybe before you tell us about the situation 
becoming more complicated I must just repeat that what I said was, 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 117 of 170 
 
maybe let’s not have a situation where we must adjourn Mr McBride’s 
evidence because we – the Commission doesn’t have a lot of time.  Let 
me hear his evidence but I still indicate that probably the way forward 
should include that submissions be invited from legal professional 
bodies, I may have mentioned one or two other people or instit utions to 
make submissions before any decision can be made as to what should 
happen with regard to any evidence that might relate to my younger 
brother and my plan is still that unless something that – unless 
something else happens my plan is still that I should invite certain legal 
professional bodies, I haven’t finalised in my own mind who else to 
10 
make submissions so that at a certain stage I can then, if need be, 
make a decision whether – what should be done, you know, the – it’s an 
unusual situation bec ause if I was sitting in Court as a Judge it may 
have been very easy but I’m sitting here as Chairperson of the 
Commission and to make things more complicated the Commission 
wasn’t appointed in the usual way in which Commissions are appointed.  
There was a remedial action from the Public Protector who prescribed – 
made certain prescriptions, there was a High Court decision which gave 
effect to the Public Protectors remedial action as to the selection of the 
person to be – to Chair the Commission.  So all of  those things will 
20 
need to be looked at so that if I am the one who must make the 
decision as to what should happen to it I make it with the benefit of 
submissions from different bodies.  I don’t know whether it’s a matter 
which – I think there was reference to a possibility to – I think it’s in 
the memo or note that was written that was – that we talked about 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 118 of 170 
 
earlier, there was reference to the possibility that maybe the President 
could be asked to amend the terms of reference...(intervention).  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Or the regulations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja or the regulations so there are all kinds of things 
and certainly if I’m the one that must make the decision I would like the 
benefit of different submissions from professional bodies but I certainl y 
accept that the note you put up is there, it’s available to me to read in 
full – ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   So Chair before we get to the 
complication, in the light of the various press reports, all of which I’ve 
10 
not read and may not be accurate , just to summarise McBride originally 
intended to express an opinion on someone else’s disciplinary enquiry 
and the circumstances prevailing in that enquiry that there is a written 
record upon which any informed judgment can be made in due course, 
that’s not before you save perhaps in some annexure where the ruling 
of Mr Zondo exists that in order not to delay proceedings unduly it was 
decided as an interim measure and pending any decision you make, 
after hearing representations, not only from other profes sional bodies 
but also from the President’s office you mentioned, you will make a 
final decision and that it would not affect that process if you merely had 
20 
reference or heard the opinion in relation to those facts of Mr McBride 
but the situation has now – oh and also the submissions of the legal 
team remain before you for your consideration, unaltered and those 
were the only written submissions before you.  The situation has 
become a little bit more complex now because we were informed this 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 119 of 170 
 
weekend, Chair, that Mr Booysen also wishes to make reference to an 
enquiry in which Mr Zondo presided or didn’t – may not have continued 
I don’t know the full facts and the extent to which the enquiry continued 
or didn’t continue but it involved General Booysen himself so it’s direct 
and Mr Sesoko may come to give evidence, again he will give evidence 
which is direct as opposed to opinion.  In that – in the light of that, and 
I’ve discussed it with Mr McBride perhaps everything, opinion and 
everything else should be pend ed, pending a full consideration of all 
the evidence together to see what to do because I would imagine that 
the evidence of Mr Sesoko, which is direct and the evidence of General 
10 
Booysen which is also direct will be decisive of this issue rather than 
what Mr McBride might or might not have to say and Mr McBride is 
quite willing, I understand, and he can confirm it, to pend his evidence 
in relation to paragraph 51 of his statement until further notice.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I would be inclined to say let’s get more information if 
General Booysen has something to say as well, let’s hear what he has 
to say before any decision can be made and if McBride is happy to 
pend that part of his evidence there is no problem, Mr McBride do you 
confirm, what’s your position?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes sir I have no objection. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   So just for clarity sake because 
one doesn’t know how this will be understood by the media there was 
little prejudice to the overall process still to be considered by yoursel f 
by hearing the opinion indirectly of Mr McBride. We have subsequently 
learnt that there are at least two pieces of direct evidence that deal 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 120 of 170 
 
with the same matter which really overtakes the consideration of Mr 
McBride and in relation to that it requires f ull and comprehensive 
consideration for a decision by yourself on the strength of, amongst 
other things, the submission the legal teams have made to you.  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that’s fine I think that’s – that is the way to go 
because assume that the decisi on was to say, well if one looks at what 
Mr McBride has to say about Mr Mxolisi Zondo in regard to Mr Seseko’s 
disciplinary hearing if one were to say, when one has regard to the 
nature of what he has to say in the scheme of everything I should hear 
it then there would be a problem, if later on, General Booysen or 
10 
somebody else comes up with something else so it might be better to 
say – because if in the end the decision would be in the light of what 
General Booysen may say in the light of what someone else  may say, I 
should not hear it then I may as well not hear the part of it that comes 
from Mr McBride.  So it’s more convenient to say, let see exactly what’s 
in – what every witness comes up with.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja thank you. But there is no evidence that should be 
heard that will not be heard. It is a question of who must hear it.  If it is 
evidence that should be heard it should be heard.  It is a question of 
20 
who should… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It will indeed be heard in the 
form manner and by the person …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That ultimately has decided…  
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 121 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At least under your initial 
direction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Maybe that the person who 
finally hears it is appointed by someone else.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If that is possible at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is a complex … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a very complex…  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Matter I think I have had time to reflect on it. It is 
complex because in terms of – not just in terms of reference in terms of 
a high court decision giving effect to the Public Protector’s remedial 
action evidence relating to matters that fall under the terms of 
reference as they stand they need to be heard by this commission.  Is 
the question if now it is somebody is it still being heard by this 
commission? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it is being heard by somebody else.  But at the 
same time there may be situations where what – however you look at it 
I should not hear certain evidence.  I do not know.  I know that in the 
constitutional court we have dealt  with matters even where a colleague 
of ours is involved and we deal with them and we deal with them in the 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 122 of 170 
 
best way we can.  But it is not always the best situation.  So – so it is 
not an easy matter.  It is a matter that needs proper submissions to be 
made. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that in the end there can be nobody suggesting 
that any evidence that should have been evaluated in a certain way was 
not evaluated in a certain way, in a proper way or was – evidence was 
heard by somebody who should not have heard it.  So we need to look 
at everything properly. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To be fair to all concerned 
10 
particularly yourself Chair to have heard the contents of paragraph 51 
the opinion there would not have affected any  final decision that you 
might have made.  The situation is now different.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Where there is further direct 
evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That requires a fresh approach 
to the problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, no that is fine. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And for that purpose you have 
the submissions of the legal team.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And any further submissions that 
the legal team might make. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 123 of 170 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Plus submissions of outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Bodies including the Presidency. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 52 Mr McBride  you 
say that Sesoko also faced criminal charges together with Mr Khuba 
and yourself? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  For fraud and defeating the ends 
10 
of justice? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you have already said that 
those criminal charges were withdrawn on the 1 November 2016?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  You then returned to office?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  What happened to Mr Sesoko?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Mr Sesoko had taken the matter to the 
Labour Court or the Bargaining Council I cannot remember precisely.  
20 
But in the process and in the absence of a handover report by  
Ramonyane the reasons given for the – his dismissal and a decision to 
discipline him were not available.  In addition to that there was no 
basis for IPID as an organisation never mind myself to actually oppose 
any action that Sesoko sought for redress on his situation.  As such a 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 124 of 170 
 
department had to settle with Mr Sesoko’s legal team which resulted in 
his return to IPID. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Alright.  You say at paragraph 53 
Mr McBride on page 11 of your statement 11 of Exhibit Ya that you 
made a certain discovery or observation on your return to office in 
relation to the statistical performance of IPID as it had been reported in 
your absence.  What is your evidence in that regard?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes it was brought to my attention by 
Mr Sesoko and the team that – and that the Auditor General had also 
queried a number of issues relating to the way in which cases were 
10 
closed.  One particular which is quite strange and stark was a case of a 
complaint that was laid in my absence against General  – General 
Phahlane and at some stage a duplicate of the same case made under 
a different case number in the IPID case control system was made and 
subsequently both cases were closed because they were duplicates of 
each other.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes just to illustrate the point.  
You have one case. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Docket investigating a particular 
20 
police official? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  You have a duplicate file 
implicating the same person on the same investigation?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct yes. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 125 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  So the two are in essence copies 
of each other? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The one is withdrawn because it 
has a duplicate? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  And the other is also withdrawn 
because it had a duplicate?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  So both disappear? 
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  So in the IPID’s system both cases are 
closed. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Yes.  But to – you deal with that 
later in your evidence.  To deal with the general point you make in 
paragraph 53 how was the performance of IPID in your absence 
reported including to Parliament?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Thanks Chair.  For us it was reported 
that IPID’s performance had gone up since the appointment – well since 
the suspension of the Executive Director and the appointm ent of an 
Acting Executive Director and …  
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Was this accurate? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  No, no.  It was – it was not accurate 
and it was untrue and the manipulation of statistics and the closing of 
cases under a provision which is called Special Closure is what was 
utilised to come to that conclusion.  It is important to add that there 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 126 of 170 
 
was a criminal case opened up on this matter and disciplinaries which 
resulted in one person being dismissed and another very senior person 
who was responsible resigning from IPID.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Alright.  So in summary in your 
absence after the change of leadership.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  In IPID it was reported you say 
falsely that the performance had improved.  This was a device that was 
used or there was a device used to manipulate statistics to achieve an 
apparent result which was not an accurate result?  
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes.  And the practice was quite 
widespread across provinces an d an instruction had been given at 
some stage the exact nature of the instruction Mr Sesoko could attest 
to but it also occurred within for example KZN I am aware of and 
Gauteng just from the reports that were coming in and from memory.  
So it was not an isolated case it was a number of cases on Special 
Closure.  In fact it – that loophole in definition we then forced the 
following financial year to change the definition of what a completed 
case is and how it is handled.  If I remember correct that also res ulted 
in a new standard operating procedure.  
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Alright. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Which was then signed. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Okay.  In summary what has 
happened is that the leadership of a Law Enforcement Agency 
institution or a government institution is removed and replaced by other 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 127 of 170 
 
leadership.  It is then reported that under the new leadership 
performance has improved.  Is this occurrence unique to IPID at around 
the time? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  No Chair in the period – General 
Ntlemeza indicated that performance of DPCI had gone up after 
General Dramat’s removal and he to that position – he had been 
appointed to that position.  Similarly in SARS the then Commissioner 
Moyane made the same comment that performance an d collection in 
SARS has gone up. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  The Chair will in due 
10 
course consider all evidence placed before him and make a finding in 
relation to whether these are coincidences or whether there was a 
design behind them.  Let us go on with your statement.  Tell the Chair 
please what the fate of Mr Khuba was?  Was he also suspended on the 
21 May 2015? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct.  Mr Khuba was 
suspended and then as we have covered already Mr Khuba was – Mr 
Khuba did a plea bargain with the department.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Before you go there we will deal 
with that in due course in the following paragraph.  
20 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But just to complete what you 
say in paragraph 55 if we may?  The reasons for his suspension I 
understand were the same as the reasons for your suspension and Mr 
Sesoko’s suspension? 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 128 of 170 
 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Dealings with the Rendition 
Report? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Did he also submit an affidavit 
on your behalf and your court challenge to your suspension?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Indeed he did yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then in paragraph 56 you refer 
to certain events that took place before his dismissal which followed.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Tell the Chair about that please.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Ja so some of the stuff Chair I had 
covered earlier when discussing my engagement with Werksmans and 
that I had raised some of these concerns.  But after six months of 
suspension Mr Khuba reached a plea bargain agreement to the 
department.  He would admit nonspecific wrongdoing on a Wednesday 
and the following Monday he would be back at work.  Khuba explains 
that in one of his affidavits somewhere as to what pressure were on him 
and why he needed to come to that – to that plea bargain.  In any event 
he did the plea bargain, he was told to report back for  duty on Monday.  
20 
He then made an affidavit on the Friday.  In that affidavit he covers his 
plea bargain, his reasons and that in his affidavit he did not infer any 
guilt or implication to McBride and Sesoko.  He then arrives at work on 
Monday.  On Monday he gets a call from Mr Ramanyane to tell him that 
he should give him within 24 hours reasons why he should not be 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 129 of 170 
 
dismissed because his plea bargain and his affidavit on the Friday that 
is between the Wednesday and the Friday are – are in contradiction to 
each other and I think Mr Khuba made some written representation.  In 
any event Tuesday morning he was dismissed without a hearing or any 
further explanation.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  The emphasis in paragraph 56 of 
your statement Mr McBride is som ewhat different where you say he was 
dismissed after he refused to falsely implicate yourself and Sesoko and 
upon his refusal he was dismissed with immediate effect.  I understand 
you to say now that no the real reason for his dismissal was a 
10 
contradiction between his contents of his plea bargain and his 
supporting affidavit to you. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Chair I purposefully answered like the 
way in which I did and it is not different to what is here and I will 
explain to you why and then when Mr Khuba c an testify for himself.  
When he signed the plea bargain what he was agreeing that he had 
done wrong he just admitted he was doing wrong.  Separate from his 
signature on the plea bargain a set of charges was added onto him with 
allegations onto the paper w hich was not what he had signed and – and 
this was done in the presence of the – of the Advocate.  But Khuba 
20 
says he did not – he was not aware of that attachment and that is why I 
answered but the discussions with Ramanyane was that why does he – 
does he say he did wrong but he does not go further in saying McBride 
and Sesoko did wrong.  So indeed the last sentence or the last two 
sentences within a week Khuba was summarily dismissed after he 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 130 of 170 
 
refused to falsely implicate me and Sesoko.  And it then – it follows up 
what is in 57 because 57 then goes into detail how the same attempt to 
get him to falsely implicate us continues after he is now dismissed and 
sitting at home. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Let us deal with 57 then.  Thank 
you. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Thanks.  So after Mr Khuba is 
dismissed he was approached by officers from DPCI and promised his 
job back on condition he made a false statement saying that I had 
forced him to change the Rendition Report.  He was visited over a 
10 
period of a number of days on this occasion and on the last of that – of 
those series of visits he recorded a phone call after these visits had 
taken place of one of the people who had visited him.  And the 
recording is with the commission and so is the transcript of the 
recording.  And in the recording Khuba is then informed by Colonel 
Mhlongo that General Mtlemeza will not forget him if he says what was 
discussed he will be restored to his position and that the general is his 
friend and will not leave him and will not dump h im.  And the general in 
the context according to Khuba is General Ntlemeza.  So the point of 
57 is that Khuba is dismissed unfairly in a very un -procedural way.  
20 
Whilst he is sitting at home he is not left alone.  They come to him and 
offer him his job bac k to be restored.  They come right into his house 
but he must do XY and Z which includes implicating in their words and 
it is on the recording. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Alright before we go on with the 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 131 of 170 
 
leave of the Chair we want to play the recording  if we may?  It is very 
brief. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes alright. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  And there is a transcript 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think that – let us do that if – ja let us do that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  May I just say and ask the 
witness.  The recording is an isolated communication that happened 
after a series of communications, a series of visits you say?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In fact according to – if Mr 
10 
Khuba does give evidence and according to your evidence Colonel 
Mlongo visited Khuba on a number of occasions?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And this telephone call is the 
last one of the last in these series of communications whether personal 
interactions or telephonic?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct.  The …  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  The point I wish to make is that 
one can only understand the full import of the transcript and the 
telephonic recording if one understands all that p receded it? 
20 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Absolutely Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  So – and you will point this out 
to the Chair after hearing the recording.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  The recording has been 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 132 of 170 
 
transcribed I am told not instructed Chair I am told accurately.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  And it is in bundle D, Exhibit Yd 
at page 1456.  Is that right?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but we – for now you will play the recording.  Hey 
Mr Pretorius? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Sorry Chair do you have a 
question? 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is okay it is taking over – it is overtaking – it has 
been overtaken by events. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Sorry hold it.  I am sorry Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay not it has  been overtaken by events it is okay.  
Okay alright let us hear the recording.  
[LISTENING TO RECORDING]  [NOT AUDIBLE TO TYPE]  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  I am informed Chair of two 
things.  I am not a linguistic expert Chair by any means but I informed  
that the language is used are a combination of Setwana Sesotho and 
perhaps Sepedi as well and I am also…  
CHAIRPERSON:  And some English as well. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  I am also informed that – I am 
20 
sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And some English as w ell.  Some English. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Some English yes.  That I did 
understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 133 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Chair the – I am also informed 
that the transcript is an accurate transcript.  That may be subject to 
debate in the future. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  But perhaps we should have it 
officially transcribed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  In due course but for the 
moment my information is that it is safe to proceed on the basis of  the 
translation contained at paragraph – at page rather 1459 in Exhibit Yd.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  1459? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Well 1458 it begins but the…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  The parts that we will seek to 
place on record are at page 1459 and following.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  But let us just place this 
telephone conversation in its proper context please Mr…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before we do that let us talk about how far we 
will go today.  It appears to me subject to you and Mr McBride being 
20 
agreeable so that we should try and not finish before five.  What is your 
attitude I know you have been standing there for a long time?  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair if we continue to five that 
may help, but I am not sure in the end it will make much difference.  
CHAIRPERSON:  A difference. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 134 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Because in any event we will not 
finish today and we are in for tomorrow as well.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So whether we finish at four or 
five. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I do not think it makes a material 
difference ultimately because as discussed with you over the long 
adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is unlikely that we should call 
the next witness who is also. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  A witness whose evidence is of 
some length. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The only thing of course is that if we ad d more time 
today we enhance our prospects of finishing tomorrow with him.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe even earlier than later.  That would be the 
case if we do not add more time.  That is the on  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the only consideration. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Ja.  That is entirely in order 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 135 of 170 
 
Chair.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If we may just take a break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I would like. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At some stage between now and 
five. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I think after finalising what we will do beyond 
whether we proceed to five then we can take a break and then resume.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well I thought that we had 
reached “an agreement” on the issue Chair.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We would proceed today till five 
[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I have not asked Mr  McBride. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr McBride what is your situation about proceeding to 
5 o’ clock? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  I would prefer if we did not have to.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, if we did not have to, but you remain available 
tomorrow? 
20 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes.  In addition Chair there is an 
aspect in terms of the first affidavit which I signed.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Which we have not consulted on yet.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 136 of 170 
 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  And which means it is unlikely even 
tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That we will finish. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  And it is quite important, but I have not 
discussed it with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With Mr. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Mr Pretorius. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Pretorius. 
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Advocate Pretorius yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  But I am - in the back of my mind it is 
there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  And it has been submitted last year to 
the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well, but if we finished at half past four then you 
20 
would be fine? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  It would not inconvenience me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would not inconvenience you.  Okay.  Well I am 
trying to strike a balance.  Finish at four and five, but half p ast four is 
fine with you? 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 137 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay.  Not that is fine.  I think let us take a 
break now rather than later.  It is about 26 minutes to four.  Let us say 
we return at quarter to.  Is 10 minutes fine?  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Quarter, 10 minutes? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Quarter to four, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Should it be 10 to?  Quarter to four is fine.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  10 to Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  10 to.  Okay. We will adjourn and resume at 10 to 
10 
four. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed Mr Pretorius.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Thank you Chair.  Mr McBr ide at 
page 1458 is a translation of the transcript, or the transcript of the 
telephone conversation that we have just heard.  I don’t want to go into 
too much detail because Mr Khuba can give original evidence as to 
20 
what happened in the telephone call.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   And if the Chair is to rely on 
any evidence finally it will be that of Mr Khuba.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct yes. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 138 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   What this shows for pre sent 
purposes to place it into context and into the context of your evidence 
is that on the face of it Mr Khuba was offered or promised a promotion 
if he cooperated? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  He was promised restoration to the post 
from which he was dismissed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In other words reinstatement?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Yes, the later transcript will 
deal with the offer of a promotion, am I correct, or is that someone 
10 
else? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is another person, another 
recording. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Yes, alright so for the present 
the offer is that his job will be restored provided certain action is taken 
by him? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Right, to support General 
Ntlemeza is friend and not to support his enemies?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:    That’s correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   And this will be placed into full 
context once we have evidence of the full sequence of interactions  
between Colonel Mahlangu on the one hand and Mr Khuba on the other.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Then it’s hearsay for the 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 139 of 170 
 
moment but Mr Khuba will come to testify to the extent that it may be 
put in dispute but what do you say in paragraph 58 in relation to a 
communication between General Ntlemeza and Mr Khuba?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Ja indeed Mr Khuba has attested to this 
in a warning statement which he signed at the time at which we were 
arrested and charged on the rendition matter.  He spoke about this 
interaction with General Ntlemeza in that statement.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   What was that interaction?  
Chair we’re obtaining the warning statement, we just haven’t got it yet.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Well he indicated that at some stage in 
November 2013 General Ntlemeza who was known to him through the 
interaction in investigations of police and who was Deputy Provincial 
Commissioner for Limpopo had approached him and th e exact sequence 
and discussions we would have to look at the statement again to get it 
as accurately as possible but the key element which was there which 
I’m drawing attention to here is that Ntlemeza was interested in the 
rendition investigation in 2013  already before I arrived at IPID, so there 
was an interest and the interest was you’re holding me back in my 
progress and my career, and during the same period within a matter of 
20 
a few weeks at least from documentation and evidence Advocate 
Mosing also placed pressure on Khuba to finalise his report and on the 
Rendition matter, so that’s the context in which this conversation took 
place.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Then Mr McBride from what you 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 140 of 170 
 
say and it must be common cause Mr Khuba has since been restored to 
his position through an order of the Labour Court.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes Chair before I go there, there was a 
follow up meeting almost a year later, between General Ntlemeza and 
Mr Khuba in ...(intervention)  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   In 2014? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  In 2014, a year later so I am IPID, the 
Minister has asked for all the information in November, this 
conversation is taking place just prior to General Dramat receiving his 
letter of Notice of Intention to suspend him from Minister Nhlegu, so 
10 
that’s the context, it’s General Ntlemeza, he raises his  interest in 
where the rendition investigation is going, a year later General 
Ntlemeza is also aware that something is going to happen with General 
Dramat and that Mr Khuba s hould watch the media. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   And is it your evidence that the 
context of the statement you make in paragraph 58 is that General 
Dramat’s 
removal 
would 
facilitate 
General 
Ntlemeza’s 
career 
advancement? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes Chair and the two instances and 
the subject matter discussed in both conversations there are no way to 
20 
de-link them, they are linked.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Ja, well Mr Khuba will come and 
give that evidence. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Then I understand Mr McBride 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 141 of 170 
 
that you have time constraints and that if possible we should try and 
proceed with your evidence without detracting from its content too 
much as rapidly as possible..  I was informed that du ring the most 
recent break, am I correct?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   In paragraph 60 through to 
paragraph 75 ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Pretorius if the time constraints to which you 
refer are such that, if they affect today as well as opposed to other 
days I will understand if there’s a request that we should not go to half 
10 
past four, I just want to check whether adding that 30 minutes might 
just be an unnecessary inconvenience.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Yes I speak entirely against 
interest Chair but it may require us to go further today because the 
problem is tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, okay.  Mr McBride so is your position that 
we should cover as much as we can today?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Yes, okay no, thank you.   
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Alright. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   From paragraph 60 of your 
statement on page 12 of Exhibit YA you deal with what you discovered 
on your return in regard to what happened to senior personnel within 
IPID, correct? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 142 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   And you deal with the case of 
Felicia Ntshangase, the case of Nmkozi Netsayanda, the case of 
Mahoca, the Director of Litigation Services, the case of Moses Dlamini, 
the case of Mapachu, the Director Executive Support in the Office of 
the Executive Director and then you deal with restructuring the case of 
Vinesh Budu, Marianne Morwaswe, Suziwe Pale, Ndukule Qongo and 
Mamodishe Malope, all those cases, are you able to summarise 
generally what happened in this regard?  The detail is there in your 
statement, the Chair has your statement, it’s on record, what do you 
say about firstly the restructuring or transfer s or dismissals generally 
10 
and secondly the period of time over which this took place and whether 
this took place and whether this was normal or abnormal?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  I think essentially the affected officials, 
that’s now in addition to myself, Mr Khuba and Mr Sesoko, were all 
senior personnel in IPID and were in key critical positions.  Ntshangase 
was Provincial Head, Gauteng and just to contrast it Mr Kgamanyane, 
who was acting as Executive Director, was a Provincial Head, Free 
State, so we have Mr Kgamanyane moving to the National Office, Ms 
Ntshangase I think being suspended or I can’t remember the exact 
sequence of events, and then we have Ma’am Morwaswe who is the 
20 
Chief Director, Legal Services who is then moved to the Provincial 
Head in Northern Cape the Head of Northern Cape is then transferred 
as Head of Legal, the CFO, Linda Gudlu Ncomo, is transferred as Head 
of Corporate Services, Gauteng.  The Head of Supply Chain 
Management, Suziwe Qwele, is transferred to Gauteng.  Mamodishe 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 143 of 170 
 
Malope, the Head of Stakeholder Management is transferred as 
Provincial Head, Mpumalanga and a key one is Ma’am Pargu, he is 
basically the institutional memory of the Department, he is in the office 
of the Executive Director, he is in effect transferred to Stakeh older 
Management.  Another key person who is moved is Mr Mahoka who is 
Director, Litigation Services, that is he is responsible for preparation of 
all documentation including the documentation that dealt with the 
constitutional challenge, he is the immedia te subordinate to Ma’am 
Morwaswe.   
 
So these are the circumstances, where key people are moved, 
10 
there’s no rational or reasonable explanation why it was done, and no 
explanation was ever given except that it was done and I’ve got orders 
from my principals , my supervisor indeed which is the Minister, and I 
am doing it.  This is not unlike what happened in the other two 
institutions that I mentioned.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   What effect did these transfers 
and this restructuring have on the viability or ability to control IPID?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  I think the context of transfers and 
uprooting someone who is at head office for example to Northern Cape 
besides the effect on the functionality of the Department it immediately 
20 
instils fear, immediately instils fear, others they have children, they are 
single parents, they must leave their kids and go to another Province.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   What happened to the person 
who was transferred to the Eastern Cape, would you tell the Chair 
about that? 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 144 of 170 
 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That was Mr Vinesh Budu who was a 
Deputy Head for Gauteng, the Provincial Head in Gauteng after Ma’am 
Ntshangase was suspended comes from Northern Cape and he’s a 
Deputy at Northern Cape and he comes to be the Acting Provinc ial 
Head in Gauteng and immediately you have two people of the same 
level, both Deputy Heads of respective provinces and now the one is 
senior to the other.  There’s immediate tension between the two as to 
how things must be done.  To fast forward a number  of the special 
closures are supervised by the Deputy Head of Northern Cape who is 
now the Acting Head of Gauteng, and eventually after disagreements 
10 
how matters were done Mr Budu was then transferred to the Eastern 
Cape, and he couldn’t question it.  He then left the Department because 
separation from his family he couldn’t tolerate it any further.  He has 
since reapplied for a position in IPID and before my departure was 
appointed to that position, so he is back at IPIC.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Right. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  But he is one example of those 
uprooted and sent somewhere else. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Over what period of time did 
these transfers under this restructuring occur?  Was it months, days, 
20 
weeks, years? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  The exact dates I’m not sure but this 
would be a period of at least nine months.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   You refer in paragraph 75 to a 
report of the Auditor General dated 31 March 2016, was this a report of 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 145 of 170 
 
occurrences within IPID and the performance of IPID during the period 
of your suspension? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes, I think it covered the 15/16 period 
which is a period upon also half of the year which I returned during 
October, but it covered a significant part of when I was abs ent, but if 
you’re head of the organisation you have to take responsibility for 
everything. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   The report appears in Exhibit 
Yd at page 1464 and there’s an extract at page 1475, paragraph 27, if 
you could place that on record p lease. 
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Is that d Chair? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   D, small letter d, Exhibit Yd, 
page 1464 is the first page of the Auditor General Report and the 
extract is at paragraph 27 of 1475, if you could just place that on 
record please. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  I have it Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Right, just read that onto the 
record please, and comment if you will.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Four officials in top management 
position 
have 
also 
been suspended 
or 
transferred  which has 
20 
compounded leadership effectiveness problems, ethical issues in the 
dealing of the Department have also been identified which forms part of 
the ongoing leadership instability.  And this it’s dated 22 n d of July 2016. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Is that the passage to which 
you wished to refer the Chair?  
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 146 of 170 
 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:    Yes, that’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  You returned to office you say in 
your statement at paragraph 76 on the 19 t h of October 2016? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  And you requested a handover 
report? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Did you receive such a report 
from Mr Kgamanyane? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  No I did not. In fact I did not see Mr 
10 
Kgamanyane at work ever again, or any time since.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Your requests for a report on his 
response are in the bundles, do you need to refer to them?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  No, not necessarily Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say you didn’t see Mr Kgamanyane at work again. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before your suspension he was Provincial Head in the 
Free State isn’t it? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He did go back there or you don’t know?  
20 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  No Chair he was transferred to DPCI.  
Now usually when a person is transferred both Departments have to 
agree to the transfer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and certainly the Head of the organisation from 
which he comes should be informed or should have been consulted.  
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 147 of 170 
 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes Chair but the transfer was effected 
by Minister Nhlegu, so it was not done by me, it was done between 
Minister Nhlegu and General Ntlemeza.    
CHAIRPERSON:  In the meantime General Ntlemeza had become, had 
taken General Dramat’s position as head of DPCI?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  I think perhaps at that stage he was 
already permanently appointed to that position.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, either he was acting or he was permanently 
appointed, ja. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct, that’s correct yes.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, but you were not consulted, your views were 
not sought and you did not – you were not asked for your consent or 
anything like that? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Absolutely not Chair.  If I can just add 
on at a stage when the consideration of disciplinary processes against 
Mr Kgamanyane it was at that time that he completed his move to DPCI, 
in fact he took leave for a few weeks upon my arrival – in fact the day 
before the Minister approved his leave for two weeks because it was 
known that I would come back on the 19 t h of October and I think it was 
the Friday I think 19 t h could have been a Tuesday so it was a day 
20 
before, the 18 t h, there’s a leave form which I found which th e Minister 
had approved his leave to be away from the office.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  The communication we’ve just 
referred to and that is Mr Kgamanyane’s response to your request for a 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 148 of 170 
 
handover report is dated the 27 t h of October 2016 and it appears at 
page 1554 of Exhibit Yd, would you mind going there please and just 
tell the Chair very briefly if there’s anything in that you believe bears 
emphasis.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 1554 you said? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  1554. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  That reply should be read in the 
context of your request at 1552. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct Chair. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Where you said in paragraph 3 
the Exco has directed that the follow ing aspects should be covered in 
your presentation. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  What were you seeking to 
establish or find out about?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  I had indicated that there’s some 
explanation in the financial transfers of the Department and the 
Department in general, financial implications of what happened.  The 
Executive Committee of the Department had a meeting and as a result 
20 
of that meeting it was decided that the following information is required  
and that it is proper and correct to have a handover report so that 
decisions that were taken by the Acting Executive Director some 
rationale could be provided for them.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And there are various other 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 149 of 170 
 
matters in respect of whic h you requested information, is that so?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Alright, I’m not sure that it’s 
necessary to go into any detail, but did you receive a cooperative 
response, and I’m referring to page 1554 . 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  So in particular I will refer to page 
1555, which basically sums up the attitude, it’s the end of the sentence.  
“For the record I accounted to whoever who appointed me to 
act for that particular period and any issue, matter and 
uncertainty that you are having you are more than welcome to 
10 
take it up with him as He (with capital letter H as one refers to 
the Good Lord) He is the one who suspended you and 
thereafter appointed me.”  
But that summed up the attitude. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You requested information on 
various operational matters?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  And you say the response you 
received was to put it mildly not entirely helpful?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Ja, it did not assist at all.

ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Right, can we go please to page 
18 of Bundle YA, your statement, at paragraph 77.  Is it correct that Mr 
Kgamanyane faced disciplinary action for what occurred in IPID during 
his period of control? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct yes. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 150 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Do you know what happened to 
that matter? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  The discipline reaction?  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Yes. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  It fell away because he transferr ed to 
another department. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Alright, let’s go then to the next 
topic you deal with on page 18, and that’s the infiltration of IPID by 
Crime Intelligence.  You’ve told the Chair that during the period of your 
suspension three members of Crime Intelligence became employed 
10 
within IPID. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Would you like to comment in 
that regard? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes I noticed upon my return that there 
were – thanks Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Take your time, it’s in paragraph 
78. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Ja, Brigadier Cloe Gommo had been 
appointed Director Investigators and he had come from Crime 
20 
Intelligence.  In effect he was the Acting Head of National 
Investigations in Mr Sesoko’s position.  He returned to Crime 
Intelligence soon after my return to office.  My next encounter with 
Gommo was in Parliament where he was part of General Phahlane’s 
team to come to IPID Investigations.  Gommo would later approach  IPID 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 151 of 170 
 
investigators, Mandla Mahlangu and Cedric Ncabende to offer them 
Brigadier positions to induce them to make false statements to 
implicate IPID managers in wrongdoing, and then I refer to a recording 
made by Mahlangu about his conversation or phone ca ll with Gommo 
and such an offer is made and there is accompanying statements to 
those recording made by Mr Mahlangu.  He confirms to Mahlangu, that 
is Gommo, that he is working with the Northwest team led by Major 
General Jan Mabula, it was actually not ne cessary to even confirm that 
because I had seen him in Parliament on General Phahlane’s side.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Let’s take t hat step by step 
10 
because you’ve just given a lot of evidence in a very short period of 
time.  The first point that y ou make in paragraph 78 is that Gommo and 
others during your suspension became employed by IPID.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :   Shortly after your return went 
back to Crime Intelligence. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was he employed on a permanent basis during your 
absence or it was it was just a temporary arrangement?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  It was – thanks Chair.  It was a 
20 
permanent appointment at IPID. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I want to deal with the recording.  
If you could go to Annexure Q which is at page 1557 of Exhibit Yd.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Just give me the page again?  
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 152 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  It is at page 1557 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Again the full import of this 
recording can only properly be understood when direct evidence is 
given as to its contents and Mandla Mlongo in order to place it before 
the Chair would have to give direct evidence as to what occurred d uring 
the telephone conversation. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct and the context in which 
it occurred and… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  And what preceded and 
10 
subsequently occurred after the conversation?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  And as a party to the 
conversation Mandla Mhlongo can also give evidence as to the 
circumstances under which the recording was made.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct and which the 
accompanying affidavit to the  recording was made. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Right that is all to…  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  In a particular criminal case 
investigation which was opened as a result of this.  
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  So it is a matter of public record 
already is it? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Absolutely. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Right.  Just ask that it be 
played.  Chair this transcript which shows the words in the original 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 153 of 170 
 
language used and then the translation follows.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Could you play it please.  Sorry 
before you start playing.  The transcript refers to a person by the name 
well not by then name by the title of male, m -a-l-e, who is that? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is Mr Mlongo. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then male 1 who is that?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  It is Brigadier Gomo. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Okay.  Would you play it please?  
[LISTENING TO RECORDING] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the end? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  No it continues I am told. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The technicians are looking at you.  
[LISTENING TO RECORDING] 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Thank you.  Once again we will 
check the translation Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  For the moment just to place  on 
record 
there 
will 
be 
independent 
evidence in regard 
to 
this 
conversation including a participant in the conversation.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  I say that provisionally because 
I do not have the final agreement but we will endea vour to place it 
before Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 154 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  The second point perhaps this 
should be dealt with you by – dealt with by you Mr McBride.  The 
telephone conversation appears to have taken place on the 21 June 
2018 that is sometime after your return to IPID, after your suspension, 
is that correct? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is – that is correct Chair.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Right at that time …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think he just looking for something before you…  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Chair I am not – I am back on my …  
CHAIRPERSON:  You trying to look for something that will help you 
10 
with the timing? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  My statement here.  I think on the – we 
need to just double check the date on which it happen ed in particular 
the year.  My – if my memory is right it was in 2018.  It could have been 
– it could have been 2017 as this was one continuous process I will 
have to double check on that in terms of sequence of events ja.  I do 
not have independent recollection now. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Well the heading to the 
recording says 21 June 2018 I presume that can be independently 
checked by our own investigators. 
20 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  My only concern is perhaps the day on 
which the transcription was made I am not – I am not really…  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  That may also be correct. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Because there are number of errors in 
the transcription.  For example reference to Mr Sesoko is reflected as…  
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 155 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Yes we will come to that. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  You say this could have 
happened in 2017? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  In any event – what position did 
you occupy at the time?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  I was the Executive Director of IPID.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  After your return from 
suspension? 
10 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Mr Mlongo what position did he 
occupy at the time? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  He was a principle investigator. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  With IPID? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes.  He was – he was handling a 
number of sensitive investigations.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Alright.  When you say sensitive 
investigations can you name one or two?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Well the obvious one and for this 
20 
particular discussion and what I have testified to a little bit earlier it 
was the investigation into General Phahlane.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Alright.   
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Initially Mr Mlongo was the head 
investigator. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 156 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Right and Mr Gomo what 
position did he occupy at the time?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  He was a Brigadier in Crime 
Intelligence. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Had he gone back to Crime 
Intelligence by this time?  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  By the time of – yes that is 
correct Chair.  At the time of him making that phone call he was in 
Crime Intelligence. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So what we have  here is 
10 
a conversation between a senior officer in Crime Intelligence and an 
investigator in IPID Mr Mlongo.  Mr Mlongo was at the time engaged in 
a number of sensitive investigations involving members of the South 
African Police Service?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Including General Phahlane. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And sensitive in this context has a lot to do with the 
positions in government or society of the persons who were affected by 
20 
the investigations? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Chair that is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Part of it? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Part of the considerations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  The other part was exactly what was being 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 157 of 170 
 
investigated? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Firstly from what you have 
testified about the independence of IPID regardless of the detail should 
a conversation of this type ever have take n place between a senior 
official in Crime Intelligence and an investigator in IPID?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Chair if – if the context is – even if the 
context is not given in this conversation the contents are improper.  As 
there is clearly offers of a job. In fact jobs are just offered out.  
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Yes we know that.  But my point 
– we will get to the content in a moment.  My point is that this is a 
senior officer in Crime Intelligence talking about job offers to a person 
in IPID who is doing investigations into members of the police force.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think Mr Pretorius your question was such that I 
think he had to think whether the conversation irrespective of who it 
was between whether it was proper or not.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So his answer that at whatever level it was improper.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe should be understood in that context.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Yes I am – I am just dealing with 
a different point apart from the content and that is that this is Crime 
Intelligence talking to IPID. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Chair to answer that in its fullest is that 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 158 of 170 
 
it cannot be purely improper for a conversation to be held with two 
former colleagues if I can put it in that way.  The context here is that 
they discussing investigations and that at that stage Brigadier Gomo 
was in charge of Internal Security nothing to do with anti -corruption 
stuff and that why he is – his appearance in 2017, 16 May at Parliament  
with General Phahlane and his team was already problematic.  There is 
– clearly the investigation – the – I mean – aspects of the statement 
say well and subject to confirmation.  We do not want to detective work 
because detective work is busy wasting time  chasing criminals.  There 
is a kind of orientation here which is for me is disturbing.  
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Alright.  Let us go to the content 
then. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  And I will return to the question 
later.  It appears that at page 1558 and following and in summary the 
discussion takes place and it may even be termed an offer on closer 
examination of a post for Mr Mlongo, is that correct?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct Sir. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And on page 1560 the rank is 
discussed first Brigadier then Colonel?  
20 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Now in relation to the post 
occupied at the time by Mr Mlongo would this have been a promotion, 
would it have been a transfer at the same level of seniority, what is the 
position? 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 159 of 170 
 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  So it is a – it represents a promotion 
quite a substantial one exceeding a few levels and jumping a few 
levels. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  So we know then that the two in 
the conversation are discussing a substantial promotion and a transfer.  
If we can go then to page 1561 Mr Mlongo says but look is this not 
favouritism or corruption of some sort, will it not be viewed like that?  
And the answer is, no, no that is nothing to do with corruption you 
resign at IPID and then you work where you like.  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  I mean I – I think … 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  You do not need to comment. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The validity of such a statement 
is … 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Apparent on the face of it or its 
lack of validity.  But what I would like to do is ask you about what you 
know of the conversation at the bottom of p age 1561.  In other words 
on the one hand there is talk of a transfer or a termination of 
employment and reemployment at a much more senior level.  That is 
20 
what we have established so far. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But at the bottom of page 1561 
the translation reads: 
“Remember here you are with us now and we 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 160 of 170 
 
discussed the things that well where your service 
fellow is going down.”  
What is being said there?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That the context is given on page 1562 
and exactly what it means.  It came over on the – on the recording.  
Here it is stated in the fourth line as indistinct.  So Mr Mlongo asks 
Brigadier Gomo why would and what is indistinct there is ED we going 
down.  Because of what?  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Who is ED? 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  ED was me I was Executive Director.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So ED was basically E for Executive D for Director?  
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  That is correct yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ROBERT JOHN McBRIDE:  Reference to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC :  Then in the context firstly of 
what appears on the face of it at least to be an offer of a senior 
position in Crime Intelligence.  Secondly in the context of a 
conversation where the Exec utive Director that is you is quote “going 
down”.  Evidence is then discussed in the middle of page 1562 where 
20 
Mr Mlongo says: 
“All those questions I received I know nothing about 
them.  You see I am going to be a useless 204.”  
And then the response from Brigadier Gomo is: 
“No those questions whether we know them or we do 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 161 of 170 
 
not know them is irrelevant.”  
What is – if you could just give some explanation of that in the context 
of what you know? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  The key issue is they are discussing 
Section 204.  That line before that says Section 4, but.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is 204 of the Criminal 
Procedure Act? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Ja.  It is when an accomplice witness 
testifies against his, his co perpetrators as it were.  Now what is b eing 
offered and what has been explained is that by Khomo is you will be the 
10 
204 and Mahlangu is saying I will be a useless 204 because I do not 
know anything about those questions that were posed to me.  Referring 
to some previous occasion which, which th ey can explain directly what 
it is and Khomo’s position is regardless of whether you know about the 
questions or not and in – so then the subject is changed about where 
he is driving but the issue is regardless of whether you know or not you 
will get promoted and obviously the other witness - Mr Mahlangu - 
would have to give context to that directly, what it meant or what it 
could only have meant or whether it could mean anything else.  Maybe 
there is an innocent explanation for it.  
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  For the moment what needs to 
be explained is a conversation between a senior officer in Crime 
Intelligence speaking to an investigator in IPID who is investigating a 
number of sensitive cases.  An offer of employment at a level far more 
senior than that being held at the time by Mr  Mahlangu.  You the 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 162 of 170 
 
Executive Director “going down” evidence to be given in a case where 
you are to be an accused and he is to be presumably an accomplice 
that appears on the face of it to be the case.  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Well Chair there was an attempt to do 
that when the Mabula Team actually charged and I am sure we will get 
to it later.  Paul O’Sullivan, Sarah Trent, Binang one of the lead 
investigators and Mr  Mahlangu. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And yourself. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  No I was not charged. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Were you not charged with 
10 
entering premises? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  No, no I was not there at all.  I think 
when we consulted I covered that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In a counter investigation. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  No, I was not there on the scene where 
they were charged and what he is discussing is the strategy to now 
include me also because now I am going down as the charge from 
entering premises evolves and snowballs  and miraculously becomes 
racketeering later on. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But you were the subject matter 
20 
of that charge at a stage?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  No, I was not.  I was not [intervenes].  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then I misunderstood what you 
have told me previously, but we will get there.  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 163 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The people involved seem to be 
those referred to at the top of page 1565.  Is that correct?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you proceed Mr  Pretorius.  Mr McBride a few 
minutes ago I wanted to ask you whether you are still comfortable.  Are 
you still okay? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes Chair.  I am good. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Thank you.  You may proceed 
Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Page 1565.  Well let is go to 
1564 before we get to 1565.  1564 Mr  Khomo says: 
10 
“Yesterday you said you are going to…”  
Sorry not Mr Khomo.  Mr Mahlangu says: 
“Yesterday you said you are going to include…”  
It reads Mr Setsubi, but I think we all heard it i s not him.  It is 
Mr Sesoko is that correct?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is right. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then at the bottom of the 
page Mr Mahlangu – is that Mr Khomo says: 
“But there is not anything wrong he did thus far but 
if we can find a way like we discussed that day like 
20 
finding that laptop.  We could find the case that he 
committed.” 
What is the context there?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  I am not sure whose laptop they are 
looking for.  I assume it is Mr  Sesoko’s in the context of the discussion. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 164 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But what is being discussed here 
is the context of the promotion, you are going down is the fact that one 
of the persons to be added to the list they do not have anything against 
him thus far but they are looking for a way of finding a case against 
him.  Am I correct? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Chair let me, let me answer this 
question because it needs a proper answer not that and I should be 
less reticent to just say it as it is.  All of this is a ruse to start a sham  
investigation against IPID to scupper the Phahlane investigation.  That 
is what all of this is about.  This is a plan hatched how to counter IPIDs 
10 
investigation.  That in essence that is it.  It is nothing, it is nothing 
else.  They can come and explain m aybe if they have an innocent 
explanation.  In the context of what took place in litigation between 
ourselves as IPID and the Phahlane Team and Mabula Team who in any 
case are suspects and the two judgments of Prinsloo and Stockton 
forbids this counter inv estigation to take place. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I understand that but perhaps 
what we should do is deal with your evidence on the counter 
investigation. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Ja. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  First. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then this will make sense. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But for the moment it appears on 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 165 of 170 
 
the face of it that this conversation  is talking about a potential case  
against seven accused? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Included in this conversation is 
the prospect of joining Mr  Sesoko as one of the accused.  Correct?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At the bottom of the page there 
appears to be a statement: 
“But there is not anything wrong that he is done but 
we can find something wrong.”  
10 
Do you see that? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes and also in the middle of the page 
when Khomo speaks about or Mr  Mahlangu speaks about Mr Sesoko he 
says: 
“Yesterday you guys said you are going to include 
Mr Sesoko as well and Khuba.”  
So it is a context in which that – that comment or response by Khomo 
at the bottom which you just referred to is said.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well Khuba is mentioned over 
the page.  It is spelt K-H-U-W-A, but I think it should refer to Khuba not 
20 
Khuwa.  Do you see that?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes Chair.  I am on page 1564 in the 
middle. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, Khuba is mentioned on  
1565. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 166 of 170 
 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Not on 1564.  Where? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  On 1564 he is mentioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Intervenes] Khuwa. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Oh I see that yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It must be Khuba on. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1564. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Setsubi who is Sesoko and 
Khuwa who is Khuba.  Yes I see that.  Is that the one you are referring 
10 
to? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  And the importance of that Chair is 
that: 
“Yesterday you guys - meaning Khomo - arbitrarily 
added Mr Sesoko and Mr Khuba to the suspects.”  
And that is that is and then Khomo says:  
“No he is not there.”  
But clearly there has been some discussion in the – yesterday which 
Mahlangu must give context to but that is the context in which it is 
here. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and there is the question 
of finding evidence at the bottom of page 1564.  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  It says. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  “But if we can find a 
way like we discussed that day like finding a laptop 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 167 of 170 
 
we could find the case that he committed.”  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Chair just in terms of – this is not 
unlike the hullabaloo about the rendition.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No I understand. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I am just dealing with what is 
said in the transcript. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes, yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  For the moment rather than. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Ja. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Commenting too widely on it.  It 
is [indistinct] – it is clear what is being said here.  Correct?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The last question I would like to 
deal with for today and then we can come back to this refreshed 
tomorrow.  At the top of the page mail that is Mr  Mahlangu says: 
“Oh okay oh yeah, the others it means it is me, the 
ED, Paul and then it is indistinct and Nkabinde, 
Binang and Prince.” 
Now unfortunately we are dealing with this conversati on before we deal 
20 
with the counter investigation which will explain all of this but who were 
all those people? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  The only person I am not sure is Prince 
who they are referring to and I cannot work out even when I heard the 
recording who Prince is.  So I am not, I am not sure who that is but.  
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83 
 
Page 168 of 170 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What is the name of the 
secretary of Paul O’Sullivan? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Trent. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  So she was also part 
of? 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE: 
 
She 
was 
charged 
initially 
with 
Mahlangu and Binang and O’Sullivan.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  So the people here and 
we will give context to this later, who are they?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes.  So Mr Nkabinde is a person who 
10 
was also approached at some stage to change his evidence and when 
he refused to own up to it he was kicked off the Task Team.  I am just 
going through it quickly and then made complaints to the present 
Minister of Police after being kicked off the Task Team an d then Binang 
was one of the initial accused of the counter investigation which was 
conducted by General Mabula and his team.  In fact it becomes even 
worse.  Binang and it was a subject of [indistinct] judgment.  Binang 
was investigating General Mabula and his team for a range of tortures 
spanning - some of the tortures date back to 2006, 2010 and some of 
the team of General Mabula appeared in court in 2012.

ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us not go into the detail.  We 
are coming there I promise, just the people.  That is Mahlangu, the ED 
who is yourself.  Paul I presume is Paul O’Sullivan. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And Nkabinde, Binang and

Prince. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You do not know who Prince is.  
Now just to foreshadow what you will tell the Chair tomorrow is that 
IPID officials were investigating a number of police officials?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In response to that investiga tion 
there was what you will refer to as a counter investigation?  
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You say on – you will say as I 
10 
understand it on spurious grounds a whole investigation was conducted 
as a response and that went to court and was the subject matter of a 
judgment by His Lordship Mr  Justice Stockton which we will deal with 
tomorrow. 
MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  That is right. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  This is an appropriate time 
Chair.  I think we all need a break. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we can take the – can adjourn for the day.  So 
tomorrow 
at 
half 
past 
nine 
I 
will 
deliver 
my 
decision 
in 
Mr Tom Moyane’s application for leave to cross -examine.  I will not just 
20 
hand down.  I will give full – read the decision.  So that might take 
maybe 45 minutes.  I previously said we would start at half past nine.  
So I think that certainly in terms of resuming the evidence of 
Mr McBride I do not think we would resume it before 10.  So I think 
Mr McBride you do not need to be  here before 10. 
15 APRIL 2019 – DAY 83

MR ROBERT JOHN MCBRIDE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and then once we have finished delivering the 
decision then we might take a break and then resume or resume 
immediately.  So we will adjourn until tomorrow.  So with the evidence i t 
will be after the delivery of the decision in the other matter.  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 16 APRIL 2019
