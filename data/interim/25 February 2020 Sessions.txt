CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Chair in opening we just wish 
to place on record that today we continuing with the SABC – with 
evidence that relates to the SABC.  Chair would recall that on the last 
occasion Chair had directed that the MultiChoice contract between – 
the contract between MultiChoice and SABC was of a matter of public 
importance and that it had to be investigated.  The evidence that we 
will be leading today and possibly tomorrow we relate to that contract.  
Chair there has been various court judgments that deal with what we 
referred to in the previous – on the previous occasion as the Digital 
10 
Migration Policy, the various amendments to that policy.  And a bundle 
has been placed – has been sub – placed before – the Registrar will 
hand it up which is Exhibit CC44.  That bundle Chair is – consists of all 
the judgments that relates to the matter that we will dealing with going 
forward.  Chair the first judgment just in summary – the eTV judgment 
that appears on pages 1 to 25 of that judgment that was the judgment 
that was handed down by Justice Pretorius. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let us quickly admit this? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  As Exhibit 44. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  May it then be admitted Chair as Exhibit 
44? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is called the Digital Migration Judgment 
bundle. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 4 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The file containing various judgments starting with 
the South African High Court Judgment in the matter of eTV PTY 
Limited versus Minister of Communications and Others – case number 
34694/2012 and other judgments in that file. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will be admitted and marked as Exhibit CC44. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Thank you.  The first 
judgment Chair dealt with the issue of whether the Minister which in 
this case the Minister had decided that Sentech was going to be 
responsible for the STB Control Systems and when that happened then 
10 
eTV took that decision to court and the court found that the Minister 
had no right to prescribe to …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe just to ensure that everybody is on the same 
page as all of us because it has been quite some time that evidence 
was led relating to Digital Migration ...…(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you could just take one minute or so to remind 
everybody what Digital Migration is all about so that they can follow. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair.  Chair the Digital Migration 
related to the policies – the first policy on this issue was passed in 
20 
2008 by Minister Matsepe Casaburri which related to the Free to Air 
televisions like your eTV, SABC which were using analogue technology.  
By 
June 
2015 
the 
International 
Unions 
– 
International 
Telecommunications Unions had announced that the date for migration 
from analogue to digital had to be June 2015.  And it was a result of 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 5 of 169 
 
that that then there was the rush then to amend the policies in order to 
fit in and make sure that by the time that deadline comes about then 
there is digitisation of the analogue technology system.  Now in order 
to do that then it was necessary therefore that Set Top boxes be 
secured because in order to change the signal or convert the signal – 
the analogue signal to digital one needed those Set Top boxes.  And we 
had heard the evidence of Mr Roy Kruger, the evidence of Mr Strachan 
and the evidence of Mr Jansen Van Vuuren on why – how many Set Top 
boxes were – would be required by the country.  At the time they were 
talking about 5 million of those for the persons who were indigent who 
10 
could not afford to pay for that and those were going to be subsidised.  
And as a result of that then there were certain amendments to the 
policy which were affected by the various Ministers.  But what Minister 
Dina Pule did on the 10 t h of May 2012 she made a decision that 
Sentech was going to be responsible for the control system and that is 
the decision that eTV took to court and that is the judgment in case 
number 34694 of 2012.  And the court agreed with eTV and found that 
the Minister had no powers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is the judgment by Pretorius BC. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  AJ. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Acting Judge ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And the court found that the Minister had 
no right to prescribe to Free to Air broadcasters who should manage 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 6 of 169 
 
the Set Top boxes and found that ICASA had the power of regulation in 
that regard.  And then the next judgment would also involve 
…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Apart from what appears to have been simply a 
question of law. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were there any important findings that …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of a factual nature? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No not in that case. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nothing. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Not in that case. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  And then eTV again 
brought another litigation against the Minister of Communications.  
Chair will find that at – from page 26. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV 
THANDI 
NORMAN 
SC: 
 
This 
was 
the 
judgment 
before 
…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this is case number 26166/2015? 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In that case the judgment of Prinsloo J 
Chair I observed last night that unfortunately the copy that has been 
placed in the file in the bundle is incomplete.  I beg leave Chair to 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 7 of 169 
 
make a – submit a full set if Chair’s is also incomplete during the tea 
break – we have it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes no that is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But apparently when they were 
…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have not checked whether it is complete or not. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair that will be rectified 
during the tea break. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In that judgment Chair the – what eTV was 
challenging were certain amendments to the Broadcasting Digital 
Migration Policy which we effected and implements around 18 March 
2015.  Now this was after the Portfolio of Telecommunications had been 
split into two.  One had the Minister of Communications and also one 
had the Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services.  The 
proclamation that is relevant is the one who published on the 15 t h of 
July 2014 and then there was another proclamation which was 
published on the 2 n d of December 2014 and the – that dealt with the 
20 
power to make broadcasting policy in terms of Section 3 of the 
Electronic Communications Act which transferred that power from the 
Minister of Telecommunications to the Minister of Communications.  
This is the policy that deals with the Digital Migration Process.  The 
issue that was before court was that he amendment of March 2015 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 8 of 169 
 
stipulated that the subsidised STB’s will not have capabilities to 
encrypt broadcast signals.  And Chair would recall how Mr Roy Kruger 
had described the encryption and the non-encryption.  They had – he 
had emphasised that the reason for encryption which was in 2008 
policy was to make sure that there is no – prevents against theft.  It 
also prevents against hacking either from outside the country or for 
other countries so that they cannot simply tap onto the systems within 
the country.  And eTV on the other hand wanted the subsidised STB to 
be fitted with an encryption facility because eTV wanted to broadcast 
the encrypted signal as a Free to Air broadcaster.  The complaint that 
10 
was brought on review was that the amendment was not preceded by a 
consultation process and therefor it was unlawful and should be set 
aside.  Prinsloo J found that the amendment was not all ...(indistinct) 
and he rejected the arguments by eTV.  And as a result of that he then 
dismissed the application – the review application.  Once that 
happened then eTV took the matter to the Supreme Court of Appeal and 
appealed that decision of Prinsloo J and Chair would find that the 
Supreme Court of Appeal decision at pages – starting from page 85 of 
that – of bundle CC44 and that case is reported as eTV PTY LTD versus 
Minister of Communications 1039/2015 (2016) ZASCA  85 31 May 2016.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It looks like there are about what four or five 
appellants. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
ME KHUMALO:  eTV PTY Limited and others. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And others. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 9 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Versus Minister of Communications and Others. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  And in this one Supreme 
Court of Appeal …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the judgments is written by Lewis JA? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct and it was unanimous 
Lewis and Salduiker J, Swain J and Mgha A and Baartman AJA.  What 
10 
the court found was that when the Minister consulted or went about the 
consultation process the court was of the view that the Minister – no 
sorry, sorry.  The Minister was – the encryption amendment that the 
Minister had implemented was ultra-virus and it was invalid.  And in 
other words the court found in favour of eTV that the Minister had no 
powers to make the amendment in the manner in which she did.  And 
there they – the court does deal with the various amendments 
throughout from 2008. But at paragraph 66 the court made the following 
finding: 
“In my view Minister Muthambi has issued an edict 
20 
he has decreed that the subsidised ST boxes shall 
not encryption capability – shall not have encryption 
capability.  USASA has said nothing on this score it 
cannot make a financial decision that is not 
consonant with the policy.  The Minister’s decision 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 10 of 169 
 
does purport to bind and that is borne out by the 
statements in the answering affidavit that say that 
government will not bear the costs of encryption and 
that if eTV wishes to broadcast an encrypted signal it 
must provide the ST boxes to consumers at its cost.  
That as has already been said makes it commercially 
impossible for eTV to encrypt its broadcast signals 
despite the statements in clause 5.1.2C that it is free 
to do so.  In my view Minister Muthambi did purport 
to issue a binding direction which she was not 
10 
entitled or empowered to do.  For this reason too the 
encryption amendment is invalid.” 
And then in that case then eTV was successful and as soon as 
that happened then the Electronic Media Network Minister of 
Communications and the SABC took the matter to the Constitutional 
Court.  Chair will find that judgment at page 114 and Chair was part of 
the bench.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In that matter.  Yes.  The issue there 
revolved …(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is under case number. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Under …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  CCT14G. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Of 16 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  /2016 I see there is 141/2016 and 145/2-16 as well. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 11 of 169 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  And it is …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And it is reported as Electronic Media 
Network Limited and Others versus eTV Limited and Others 2017 
ZA66/17. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The issue there revolved on the – in fact 
they appealed the judgment on the basis that the Minister was well 
within her rights to amend the policy in the manner in which she did.  
But in that judgment there are findings that have – that are factual in 
10 
nature and also findings that we wish to deal with going forward as the 
Commission because the Constitutional Court made the findings and I 
would like to with your leave Chair to just deal with them quickly 
because the court dealt with that at page 140 and the court made these 
findings and the title – sub-title is the Effect of the Minister’s Selective 
Consultation.  So that relates to the process that was followed by the 
Minister.  Paragraph …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before we proceed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We need to – you need to say that there were two 
20 
judgments. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the Constitutional Court. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes I …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  One being the majority judgment, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 12 of 169 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And the one of Freeman J and Company 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The majority one was written by the Chief Justice. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then there was the Minority one but now I have 
not looked at – now I cannot remember whether ...…(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  There is another. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether it is a concurrence or a descent. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is a descent DCJ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it descent so …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I was going to deal with it in my address 
to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no that is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is important to say it was a split. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Decision. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  In fact …(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the margin was quite narrow. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A 54.  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 13 of 169 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair.  I was going to deal 
with and …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am just mentioning that because …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is important ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The court of first instance found one way. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the Supreme Court of Appeal found differently. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then it went to the Constitutional Court and then 
there was quite a …(intervenes). 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  A split. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A sharp split. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chair in the majority if I 
may put it – yes it is the majority.  The majority found that the decision 
of the Minister was rational and it was valid.  And then the court again 
re-emphasised the principle of separation of powers but what the court 
made – the findings that the court made – paragraph 59 at page 140 
the court stated the following without reading the entire paragraph.  
20 
Chair if you may permit? 
“The Minister solicited the views of some undisclosed 
persons.  In the policy development process the 
Minister 
may 
if 
she 
so 
wishes 
consult 
some 
interested persons or experts on broadcasting digital 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 14 of 169 
 
migration policy.  Broadly speaking the Minister may 
seek more enlightenment on any aspect of the policy 
formulation exercise beyond the parameters of the 
prescribed consultation process.  The legislation 
neither 
forbids 
nor 
regulates 
...(indistinct) 
for 
clarification 
or 
additional 
information 
from 
whomsoever it might be beneficially sourced. This is 
so because some latitude or a reasonable measure 
of flexibility ought to be allowed in the exercise of 
executive authority without effectively undermining 
10 
the values of openness and accountability and this 
extends to the development of policy although she 
was under no obligation to consult.” 
But then the court continues at paragraph 60: 
“Although 
the 
Minister’s 
consultation 
of 
some 
undisclosed 
stakeholders 
potentially 
taints 
the 
process in some way it does invalidate the policy.  It 
needs to be reiterated that it is so …(intervenes).” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know whether you read? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does not or does – or it does but it says it does not. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It does not invalidate the policy.  Yes 
Chair.  Oh did I miss out the not Chair?  I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In my ears it sounded like it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It does. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 15 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I beg your pardon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.   
“It does not invalidate the policy.” 
The paragraph that I wish to draw your attention to Chair is 
paragraph 61 at page 141.  The court says: 
“Have made those findings that – but this does not 
mean that a blind eye is to be turned to her consent 
evoking evasive and suspicious responses or lack 
10 
thereof to pertinent questions raised by eTV for we 
live in a constitutional democracy whose foundational 
values include openness and accountability.  It is 
thus inappropriate for the Minister to not have 
volunteered the identities of those she consulted with 
and what the consultation was about as if she was 
not entitled to solicit enlightenment or did so in 
pursuit of an illegitimate agenda.  This conduct must 
be frowned upon and discouraged.  It does not 
however constitute the necessary and unavoidable 
20 
constitutional basis for judicial intrusion.” 
Then the majority found that the policy did not interfere with 
the policy – did not set it aside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not read the whole of paragraph 60 but I think 
it might be convenient to read it too. I see some …(intervenes). 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 16 of 169 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh up to the end? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Statements – yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which appear to be important. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By the court ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Paragraph 60 again: 
“Although 
the 
Minister’s 
consultation 
of 
some 
undisclosed 
stakeholders 
potentially 
taints 
the 
process in some way it does not invalidate the policy.  
10 
It needs to be reiterated that it is so because she is 
free from any constitutional constraints in the 
information gathering exercise for the purpose of 
policy formulation.  Her disclosure or non-disclosure 
does not necessarily undermine any broadcaster or 
interested persons rights.  eTV could have but chose 
not to pursue readily available openness and 
accountability enforcing mechanisms to achieve that 
objective.  More would be required to conclude that 
the only reasonable inference to draw from the 
20 
Minister’s ill-advised an unfortunate non-disclosure 
is that her consultation of some interested persons 
necessarily redundant to the advantage of those who 
were consulted at the expense of the un-consulted.  
Her consultations with some stakeholders did not 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 17 of 169 
 
without more gave eTV the right to also be consulted 
considering the opportunity it also had to oppose any 
change to the Carrim proposal.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  And in the end then the 
court – the majority found that the Minister was well within her rights to 
amend the policy.  Then Chair the dissenting Judgment is that which 
was penned by Justices Froneman and Justice Cameron. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  They also frowned upon the fact that the 
10 
Minister’s consultation process involved persons that were not 
mentioned and they found that her decision in fact on the encryption 
issue they found that it was irrational and then they proposed that they 
would have upheld – they would have dismissed the appeal on that 
basis.  But what they say if I may just direct Chair to paragraph 157 of 
that judgment which will be at page – I will give you the page now 
Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  175. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Which – 175 that is correct.  What the 
Justices said there is:  
20 
“That the Minister does not tell us why further 
consultation was necessary nor who she consulted 
with.  In this she failed to adhere to fundamental 
constitutional 
values 
of 
accountability, 
responsiveness and openness and for each she 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 18 of 169 
 
offers no explanation.  She does not seek to explain 
why this is not an instance that opens the door to 
secret 
lobbying 
and 
influence 
peddling. 
 
No 
explanation, no reason, unreason, arbitrariness, 
irrationality.” 
That those findings coupled together with the ones of the 
majority judgment are the findings that we are going to touch upon.  But 
then without finishing that aspect Justice Japhta also penned a 
concurring judgment where he was satisfied that there was proper 
consultation and he was proper – also satisfied and supported the 
10 
majority judgment.  And he made one – I beg your pardon Chair if I may 
just take you to one – at paragraphs 202 and 203 of that judgment.  
Justice Japhta stated at paragraph – if I may start at paragraph 200 
Chair that appears at page 187? 
“Here it is not disputed that Minister Muthambi 
sought 
to 
achieve 
two 
purposes 
through 
the 
impugned amendment.  The first was to secure the 
Set Top boxes and the second one was to save 
costs.  The question that arises for determination is 
whether there was a rational connection between the 
20 
amendment and the object of saving costs.  The 
question of security is not disputed.  It cannot be 
again said 201 that the decryption capability would 
increase costs of producing the Set Top boxes.  Even 
eTV are said that if it were to produce Set Top boxes 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 19 of 169 
 
on its own the costs would be prohibitively high 
hence it was in favour of the decryption capability 
being added to the Set Top boxes subsidised by 
government.  It was submitted that eTV was willing to 
cover the additional costs and refund the government 
later.  It follows that excluding the decryption 
capability from the Set Top boxes would save costs.  
Accordingly there is a rational connection between 
the amendment and the objective of saving costs.  
But eTV contends that its offer to cover the 
10 
additional costs and refund government later bears a 
rational relation to the purpose of saving costs.  It is 
not clear to me how a policy that says government 
will pay for the additional costs during the production 
of the Set Top boxes only to be refunded later would 
be saving costs.  It seems to me that such a policy 
would be requiring government to advance money to 
eTV on the promise of a refund later.” 
And he supported in paragraph for these reasons in paragraph 
210: 
20 
“I support the order proposed in the first judgment.” 
Then the last judgment that appears in your bundle Chair is 
the judgment of SOS, Support Public Broadcasting Coalition and Others 
versus South African Broadcasting Corporation Limited and Others.  
Just – madam Justice Kathree Setiluane was the Scribe and the – it is 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 20 of 169 
 
an unanimous judgment and it dealt with …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it was in the Constitutional Court as well. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It was a Constitutional Court Judgment.  
That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe it is the only one where eTV does not seem to 
feature? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes it appears to be the only one Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Because this one is really a matter – it 
was – it dealt with whether or not the Competition Commission had 
10 
powers to – for instance to subpoena witnesses in the light of an order 
that was made in – on the 24 t h of June 2016 where the Competition 
Appeal Court had set aside the tribunal’s decision that the conclusion 
of the agreement between MultiChoice and the SABC did not give rise 
to a notifiable measure and referred the transaction to the Commission.  
Then there was – then what MultiChoice and the SABC did they 
submitted certain information to the Commission but that information 
was found that it was not sufficient and their defence was that look this 
is all we have either some information does not exist or it never existed 
or it could no longer be traced.  Then what the Commission then 
20 
intended to do it asked the tribunal to issue a directive where the 
tribunal would say that the Commission is entitled to conduct 
interrogations of the Board Members of the various entities or any other 
executives as they deemed fit.  And then SABC and MultiChoice 
objected to that and they said the tribunal had no jurisdiction to 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 21 of 169 
 
entertain the Commission’s request and then the tribunal on that basis 
it refused to do so.  Then the matter came then before the Competition 
Appeal Court which handed down its judgment in that matter.  And then 
the Competition Tribunal – Appeal Court I beg your pardon found that 
the – that is the June 2016 order which I have already referred to did 
not and cannot be read to give the Commission powers that would go 
beyond the documentation that was given to it.  And there it says its 
powers were expressly confined the course of the inquiry to be 
conducted by the Commission exclusively to documentation as set out 
in the order.  And that is the order that was then set aside on appeal by 
10 
the Constitutional Court on the basis that the Commission does have 
powers to use – the term that the court used – to use it is – if I may 
just take the Chair to paragraph 227 of the Order?   
“Where the court found that Leave to Appeal is granted.  
The appeal is upheld and the Competition Appeal Court’s 
Order of 28 April 2017 is set aside and replaced with the 
following.  It is declared that the Order handed down by 
the Competition Appeal Court on 24 June 2016 does not 
preclude the Competition Commission from exercising its 
non-cohesive and cohesive investigative powers in terms 
20 
of Part B of Chapter 5 of the Competition Act for 
purposes of discharging its obligations under paragraph 
3 of the June 2016 Order.” 
And then further orders then were directions by the court as to 
by when the reports were to be filed. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 22 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the Order is in paragraph 90 of that Judgment.

CHAIRPERSON:  That the pagination in this file is not continuous from 
beginning to end. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If the - if the affidavits are in the same file.  It is 
better that …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It be continuous. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It be continuous rather than starting a new 
…(intervenes). 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Pagination. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page – ja.  Pagination somewhere in the middle.  So 
if that …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can be done.  That should be done …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if it is going to be problematic then maybe what

ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Maybe to separate it from there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Either separate – well we have now admitted it 
20 
as together. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So maybe you can do an index that makes it clear 
that there are two sections in the file. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In the file. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 29 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  One section maybe you can call it A.  The affidavit of 
Mr Lawrence and annexures.

CHAIRPERSON:  And it should be paginated from page 1 up to – maybe 
page A1 up to whatever …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the second section is the section that 
contains Ms Khumalo’s affidavit and annexures and then it would be 
under B or something.

10 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it starts from one, but then it is under B.

Mr Motsoeneng? 
MS KHUMALO:  From 2011 until he left the organisation.

mistaken.

ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then when he left did you continue in

Page 32 of 169 
 
the position of being a Personal Assistant to …(intervenes). 
MS KHUMALO:  No.  No.  I did not. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To another COO?

were approached by the investigators of the Commission? 
MS KHUMALO:  Yes.  It is correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And they requested …(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before that Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We all have an idea of what a Personal Assistant 
does, but just reiterate what your duties were generally speaking as 
Mr Motsoeneng’s PA. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 33 of 169 
 
MS KHUMALO:  Okay.  On a normal business day.  It will like assisting 
him in the office.  Taking calls, screening the e-mails.  If e-mails need 
attention, his attention I will just print them and make sure that he 
received them and welcoming visitors in the office and doing his 
appointment. 
Make sure that he attends those appointments and when he is 
leaving the office probably he has got meetings outside.  Making sure 
that he gets there and – ja.  That was normally what …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – those were you duties …(intervenes). 
MS KHUMALO:  Ja. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Generally speaking? 
MS KHUMALO:  Generally, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then when you say you would look at 
the e-mails.  Where would you look at the e-mails from?  From whose 
office? 
MS KHUMALO:  From my laptop. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS KHUMALO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Now these e-mails would they be for your 
20 
own personal – were they for you personally or were they for the COO, 
Mr Motsoeneng, that you received on your e-mail? 
MS KHUMALO:  No.  It was for Mr Motsoeneng. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And it was used as an official e-mail for 
the COO? 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 34 of 169 
 
MS KHUMALO:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Then you have in paragraph 4 and 
maybe I should get started with us.  You have just started – you stated 
your qualifications.  Could you just do that?  Sorry.  I omitted that. 
MS KHUMALO:  I have got a Bachelor Degree in Ministry obtained in 
Christian Family Church and then I have got a Diploma in Personal 
Assistant.  I received it from Quest Computer School and I have 
matriculated in 2002 in Asamaloka Secondary School. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and you have already dealt with what 
you were doing at the time when you were employed in 2006. 
10 
MS KHUMALO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Now could you then tell the Chairperson 
about your interaction with the investigators of the Commission.  That 
they approached you and what happened? 
MS KHUMALO:  Okay.  They approached me yesterday and there was 
an e-mail that they have received.  So that e-mail it was sent by the 
former Minister Faith Muthambi and it was – I think it was addressed to 
Ellen Tshabalala and I was copied on that e-mail. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now I am going to just take an 
exhibit that appears – which you have attached to your statement. 
20 
MS KHUMALO:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry.  If you go to page 10 of that 
document which is the very last page.

is another person that was copied in that e-mail is Ashu.  So I do not 
know who that person is.

ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Ms Ellen Tshabalala what was she at the time.  
20 
Do you know? 
MS KHUMALO:  I think it – because it was 2014.  So I think she was 
still the Chair – the SABC Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Chairperson of the Board? 
MS KHUMALO:  Of the Board, yes. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 36 of 169

responded.  So …(intervenes).

10 
Ms Tshabalala she just responded to everyone.

20 
The e-mail that you read earlier on Ms Khumalo that is from the person 
referred to as Zandile – who you said was Ms Tshabalala addressed to 
Honourable Minister Muthambi.  Will you please just read everybody

MS KHUMALO:  Okay.  I will do that.  It is from Ellen Tshabalala.  Her 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218

Page 40 of 169 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MS KHUMALO:  And then there was an attachment to it.  The 
attachment is – the name of the attachment is:  Final Proclamation 
01 August 2014 and then the contents of the e-mail says: 
“See proposed proclamation.  The President must 
sign.  Sent from my iPad.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Now let us look at what attachments were 
there.  Are they attached to the e-mail that is before you now? 
MS KHUMALO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS KHUMALO:  It is the attachment. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you just tell the Chair what those 
attachments were starting with one that appears at page 6?  What was 
that? 
MS KHUMALO:  It is proclamation by President of the Republic of 
South Africa. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is at page 6? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That – it is at page 6 of the bundle.  Thank 
you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you just read the title? 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 41 of 169 
 
MS KHUMALO:  “Transfer of administration and power of 
function instructed by legislation to certain Cabinet 
Members 
in 
terms 
of 
Section 
97 
of 
the 
Constitution.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and if I may just read the next 
paragraph.  It says: 
“In terms of Section 97 of the Constitution of the 
Republic of South Africa 1996.  I hereby transfer 
the powers, functions and duties entrusted by the 
specified legislation and all amendments thereto to 
10 
the specified Cabinet Member as set out in the 
Schedule in English and ... with effect from the date 
of publication of this proclamation in the Gazette 
given under my hand and the seal of the Republic 
of South Africa at – this day of 2014.  President by 
the order of President in Cabinet.  Minister of the 
Cabinet.” 
That document is a draft.  It appears to be a draft.  It is not 
signed.  Am I correct? 
MS KHUMALO:  No.  It is not signed. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then the next document 
that appears at page 7 was that also one of the attachments that you 
have received? 
MS KHUMALO:  Yes.  It is. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could you just tell the Chair what is 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 42 of 169 
 
written on that one? 
MS KHUMALO:  It is written Schedule. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Schedule. 
MS KHUMALO:  Schedule …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS KHUMALO:  And to the extent stated below. 
“The administration and the powers of a function 
instructed by the legislation mentioned in Column 1 
of the table below to a Cabinet Member as 
Executive Authority of that Department mentioned in 
10 
Column 2 of the table are transferred to the Cabinet 
Members mentioned in Column 3 of the table.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS KHUMALO:  1.1. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS KHUMALO:  “Communication related and the legislation.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then you have got three columns.  
The first column deals with legislation.  The second it deals with the 
previous Cabinet Member and then the third column with the Minister - 
the new Cabinet Member. 
20 
MS KHUMALO:  Yes.  It is correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN C:  Yes and that document is three pages.  On 
the third page you also have …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 43 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that Ms Norman just to …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Make sure that the transcript will - whoever reads will 
understand.  There are three columns on the Schedule that the witness 
says was an annexure to the e-mail that she has read. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Column 1 is written legislation.  Column 2 is written 
previous Cabinet Minister.  Column 3 says new Cabinet Minister.  
Maybe for – maybe it is convenient to say now – Ms Norman to say. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  On Column 1 before legislation it reads:  Electronic 
Communication Act 2005 Act 36 of 2005 and then under Column 2 
immediately below previous Cabinet Minister it is written Minister of 
Telecommunications 
and 
Postal 
Services 
and 
under 
Column 
3 
immediately below the reference to new Cabinet Minister it says 
Minister of Communications. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can continue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair we are going to expand slightly on 
this when the next witness testifies …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 44 of 169 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Because he will deal with the policy 
issues.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you had – you wanted to refer to the last page. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair.  Then the last page 
of that was that also a part of the attachment? 
MS KHUMALO:  Yes.  It was. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and that page deals with – it has 
...(indistinct) Act in the first column and it has the previous Minister, 
10 
because 
it 
is 
the 
same 
table. 
 
It 
would 
be 
Minister 
of 
Telecommunications …(intervenes). 
MS KHUMALO:  H’mm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And Postal and then because this was a 
proposed transfer of powers, as it says, then the new Cabinet Member 
…(intervenes). 
MS KHUMALO:  H’mm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Under Column 3 would be Minister of 
Communications. 
MS KHUMALO:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then you also have below 
that the Broadband Infraco Act of 2007 which would have been previous 
Cabinet Member.  Minister of Public Enterprises and then new Cabinet 
Member in Column 3.  Minister of Telecommunications and Postal 
Services. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 45 of 169 
 
MS KHUMALO:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Now when you received these 
e-mails what did you do with them? 
MS KHUMALO:  I normally print them.  All the e-mails that I receive.  I 
normally print them and put it in a folder and make sure that 
Mr Motsoeneng gets it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and do you know the reason why or 
did Mr Motsoeneng have a separate e-mail address that he was using 
which you were also managing for him? 
MS KHUMALO:  Yes.  His e-mail address. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  He had his own e-mail address as well? 
MS KHUMALO:  He had an e-mail address.  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Now when you received 
these e-mails if now somebody were to go to your computer today. 
MS KHUMALO:  H’mm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Would that person find these e-mails? 
MS KHUMALO:  Yes sir. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and is it correct that the investigators 
have also e-mailed your computer? 
MS KHUMALO:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So everything that you have placed before 
the Commission now  
MS KHUMALO:  In my e-mail. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is – it still exists …(intervenes).

is the evidence from this witness.

25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 47 of 169 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The first page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Spelling of his name on the first page of his affidavit 
and you look on the cover – on the spine.  It is different as well as on 
the first page in the file.  At least with mine.  I do not know whether it 
is …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The same as yours.  I hope that his one is correct, 
because he will think that how can you people get …(intervenes).

CHAIRPERSON:  You see before the S it is U not I. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.

we had alerted the Team that bundles to this and because the first page 
was corrected.  I assume that everything was corrected, because it 
…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No.  It was – Mr Carrim I hope that on your file 
on the outside they have spelt your name correctly, because on mine 
20 
they did not. 
MR CARRIM:  Judge Zondo, good morning to you and to the others 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Good morning.

CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.

MR CARRIM:  Which is a female name.

CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR CARRIM:  And that is how I am often spelt.  So Y-u-n-i-s is not so 
bad.

apologies for my two leaders missing, Ms ...(indistinct) and Mr 
Trenworth. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much.  Ms Norman they all may have 
spoken very fast when they gave their names, I don’t know if the 
transcribers would have got that, so it may be that somebody can just 
write the names down and pass on to the transcribers because they 
20 
might not also have got their spellings correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Thank you Chair, that is being attended 
to, thank you Chair.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      Thank you.  Mr Carrim in front of you, 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 52 of 169 
 
you have a file that on the spine is marked Exhibit CC41, do you have 
it? 
MR CARRIM:   Yes I do. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes, if you open that file it has on the 
very first page it says submissions of Mr Yunus Carrim to the Judicial 
Commission of Inquiry dated 30 January 2020 and it is follows up by an 
index, do you see that? 
MR CARRIM:   Yes, yes I do. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you, but at page 4 it is an affidavit 
and that affidavit goes up to page 80.     
10 
MR CARRIM:   Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      At page 80 there is a signature, is that 
your signature? 
MR CARRIM:   Yes indeed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      It is, thank you.   And when did you 
depose to that affidavit? 
MR CARRIM:   Well on the 30 t h of January if I am correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      Yes, and the contents of that affidavit 
true and correct? 
MR CARRIM:   Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Thank you.   And this morning we were 
furnished with another supplementary affidavit from you.  Chair if I may 
hand up it doesn’t form part of the bundle, it was handed up this 
morning and could you just explain to the Chair the purpose of that 
supplementary affidavit.      
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 53 of 169 
 
MR CARRIM:   Yes, I don’t have the copy before me but basically it is a 
reference to paragraph ...…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   They will give it to you just now, give the witness 
first.   
MR CARRIM:   Yes Judge, I will actually more or less read it if you like, 
obviously I refer to who I am, an adult male serving in the National 
Council of Provinces currently as the Chairperson on the Select 
Committee on Finance and obviously I confirm that this is to the best of 
my ability true and correct.  Now there is just minor things, the first one 
is 3.1, the word is missing, so the sentence paragraph 174 should now 
10 
read Chairperson: 
“As far as I can recall the first SABC Board Meeting 
where digital migration was discussed Mr Motsoeneng 
was the only person (that was left out) was the only 
person who opposed STB control.” 
So the words missing there were “was the only person”, for 
which I apologise, that was my draft, I apologise for that.  At paragraph 
225 I picked this up only yesterday and so I approached the 
Commission if I could insert these words, at paragraph 225 the last 
sentence should read as follows: 
20 
“And if I refer the Commission to paragraphs 105 and 
162 of these affidavit amongst other paragraphs which 
deal with the issues regarding how Naspers sought to 
influence government policy on digital migration.” 
This is a direct response to the question of the Commission: 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 54 of 169 
 
“Do you have any direct evidence of collusion and 
corruption?” 
To which I replied: 
“Not direct evidence though Mr Agrizzi was able to 
provide it but if you refer to those specific paragraphs 
amongst others what is very clear, and the Commission 
must decide on this, that what happened either was or 
bordered on being corrupt.” 
And then in respect of the relevant affidavit, paragraph 272 
quotes from a reply that I made in reply to Mr Nono Letele, the 
10 
Chairperson of the MultiChoice Board, and although I refer to the letter 
in paragraph 272, and I have referred it to the Peter Harris office, they 
mistakenly forgot to forward that annexure and when I picked it up on 
Sunday they arranged for the annexure to be attached, but in paragraph 
272 the annexure is referred to, the paragraph is extracted from it, and 
all the annexure does now is confirm that I have written such a 
...…(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      Although it is not numbered, but the 
first page is your signature. 
MR CARRIM:   Yes, yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes, and that was commissioned when – 
this morning, on 25 t h? 
MR CARRIM:   Yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      Yes, thank you.   Thank you Chair.   
Chair this will be placed properly during the tea break so as to follow 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 55 of 169 
 
the sequence in the bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It will be placed at the end of CC41. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    At the end of CC41, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So CC41 will then contain not only Mr Yunus 
Carrim’s main affidavit and annexures but also a supplementary 
affidavit.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      Thank you Chair.  Mr Carrim could you 
just place before the Chairperson your qualifications please? 
10 
MR CARRIM:   Well I have an MA in Sociology for what that’s worth and 
an International Diploma in Journalism but I suppose relevance is that I 
have been an political activist since 1971, I got to Parliament in 1994 
and I remained there though now in the National Council of Provinces 
and the matters before this Commission relate to a brief period of 10 
months when I was Minister of Communications. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      And what was that period? 
MR CARRIM:   If I remember correctly 10 t h of July 2013 to around the 
25 t h of May 2014 when the President announced his new Cabinet. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      Yes.  In your paragraph from pages 1 
20 
right up to page around page 30 you deal with the evolution of the 
digital migration policy under various Ministers but in – the Commission 
has heard – has received that evidence from Mr Roy Kruger, Mr Jansen 
van Vuuren but largely from Mr Roy Kruger who was in charge of 
implementing that policy. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 56 of 169 
 
 
Do you know Mr Roy Kruger? 
MR CARRIM:   Yes in fact he was appointed as the advisor to Minister 
Dina Pule and he is an expert on digital migration and he was brought 
in as I recall because of his expertise, the private sector had 
nominated him and my predecessor had him there and I kept him on. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      Yes, and who was your advisor at the 
time when you were Minister of Communications? 
MR CARRIM:   It was Joan Juagga whom I appointed and Mr David 
Nidrey whom I also appointed.   Mr Kruger was there already as I 
explained. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      Yes without then rehashing all the 
evidence that Mr Roy Kruger has placed before the Commission I would 
just like you in a very brief way to identify the differences between the 
amendments that were effected during your period and those that were 
effected during the time of Ms Muthambi and how those differed and 
how they in your own eyes affected the implementation of the policy as 
a whole. 
MR CARRIM:   Yes, well I can’t recall everything I had said Judge in 
the ...…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you can look at your affidavit if that will refresh 
20 
your memory. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      Yes. 
MR CARRIM:   Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      Okay. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 57 of 169 
 
MR CARRIM:   But basically to summary it I think while the affidavit 
that I have submitted deals with the technical issues of what digital 
migration is and what sector control is and why it is so important to 
diversification of the paid TV Sector Mr Kruger and presumably Mr 
Garth Stracken from the South African Bureau of Standards had set out 
the technical issues, but embedded in the first 30 pages or so are the 
political issues as well and I will focus on that rather than the technical 
issues. 
 
So in 2008 the then Minister, Minister Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri, 
through Cabinet introduced the digital migration policy.   It was very 
10 
clear and explicit and I explain in my affidavit further how that she and 
Cabinet felt that there should be encryption or call it sector box control, 
the term we used in the period I was the Minister, so she thought it was 
crucial to have sector box control for a variety ...(indistinct) until 
Minister Pule in 2012 tweaked the policy.   What she did was remove 
the reference to the term encryption which the experts tell me is a form 
of STB control, but she didn’t withdraw control itself, because to have 
to do that in any event you would have to go to the South African 
Bureau of Standards and change the standard which provided for 
control. 
20 
 
It would take anything between 34 week and 17 months to 
change that, so she left that term there, so when I got there STB 
control was still the policy and indeed at the ANC Mangaung 
Conference, as I explain in the affidavit, there was a strong emphasis 
on the importance to ensure competition in the paid TV Sector, which at 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 58 of 169 
 
that time was dominated 98% by MultiChoice/Naspers and it was felt it 
was important to bring in black, particularly African new entrants and 
the way to do that was to have a control system so that new entrants 
can get in, in a way that government has done in various forms of 
industrial development initiatives, in the automotive industry and so on.  
I explained why the Department of Trade and Industry was so strongly 
for STB control. 
 
So basically when I got there as I explained the environment 
was to put it mildly, very toxic.  Within the Department of 
Communications there were various fractions and factions regrettably 
10 
but within the industry too, and we had the ITU, United Nations 
International Telecommunications Union deadline of June 17, 2015 by 
which time we should have completed the digital migration process, and 
in fact it was meant to have been finished when Cabinet opted for it in 
2008 three years hence which mean 2011, and have in mind that 2014 
elections were looming I thought that this administration of government 
should complete the process, meet the ITU deadline, finalise the 
policies and so the new incoming executive could just implement it. 
 
So there were those pressing deadlines, but having acquainted 
myself with the issues it became very clear to me that there was no 
20 
prospect of the parties themselves meeting the broadcasters concerned 
or the manufacturers concerned and therefore a facilitation process to 
seek some consensus, some give and take.   Sorry Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, before you proceed can we go back to volume 8 
when Cabinet adopted the policy as formulated by the then Minister of 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 59 of 169 
 
Communication, Dr Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri, do you know whether the 
ruling party had already adopted a position or policy position or not yet, 
it was to do that later? 
MR CARRIM:   It is a very good question which I haven’t thought about 
before, I can’t answer that, but I can certainly assure you Judge, and I 
have set it out, that the issue of competition in the paid TV Sector was 
set out very explicitly in the 2012 December ANC conference.  What 
was not set out was the form through which you should secure this 
competition. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR CARRIM:   And allow for African entrants into a very monopolised 
sector. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CARRIM:   And what we had at our available disposal was STB 
control, there was no other option and so we used that, if there was 
some other technology or some other option to diversify, in fact the 
ANC resolution as I recall it says attempts to diversify and encourage 
competition in the paid TV Sector, those are not exact words, I can 
refer to them if I have to, but it is there in the affidavit, have failed so 
far and more has to be done. 
20 
 
So what is certainly clear is by December 2012 the ANC held 
to the view that you must have competition, subsequently before I went 
to Cabinet there would have been at least five or six meetings with the 
NEC Committee on communications where I took the proposal we had 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 60 of 169 
 
after all those consultations and said to the NEC sub-committee the 
facilitation process has failed ...…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, before you focus on that I want to go back also 
to what you found when you were appointed as Minister. 
MR CARRIM:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have told me already that your predecessor had 
made some changes as I understand the position. 
MR CARRIM:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As I understand it what the policy position was then 
after she made those changes differed from the position that had been 
10 
approved by Cabinet in 2008, is that right?   Am I right that differed or 
not really? 
MR CARRIM:   Well as I said it was a tweaking and ...…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, not in substance, it was not a change in 
substance? 
MR CARRIM:   No the idea of sector box control was retained. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CARRIM:   The word if I recall correctly, and it is in my text and if 
you like I can refer to it, they dropped the word encryption but the 
terms STB control was maintained. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CARRIM:   I should also say in fairness to my predecessor that in 
her budget speech around March/April of 2013, about three months 
before I became the Minister, she had hinted that she was going to 
review the mandatory nature of STB control, but as it happened she 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 61 of 169 
 
didn’t do anything subsequently so when I got there STB control was 
still very much the policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that was in line with the 2008 decision?  
MR CARRIM:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was not inconsistent with it? 
MR CARRIM:   No, it was tweaked. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CARRIM:   Moreover there was in September 2012, I think the 14 t h 
of September, my text will have the correct date, what was passed was 
the STB Manufacturing development policy.  The ...(indistinct) of Trade 
10 
and Industry set out why it was important to the growth of the local 
electronics industry and the creation of some date predicted whether 
that’s feasible or practicable I don’t know, 23 500 jobs had surfaced, 
that we would use the digital migration process because of its sweeping 
nature, it was going to transform the entire broadcasting industry.   
 
It is part also, you see Judge you can’t reduce the matter as I 
insist in the affidavit and as the Department insisted when I was there, 
you can’t reduce it simply to a broadcasting matter, it was going to 
transform the broadcasting landscape but even more it was closely 
linked to the overall economic transformation of South Africa, including 
20 
crucially its de-rationalisation, so if you look at our broad socio-
development goals and the Department of Trade & Industry if you like, 
and you can call the officials if you care to, or have the time to, were 
always breathing down our neck not to forego control, so in short there 
was no substantial change when I got there that required us at the time 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 62 of 169 
 
as a collective to forego control, if anything the Department of Trade & 
Energy said just move they said, just move on this and as I said Judge 
we tried to strike a balance between the two sides, and we brought in 
independent facilitators and they failed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      Thank you, Chair ...…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, maybe that is the right time to take the tea 
break. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      Yes, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And therefore you may continue. 
MR CARRIM:   Thank you very much. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, we will take the short adjournment and we will 
resume at 11:35. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us proceed.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair.  Thank you.  Yes, 
Mr Carrim when you were answering the questions to the Chairperson you 
highlighted the difficulties with the parties not agreeing and in 
20 
paragraph 24 of your statement you deal with some of the – what we 
would look at – think it was a simple issue but we that the parties would 
disagree on the terms control conditional access and encryption.  Could 
you just tell the Chair, because your, the proposed policy on your part 
was dealing with conditional access, am I correct? 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 63 of 169 
 
MR CARRIM:   Well, as we held the term SDB Control, now if you talk to 
Mr Kruger and others, Mr Mohapi and others who served at that time as 
the head CEO of Sentech, excuse me, their view was that you could have 
a variety of types of control.  One of which is encryption, another 
sometimes 
interchangeably 
used 
with 
the 
term 
encryption, 
was 
conditional access, that ultimately the government was not so concerned 
about the form of SDB Control use.  That is a technological issue.  What 
we were concerned to do was to achieve the goals, and I have set it out 
in the affidavit, and there is about 16 goals that we sought to achieve and 
they revolved around the issues I raised earlier around diversification, 
10 
de-racialization, transformation.   
So, what I must also say Judge, even the experts could not 
agree on the terms SDB Control, the term encryption and conditional 
access.  Some of the experts held to the view that there are very specific 
and distinct meanings.  Others however said they are interchangeable, so 
even after the facilitation process, though the facilitation process sought 
to arrive at a definition, the different experts, including the same expert 
would use the term interchangeably.  We are politicians’ Judge.  We are 
not technical experts, and I have explained, I have got no broadcasting 
engineering experience.  What we wanted was the policy.  We are 
20 
politicians.   
How you achieve this, is something the technical experts and 
may I say Judge, I should have said this at the outset, I was very 
honoured and privileged to work with a wonderful team.  And it is a matter 
of deep regret to me, and I would like to acknowledge then that all the 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 64 of 169 
 
hard work they put in has come to nought.  Mr Mohapi is utterly brilliant, 
he makes this country proud.  Mr Kruger who is a super-rich person as I 
understood it, he had retired, decided to come and serve Government, 
from the private sector.  Mr Nidri who served the public movement, the 
movement.  Came and offered his services.   
The DG, Wanda Glangamandla and others, they, it is a deep, it 
is a matter of deep regret to me that all the work they put in has come to 
nought.  So I may I just say that on the terms, we thought it is best to use 
the term SDB Control because it avoided the different parties deliberately 
distorting the policy.   
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, thank you. 
MR CARRIM:   And that is advice I got from Mr Kruger and Mohapi and 
others, as I recall it.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So would it be correct to say that from Governments 
point of view, as long as you had control, that enable you to achieve the 
goals that you sought to achieve.  It did not matter what the form of that 
control was, is that correct? 
MR CARRIM:   If I am correct, and again may I stress, I am no lawyer, the 
advice we got within the Departments lawyers and perhaps outsiders was 
20 
that the eTV Court judgment precluded the Minister from deciding on what 
form the control should take and we did not want to undermine the 2012 
Court Judgment that Advocate Norman referred to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR CARRIM:   Moreover, there were people threatening us on both sides.  
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 65 of 169 
 
eTV and them wanted control set if you drop control, we will take you to 
Court, led by MultiChoice.  MultiChoice, SABC and NAMEC – The National 
Association of Manufacturers in Electronic Components, said if you go 
ahead with control, we will take you to Court.   
So to avoid Court action from both sides we evolved a policy 
that said, those who want to use control, they can use it, but they will 
have to pay appropriately for the extra, at that stage equivalent of 18 to 
20 Rands on the SDB Control System.  They will have to pay for it.  Not 
20 Rands, as eTV hinted in one of its Court representations, but far more.  
Interestingly Chairperson, a Minister advised me, who is far more 
10 
accomplished in the Economics sphere, why do you not take the money 
you will secure as a profit on putting in the SDB Control and give it to 
SABC which needs the money.   
So that is what we intended, that is what we started to do with 
National Treasury.  We started engaging with them to say, the profits we 
get from the use of the Control System which bordered on 20 Rand, and 
which was negligible given the overall cost of the SDB and given the 
dividends that will come to Government.  Government invests over 7 
billion, according to the DTI, in areas like automation and mining and so 
on.  It puts money in because you derive from its revenue.  So, in short, 
20 
we were not doing anything which was specifically different from the DTI 
approved – Cabinet approved Industrial Policy Development Incentives.  
We do it all the time, we provide tax incentives.  So, in short, I will stop 
there.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 66 of 169 
 
MR CARRIM:   May I suggest Chairperson, I am going on for too long, you 
obviously free to tell me Mr Carrim, …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that is fine. 
MR CARRIM:   You know we are politicians; we can keep you here, 
…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   No no I understand.   
MR CARRIM:   Regrettably that is our vocation.  You are Judges and 
lawyers and you want to be precise well I am not a lawyer I am afraid, 
and I am what I am.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I can tell you that lawyers are accused of being 
10 
long-winded too.  Okay, Ms Norman? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, yes, thank you Chair.  Thank you, and 
you have highlighted – you have dealt – you have touched on the SABS 
standards, but how were you and when you were proposing the 
amendments to the policy, how – what mechanisms did you at least put in 
place to make sure that whatever Set Top Boxes find their way within the 
country, they would have at least been manufactured within the country, 
and if not what benefits would the local manufacturers derive from Set 
Top Boxes that were not manufactured within the country? 
MR CARRIM:   Well Chairperson, it was the usual story, and perhaps to 
20 
get somebody senior, who was in DTI at the time will be more helpful to 
the Commission for a more technically and economically sound answer, 
but as I understood it we first and foremost felt, if Government is 
investing to give Set Top Boxes to 5.2 billion people who are indigent, 
who are earning below a certain …(intervenes). 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 67 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that million or rather billion? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Ja. 
MR CARRIM:   Sorry, it is 5.2 million, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
MR CARRIM:   Right and the amount would run into billions, we felt that 
we have to protect our investment and part of that amongst 7 or 8 
reasons, for the control system was to encourage the growth of the 
electronic industry in our country.  We also introduced control, taking into 
account WTO restrictions to prevent our market from being flooded with 
10 
cheap imports that will not function properly.   
Experts drew to my attention and may I say Chairperson, I have 
had the privileges under Apartheid of Education and I have for what it is 
worth, a Master’s Degree in Sociology and an International Diploma in 
Journalism.  So, I have privileges that perhaps some other Ministers in 
our Cabinet did not have.  So, I am a journalist, I read on my own, a 
considerable amount, because I felt I should not become beholden to 
technical experts.  So I did a lot of reading too, and it seemed to be 
reasonable what they were saying, that these cheap Set Top Boxes that 
have no Control System, were used in Mauritius and I Googled it myself 
20 
and I found that they were dysfunctional there.   
And we were concerned that some of them were already 
circulating inside the country, and it was alleged that some 70 000 of 
them or there, that number were hold up in the Richards Bay port.  They 
were meant to be brought in but because they did not meet the South 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 68 of 169 
 
African Bureau of Standards, they were not allowed to be brought in.  
Secondly, as I explain in the affidavit, for you to change the SABC 
Standard, and Chairperson you will find annexures to that effect, even 
including a letter.   
The South African Bureau of Standards said that the minimum it 
will take, it is their letter Chairperson, the minimum it will take is 34 
weeks to get agreement.  And that is of course only if there is consensus 
amongst those ferociously opposed to control and those ferociously 
supporting control.  They said the last time they changed the standard – 
SABS standard, it took 16 to 17 months and given the very limited 
10 
prospects at arriving at consensus on the standard, they could not see it 
happening any sooner.   
So because the ITU deadline was looming, the term of the 
Parliament and Government were ending around April/May 2014, we 
decided to retain the standard, which is what the previous Minister, even 
though she might have been edging towards dealing with reviewing SDB 
Control, could not move, she was stuck with it, because she knew 
presumably, I cannot speak for her, it would take a very long time to 
change.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes and whilst you interact again consulting 
20 
various stakeholders on the measures that you just eluded to, ICASA – 
you would have kept ICASA on Board and I see you have attached 
annexure 2 is which is a letter from ICASA which was saying to you, the 
measures that you were proposing to make the Set Top Box control non 
mandatory while you are setting the Government response which is to 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 69 of 169 
 
protect its investment in subsidised Set Top Box’s being the wisdom of 
Solomon to an intractable matter on which all stakeholders are unlikely to 
agree.  That appears Chair at page 87.  So, I would imagine when the 
…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one moment you have started by reading 
before you could tell us where to turn to. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   I beg your pardon Chair page 87. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 87. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, yes.  That is a letter from ICASA which 
was addressed to Mr Carrim. 
10 
MR CARRIM:   Yes, well firstly perhaps I should just quickly explain what 
was the policy we adopted; there was those that were aggressively 
opposed to control, going to Court they said, there were those who for 
control and said if you change the policy we are going to take it to Court.  
So we said fine, what we going to then do is make SDB control the choice 
of whether you want to use control or you do not want to non-mandate, so 
those who want to use it they can do so but they will have to pay for it, 
and those who do not want to use it are free not to use it and they can 
decide later down the road as technology evolves whether they need it or 
not.  So, we then said however, to protect the manufacturing industry to 
20 
meet the requirements of Department of Trade and Industry to meet a 
whole number of goals and is another 14 goals we set out and it is set out 
in the affidavit.   
We will say that the Set Top Box will have a control mechanism 
for an extra 20 rounds at the time, it is about 2 US Dollars if I am correct 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 70 of 169 
 
and those who want to use it they pay, those who do not want to use it do 
not have to pay.  So, the decision if whether you want to use it or not is 
yours.  But the manufacturing and the other needs or goals of the Set Top 
Box policy control policy from 2008 onwards including during the time of 
Mr Phule would be respected and it will be represented in the 
manufacturing part of it having the SDB controlling any case.   
Judge, about a year before I got appointed the Department 
advertised for a tender and it was on the basis of a Control System and it 
we had foregone the Control System we could also have been taken to 
Court by the manufacturers who had invested hundreds of thousands of 
10 
Rands in the process of getting ready for a SDB which would have a 
Control System they invested that money and the South African 
Communications Forum which is yet another organization representing 
very powerful African entrepreneurs hinted to us or at least informally 
that there are people who are affiliated to them will take us to Court 
because they tendered for a SDB Control System, Minister, if you drop it 
then we are going to take you to Court.  So, to manage all of this Judge it 
is not rocket science as a Judge you would probably if I may presume to 
say arrive at the same thing, you saying no control you saying control, 
fine you can each decide, but we have to protect Government’s interest 
20 
and our investment and our manufacturing industry and for what it is 
worth may I repeat the September 2014 Industrial Development Policy in 
the electronics industry which was gazetted, approved by Cabinet was to 
create at least 23500 jobs.   
So, yes we had to protect it and ICASA goes on to say if I may 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 71 of 169 
 
point out Chairperson, that so we urge you to proceed with the 
amendments but they also say we believe the measures are reasonable 
and fair and should survive legal challenge.  Indeed, we got at least two 
opinions, one internal one external that said that the policy we adopted 
on the 4 t h of December 2013 was legally tenable.  May I also say Judge, 
what I find quite offensive and what partly drives this affidavit 
unapologetically was it got personalized to me personally.   
I was targeted by MultiChoice as I say later in an advert that 
goes to the extreme extent of saying several newspapers, Sunday 
newspapers – I think all the Sunday, City Press, Sunday Times they put 
10 
an advert in to say something to this effect I do not remember the exact 
words but they in the text that your policies like it is mine.  Your policies, 
Minister, represent the narrow commercial interest implying eTV obviously 
and they do not represent the interest of our nation Chairperson, notice 
your as if I a marginal Minister as if I a Non-MEC Member never mind I 
have been around since 1971, I could as I have replied to Mr Andre Pierre 
Du Plessis said in the Daily Maverick response to his Daily Maverick 
piece I said you know it is almost implying that the Cabinet were sheep 
that I was some sort of shepherd, that I am marginal Minister a newly 
appointed Minister not in the MEC could shepherd the likes of, can you – 
20 
can you imagine Chairperson, Naledi Pando, Trevor Manual, Aron 
Motsoledi, being shepherded by me?   
It is my policy, it is not mine it was there since 2008, it was 
confirmed by the ANC, the MEC Committee up till eighteen months ago Mr 
Jackson Mthembu was chairing the MEC communications repeated that 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 72 of 169 
 
STB control remains the ANC policy as far as I know it still is.  So, it 
ridges to me.  Secondly, it is we are representing our nation, so it is 
strange.  I am an elected public representative, I am in Government I 
have been there since 1971 and now you take their representative not the 
Government our nation and your policies, you getting very personalized 
around me, so that explains my letters of 14 t h February to Mr Nonothele. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, thank you.  And then you deal of 
having outlined the STB control and the workings and everything that is 
around that is you have testified now.  Then you deal with subheading 
10 
entitled How NASFIS sought to influence Government policy on digital 
migration you will find that at page starting from page at the end of 
page 31 to 32 of your affidavit …(disturbance in recording). 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, let us continue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  Mr Carrim we are 
still dealing with your sub heading that appears at the end of page 31.  
Could you just tell the Chair what you mean by the influence that you 
allude to in that paragraph – in those paragraphs? 
20 
MR CARRIM:  Firstly, we have to understand as I see it on page 32 
paragraphs 103, I set out there the absolute dominance of Naspers.  
Chairperson, at the time that I was serving this particular role, Naspers 
and MultiChoice were – Naspers is a holding company, MultiChoice was 
its subsidiary and as I remember it apart from Tencent the investment by 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 73 of 169 
 
Naspers in the Chinese internet company, MultiChoice was the big money 
spinner.  It had 98% of paid TV.  So that is why I refer to 
Naspers/MultiChoice in the affidavit because MultiChoice could not have 
done many of the things it did were it not part of this powerful, at that 
time, third largest media company in the world.  And so that is why I say 
Naspers/MultiChoice.   
 
Secondly, the need for competition was because we were 
tackling and we continued to do monopolies.  In the mining sector we 
have transformation charges.  In the banking sector, in the auditing 
profession, it is perfectly reasonable for the average Minister or political 
10 
activist to also want to secure some degree of diversification in the paid 
TV Sector.  Moreover, if you have competition, you reduce the cost of 
watching paid TV.  Who watches paid TV if not the elites?  Furthermore, 
the SABC is a public broadcaster.  It was providing a 24-hour channel a 
news channel on a paid TV service.  And if we got digital migration going 
then it should also become available as SABC itself said to free to air, 
anybody can watch it even if they do not have a paid TV service.   
 
So, from 103 onwards what we do is focus on the power of 
Naspers.  It was obviously launched more than a century ago as the 
mouthpiece of the National Party at the time.  And we say here that it was 
20 
the only interesting media group that refused to appear before the TRC.   
 
Thirdly, it dominated the combined presence of all other – all of 
its competitors.  In fact, these facts I got by Mr Nidri, he was my – one of 
my two advisors at the time, and it is drawn from a book or a publication 
of some sort by Professor Eli Noam of the University of Columbia who 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 74 of 169 
 
said in his book, who owns the world’s media, media concentration and 
ownership around the world.  That Naspers own media 24 was extremely 
powerful.  In fact, at the time the Professor I gather said that South Africa 
is the fifth most concentrated media market in the world.   
 
And then I sight examples of it right that Naspers was one of 20 
South African companies, that is 103.4 Chairperson, listed in the Forbes 
2000 Global Companies.  South Africa was in the world’s Top-5 most 
concentrated markets Chairperson.  Media24 accounted for more than 
60% of the daily papers more than 50% of the weeklies more than 70% of 
the magazines.  Accounted for nearly half of all of the community 
10 
newspapers.  So, they would buy up knock and drop news paper and 
control it.  So that was the ...(indistinct) modeling if it is the correct word.  
And it also had – I go on to say 1.360 Chairperson, a monopoly in 
terrestrial and subscription TV. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  More than 98% of direct satellite subscriptions and it 
controlled the largest internet company through MWEB. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  And you refer from paragraph 
105 onwards to the SABC MultiChoice agreement and I see you have used 
the term there, controversial.  In fact, in the SOS judgment that I referred 
20 
the Chair to in the morning written by Justice Kathree-Setiloane Judgment 
of the Common Court, she uses the very term of controversial, the 
controversial agreement.  What were – when you – it was signed before 
your time? 
MR CARRIM:  Yes. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 75 of 169 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  That is a few days before you are 
appointed for. 
MR CARRIM:  On the 3r d Judge.    
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  And I think I was appointed on the 10 t h. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  On the 10t h. 
MR CARRIM:  A week before. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And you list there the terms that you 
felt there were sort of crippling the SABC in a way.  Could you just briefly 
tell the Chair what you felt the effects of the agreement were on the 
10 
SABC? 
MR CARRIM:  Okay.  So firstly, from what I can tell Chairperson at the 
time subsequently Ms Theresa Geldenhuys submitted an affidavit to which 
she attached Minutes of Board Meetings, SABC Board and SABC Board 
Committee meetings.  I have been through them since Friday night when I 
received them and I am not sure whether it has been tabled here yet.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair yes, we are going to refer to them.  
She – Ms Theresa Geldenhuys is one of the implicated persons.  In fact, 
she responds to a statement made by Mr Carrim that they were from time 
to time asked to change the minutes.  So, in response to that she filed an 
20 
affidavit and she attached various sets of minutes.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is the context. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR CARRIM:  So, I have looked at those minutes since Friday night and 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 76 of 169 
 
as boring as they were, I cannot find anything.  They go up to I think 2015 
in a Board Meeting where the decision to have this agreement with 
MultiChoice was adopted.  So, the first point is it was never it seems to 
me unless evidence surfaces Advocate Norman ever adopted by a Board 
Meeting until very late, about 14 months later.  I gather from the media 
that by a vote of eight to six the subsequent Boards, some 14 months 
after the 3 r d of July signed – agreed to the MultiChoice agreement.   
 
May I also take this opportunity as I should have done at the 
outset Chairperson to say that I did not write in my affidavit in paragraph, 
I think it is 179, that Ms Geldenhuys told me personally that at times she 
10 
was under pressure to change the minutes.  I said she had said that as 
well as some Board Members.  And I want to stress that she most 
certainly did not tell me and to the extend I formulated that clumsily, I 
regret it.  I have no intention of impugning her integrity.  So, she certainly 
did not tell me.   
 
But it is certainly not true where she says, in fact, she says I 
quote her, “I have never had a conversation with Mr Carrim”.  That is not 
tenable because I went repeatably to the SABC HQ at Board Meetings 
there and I did have exchanges mostly around pleasantries.  What I do 
recall unless I have got it wrong, she seemed at times to be extremely 
20 
stressed.  Why she was stressed I cannot say for sure.  But at some 
stage it seemed to me it was around the time that there was Ms Lulama 
Mokhobo the Group Executive on the one side and there was Ms Sandile 
Tshabalala the Board chair and Mr Motsoeneng the Acting CEO on the 
other side.  It seemed to revolve around Ms Lulama’s departure, that is 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 77 of 169 
 
what it seemed to me.  And it seemed to be the tensions within the SABC 
Board but certainly she never told me. 
   
Now where did I get this from?  From people within the 
Department.  I have since tried to ask them to send you an affidavit in 
that regard.  At this stage people are feeling ill at ease, let us put it that 
way.  May I also take this opportunity Chairperson if I may to say, quite a 
few people who know a lot about what happened during my tenure there 
said, Mr Carrim or they still call you Minister Chairperson although you 
may not – it is a democracy.  Once you are not reappointed or fired you 
are no more a Minister.  I am not a traditional leader; they are not 
10 
Ministers for life.  But including the SAPS personnel says, hello Minister.  
I have to remind him I am not a Minister, that is ancient history.   
 
So, they say, Minister we totally agree with you.  We are very 
glad you are going forward.  But please we cannot appear there.  So, I 
probe them and they will say, no we are still in the public sector and we 
do not know what will happen at the top.  Secondly, they say, I am not in 
the public sector where they not but I work with the public sector or want 
to come back to the Department so I cannot volunteer my name.  So, I 
commit that I will find out if I can find you a person but take it that she 
did not tell me because that is a fact.   
20 
 
May I also say this because it has been something that I said in 
the outset of my affidavit because it is now removed from that first half of 
my affidavit to the second.  I would just like to read to you because I 
think it is important Chairperson if you feel I am being irrelevant then 
obviously you are in charge. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 78 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR CARRIM:  You tell me no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, that is fine. 
MR CARRIM:  So, I would like to read this because it comes from the 
bottom of my heart really. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  And I think it is important as a politician as if you like many 
will call me a veteran.  50 years now since I first became political active 
in high school. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR CARRIM:  I say in clause 5 …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  May I ask where you are reading from? 
MR CARRIM:  Clause 5 …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph. 
MR CARRIM:  Or paragraph 5 or page 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph 5. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh, right at the beginning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of your affidavit. 
MR CARRIM:  I am going to say this at the outset Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  But I am not seeking to distract from the question.  I know 
it full well.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  And I will come – and you will make sure that I do. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 79 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, that is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  But I do feel that I should say it before it escapes me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  I say there; I fully support the traditional: 
“Commission of Inquiry into allegations in State Capture, 
corruption and fraud in the public sector including Organs 
of the State.  And commend the work that it is doing.  I 
confirm my cooperation with the Commission. 
6. I did not approach the Commission with any complaints 
10 
about my experience as a Minister nor did I nudge 
anybody to do so.  It was the Commission that 
approached me for cooperation.  I was in fact asked by 
a few Ministers, senior members of the ANC and 
Alliance 
leaders 
and 
others 
to 
approach 
the 
Commission about my experience as a Minister.  But I 
did not want to as I felt that the Commission has 
enough on its plate.  I also felt that my experience was 
far overshadowed Chairperson but – by that a former 
Deputy Minister Jonas, Minister Gordhan, Former 
20 
Ministers Ramatlhodi, Hogan and others as well as 
Senior Civil servants such as Mr Maseko and Ms 
Williams.  Besides I did not want it to seem as if I am 
some sort of “cry baby” running to the Commission to 
try to settle political scores because I was not 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 80 of 169 
 
reappointed as a Minister after the May 2014 
elections.  Anyway, in some circles, political circles 
there is a sense that those former Ministers and others 
were removed from positions or not reappointed 
approached the Commission to settle political scores.”   
And elsewhere in the affidavit you will see I respond to that.  I 
knew it was alluding.  I was 100% sure.  I have told people publicly so I 
will say it here.  I thought I was going to be moved as Minister of 
Communications and put in a so called safe like Deputy Minister of Arts 
and Culture or Deputy Minister of Science and Technology under powerful 
10 
MEC Minister.  So, I am not a problem. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  So, what surprised me was that they removed all together 
the Executives.  But that I was removed as a Minister …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry, maybe at that point. 
MR CARRIM:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you just tell the Chair how you got to 
know that you were going to be removed as a Minister? 
MR CARRIM:  Well this is a subject of a novel.  I once said to somebody, 
a journalist, if you write this story of Set Top Box control over the 10 
20 
years or so as a non-fiction Chairperson, your editor and publisher will 
say, no, no, this is fiction.  We have got some very colorful characters 
here, very interesting and some of the e-mails that will presumably be 
adjudicated on for their authenticity which will come to you presumably 
also convey that.   
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 81 of 169 
 
So very shortly after the December 4 t h, 2013, I do not have it 
exactly clear Chairperson, it is a bit hazy because so much happened in 
the 10 months.  So, I think it was around the 22 n d of December, I went on 
leave by 24 t h.  The first tend to came from the private sector from a 
person I think was sympathetic to control.  He said, Minister we hear you 
are being removed.  So, I said, whatever happens, happens.  You are all 
being removed in April 2014.  I understood the election will take place 
then.  But it goes on in …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is December 2013? 
MR CARRIM:  Yes, yes, two weeks after the Cabinet adopted that ANC 
10 
policy and …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  So then going into January I happened to end up in Davos 
because theme for that year January 2014 was something to do with the 
4 t h industrial revolution.  So, the President asked me as the Minister of 
Communications to go.  So, when I get there, there is about three or four 
Senior African Businesspeople who in different ways approached me.  
One of them certainly saying he thinks the policy is fantastic.  He has 
been in the broadcasting sector – I will not bore you with that.  Another 
came to me and said, you are going to be in trouble or was very 
20 
sympathetic to the policy.  They are going to remove you and you know 
who you are taking on, the third largest media industry in the world.  And 
they refer to persons so we’re not here.  Well there is nothing to hide you 
are taking on Koos Bekker.  Do you know what you are doing?  Well that 
was a repeated theme after that right.   
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 82 of 169 
 
 
So, in the months ahead one or two of the participants in the 
facilitation forum were meant to come to a Committee Meeting of the 
facilitation forum, I think around the 30 t h of January 2014, when initially 
said they will come.  Then told me they are withdrawing.  So, I asked 
them, why would you initially say you are coming and now withdrawing?  
They said they were told by the SABC that this Minister is on his way out.  
Do not bother with him and his policy as if it is mine once again.   
 
Also, there is nothing to hide because Mr Motsoeneng is the 
colorful character you and the country know him as.  He seemed to be 
telling people very shortly after Cabinet decision.  Look he said to 
10 
paraphrase, obviously I do not know the precise words and that it was 
conveyed to me by others and not one person, more.  Look then he said, 
do not worry about this Minister.  I got rid says Mr Motsoeneng I am told, 
of an entire Board.  This Minister I will get rid of him. 
   
Secondly, well look there were people who rang me including 
journalist who were picking up that I am on my way out.  Now some of 
these journalists cover the artificially intelligence for IR within the 
broadcasting sector and for some reason or the other they were very 
sympathetic to the policy we adopted.  So, they might have given this an 
inflection, it might have been tendentious reading but they kept asking 
20 
me, are you out?   
 
Then I approached a very Senior African Businessperson and 
said, look, firstly I am being accused of being corrupt – which I would 
really like this Commission to challenge me on.  If that is what you want 
to do, I will address it.  I really because that is the main thing that upsets 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 83 of 169 
 
me.  And I want you to go out and see whether I am taking any money 
from eTV.   
 
Secondly, can you try take the Black Business Council and 
AFCOC also came out in support of the policy.  South African 
Communications Forum representing Astrata of African Entrepreneurs 
came out and supported the policy.  It is just NAMAC and one wing of 
NAMAC as you will see later in my affidavit that said no to control and 
they were closely linked to MultiChoice.  And hopefully there are e-mails 
that will confirm what I am saying.   
 
So, what I am saying in short is there was a buzz in the sector.  
10 
And some of these journalists were saying but they just appointed you.  I 
never admitted to any journalist that I was on my way out.  I was not 
100% sure myself and it was only it was announced or at least I was – 
you know how it works.  The President lets you know or at least the 
Secretary General at the ANC does after President is sworn in, it is about 
late that evening and then through the night and you must have read the 
buzz and so I went to sleep.  Because quite frankly if I am going to get 
appointed, my phone is on, somebody will ring me.  And if I am not, so 
what?  I am not entitled to it.  So, I think that there is a lot more I could 
say but a lot is in my affidavit.  If you want to question me specifically on 
20 
that matter, please do. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  But it was clear I was on my out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  But there …(intervenes). 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 84 of 169 
 
MR CARRIM:  And I have no regrets Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  I tell you no regrets.  I will do exactly what I did because I 
am answerable to collective. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  And even if I knew.  Even if the powers that be said to me, 
Minister is you go ahead, we will fire you.  I would have said, I can do 
nothing about it.  It is your decision whoever the power may be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mm. 
MR CARRIM:  May I also say, I got this businessman.  He went around, 
10 
he came back to me as I recall it and said, you know Yunus or he called 
me Minister obviously – Minister, I remember where we met at a hotel 
Intercontinental just opposite where the O.R. Tambo Airport.  He said to 
me two things.  One, in a cryptic way – he is a very decent very nice very 
balanced person, big businessperson.  He said to me, firstly, I agree with 
your policy.  He used a wonderful term as I recall it.  He said, you cannot 
have a dual system.  Some would Set Top Box or decoders and others no.  
And I think he like many people thought, why should the average person 
in Guguletu or Soweto or Vulindlela not watch soccer matches.  They 
have to pay for it.  So that was what riled him and many other people.   
20 
 
Secondly, he said to me, Minister the very people that you are 
fighting for are stabbing you in the back.  I think he implied, he never 
used his words, SABC.  Thirdly he said to me, Minister the consequences 
are going to be quite bad for you or something like that to which I 
laughed and said, you mean I am going to be fired because I picked it up.  
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 85 of 169 
 
He did not admit to that but that I do know is that it was pleased to be 
well known that I am on my way out.  Including in the City Press 
somebody see I am wonderful at that time.  Media officer I think draw to 
my attention there was a speculation I am on my way out and two or three 
other people. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well two things.  You said that one of the reasons that 
not made you come forward earlier was that you did not want anybody to 
think you were coming forward to the Commission to settle political 
scores. 
10 
MR CARRIM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now I think that it is a pity that that kind of argument 
should be given any credence because some of the people who would be 
saying that would be people who have problems with the existence of this 
Commission.  They would be using those arguments to discourage people 
who have something to contribute to this Commission from coming 
forward.  And some of them I have no doubt would be people who would 
like this Commission not to be there because they do not know whether it 
will end up breaching their territory.   
 
So that is just what I want to say that there are people who 
20 
would be discouraging – they have been discouraging people from coming 
forward for their own reasons.  And we have got to try and just do the 
right thing.  I appreciate the challenges that some of the people face for 
example those who might feel that they would be – their safety would be 
under threat or even their lives would be under threat because of what 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 86 of 169 
 
they know.  We continue to just ask people who can come forward to 
come forward.  The less this Commission knows the better for certain 
people.   
 
But also it means that if we do not get to know certain things 
which did happen and which are known to certain people, it means we 
may be hampered when we come to say what kind of recommendation 
should we put up to make sure that whatever may have happened, never 
happens again.  And of course, some of the people who may have been 
involved in some of the things that we are looking into might not want that 
door to be closed.  Because they might want to come back and continue.   
10 
 
But I appreciate that you are here now and that you are able to 
make whatever contribution.  I just wanted to say that we just have to be 
alive to the fact that some of the people who spread that kind of argument 
are people who do not want the Commission to succeed.  They do not 
want people to come and share with information, knowledge that they 
have about things that are really important for the Commission.  But thank 
you. 
MR CARRIM:  Chairperson, can I just say one quick thing? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  Firstly, I am acutely aware of the challenges that the 
20 
Commission faces.  Partly they were to be expected.  But I only want to 
say one thing to add to what you have just said.  It is not only people who 
have something to fear from this Commission who feel that this is not the 
forum to deal with the issues.  There are people who share your values, if 
I may say so, who also feel while they are very good people in my 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 87 of 169 
 
movement – our movement, they do unfortunately also feel whatever 
issues you have, the more you go there the more you reproduce this.  And 
it damages the economy, it damages our image, it demoralizes people and 
the Commission has gone so far, they made the point.  And so are also 
good people so to speak of nothing to fear from you Commission 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  They also feel the same way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no, I think over the time that the Commission 
has been sitting I have gained the impression that there may be people 
10 
who are not coming forward to the Commission despite the fact they have 
got knowledge of certain things and maybe have a contribution to make to 
the Commission.  But decide or prefer not to come forward not because 
they have been involved themselves in anything of a corrupt nature but 
maybe because they take the view that some of these things that they 
know about should be dealt with in elsewhere.   
 
Now as you say some of those people may be good people who 
have got nothing to hide and so on.  My response to that kind of argument 
is simply that it is a pity that they have that view because I believe that 
this forum is a very important forum.  Maybe it might not be the best 
20 
forum but a very important forum that has the opportunity of coming up 
with measures that are aimed at ensuring that we fix a lot of things that it 
is looking at.  And we would like to have had everybody that shares the 
values that we share, come onboard and say, the country first.  Let us put 
the country first.  Because in this forum nobody is prevented from coming 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 88 of 169 
 
but maybe another forum that some of them may be looking at it is not 
everybody who can go maybe it is certain groups and so.   
 
But this one is open, it is for all South Africans to come forward 
and make a contribution to say whatever it is that we may have gone 
through in our country, what do we do, what contributions do we make 
that might find their way to the recommendations of the Commission to 
the President to say to avoid this in the future, measures A, B, C, D 
should be put in place.  But I think the point you make is an important 
one that not everybody who is staying away is staying away because they 
have been involved in wrong things.  Okay, thank you. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Let us just finish this part 
that you started on Mr Carrim about the – about your appointment and 
you not being appointed to the position.  Could you just tell briefly the 
process that was followed when you were informed that you were not 
going to be appointed.  You said you heard rumors that you are not going 
to come.  Did you at any point say, look let me just find out from the 
President because it is the only person that appointed me? 
MR CARRIM:  I yes, no …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Did you take the trouble of saying, look 
these rumors, what do you think am I fit to continue 
20 
MR CARRIM:  No, that is not me Chairperson.  Chairperson can I just say 
I am no hero.  I am just an ordinary activist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  I guard because of accidents of history. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 89 of 169 
 
MR CARRIM:  It could have been anybody else. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  Deployed in various roles, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  So, I would not do that.  It is demeaning to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR CARRIM:  I am not entitled to any position.  I never asked the 
President ever.  Yes, I know people do go to him to whinge whatever or to 
feel bad, they worked and they do not know why they were removed.  You 
never know.  The way it works, I do not want to belabor this meeting. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  But I think you have some sense.  You do not know whether 
you are being appointed or not.  The rumor start flying around.  In my 
case it is so absurd, I have referred to it elsewhere in the affidavit.  I 
mean a person – well let us leave that we come to that.  There is a – I 
think you will come to it.  There is the Clarissa Mack exchange, 
MultiChoice’s Regulatory Affairs person two months before, I did not know 
about that affidavit, two months before the President announces at 
Cabinet she knows.  Not just that I am out but Ms Muthambi is going to 
replace me.  How does she know two months ahead, MultiChoice does?  
20 
Two? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  Mr Koos Bekker no less in March 2014 issues a 
memorandum where he hints that you know he says I am in the power 
of eTV which is very offensive and you can question me on that.  But – 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 90 of 169 
 
and he says I am temperamentally unsuited.  That is his absolute right 
Chairperson it is his right.  He can say I am stupid.  He can say I am 
not cut out for this job.  I am too left wing or whatever.  But then you 
know he sort of says he is on his way out but you never know but we 
will come to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ha. 
MR CARRIM:  But there are some bizarre things like two weeks before 
the appointment there is a party that Mr Motsoeneng, Mr Calvo Movella 
and they have in Sandton to celebrate.  But Carrim is out.  Jackson 
Mthembu is not replacing him and frankly Muthambi is going to be 
10 
Minister.  How would they know?  It was circulating Chairperson.  So I 
was cool with it.  I would like to have finished the work because I had a 
wonderful team.  It was a disappointment to them.  But no I could 
never.  And secondly you are not entitled to it Chairperson.  What I do 
say since 2000 – 1999 when I first found out how it works I think there 
is no harm in a President once you appoint the Cabinet, you know you 
are not being appointed because you do not get the call.   
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR CARRIM:  Secondly I think it is reasonable for a President to call 
those people he has not appointed – it is always a he in this case that 
20 
is why he.  I said to them, thanks for your work.  He does not have to 
explain why, he is not obliged to but say look you know I wish you well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR CARRIM:  You know or if you have not performed call you in you 
must learn and grow.  And say I took you out for the following reasons.  
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 91 of 169 
 
Not he is obliged.  In this country it does not happen.  I imagine it does 
not happen in other countries too but for us we are not a normal 
capitalist society if I may use that word.  We are if you like a social 
democracy.  The ANC claims we are a National Democratic Movement.  
We claim to be more human than humane than other parties.  So I 
would imagine it is fine but as far as I am concerned, no I will never do 
that and I am cool.  It is the President’s right.  It is the office bearers of 
the ANC's right because he confers with them.  No I am not entitled to 
anything. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You deal with those aspects. 
MR CARRIM:  Later. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  On paragraph 155 but you have touched 
on them now.  We will not repeat them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes quite. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  But then in paragraphs 115 from 105 
actually that is where we are dealing with the MultiChoice Agreement. 
MR CARRIM:  That is right. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But you have made reference to a 
20 
statement that Mr Obbit Maguvhe had made. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In paragraph 116.  This is where you are 
dealing with how much they – SABC liked MultiChoice and you quoted 
what he said at a certain gathering at paragraph 116 there. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 92 of 169 
 
MR CARRIM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But what I want to alert the Chair to is that 
attached to the bundle Chair there is – from pages 207 onwards there 
is an affidavit …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  2? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  207. 
CHAIRPERSON:  207. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  207 Yes Chair.  There is an affidavit of Mr 
Maguvhe I think it is Professor Maguvhe where he responds to what you 
state in that paragraph.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Carrim must – we must know what he states 
before we go to …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Professor Maguvhe. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  But – at paragraph 116 what do you 
say there about Mr Maguvhe Mr Carrim? 
MR CARRIM:  Do you want me to read that? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  Okay.  So it reads:   Chairperson in an article dated 29 
May 2015 Ammu Bongani stated that at the launch of the SABC in court 
20 
channel the chairperson of the SABC Board Mr Obbit Maguvhe I think 
he is Professor sorry proposed a marriage between the Public 
Broadcaster and MultiChoice.  A copy of the article is that hereto is 
Annexure 5. The Chairperson is quoted as saying – I am referring to Mr 
Maguvhe now – Professor Maguvhe these are his words I quote. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 93 of 169 
 
“Actually for me I would not have preferred it to just 
be a partnership.  Actually it should be a marriage.  
You can be our bride and we will be the bridegroom.  
We love so much MultiChoice we want to enter into a 
marriage.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And his response ...…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  His response appears at page 207.  If I 
may Chair just to indicate that the investigators had made available 
recordings of that meeting to a full recording was given to Professor 
10 
Maguvhe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So it does not seem to be really an issue 
but he has asked that this be placed before you so that it is read 
whatever he said there is viewed in context.  That he says:  “I have 
since learnt” 
Paragraph 11 at page 209. 
“With the assistance of the investigators of the 
Commission that the Ammu Bongani article quoted 
from a speech which I gave at the launch of the 
20 
Encore Channel the full recording of my speech is 
available from this link as provided to me by the 
investigators 
of 
the 
Commission. 
 
Regarding 
marriage between the SABC and MultiChoice per 
paragraph 116 of the affidavit deposed to by Mr 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 94 of 169 
 
Yunus Carrim I do not think it is an institution to 
break the laws of our country.  I could have used it 
as a metaphor to mean that the partnership grows 
from strength to strength.  There is nothing untoward 
from my side which I used that phrase for if it is 
found in the records.” 
You have also given a – that – am I correct?  You were told 
about that response? 
MR CARRIM:  I was told about it.  Ja I received obviously Chairperson 
this. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  File only when I sat here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  But as I explained to the Commission prior to this I was 
merely quoting an article in the newspaper 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja. 
MR CARRIM:  And secondly I was merely trying to convey that in effect 
the MultiChoice SABC agreement was almost if you like a merger and 
for what it is worth as Ms Norman will show later the Competition 
Commission found it to be a notifiable merger and explains that by 
20 
dropping encryption many of the best of MultiChoice in effect the SABC 
and MultiChoice had a huge negative impact on the market and what I 
imagined they were saying if you look at the text is that it inhibited new 
entrants.  But I should explain Chairperson if you look from paragraph 
105 onwards I deal with the fact that at the time that I became the 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 95 of 169 
 
Minister there was an interim Board.  And this Zandile Ellen Tshabalala 
was the Chairperson of that Board.  And on the 26 t h of July she wrote 
me a letter signed by her which is attached as an annexure to say that 
the SABC supports STB Control.  And on the 12 t h of August she wrote 
me a letter again completely rescinding the earlier letter and she says 
we are now not supporting Control.  In the earlier letter of the 26 t h of 
July she attaches a memorandum.  If I recall correctly the memorandum 
has the signatures of Ms Mokhobo, Mr Sipho Masinga the Head of 
Technology and indeed surprisingly Mr Motsoeneng.  The memorandum 
is making a case for STB Control.  Then we have a further letter on the 
10 
12 August where she says we are not in support of Control and she 
attaches a memorandum to explain it.  This memorandum is not signed 
by Lulama Makhobo.  It is not signed by Sipho Masinga who is in 
charge of technology, he is the GE of Technology and it has a signature 
if I recall of Mr Motsoeneng and Mr Tiaan Olivier.  Now I also submit in 
my affidavit Chairperson that when Ms Zandile Tshabalala, Ms Makhobo 
and Mr Motsoeneng appeared at the Round Table Facilitation Process 
they – the first meeting said they do not have a position STB Control 
which was puzzling because the position was there since 2008.  And 
they would come back with their position which they did.  The position 
20 
they came with I think it was presented mainly by Mr Olivier at the 
second meeting by the SABC of the Facilitation Process.  I was there 
as an observer.  I did not participate apart from preliminary remarks at 
the first Facilitation and I did not attend all the meetings but I was 
there where they came and presented an argument that they oppose 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 96 of 169 
 
STB Control.  Ms Lulama then sent an e-mail which I have included to 
explain that that was not the position of the SABC.  I also subsequently 
received from the Deputy Chairperson of the four person interim Board 
of the SABC from Ms Noluthando Gosa an e-mail saying Minister we 
would like to meet with you.  The position presented by Ms Tshabalala 
and Mr Motsoeneng have not been approved by the interim Board.  
They are representing their own personal interests and she sent me an 
exchange of e-mails between herself and the Chairperson of the Board, 
Ms Tshabalala and she attaches the first e-mail to me with her name.  
Mr Ronnie Lubisi who is the other interim Board Member and the fourth 
10 
Board Member Mr Vusi Mavuso where they saying they dissociate 
themselves from the representations made on STB Control by Ms 
Zandile Tshabalala and Mr Motsoeneng.  There are also e-mails of the 
same nature, they are actually extracts from the e-mails and the 
annexures Chairperson by Lulama Makhobo setting out a long period 
from 2008 right up until well August 2012 where the SABC is committed 
to set the Set Top box control in March 2013 if I recall they have an 
agreement that they would write to the Minister to do that and so on 
and so on.  So from what I can tell Chairperson there was never a 
Board decision to support STB Control.  According to Ms Noluthando 
20 
Gosa.  According to what I gather Mr Krishi Naidoo says until much 
later and certainly what Ms Makhobo says but you can speak to her 
yourself.  I have gone through the affidavits and I mean and the 
minutes, the voluminous minutes sent by Ms Theresa Geldenhuys, and I 
cannot for the life of me find any Board decision. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 97 of 169 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  What I do have is on the 2 n d of July it is Minutes of a 
sub-committee where a decision was taken to support STB Control 
subject to certain conditions which conditions were never met.  In fact 
within 24 hours on the 3 r d of July it was signed off.  Crucially 
Chairperson it was not signed off by the legally mandated person to do 
that Ms Makhobo.  She was not there.  From what I can gather and you 
can ask her yourself she was opposed to the clause 9 I think it is of the 
contract which dealt with the News24, 24 hour channel and the 
entertainment channel on condition MultiChoice said you do not have 
10 
encryption.  That is pre-empting government policy and changing the 
SABC policy.  I am prepared if it is necessary at all to go through all of 
the minutes well it will not take long about 20 minutes I can go through 
each one and show you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  How the decision is absurd actually.  It is ultra vires to 
use a lawyer’s term. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was no Board decision until much, much later. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  If you need that I can do it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Ja, no can I just take you to the minutes 
of the 6 June which you have attached.  This is before your time. 
MR CARRIM:  Yes 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 98 of 169 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  I did not want to just …(intervenes). 
MR CARRIM:  Yes it would be attached to first. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is attached it appeared from page – 
sorry – Annexure 3 page 90.  90 same bundle. 
MR CARRIM:  Oh you talking about mine? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 90.  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  Yes page 90. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You have got – you have attached to your 
…(intervenes). 
MR CARRIM:  Oh yes we are yes I have got it. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct you have attached the 
minute.  But what I would like to draw your attention to is at page 98.  
This was a meeting with there is various persons MultiChoice was 
represented and SABC was represented where – but I would like to 
draw your attention to what Ms Tshabalala says at page 98. 
MR CARRIM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Maybe 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does not have line numbers but you might be able 
to guide us as to …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  15 maybe. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether it is somewhere in the middle of the page. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Maybe 15 lines.  Which – around the 
middle 15 lines on – from the top Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The matter is going to be escalated? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct yes. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 99 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Ms Tshabalala says the …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is the same. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Have you found it? Same bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The same file that you have been having all along. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes I understand Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and page 98. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Are you on page 90?  90 on top yes. 
MR CARRIM:  90 okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR CARRIM:  Chairperson can I understand the rules of the 
Commission and the norm and the processes.  A lot of my notes are 
actually in my original text. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay that is …(intervenes). 
MR CARRIM:  So I would plead with you to be slightly forbearing if that 
is the word, just bear with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no. 
MR CARRIM:  Because I need to look at my notes but I have got you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay no you need to …(intervenes). 
MR CARRIM:  Page 90 – I am on page 90. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Are you on page 90? 
MR CARRIM:  Yes indeed. 
MR CARRIM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No if there is something in your notes that will refresh 
your memory. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 100 of 169 
 
MR CARRIM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
MR CARRIM:  Good, okay thank you very much. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Ms Tshabalala says 
there that the matter is going to be escalated.  This is the matter of the 
agreement – is going to be escalated to the Board Meeting which is 
taking place on the 12 t h which is next week. 
MR CARRIM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And if one has a look at the minutes of the 
10 
12 t h that I did not want to canvas these areas with you. 
MR CARRIM:   Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Because these are areas that Ms Makhobo 
talks to. 
MR CARRIM:  Will deal with ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And I think she is the appropriate person 
to actually deal with those. 
MR CARRIM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So – but I just – because you have 
attached the minute. 
20 
MR CARRIM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And also just to support the point that you 
make. 
MR CARRIM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That at least the meeting was going to be 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 101 of 169 
 
on the 12 t h of June and by the 6 t h of June there was no endorsement of 
that contract and then the 12 t h of June one does not find from the 
minute of that the approval that you are eluding to. 
MR CARRIM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes but having said that in your own 
analysis you have already indicated that you felt that as you do in 
paragraph 115 that the sale or the access that MultiChoice had to the 
archives of the SABC did not benefit the SABC.  Could you just talk to 
that aspect? 
MR CARRIM:  Yes firstly as I recall what I have said and having looked 
10 
at the minutes Chairperson and having seen media statements.  There 
is a media statement issued by the subsequent SABC Board which says 
that they want to charge Mr Motsoeneng for criminality on two grounds 
as I recall it.  Chairperson I am choosing my words carefully as I recall 
it because if I were to literally read the text out it is going to take us 
days.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR CARRIM:  So …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no that is fine. 
MR CARRIM:  My words are – exact words are in the text. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja paraphrase it. 
MR CARRIM:  And presumably you will give the full text to the people 
effective. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR CARRIM:  So my words are paraphrasing. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 102 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine. 
MR CARRIM:  So as I recall it to save time the SABC Board I think in 
2015 or 2016 after Mr Motsoeneng had left presumably 2016 said two 
grounds.  One is the R11.4 million which he got as the first of three 
tranches I think he was entitled to, he claimed for securing the SABC 
MultiChoice deal of R33 million.  He said he was entitled to.  So they 
wanted that R11.3 million back and as the SIU investigation and I think 
that matter is being handled by the court.  But the second grounds on 
which the SACP spokesperson said they were thinking of taking 
criminal action against him was that he agreed to allow MultiChoice 
10 
exclusive access to the archives without any authorisation of the Board.  
So we who were there then we did not understand what the implications 
were.  But when it grew on us the gravity of what had happened the 
Department Officials were mandated by me to look into this.  But you 
must remember Chairperson our focus at the time was on the ICT 
Green Paper.  The related issues of Digital Migration and Broadband, 
South Africa Connect.  Between the 10 t h of July and the 4 t h of 
December we took three major policy decisions to Cabinet and all were 
approved by a fully-fledged Cabinet no division on it either in the 
Cabinet committee or in the full Cabinet right?  So it was only once we 
20 
began to understand the power of MultiChoice on SABC at the time 
sadly that we realised we have to look more carefully at the 
MultiChoice SABC agreement.  And that is when we – what emerged 
was the fact that not just an agreement to forego encryption against 
government policy and SABC policy and without Board approval but 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 103 of 169 
 
also a bit stunning that SABC will allow MultiChoice exclusive access to 
its archives.  Now we asked for some opinions and you know 
Chairperson you know more than me each lawyer has their own view.  
So there was a view that it is not a legal ownership by MultiChoice of 
the archives to which my immediate reply was that is neither here nor 
there.  It is not a matter of whether legally they had handed over 
ownership which they cannot do anyway but the access is wrong.  It 
must go through the Board and if it is talking about archive access 
some commentators, some experts drew it in the public drew it to the 
public attention or me privately that that is a historical site.  It is a 
10 
culture, the value, the treasurer of the country.  SABC has archives that 
nobody else has.  That is a public broadcaster. You cannot forego it to 
eTV or anybody.  Secondly I have spoken to Mr Niddrey and he cannot 
recall exactly who or if it was he who raised this with me.  But I recall 
Mr Chairperson that some person suggested – it was not just that the 
archives were foregone even if not legally to the exclusive access by 
MultiChoice it is also that the worth of those archives were 
substantially reduced by what MultiChoice offered.  One suggestion 
was at least R1 billion was the value of it and that may or may not be 
true I am no expert.  So when I wrote to Mr Vincent Smit who was 
20 
Chairperson of the ad hoc Parliamentary Committee looking into the 
SABC I set out that our problem with the MultiChoice agreement was 
not just encryption.  Was not just that a big multi-national is deciding 
for government, government’s policy by forcing the SABC to change its 
policy and try to influence us as the government.  Chairperson one of 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 104 of 169 
 
the reasons I agreed to come here and I would have come anyway in 
response to your earlier points is I think this is a clear and explicit 
example it seems to me.  I do not know whether the Commission – of 
what we call regulatory or policy capture.  Now what I have seen 
Chairperson I only watch the news I do not follow the Commission 
because there is not time.  As much as I respect your work but my 
sense is Bosasa you know, SAP, McKinsey and so on whoever appears 
before you their extracting from the state is related to tenders?  They 
either shape if you like the tender specifications subtly and sometimes 
there are many times they pay for it or they ensure that they get the 
10 
tender through various possibly irregular means.  But here is an 
example of actually the first example perhaps before the Commission of 
what one would call regulatory or policy capture.  Now Mr Harris last 
week gave me the text.  Either he got it from Advocate Norman of 
Doctors Kaufman’s presentations to your Commission.  And I read 
through it very fast and I see there I can quote it but it is various parts 
where he says that he and his colleague, another professor, built on a 
Nobel Prize awardee economist view that there is such a thing as state 
capture.  They – it is not capture of institutions it is also regulatory or 
policy capture.  Now this for me at least for me, speaking for myself 
20 
and many who worked with me is a very clear example of regulatory or 
policy capture.  Whereby irregular means you shape a government 
policy and the technique or the – because Chairperson there is 
absolutely no reason to include in a commercial transaction between 
the SABC and DSTV a clause that deals with government policy.  You 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 105 of 169 
 
cannot encrypt your broadcast.  And you will see elsewhere in the 
affidavit Sir that there is a section on re-transmission and you will see 
that in terms of the ICASA rules Chair being reviewed the pay TV 
service is obliged to broadcast the Free to Air broadcasters’ programs.  
So that is SABC 1, 2 and 3 and eTV.  Now interestingly at the time that 
I was there as a Minister the experts said to me that 40% possibly or 
thereabouts of the viewing that took place on DSTV was of the 
programs of SABC and MultiChoice.  Presumably SABC mainly because 
it has indigenous language programs.  And the majority of us in this 
country speak indigenous languages.  Yet the SABC gets nothing in 
10 
terms of re-transmission fees.  So Mr Niddrey and Mr Kruger raised 
with me then that I should approach ICASA about this matter and ask 
them to review it.  Subsequently it seems somebody did.  I was not 
reappointed so I could not follow up on that but what I would like to 
stress is that the encryption aspect had absolutely nothing to do with 
the commercial agreement.  There is no such thing with ANN7. There is 
no such thing with EN – what ENCA.  And when you ask representatives 
of MultiChoice why is it there they do not give you’re an answer.  But if 
you look at the minutes Chairperson of the 6 t h of June since we are 
there I can show you at least four or five examples of how Mr Imtiaz 
20 
Patel actually says that this is a deal breaker.  We do not normally – I 
do not know his exact words and the Commission’s investigators and 
research team, he says things like; you know what we do not normally 
pay for news and we are going to give you R100 million and R553 over 
three – five years.  How do I go to my Board he says the MultiChoice 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 106 of 169 
 
Board – how do I go to them and say it is worth our while if you give us 
something in return is more or less what is there – encryption it is a 
deal breaker etcetera.  But we also point out to you and Advocate 
Norman that on page 6 of those minutes I am afraid …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  I would – it is page 6 would be presumably. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 6 would be …(intervenes). 
MR CARRIM:  Presumably 095. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  Yes but your page 6 I am afraid – oh it is paid 8 sorry. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 8 of the minutes. 
MR CARRIM:  Of the minutes of the 6 t h of June. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is page 97 of the bundle. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  97. 
MR CARRIM:  Page 97. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  I am afraid yours does not correspond to mine. 
Chairperson instead of holding the committee back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
20 
MR CARRIM:  You are recording me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR CARRIM:  And if I am wrong. 
-CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR CARRIM:  You will …(intervenes). 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 107 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can always check ja. 
MR CARRIM:  Correct that.  So let me read to you very interesting how 
Mr Patel operates right? 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR CARRIM:  So Mr Mavuso says, that is Vusi Mavuso, who by the way 
has told me not – I bumped into him he is in Parliament.  Last Thursday 
I bumped into him.  I said is the Commission calling you.  He says no 
because I have been called by the SIU again.  But he told me earlier he 
is very happy to come. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MR CARRIM:  He still holds the view they were right to say control is 
correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  He still holds the view as far as I can tell – I have had 
three exchanges with him that they had no permission Mr Motsoeneng 
or Ms Tshabalala to actually change their policy.  So Mr Mavuso says I 
will read to you literally what is there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  The point was it says that the offer presupposes that is 
the MultiChoice offer that all SABC channels on DTT platform would be 
20 
made available to the public encrypted without a conditional access 
system and thereby incidentally received by MultiChoice’s DDTH 
...(indistinct).  The reality for me I think has changed a broad spectrum 
because as it were now the Minister has pronounced that DTT is no 
longer in our scope.  In other words it is not would it now ...(indistinct) 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 108 of 169 
 
as it were.  DT meaning Digital Terrestrial Television.  Chairperson, Ms 
Norman because she knows me has told me that I speak too fast and I 
have been told that since the age of 5 I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR CARRIM:  So if I am going too fast presumably please slow me 
down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I – no, no you are fine ja. 
MR CARRIM:  It is all there in the text that is why I am reading it fast. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR CARRIM:  So Chairperson he says she meaning the Minister will 
run with that in however way she prefers to do that therefore clause 9 
says Mr Mavuso becomes superfluous because it is not something that 
we can be able to change or be able to say anything about.  I suggest it 
be removed completely says Mr Mavuso.  Then Ms Tshabalala says, 
okay so members the proposal is to remove clause 9.  This is Zandile 
Tshabalala.  We have actually in clandestine meetings – clandestine 
meetings Chairperson – make what you will of that – interrogated this 
whole document and we all disagree with clause 9.  Chairperson my 
emphasis all disagree.  So Ms Geldenhuys says:  Do not say 
20 
clandestine meetings said Ms Geldenhuys.  Ms Tshabalala says okay 
outside meeting.  Well because there was a Board Meeting then GCEO 
meaning Ms Makhobo presented this document for MultiChoice.  We 
listened to it, went through the document and we had a problem with 
clause 9 she repeats.  So I think there is a bone of contention.  There 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 109 of 169 
 
is what we are going to discuss with MultiChoice etcetera, etcetera.  Ms 
Makhobo then goes on to say, Chairperson – meaning the – Zandile 
Tshabalala perhaps clause 10 also – that is to do the ...(indistinct) right 
so I will drop that.  Now elsewhere Ms Patel asks in this text in the – of 
the 6 t h of June meeting.  He asks, is the meeting being recorded?  Ms 
Makhobo says, yes.  Then he says and you know Ms Norman will guide 
the Commission.  He says, well then I have to be circumspect in what I 
say.  Now if you are engaging at a public broadcaster if indeed you 
know you got nothing to hide why is Mr Patel preoccupied with well you 
know I cannot really say what I want to say.  He is dealing with a public 
10 
broadcast here.  These are not two private sector entities. That public 
broadcast is answerable not just to Parliament it is merely answerable 
to – through Parliament to the public.  So Mr Patel may I suggest 
makes himself vulnerable and linked to what else I have said in his 
affidavit and Mr Koos Becker is behind it as I repeatedly say.  
Elsewhere are – points are that Mr Becker and Mr Nono Letele with due 
respect them may well have their strengths.  I saw some in Mr Letele 
with due respect but none in Mr Patel.  He did not seem to be in the 
one year I knew him for ten months say anything original.  What he was 
doing mainly was processing.  Very aggressive processor.  But Mr 
20 
Becker on the other hand as I say was the key person using Mr Calvo 
Movello the current CEO, Mr Patel and others to do his bidding.  But 
those are issues that if you care to I can address but I am happy to go 
through and show you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 110 of 169 
 
MR CARRIM:  Throughout the minutes of the meeting the absurdity of 
the final decision it is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no, no, no, it is not necessary. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  In – at paragraph 131. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I see we are at one? 
MR CARRIM:  Page 131. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh yes thank you Chair. Maybe then 
adjourn for the – take the long adjournment Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I have a feeling that Mr Carrim is not following 
the route you may have planned. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that he has been able to cover quite a lot. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Quite, quite a lot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In a particular sequence. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you would keep an eye so that …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  When we come back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that we do not repeat what he has covered? 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No true Chair we doing that yes.  Thank 
you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We are going to take the lunch adjournment we will 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218

resume at 14:00. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise.

INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready Ms Norman? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we proceed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Carrim, I would like us to go back to the 
discussion we had before lunch relating to people that may not coming 
forward to assist this Commission, because they believe it is not the 
right forum for certain issues.  I just want to make sure that I indicate 
what my thoughts are about that group of people. 
Firstly, I think everybody in South Africa who has knowledge 
of matters that fall within the terms of reference of the Commission 
should come forward to assist the Commission and to share that 
information.  So that the Commission can do its job which is for the 
country really, but if those people happen to also include persons who 
20 
serve as Members of Parliament particularly – I will refer to the 
National Assembly, because there is a specific or there are specific 
provisions in the Constitution that relate to the National Assembly that 
are, I think, relevant to this. 
I think one of them is Section 48 of the National Assembly 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 112 of 169 
 
which you probably know well, because although you are in the 
National Assembly now.  You spent a lot of time in the National 
Assembly.  No, no.  It is not Section 48.  It is Section 42(3).  Section 
42(3) of the Constitution says about the National Assembly: 
“The National Assembly is elected to represent the 
people and to ensure Government by the people 
under the Constitution.” 
And then it says: 
“It does this by choosing the President by providing 
a national forum for public consideration of issues, 
10 
by passing legislation and by scrutinising and 
overseeing Executive action.” 
Which seems to suggest to me that if you are as Member of 
the National Assembly even though you may have been sent there by 
your party.  Once you are performing your functions as part of the 
National Assembly you have got to bear in mind that the National 
Assembly is elected to represent the people. 
Therefore the people of South Africa must come first and then 
if you go to Section 48 it talks about the oath or affirmation that gets 
taken by Members of the National Assembly and it says: 
20 
“Before Members of the National Assembly begin to 
perform their functions in the Assembly.  They must 
swear or affirm faithfulness to the Republic and 
obedience to the Constitution in accordance with 
Schedule 2 and the oath or affirmation contained in 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 113 of 169 
 
Schedule 2 in respect of Members of the National 
Assembly include swearing or solemnly affirming to 
“be faithful to the Republic of South Africa” and to 
obey respect and uphold the Constitution and all 
other law of the Republic and to solemnly promise 
to perform his or her functions as a Member of the 
National Assembly to the best of his or her ability.” 
It seems to me that the oath or affirmation that Members of 
the National Assembly take requires them to place the interests of the 
Republic above everything else and to the extent that the group of 
10 
people that we are talking about may include people who are Members 
of Parliament particularly National Assembly who may have evidence, 
knowledge or information that would be important for this Commission 
to consider. 
To the extent that they might not be wanting to come to this 
Commission, because they think there is another forum that is better 
suited particularly if they are thinking about a political party.  It seems 
to me that they may be acting inconsistently with their oath as Members 
of National Assembly and the – or affirmation – that they are not – they 
may not be putting in the interests of the Republic of the people first, 
20 
because this Commission was specially set up. 
It is established in terms of the Constitution.  Section 84 of 
the Constitution to look into matters of national interest that have 
arisen and it is going to make recommendations to the President.  So I 
thought I must mention that so that no impression is created that one 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 114 of 169 
 
condones those who are not under fear of being harmed in anyway 
physically or killed or anything and who might not really even be 
fearing any victimisation but simply who might think it is not the right 
forum that I think they may be acting inconsistently with the 
Constitution. 
I thought I would just mention that.  You might or might not 
wish to say anything. 
MR CARRIM:  Chairperson, I will be very brief, but perhaps if I may if it 
is not indecorous.  Sometime when this Commission is over and you 
want to engage with me as one South African to another I am happy to 
10 
talk with you …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  But what I want to suggest also is I am no better than 
anybody else.  I do not want to come across as a holier than thou.  In 
fact the very Constitutional Court that you serve so admirably on has 
pronounced on this matter balancing our relationship as elected public 
representatives by parties on a PR List System and the interest of the 
public out there. 
This is misunderstood.  There is an ongoing on/off on/off 
debate on the relationship between public representatives in the ANC 
20 
on a PR List System not a ward or constituency system and the need to 
represent public out there.  My sense is Chairperson – unless I am 
wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR CARRIM:  This takes place now and then.  We are moving in the 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 115 of 169 
 
direction that I think the Constitutional Court decision suggested, but 
Chairperson many of these things that are in constitutions and in 
legislation about the responsibilities of Members of Parliament to the 
public out there whether in a ward elected system or a PR System are 
there in laws and in constitutions even sometimes in the developed 
world too. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR CARRIM:  It is probably true to say that many MP’s do not abide by 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
10 
MR CARRIM:  So it is a – it is increasingly my sense is – without going 
into a long discussion – the international norm.  We as Members of 
Parliament are increasingly seeing by the public out there whether in a 
developed or developing world as not responsible enough to people 
who elect us. 
People are increasingly sceptical of us and secondly there 
are specific challenges we have as the ANC in an emerging democracy.  
Where we are committed to what we call a national democratic 
transformation.  If one wants to use ordinary parlance you would social 
democracy and forging our identity in a society with such acute income 
20 
and material inequalities which are largely racialized. 
With 
an 
untransformed 
economy 
or 
very 
marginally 
transformed economy.  Some of these balances between your service to 
your party and your service to the country are very complex to tread 
and may I say oh this is not just an ANC problem.  The DA has a similar 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 116 of 169 
 
problem, but I will leave it there and perhaps if you feel up to it 
sometime.  I am happy to be available to you to offer my views and 
what I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes, well I would say that if you wish to share 
with the Commission more on this – on these challenges that you are 
talking about.  We would welcome that.  I say that because one of the 
things that I have said publically.  The Commission is looking at is to 
what extent did Parliament exercise its oversight over the Executive 
properly. 
Is it a situation where Parliament might not have exercised its 
10 
oversight functions properly and that is why certain things may have 
happened or if it had exercised its oversight functions the way it 
should?  Maybe certain things would have stopped before they became 
worse.  You know.  We have got to look at that and part of looking at 
that is going to be when you look at Members of Parliament who are 
Members of the majority party in Parliament. 
To what extent do they feel free to hold the Executive 
accountable the way it is expected of any Member of Parliament?  Is 
there a rule to say because the Minister is from my party I must be 
careful?  I must not be too tough on him or her and maybe some of the 
20 
– those might be some of the challenges that may have to be 
confronted to say is there a problem here or is there no problem. 
The holding Executive to account is done in the same way 
whether a Member of Parliament is a Member of the majority party or 
not or is the position that even Members of the Executive know that 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 117 of 169 
 
well opposition parties will talk, but the majority will be with me.  So 
they will not bother me.  You know. 
So those are some of the things we need to look at as the 
Commission because it may well be that if we have Parliament 
performing its oversight functions effectively.  In the future if similar 
things were to arise they would be stopped and the question might be 
what is it that is lacking that we should think of measures that should 
be put in place to make sure that the performance of oversight 
functions would be effective. 
So ideas that you might have about these things would be 
10 
most welcome.  So I would welcome that particularly because you have 
been in Parliament for a long time.  You probably have a lot of 
experience even about how Parliament – how in the National Assembly 
oversight functions are performed and you might be able to enlighten 
me quite extensively which might be quite helpful when one comes to 
say is there something that needs to be done about the performance of 
oversight functions to make sure that one, the levels of corruption in 
the country in the SOE’s and Departments to not continue to 
deteriorate. 
To make sure that they can be brought down by the use of 
20 
proper oversight functions performance. 
MR CARRIM:  May I just suggest very quickly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR CARRIM:  Firstly, I do not really have the authority – political 
authority to speak on behalf of the Parliament. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 118 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. No, no, no. 
MR CARRIM:  So I will respectfully …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  Decline your offer …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  But I know you want MP’s to appear …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  Before the Parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  It is appropriate for the two Chief Whips in particularly 
10 
National Assembly Chief Whips …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  To respond to your concerns. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  Secondly you Chairperson and others here know far 
more than me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR CARRIM:  How powerful …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR CARRIM:  The role of Parliament is in terms of the Constitution 
20 
…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR CARRIM:  And a plethora of the post 1994 legislation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
MR CARRIM:  We have no choice …(intervenes). 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 119 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR CARRIM:  In terms of law …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR CARRIM:  In terms of the Constitution …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR CARRIM:  To play an effective oversight role. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR CARRIM:  We ourselves as the ANC and here I say – speak on 
behalf of us – the majority of us have been saying it publically 
particularly the previous Chief Whip, Mr Mothapo.  He is on record – if I 
10 
recall – and other Chief Whips, Mr Max Sisulu and so on.  We have 
repeatedly said play our role more effectively. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR CARRIM:  At the time that Eskom appeared …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR CARRIM:  Before a special inquiry of the Public Enterprises 
Committee.  There were a lot of statements made by ANC MP’s that if 
we exercised our role …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR CARRIM:  As effectively as the Constitution and the laws require 
20 
and more fundamentally …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR CARRIM:  What our ANC policy set out about a national democratic 
Parliament …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 120 of 169 
 
MR CARRIM:  A people’s organ. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR CARRIM:  If you look Chairperson you a Constitutional expert.  We 
are politicians.  There is no different between what underlies your 
values and what you have just said …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR CARRIM:  And what are in the Constitution and what we say.  If you 
look at the period 1994 to 2004 there are so many articles written 
Chairperson on Parliament as a tribune of the people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
10 
MR CARRIM:  Some of it is jargon from the pre 1994 Parliament as an 
organ of popular power and it defers.  Some committees – ANC led 
committees obviously have strong Chairpersons and Whips.  The Whips 
are like the political heads of the study group.  The Chair is the 
functional Chairperson of the Parliament as a whole.  Who are more 
experienced?  They exercise a very effective oversight role. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR CARRIM:  Others who are new feel intimidated, because often the 
Chairperson is an ordinary Member of the ANC and the Minister is the 
National Executive Committee.  So if you like in Parliament the ordinary 
20 
member is the political boss …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR CARRIM:  Because the Minister is answerable to him, but in the 
political party structures the Minister is the boss, because he is in the 
NEC …(intervenes). 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 121 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is part of the deduction. 
MR CARRIM:  But I know Chairperson, you have raised this.  You have 
reached out to me via your Commission representatives on the SAA 
matter and I have cooperated and so I think the Chief Whip will decide 
who she wants to bring to Parliament …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  But I cannot decide to speak on behalf of Parliament as 
you will appreciate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no.  I was not inviting you to speak on behalf 
of Parliament or anybody.  I was looking more at your own personal 
experiences having been a Member …(intervenes). 
MR CARRIM:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of Parliament over a long period.  I will – the 
Commission will be communicating with - with parliamentary structures 
at that level, but personal experiences for – of people who say I have 
been there over this period.  This is what I have observed.  That kind of 
thing is what I was talking about but thank you very much. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  Mr Carrim, 
20 
before we adjourned for lunch the issue that you were dealing with was 
you had just read the one set of minutes dated 6 June 2013 and you 
asked that you would like to refer to one or two others.  You may take it 
that as you know the Chairperson has read your entire affidavit 
together with all the annexures. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 122 of 169 
 
So if you could just be very brief and make reference to the 
one that you would like to draw the attention of the Chair to.  Thank 
…(intervenes). 
MR CARRIM:  Chairperson …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
MR CARRIM:  I am not going to read the minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  But lest it be seen that I am speaking in generality 
…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR CARRIM:  Like a typical politician. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR CARRIM:  When Ms Geldenhuys gave the Commission her affidavit 
she attached the minutes and my affidavit was written before that.  I 
had no idea how on the ball as it were the affidavit was and just – I will 
simply refer to the page numbers and summarise them, but the actual 
minutes will take too long to read. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  So if one looks at 95 in Theresa Geldenhuys’ CC32 file. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I beg your pardon Chair.  The exhibit – 
20 
that is Exhibit CC43. 
MR CARRIM:  Oh.  It is CC43.  Sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I do not think that has been handed up to 
you yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  That has not been handed up? 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 123 of 169 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, no Chair.  No.  Not yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is exhibit …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is in Exhibit CC43 …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  CC40 – that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what page?  95? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   
MR CARRIM:  Well I have I am afraid CC32.  It says SABC reference 
10 
bundle …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR CARRIM:  And that is on page 95, but what might help the 
committee …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  Since we are not going to read it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  It is just like as you …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MR CARRIM:  As well as without the heads of argument. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja.  Ja. 
MR CARRIM:  Just to – for future. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can speak to it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  So that …(intervenes). 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 124 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  As long as we know where to find it. 
MR CARRIM:  Ja.  Exactly.  It does not seem as if I am speaking 
generality. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
MR CARRIM:  So I will deal with the date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  It is the 12 t h of June – sorry, 2 n d of July 2013. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  This is the Special Finance Investment Procurement and 
Technology Committee Meeting. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair you will find that at page 38 of 
CC43. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well in the meantime I have been given Exhibit CC32 
which …(intervenes). 
MR CARRIM:  Oh Allah.  In that case it is page 95. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  95 in red. 
MR CARRIM:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM: 
 
So 
Chairperson 
this 
is 
the 
day 
before 
the 
MultiChoice/SABC Agreement is signed.  That happened on the 3 r d 
of July by Mr Motsoeneng.  Right.  So on page 2 of the minutes of the 
2 n d of July it is clear that there is no approval for STB Control.  On 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 125 of 169 
 
page 3 it is noticeable that Ms Lulama Mokhobo who is the GCEO is not 
there and it was agreed that the reference to clause 9 in the text of the 
discussion should be removed and it was decided that there were three 
conditions as I know it in these minutes that were set for 
Mr Motsoeneng to sign. 
The first was to seek senior legal opinion on whether the 
MultiChoice/SABC deal is legally tenable.  That was on the 2 n d of July.  
That was the first condition if I recall it.  The second condition as I 
recall it was that there should be Board – but there is no Board 
approval.  The second condition is that Mr Motsoeneng who is the 
10 
Acting CEO can go ahead and sign the agreement. 
However as Mr Harris pointed out to me – and I think he is 
right.  There is no possibility in corporate law for a sub-committee of a 
Board to change the delegations from a GCEO to an Acting – moreover 
Acting COO.  That he says, and it seems reasonable to me, can only be 
done by a Board.  So the second problem with the Committee deciding 
is that it cannot just willy-nilly change delegations. 
There is no power.  It can only have gone to a Committee.  
The third is that Mr Mavuso is constantly arguing against having clause 
9. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he is the Chairperson? 
MR CARRIM:  He is the Chair of that Committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  Ms Zandile Tshabalala came in late to that meeting – as I 
understand it.  Right, but Mr Mavuso makes it very clear at the end that 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 126 of 169 
 
any agreement with MultiChoice must be, to use his words, on SABC 
terms.  Now it is very clear Chairperson that no legal opinion was 
secured between this meeting on the morning of the 2 n d of July and the 
signing of the agreement on the 3 r d of July. 
Indeed Chairperson if you go to the 30 t h of July.  There is in 
fact a legal opinion offered.  So the legal opinion is offered, if my 
arithmetic serves me.  28 days after and you will see later Chairperson 
that Mr Krish Naidoo, a Human Rights lawyer who has got a struggle, 
he was serving on the Board. 
He did and he has given the Commission I think an affidavit 
10 
in that regard – an assessment of the legality of and concludes this 
ultra vires and null and void, but subsequent to that I gathered there 
was a further legal opinion secured by Ms Zandile Tshabalala which 
said it was legally tenable and I think it is then that an 8/6 majority 
decided to approve the deal as it were. 
The agreement with SAA – SABC/MultiChoice Agreement 
some 14 months later.  Now if you go Chairperson to the transcripts of 
the Board Meeting.  It is TGH, as I have it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM: 
 
July, 
the 
22 n d 
Chairperson. 
 
On 
page 
2.  
20 
Mr Sipho Masinga, the Head of Technology at the time, who was 
removed by all accounts, because he insisted on STB Control and 
Mr Motsoeneng it is alleged removed him because of that and that 
...(indistinct) partly played a role also in the removal of Ms Mokhobo, 
but she will speak for herself, but anyway the 22 n d of July.  Page 2. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 127 of 169 
 
Mr Sipho Masinga says very revealingly.  It is the SABC that 
put Control in the policy.  A Government policy of 2008 passed by 
Cabinet.  He says: 
“SABC put Control in the policy to defend its 
interest.  Set Top box is a principle.” 
To quote his words.  So you have got Ms Mokhobo saying that 
there is an argument by MultiChoice in particularly and those who 
sympathise with it.  That we do not need Set Top Boxes, because you 
see the future you are going to get what we call Integrated Digital 
Television.  Where Chairperson you and I have such a TV.  You may not 
10 
know it. 
Where you can actually do a whole lot of things that a 
computer can do, but the Department of Communications and the 
Ministry was clear that most people in this country can barely afford a 
TV.  Still less are they going to have the capacity to buy an Integrated 
Digital TV.  If you speak to Mr Kruger he will tell you that even with the 
IDTV, if I understand him correctly. 
You will still need a Set Top Box choice – a Set Top Box 
Control System and in fact elsewhere in the memorandum I asked him 
in preparation for this meeting.  Roy are they correct that you do not 
20 
need Set Top Boxes and he has given his explanation.  He said Set Top 
Boxes are even more important now than they were then and he 
explains why. 
He says encryption is involved in a whole lot of services.  
WhatsApp, telegram signal and so on and so on.  He himself is involved 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 128 of 169 
 
– presiding in Mozambique where his company has inserted now in a 
poor country like Mozambique …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he says they have done digital migration 
…(intervenes). 
MR CARRIM:  Exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Much quicker there? 
MR CARRIM:  Yes.  Yes.  Quite – and it has got control.  So in short he 
says in the end of his affidavit – his comment.  So much for 
MultiChoice’s view that Set Top Box Control is outdated.  Mr Bekker 
also said that as recently as December 2017. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  So that is Mr Kruger.  I am no expert.  It is for the 
Commission to decide. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  On the 30 t h of July you see very clearly in the minutes 
the different views on Set Top Box Control.  Now this sir is how many 
days?  It is 28 days beyond – 27 days beyond the signing and 28 days 
beyond a Committee which did not have the power to make the 
decisions it did. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
20 
MR CARRIM:  Then …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Carrim.  Without going 
through all the minutes. 
MR CARRIM:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The point that you are making is that 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 129 of 169 
 
those who signed the agreement had no authority and your case - in 
fact what you are placing before the Commission is that there was no - 
no Board approval for them to sign that agreement.  Is that correct? 
MR CARRIM:  Not that we can see from the minutes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  From the minutes.  Yes.  Thank you. Let 
us move …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can keep your mic on Mr Carrim. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  On – oh, sorry.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just keep it on. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you very much and you have given 
10 
us a list of those minutes that you say you have had a look at which do 
not show that they were the approval.  Now let us – you have spoken 
about the role of Mr Bekker.  Let us move on to your affidavit, because 
I know that you had said that you cannot – you have to leave today. 
Your flight is later today.  So we just have to try and move a 
bit quicker.  You have dealt with your interactions with Mr Bekker.  
Could you just tell the Chairperson what were your meetings about?  
You have had meetings with him and that – you start with that from 
paragraph 135 and that will be at page 43.  Could you just briefly tell 
the Chairperson where you met him?  Why did you meet with him? 
20 
MR CARRIM:  Yes Chairperson.  I will be very brief.  I think the 
advocate is getting rightly …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, no, no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
MR CARRIM:  I have indicated that because of budget tomorrow – it is 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 130 of 169 
 
Budget Day. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR CARRIM:  I cannot be here, but I am available next week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no we …(intervenes). 
MR CARRIM:  Alright.  So I will go …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually I can tell you that I have said to Ms Norman 
there is no reason we should take the whole day on your affidavit 
because although it’s quite extensive, 80 pages, I think that the things 
that I’m really interested in may be taking round about 40 pages or 
thereabout.  The others are important to you for purposes of how this 
10 
whole thing evolved but I have said we should be able to finish earlier 
than we have but there has been much to talk about, yes. 
MR CARRIM:   Yes, so paragraph 135, I simply say that Mr Patel asked 
me to meet Mr Bekker and I did around the September 2 n d or 3 r d in 
Cape Town.  Now Mr Bekker had obviously served on various 
Government panels including President Mbeki’s advisory panel and 
obviously his done considerably well and his company has, I mean, 
from a new alert of the apartheid era to the third largest media industry, 
I mean that’s remarkable and as South Africans we should be proud of 
that.  They play a very crucial role in the economy they are the biggest 
20 
player in the JSE and I deal with how good they did but at the same 
time it flowed from that that Mr Bekker seemed to feel that what’s good 
for Naspers is good for the country, even our dignitaries no person in 
my view.  When I deal later with regulatory capture I pick that up.   
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 131 of 169 
 
 
Then where the first meeting – what his primary preoccupation 
was to tell me that the Set Top Box policy in the Government is a big 
folly, it’s unnecessary, it’s outdated and he seemed to want to advise 
me on these matters and he was very dismissive of the facilitation 
process by the independent facilitators.  137, but I kept the door open 
to him because he’s a very important man in the broadcasting sector 
and the media section, we agreed we’d meet again and talk more about 
broadband, that never came to be.  Where the facilitation process 
reached an impasse various people, Cabinet Ministers, senior to me, 
people in the industry, the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee in 
10 
Parliament, all said, go and meet Mr Bekker, he will undo the 
...(indistinct) if anybody does it.  They said it’s not worthwhile pursuing 
it with Mr Indias Patel and Mr Nono Letele, that the real power that be 
is Mr Bekker so we arranged such a meeting and that occurred in March 
2014 …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      And that is on page? 
MR CARRIM:   Sorry it’s on page 44 paragraph 142, so that occurred in 
March 2014 here in Tshwane and Mr Patel was very keen that we have 
this meeting.  He said that Mr Koos Bekker will think out of the box and 
Mr Bekker respected a particular Minister, so the Minister was also 
20 
president. So originally Mr Bekker focused on how powerful Naspers is, 
how much they contribute to the tax revenue in this country, and they 
do and they’re treated very well all over the world but they see him in 
South Africa to have IC ...(indistinct) from their own country. 144, what 
happens is, at one stage I told him, Mr Bekker, you know, you have to 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 132 of 169 
 
allow for competition, it’s untenable 98% of paid TV is not 
transformation. 
 
So at one stage, to my surprise he said to me, give me two or 
three names of black people you think I should encourage to compete, 
to which I said, we can’t, you can’t choose your own competitors and 
nor can a Minister decide, it’s policies and regulations that will and I 
also pointed out to him, or I may have then or subsequently to others in 
MultiChoice and Naspers that they got the sole license, I think in 1988 
to launch M-Net and I read in an article, I don’t know if it’s true that 
they were also given some financial support, that may or may not be 
10 
true by the Government at the time but they were very close to the 
National Party, they had a heads-up start, they were far ahead of 
anybody else, I suggested to Mr Bekker than, that look, even if you are 
a competitor it’s going to take a very long time Mr Bekker for this 
competitor to really be a real competitor but he wouldn’t have it and at 
some stage the meeting got very frosty because he kept repeating – he 
stopped me making my presentation, why we went for control, which is 
set out in there and he was dismissive and he stopped me and he told 
me this is all nonsense and DTI doesn’t know what it is doing and so on 
and then he said that, Minister, something to this effect,  you speak the 
20 
language of eTV.  Now this came after a telephonic exchange with him, 
this is March 2014, in December 2013 when I found him to try to get 
him to come to a meeting with me to try to find some sort of 
compromise and to complain to him that people at MultiChoice and 
SABC are going about saying that I’m in the power of eTV which is 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 133 of 169 
 
exactly what he had said and that I’m corrupt and so on and I told him 
that’s outrageous. 
 
At some stage there’s an article by Mr Lloyd Gates in the Mail 
& Guardian where I told him, I asked Mr Bekker, as I remember it, look 
man what will I do, I’m so overpaid as a Minister what am I going to do 
with the money, how many novels am I going to buy.  His reply to me 
was very unsympathetic, he said, tell me Minister, moreover he seemed 
to know exactly what happens in SABC Board Meetings which are 
meant to be close meetings. He seemed to know very much what was 
happening and he was unsympathetic, so let’s go to 146 where Mr 
10 
Bekker, again, accused me of like – speaking the language of eTV.  So 
Chairperson I have many weaknesses, I’m human and I think it was in 
decorous but I swore him, the meeting got very heated, it was not 
correct to swear him, it’s not decorous but Chairperson it’s human.  I 
was fed up with him not repeating this thing and this is the currency out 
there amongst the people who didn’t want control. 
 
You know Chairperson I told him at one stage, I give a lot of 
my money away, I driver a 2001 Toyota Corolla in 2014, I drive 2005 
Scenic, what will I do with the money.  So Chairperson I’m sorry, my 
sensibilities are very trodden on, so I swore him which I regret but can 
20 
I move on the to – I asked him, can you give me information, evidence 
that I speak the language of eTV, secondly can you, in fact, show me 
which statements I’ve issued that are drafted by eTV, it’s not 
forthcoming even up to now, I asked Mr Lolo Letele to deliver that on 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 134 of 169 
 
the 14 t h of February 2018. I would like this Commission, if it’s possible 
to get the evidence, where’s the evidence, okay. 
 
Then the next thing in late 2014 – well I’ll drop that it’s not 
really necessary. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would it be correct to say, your interactions with Mr 
Bekker and basically with MultiChoice/Naspers personalities gave me 
the – gave you the impression, and that’s what I’m reading in your – 
that’s the impression I get from your affidavit, that they were – what 
they were about was to prevent effective competition from being 
10 
allowed. 
MR CARRIM:   Absolutely Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:    They were dominating the market and they were 
doing whatever they could to avoid competition happening? 
MR CARRIM:   Absolutely Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CARRIM:   As I’ve said, with Mr Bekker it seemed almost like a 
primitive defence of territory and turf, he was the one that first 
introduced paid TV with his colleagues, he was going to allow any up 
starter coming to his turf.  It wasn’t a defence of profits, I’ve said that 
20 
publically and it’s there in the text. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I’m just mentioning that because that might really 
cover your interactions with them but having said that there may be 
important things you want to highlight in regard to your entire 
interactions with them, then maybe you can highlight those.   
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 135 of 169 
 
MR CARRIM:   Yes, well that comes later and Ms Norman will guide us 
but I refer to, for example – well Chairperson you know, before you are 
a set of e-mails that we call the Namic e-mails strictly speaking it’s the 
Kitabo Vijay Panday wing of Namic.  Those e-mails have been in the 
public domain, they are quoted in the very article that I refer to in the 
Mail & Guardian, they are quoted in other articles, they’ve been 
circulating since 2015 Chairperson, up till today nobody from 
MultiChoice has challenged the veracity of those e-mails and you have 
the means, I can tell by the so-called Gupta e-mails to check on its 
veracity.  I want to say, before it’s misunderstood and in fairness to me 
10 
and the lawyer, Peter Harris, I was told by Mr Nidrey about five or six 
months after the Mail & Guardian article appeared that there are these 
e-mails he said, Yunus,  and he said  I can pass it on to you, I think he 
said, do you want to have a look at it.  So I said to Mr Nidrey what is 
there that I don’t already know, and he said to me, ja and we passed 
on.  I moved on, I was in finance and that’s a lot of work and I’ve got a 
thousand other things to do.   
 
So when I first prepared my affidavit I did alert Mr Harris that 
there are some of these issues like the Namic e-mails they’re there 
somewhere, I don’t have them and we didn’t pay much attention to it 
20 
but 10 days ago or so before the Commission, we met with the 
Commission and we tabled it and said, do you want these e-mails, they 
said yes, so Mr Nidrey made it available.  Personally I only saw it for 
the first time on Friday, last week when I got the bundle from Teresa 
Geldenhuys, I read it. I was taken aback as to how much those e-mails, 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 136 of 169 
 
if they are valid, and up to now they’ve never been challenged by 
Namic or indeed by Mr Koos Bekker and MultiChoice and Naspers, if 
they are valid, Chairperson you can even throw my affidavit away quite 
frankly just look at those e-mails, it’s astonishing the collusion between 
MultiChoice, Mr Bekker’s mentioned twice and so, the collusion 
between MultiChoice, the Kitabo Vejay Pandey wing of Namic, what we 
call the MultiChoice wing of Namic as against the Adile Chabaleng, 
Professor Khunene wing.  I don’t think you need my affidavit really, so 
Mr Koos Bekker and his Team come out there very clearly.  I hope at 
some stage the Commission will find itself – because that is more 
10 
powerful than anything I’ve said. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you, Chair I may just mention that 
those have been submitted to the Commission but they are being 
authenticated before they can be led as evidence before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Thank you Chair.  That then takes care 
actually Mr Carrim of what you deal with in the Namic issues that will 
be from paragraph’s 226 to 242 but what is left, really is – you’ve 
covered everything about MultiChoice and its dominance in the industry 
20 
and the influence that you say it had on the policy itself which is key to 
the work of the Commission.  The last issue, really, is what you deal 
with, which is really these other matters are really personal matters 
between you and MultiChoice and as we have discussed in consultation 
that I don’t think that they should dominate your evidence and – before 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 137 of 169 
 
the Commission.  Lastly then, in conclusion you make reference – 
you’ve made reference to what Mr Roy Kruger said about the STB 
boxes and their relevance and then in conclusion you make the case 
about regulatory capture and at paragraph 278 you make certain 
conclusions about who benefitted from the entire policy as you deal 
with it. If you may take it, page 79 of your affidavit, paragraph 278.  
Could you just testify to what you say there? 
MR CARRIM:   The specific paragraph is, I’m on page 79 paragraph 
madam? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      I beg your pardon, sorry, linked to that 
10 
what I was just saying now could you just start from page – go to 
paragraph 187 at page 57 it will be linked to that conclusion that you 
make at 278. 
MR CARRIM:   What precisely do you want me to deal with? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, 187.    
MR CARRIM:   Ah yes, okay so perhaps I can offer my own opinion it 
wasn’t a personal conflict between MultiChoice and me, I was only in 
that situation because I was a Minister, I don’t know these people, I’d 
never met Mr Koos Bekker before I read it through, I met him just 
fleetingly once on a plane, I don’t know him.  So it was political and I 
20 
was representing the ANC I insist and the Government and so – but 
what I mean by personal is to target me specifically and to demean me.  
There is the whole campaign there was a war room that was set up, 
...(indistinct) was actually leading this war room and so, they had a 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 138 of 169 
 
Special Task Team, media, to focus on me what could be fine, I’ve 
made many mistakes, but certainly, I’m not corrupt …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Am I reading your affidavit correctly, namely that the 
only reason they attacked you personally in this way, as far as you are 
concerned is because they didn’t like the policy position that you were 
pursuing as Minister, is that correct? 
MR CARRIM:   Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja they – it was not because of anything arising 
between your personal interactions with them it was arising out of your 
performing your job as you understood it. 
10 
MR CARRIM:   Yes exactly in fact, if I recall correctly, when Mr Koos 
Bekker met me in September 2013, in Cape Town, he said, you know we 
checked you out Minister, as they would do, and we spoke to many 
people and I know certainly one of the people is awkward because he 
told me about it and he said all of them said you are a very honest guy.  
Now from that to being accused of – in that advert of March 2014, 
serving eTV’s interest but beyond that the scurrilous campaign against 
me which hurts.  There’s nothing wrong with being hurt when you’re 
accused of corruption and there’s no case for it, it’s outrageous from 
people, you’ll see from the e-mails, do things that you as a Judge will 
20 
probably decide on, border on complete irregularity.  There are also tax 
issues that arise there, I Chaired the Finance Committee for the last 
five years and then COP, I don’t know for a fact, you will get lawyer’s 
and expert opinions but there are questions about tax issues that 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 139 of 169 
 
Namic and MultiChoice might have to answer for, but that’s for you to 
decide Mr Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Thank you. 
MR CARRIM:   So you want me to read …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  187 yes. 
MR CARRIM:   Ja you see, there’s something very bizarre actually 
almost ...(indistinct) Chairperson, so when I become Minister, Mr 
Motsoeneng – look I had to reach out to Mr Motsoeneng because the 
public view was that he’s very influential on the SABC but he’s also 
very politically connected.  Everybody – well people in the media saw it 
10 
that way and I know I’ve got a point, people said, look manage him.  So 
I did reach out to him, Ms Norman at times, and said I want to talk to 
him because I knew getting STB control going would require his support 
and the Chairperson, Sandile Shabalala, so I asked to see him but he 
also, was constantly reaching out to me.  Now it was quietly odd 
because he seemed to see himself almost like an interlocutor between 
the President and me …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Between? 
MR CARRIM:   Between the President and me, perhaps I should just 
read the text. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes read it.   
MR CARRIM:   Swiftly, so 187, Ms Norman, 
 
“It also became clear shortly after I became Minister of 
 
Communication that Mr Motsoeneng saw himself as some sort 
 
of interlocutor between the President and me and as the 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 140 of 169 
 
 
debate over the STB control matter escalated, he told me on 
 
several occasions that Wababa, meaning the President, would 
 
not or did not agree that there should be STB control.  Mr 
 
Shabalala also asked me several times if the President 
 
agreed with me, implying that he did not.  I pointed out to 
 
them that the President presided over the ANC and the 
 
country when the December 2012 ANC conference took the 
 
relevant decisions and competition and the paid TV Sector, 
 
the ANC NEC Communications Committee had expressed its 
 
support for STB control, the Cabinet took the decision on the 
10 
 
4 t h of December 2013 and also that I had briefed him on the 
 
policy before taking it to the Cabinet Committee.  I made it 
 
very clear to Mr Motsoeneng that when I was appointed a 
 
Minister, I was not told by President Zuma that I had to 
 
answer to Mr Motsoeneng, I remain, Chairperson, astonished 
 
at Mr Motsoeneng’s sense of proprietary”. 
 
I then go on to say that basically I briefed the President from 
what I could tell in a 40-minute exchange that’s before I took it to 
Cabinet, he agreed with what I was saying, he didn’t disagree with it.  
So subsequently they went around saying I misled the President.  So I 
20 
want to deal with it at present, because that’s dishonest and 
outrageous.  I mean, I’m a Minister appointed by him, so I would like to 
put it on record.   
“I had briefed the President, paragraph 190, at some 
length on the BDM Policy, that’s the Broadcast Digital 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 141 of 169 
 
Migration that was adopted on 4 t h December 2013 before 
it was taken to a Cabinet Committee.  He agreed with the 
approach set out, it is possible that he may have 
misunderstood me Chairperson but Mr Motsoeneng and 
Ms Shabalala went about saying that I had misled the 
President. It would make no sense for me to do this, that 
would be no benefit to me at all”. 
Also in my engagement with senior Ministers and other ANC 
leaders there was unanimous support for the policy, so why would I 
need to mislead the President.  They also said that eTV drafted the 
10 
policy.  President I use the information – Chairperson, from the 
Facilitation Committee.  I read it very widely, I had this excellent Team 
of advisors, privileged to have them.   One morning, it just popped into 
my head – I got up in the morning, you know we percolate, now I’m 
conscious and suddenly one morning in Tshwane, I remember I got up 
and suddenly thought, you know what, let’s settle it like this and I’ve 
already explained the policy to you, a compromise.   Those who want 
control can have it but they’ve got to pay, those who want control can 
now have it and the Manufacturing Sector defended and the other 
objected.  So I literally drafted the Cabinet memo, Ms Rosie Sekese 
20 
helped with notes, so did Mr Kruger and other, the Team I mentioned, 
Wanda and Mr Nidrey and so on but I drafted it, it’s actually written by 
me.  So its nonsensical that eTV did it and if they said so, obviously I 
say later the it’s just a lie but I don’t know whether they said it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      Thank you, could I just take you back 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 142 of 169 
 
again, just one paragraph it is very important which you omitted at page 
42 paragraph 131. 
MR CARRIM:   Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      Where you deal with Gupta leaks, how 
MultiChoice paid the Gupta’s millions, can you just deal with that 
paragraph please? 
MR CARRIM:   Yes, obviously I don’t have these e-mails, you seem to 
do but in any case I say, in a News24 media article, dated 24 t h 
November 2017, titled: 
“Gupta leaks, how MultiChoice pay the Gupta’s millions, 
10 
Ms Mac, that’s Clarissa Mac, the person dealing on 
behalf of MultiChoice on Regulatory and Government 
matters, I think she’s since resigned is alleged to have 
drafted a crucial Government document on the relocation 
of broadcasting policy powers to the newly created 
separate Ministry and Department of Communication.  As 
stated above Ms Mac and Mr Patel were the lead 
negotiators 
for 
MultiChoice 
in 
the 
STB 
control 
negotiations.  The media attached article is attached as 
Annexure 11 and it states the following, and I quote, 
20 
MultiChoice Executor, Clarissa Mac of course has since 
resigned it says here, sent policy documents directly to 
Muthambi, that’s the Minister who shared them with 
Gupta Lieutenant Ashu Chawla”. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 143 of 169 
 
 
I think he’s the person mentioned in the earlier e-mails when 
Mr Motsoeneng’s PA was here, 
“Setting out proposals for Zuma to transfer broadcasting 
powers to Muthambi after he split the Communications 
Portfolio Committee into two Departments in 2014”. 
Chairperson there’s something else that I need to draw to your 
attention, all over the world the International Telecommunications says 
you should converge.  Our ICT green paper adopted, in December 2013 
also called for convergence, basically this means that whereas 
previously there was a separate post office, a separate television and 
10 
so on and so on, now your very simple cell phone you can watch video 
on demand, you can actually see movies.  You can watch TV, you can 
watch the news, you can actually send messages that you otherwise 
would have sent to the post office via e-mails and so on, so it’s 
convergence it’s our entire green paper.  We visited all nine provinces, 
we had a major National consultative conference, it called for 
convergence.  It was very surprising, against the global trade and 
against the ICT green paper where the Departments became split into 
two ministries and two Departments.  So it’s about transferring powers 
and there was a tussle as you know, in the public domain, Minister 
20 
Cwele and Minister Muthambi about where the Broadcast Digital 
Migration belongs, must it belong to Minister Muthambi or the Minister 
of Telecommunications Postal.  So that’s the reference here, it’s 
astonishing that somebody outside with a vested material and profit 
interest could actually draft or contribute in this way to drafting a 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 144 of 169 
 
Cabinet memo on the division of powers which resides in the 
Presidency moreover.  If as Ms Mac has said elsewhere or MultiChoice 
says, she was merely making a submission, then presumably other 
people should also be entitled to make a submission or in this sector 
because they’re a private sector company.  Here again is an example of 
regulatory capture, the entire affidavit, if you like, one of its main sub 
things is precisely your concern about State Capture a specific form of 
regulatory capture and if you look at those e-mails, which I hope you 
will get to do at the Commission sometime, you will see very 
evocatively and very starkly there. 
10 
 
May I also say that I have no personal objection, and who 
cares what I think in a powerful ANC Government where I’m a marginal 
player, to lobby.  Chairperson, lobbying by business is exactly correct 
in a democracy.  If the Trade Unions can lobby and the NGO’s can 
lobby Government so must in fact, business, that’s perfect normal, it’s 
endemic in a democracy.  The question, however, is, where do the 
boundaries begin and end.  We are a civilised, non-racial, social 
democracy, we must be bound by the norms of the constitution.  
Nowhere, Chairperson in law or in the constitution does it say that 
MultiChoice could have done what it actually did and those e-mails will 
20 
be the most stark illustration of how irregular and how unfortunate it 
would seem their behaviour was. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      Thank you, and you make the statement 
in paragraph 133, the next page. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 145 of 169 
 
MR CARRIM:   “The influence of MultiChoice in drafting a policy 
for Government which is thereafter transmitted to the 
Gupta’s is irregular, that’s putting it mildly.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      Thank you and then – now I think we 
can go back to where we were at paragraph – the last paragraph 278 of 
your statement we have covered the main areas. 
MR CARRIM:   Yes do you want me to summarise that …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:      Yes please. 
MR CARRIM:   278, Chairperson on page 79 reads: 
“It is only Naspers and MultiChoice that have benefitted 
10 
from this change in policy by Minister Muthambi even 
though they are increasingly challenged by streaming 
services they still retain their strangle and domination of 
paid TV at huge costs to the economy and the country, 
especially the poor and disadvantaged.  Previously as 
stated earlier they did this to get close links to the 
apartheid Government, now they do so through the 
frailties of those of us elected to Government and the 
inertia of our democratic State but moreover 279 
concludes 
by 
saying, 
but 
we 
cannot 
allow 
this 
20 
Chairperson we waste a titanic struggle over decades at 
a huge cost against apartheid and we finally triumphed 
over it through an unprecedented negotiated transfer of 
power.  Of course the legacy of apartheid persists there 
are many problems that we have inflicted in ourselves 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 146 of 169 
 
and the transition still has a long way to go but we can 
and must, over time, triumph over our current challenges 
as one of many aspects of this transition we need to 
accelerate the digital migration process as part of 
transforming our country in the interest of all the people, 
particularly the poor and disadvantaged and we need to 
do this soon, otherwise the fourth industrial revolution 
will leave us far behind, to the detriment of all our 
people, not just the poor and disadvantaged”. 
Chairperson if we complete the digital migration process what is 
10 
revealed in the first thirty pages, you get a digital dividend, which 
means, Chairperson, to put it crudely if I’m a Politician.  You see, let 
me put it like this, as simple as it can be, of course the technocrats – 
you see if you take SABC1 it uses let’s say one radio frequency 
spectrum to crudify it right on an analogue, which is the current 
system, once you move to Digital, Mr Kruger and others will tell you, 
one radio frequency spectrum can give you between six, I think, and 15 
television services.   
So the amount of radio frequency spectrum, which is a scarce 
source that is used up with the current – atavistic or what can you say, 
20 
backward, outdated analogue television system you release so much a 
spectrum that you can produce more channels in different languages if 
you had the resources to do so, you’ll encourage more competition, 
paid TV will get cheaper, more people will have access to it but 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 147 of 169 
 
secondly, very importantly Chairperson, this is not, as I tried to suggest 
to you only about broadcasting.   
 
You’re going to release radio frequency spectrum for all the 
service providers in the mobile sector, so Vodacom, Cell-C, MTN, Telkom 
Mobile, that will be easy, when we as Government, as ANC attack the 
high cost of data, of course we are right to do that, because we are in a 
knowledge economy, information society.  If you want to reach the rural 
pore, if you want them to enter the market, the economy with little 
projects and little self-help employment schemes, and little SMME’s, you 
need data pervasive be available.  The cost is prohibited.   
10 
 
 
So, you have got also a very vital source of revenue, you can 
ask National Treasury, it is worth billions of Rands, releasing the 
spectrum which is now under agenda Chairperson with the new Minister, 
but obviously the crucial part of the spectrum if I understand this 
correctly, an expert will help you more in this regard, can only be offered 
when the digital migration process is complete.  So where are we 
Chairperson?  Collectively, that is why I apologised to my colleagues, my 
officials in the Department and experts who help me as a politician.   
 
 
Politicians, we have thick skins, otherwise you cannot be a 
politician, but officials, they should serve the public out there.  They must 
20 
be neutral and implement policies that the Ministers in Cabinet and the 
majority party in consultation, minority parties decide, so what I am 
saying in short is my understanding is and I could be wrong, the Set Top 
Boxes that were released after the last tender after I left, are dormant.  
Apparently they are lying, I do not know, in various warehouses, I do not 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 148 of 169 
 
know where it is, but the digital migration process regrettably, but I have 
confidence in this new Minister for what it is worth.  I think she is going 
to get in going, and the President and Government.  They have been 
raising this spectrum issue, but we have been held back ultimately by 
MultiChoice and Naspers in particular.  Secondly, I want to make 
something clear, it is not as if those who identified with MultiChoice and 
Naspers in particular, did so and were used by Naspers and MultiChoice.   
 
 
No – no they also had their own personal business and other 
material interests.  People in ACSTAR, I mean community TV.  What has 
community TV got to do with each of digital migration.  They were high-
10 
bound to Naspers and MultiChoice, who threatened them, threatened 
them that if , I am told, if you support encryption we will dispose of you in 
the MultiChoice bouquet, DSTV bouquet, but some of them reached out to 
the advisors and myself and said look mister, we do not have a view of 
this thing.  It does not affect us.  If you can fund us, as the Ministry, one 
of them approached me, we will support in encryption.   
 
 
And I say no, then I am buying you my friend.  No that is 
equally wrong as MultiChoice’s behaviour.  You have in this affidavit, can 
I just read what Mr Yunis Sheik sent me?  Look at the billing by 
MultiChoice …(intervenes).

CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, that is right, ja.

another example of regulatory capture …(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you referred to it earlier, let us go through it so you 
can read it, ja …(intervenes).  
MR CARRIM:   These are Mr Yunis Sheik’s words, it is an e-mail sent to 
me.  Now maybe Ms Norman you can help me. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes.  I am just …(intervenes).  
MR CARRIM:   I will look for it quickly in my own notes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Chair, it is on page 41 …(intervenes).  
MR CARRIM:   Page 41, yes? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   It is referred to as Annexure 8.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Annexure 8? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Annexure 8 …(intervenes).

CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 150 of 169 
 
MR CARRIM:   Right.  It is on page 41 of my text.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CARRIM:   I say, 
“In addition just as the facilitation process was 
beginning, Mr Yunis Sheik, an eTV Executive Director 
wrote on the 5 t h of September 2013 to inform me that 
Naspers/MultiChoice threatened to punish eTV if they 
argued in favour of SDB Control in the facilitation 
process.” 
 
A copy of Mr Sheik’s e-mail is attached hereto as Annexure 8, 
10 
and it stated the following, then I literally quote the e-mail which you 
have as an annexure, I will read it to you, this is Mr Yunis Sheik’s words 
addressed to me:   
“We draw to your attention the following, one: we 
have been advised this day, that will be the 5 
September 2013 by DSTV that if we should express 
support for the BDM Policy and Set-Up Box control 
during the course of the facilitation process, they will 
cancel the contract with eTV to host the ENCA News 
Channel on the DSTV platform.  In addition, we have 
20 
been handed a script,” 
 
Now Chairperson, handed a script by DSTV, 
“Which we were called upon to articulate.” 
 
Notice, in parrot fashion:   
“To the facilitators you have appointed.” 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 151 of 169 
 
 
Point 2,  
“In addition, we have been informed by Hlaudi of 
SABC, that they intend to oppose the BDM Policy and 
Set Top Box Control.  We understand they too may 
well have been issued with a similar script and I have 
elected 
to 
succumb, 
least 
they 
suffer 
similar 
consequences with regard to their new 24 hours news 
channel.  The declaration of eTV, DSTV issued by no 
less” 
 
Notice Chairperson, 
10 
“Issued by no less than its CEO Mr Koos Bekker, to 
our CEO Marcel Golding is at once designed to place 
us under duress and undermine the BDM Policy and 
the facilitation process.  In our view the facilitation 
process has been violated and the participants 
placed under considerable duress to oppose the BDM 
Policy and Set Top Box Control.  For this reason, we 
are of the view, subject to your advice, that we 
should 
bedroll 
from 
the 
facilitation 
process 
altogether, as the process is conducted under the 
20 
ages of the Ministry, we should want to hear from you 
before we make a final determination of the matter.”  
 
In subsequent paragraphs Chairperson, summarized, I handed 
over to Mr Nidri …(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 152 of 169 
 
MR CARRIM:   He then took it to Mr Harris and the facilitation Team, they 
met with both sides and they brought – they brought eTV back in.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CARRIM:   Let me also read the paragraph preceding that is linked to 
it, where it shows again regulatory capture.  Paragraph 126 read:   
“It has been alleged that Naspers MultiChoice 
assisted Keith Thabo, the former President of Namec, 
to draft an opinion piece, in his name.  An article in 
the Mail and Guardian dated 29 May 2015.” 
 
Annexure 5 states the following:  
10 
“AmaBhugane has also learned that at about the 
same time, MultiChoice’s management was involved 
in producing an opinion piece published in April last 
year that attacked Carrim.  The article was published 
under the by-line of Keith Thabo, the then President 
of Namec.  It is an important lobby group for mainly 
Blacks more, medium and micro-enterprises in the 
electronic manufacturing sector.  AmaBhugane has 
seen the mail, e-mail correspondence from April 21 
last year, it is presumably 2014 between Calvo 
20 
Mawela, the head of, excuse me, of stakeholder and 
regulatory affairs for MultiChoice South Africa, and 
Thabo, referring to Mawela’s role in penning an 
opinion piece published on the technology website 
TechCentral on the same day.” 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 153 of 169 
 
 
In the e-mail writes Mawela:   
“Herewith the final article as requested,” 
 
He then provides Thabo with the e-mail address of TechCentral 
Editor, Duncan McLeod saying:   
“I think, try to get him try to get it to him as soon as 
possible” 
 
The article entitled: 
“Minister you are misleading the public accuses 
Carrim of rewriting history and distorting facts.  
MultiChoice describe the allegation that it was 
10 
involved in authoring opinion pieces from Namec 
Consulting.  Through its office bearers”  
 
On the next page 41 Namec asked Mr Mavela’s input.  This is a 
quote sorry from Jackie Raktila who is a MultiChoice ...(indistinct) she 
claims: 
“Through its office bearers Namec approached Mr 
Mavela to provide an input as a broadcasting 
engineer and he shared his thought based on his 
expert knowledge of the broadcast significance.” 
 
This is in the public domain, it is from those e-mails that you 
20 
have, but let me put something to you Chairperson that is obvious.  Mr 
Kythivo does not even know the e-mail address of Duncan McLeod.  He 
has given it by Mr Mavela moreover Mr Mavela says try to get it to him as 
soon as possible is just merely an editing.  Secondly the e-mails reveal 
there was far, far more than just this role that Mr Mavela played.  I was 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 154 of 169 
 
surprised when I saw the e-mails on Friday night at the extent to which 
there was collusion.  Acts South Africa is mentioned there, Mr McKenzie 
is mentioned there and so on and so on.  I will not say more because you 
are still authenticating. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Ja, that is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you, lastly you have mentioned Mr 
Mavela and you did mention that you got an apology from MultiChoice at 
some stage.  Could you go to page 200 I beg your pardon Chair, page 71 
paragraph 253 your counsel has asked that I ask you to deal with that 
paragraph.  Thank you. 
10 
MR CARRIM:   Yes – let me tell you the context quickly Chairperson.  So, 
the business there contacts me one day out of the blue they say the 6t h of 
June as we know it 2013 e-mails have been released in the public.  I think 
it emerged from Mr Vincent’s Smiths Portfolio Committee on the SABC 
matters and she asked me whether I am aware that MultiChoice made it to 
quote and these are Mr Patel’s words “a deal breaker” this whole issue of 
control and we know that they raised a campaign against you and so on.  
So I explained to her it is not the norm for a Minister to comment, is there 
anything in the minutes that attacks my integrity because in that case 
there is nothing in government norms and policies and rules or in the ANC 
20 
rules to say you must sacrifice your personal rules and political integrity 
for the sake of what, what there is no such thing in the NDR National 
Democratic Republic.  I do not know of any such norm.  I said if there is 
an attack on my integrity, I will respond but otherwise contact the Minister 
and the Chairperson of the Committee.  The journalist came back to me 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 155 of 169 
 
and said, I think she spoke to a news editor, we said no we cannot ask 
them because they were no there at the time I said neither was I but so 
reference to a policy that relates to my period and what she presumed to 
be the reason partly for my not being reappointed.  Now I responded to 
her Chairperson, and not realising it is such a big story because I was 
busy with my work and she was irritating me, with due respect, but you 
know I am a journalist.  I mean I cannot be dismissive, she meant well so 
there it is.  Next day it is page 1 of business day and the next thing I find 
it is gone viral because you see MultiChoice is a world body and people 
phoned me from Reuters and I do not know what and so on.  I went to 
10 
eTV again because I had three requests for interviews at the same time. 
eTV and ENCA as they call ANN7 as it was then and SABC and the person 
that offered me a lift from where I was to ENCA so I got into the car and 
went so it blew up.  Subsequently what happened was I met Mr Nono 
Letele because they were doing this inquiry into ANN7.  He is the 
Chairperson of MultiChoice I think he still is.  So I met him and we had a 
discussion at the O.R Tambo Airport and he asked me basically, he said 
look over the phone and subsequently I cannot remember what was said 
over the phone and what was said personally to me, he said look Mr 
Carrim I do not believe you are corrupt.  I do not accept that you did 
20 
anything wrong.  You can call him here, I do not know what he will say, 
but that is what he said to me Chairperson and I said – he asked me what 
do you want this was more or less it from us.  After my statement to the 
business day and the thing blew up.  I said I want you to apologise to me 
I do not care as I said in my letter to him subsequently.  Who cares 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 156 of 169 
 
Chairperson in this day and age whether you are a Minister or a Deputy 
Minister who cares?  In the time that I was there Ms Norman there were 
four Ministers can we even remember them? Does anyone remember 
maybe now if they watching they will remember that I was a Minister for a 
brief period, who cares?  What I do not want Mr Letele and I told him in 
my letter so it is there.  I do not want my grandchildren Googling one day 
in this IT age that their grandfather who presented himself as a socialist 
and as progressive who gave money away that is actually taking a bribe 
from eTV I cannot take that, I do not care whether I am the Minister or 
not all I have got at the end of the day is my integrity.  So I want you to 
10 
apologise, I want MultiChoice to apologise and you know what I want you 
to put an advert in all those six whatever newspapers you did same size 
and retain your view that actually control was ridiculous, expensive and 
so on but do not give me this line that you representing the pole.  You 
cannot you are a big monolith you are making super profits you cannot 
tell me you represent the pole even less can you say you represent your 
consumers who you charge so much, okay?  
 
So he was very considerately he came across as very civil and to 
be quite fair you know in all the time I exchanged with him, the few 
exchanges I had unlike the others I had he is very civil.  He is a very 
20 
gentlemanly type so he then said well I see you work in finance and I do 
not think you are corrupt I did not understand how far he would take it.  
So, he went to a Board Meeting, I am told by others, and he presented a 
case.  He says look this chap is very upset only about one thing as I 
understand it from somebody else, who gave me a fleeting account of it 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 157 of 169 
 
he said he wants an apology.  So, Mr Calvo Mavela did apologise but 
Chairperson you will see the annexure and the end of a long explanation 
on a controversial ANN7 deal with MultiChoice that was the focus.  He 
then said something like, in so far as our March 2014 advert suggested or 
reflected on a Ministers integrity.  In so far as something we apologise, 
okay? And so, I will read to you while I actually say and then I am done 
with this side unless you have more questions.  So, it reads 
…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let us just read that part 
MR CARRIM:   So, you refer me to (Intervenes).  
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Paragraph 253? 
MR CARRIM:   Ja, in addition to the above on the 31 s t of January during a 
MultiChoice press conference Mr Mavela the then Chief Executive – The 
Chief Executive now of MultiChoice apologized to me regarding the open 
letter referred to above.  That is the advert Chairperson.  The statement 
of Mr Mavela is attached here to Annexure 20 and he said: 
“I would like to take this opportunity to confirm that 
the open letter which MultiChoice published in the 
Media on 16 March 2014 regarding digital migration, 
was in no way intended to cast aspersions on the 
20 
integrity of the former Minister of Communications.” 
 
Now here Chairperson, to tease the Commission a bit, my name 
is spelt wrong, Yunis with I, and Carrim with an E and may I say 
Chairperson if you care to read the annexure replying to Mr Andre Du 
Plessis there, he says, ja, you see Carrim and, what is this guy? Yunis 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 158 of 169 
 
Sheik.  They were buddies in a Natal Indian Congress and so on, so I 
replied to all of that.  You may have seen it.  One of the teasing 
comments I make, sarcastic comments, anyway he is Y-u-n-i-s and I am Y-
u-n-u-s.  That is another thing that does not bind us.  We were part of a 
broader movement; I do not know him particularly.  He is a nice guy from 
what I know, but I am not a buddy of his.  Okay, so I subsequently 
addressed a letter to Mr Letele dated 14 February 2018 wherein I raised 
my dissatisfaction Chairperson, and I still hold this regarding the apology 
on the 31 s t of January 2018 by Mr Mawela …(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   And basically, you were saying that the apology was in 
10 
adequate …(intervenes).  
MR CARRIM:   Not acceptable, yes that is right. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And 
was 
not 
published 
in 
the 
right 
forum 
…(intervenes).  
MR CARRIM:   Ja, Mr Koos Bekker did not apologize.  It was not put on 
their website, somebody told me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CARRIM:   Nobody even reported in the press and the Media to clarify 
this.  I mean some student might be doing a thesis 20 years from now.  
They will Google that Carrim was in the power of eTV.  Mr Bekker has 
20 
never apologised.  And then I explained what I just said in 256 that you 
know what, all I have is my integrity, and that matters to me.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no that is fine. 
MR CARRIM:   And it should to all of us.  I do not care about positions 
and therefore he must apologise.  I still got that view that he must 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 159 of 169 
 
apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no that is fine, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Mr Carrim, thank you that is the 
evidence.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, the, there may be two or so questions Mr Carrim 
that I want to ask you before I release you.  One of the things that has 
amazed me about the digital migration is the delay that has happened 
because the Policy was – in 2008 originally if I recall correctly, but we 
are in 2020, and the last time I checked, not much had happened, and I 
would have thought that one, the President at the time would have been 
10 
saying to Ministers in this portfolio at different times including yourself 
when you were Minister.  What is going on?  What is holding things up?  
It is taking long to get things done and wanting to be informed.  What is 
the problem?  Did that happen during your term as Minister of 
Communications? 
MR CARRIM:   Well to be fair to then President Zuma, I had many 
meetings with him partly by his prompting.  Never once did he say to me 
that he does not support Set Top Box Control firstly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CARRIM:   Secondly, he realized, you know Chairperson I should say 
20 
this.  There is a very dismissive attitude in the public domain about the 
President.  There are claims that he does not read documents and so on.  
Well President, it is a bunch of lies about Mr Motsoeneng as well.  You 
know, the President of the country at the time may not have a degree, he 
may not have even Class 2 education, but I think people underestimate 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 160 of 169 
 
his intellectual and political capacity.  They underestimate his firm 
understanding of the issues.  In my exchanges with him, I had a strong 
sense he knew exactly what the issues were.  It is possible that 
somebody was briefing him but whatever it is, as a politician to a 
politician he was …(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, he understood the issues. 
MR CARRIM:   He was remarkably aware of the value of SDB Controlled 
broadband and he constantly encouraged me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MR CARRIM:   In fact I met people who told me what positive things he 
10 
said about me, but what I want to say is that there were other powerful 
people who were also saying I am going too fast, overtly.  Now my view of 
the current President and the Cabinet and Government and a particular 
Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, is they are very committed to move.  
The point is that we have this baggage that we have to carry, and I think 
that Naspers/MultiChoice that is responsible for this and those who 
identified with them for their own needs and were also trying to use 
MultiChoice and Naspers as much as MultiChoice and Naspers were 
trying to use them.  I also think Chairperson, you rightly raised long-term 
issues, there needs to be a proper code of conduct as I say.  In my view, I 
20 
cannot prescribe to the Commission for business lobbying of politicians 
and politicians availability to business, so on the side of Parliament we 
need to tighten some of these provisions, on the side of business we 
need to do that, because by any measure, the lobbying by MultiChoice 
was very primitive, very backward, it is not consistent with the social 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 161 of 169 
 
democracy we are.  And it has caused a huge step back to the digital 
migration.  It suits them because they can retain their monopoly and so 
on.  So Chairperson I would say that the current Government, the ANC 
today which retains its view on Set Top Box Control, I think they are on 
the right course and as an MP I will play whatever role I can to get them 
out of this phase, but they are on the right course, but they have to move 
faster in all our interests.   
CHAIRPERSON:   You may or not be able to deal with this but I ask 
anyway.  At a certain stage and I think it was after your term as Minister.  
The policy that was pursued by the Minister of Communications, Ms 
10 
Muthambi, I seem to have got the impression that it was not consistent 
with the ANC policy on digital migration and it may not have been 
consistent with Government police as it was when you were Minister of 
Communications.  One or two of these might not be correct, but you can 
comment to the best of your recollection or understanding. 
MR CARRIM:   Firstly Chairperson it is not for me to comment on a 
Minister’s role after I have now been reappointed, that is not really – that 
is not my thing, but all I can tell you is what is in the public domain.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR CARRIM:   You suggested it seems like the policy that the Minister 
20 
adopted was not consistent with the ANC policy and previous Government 
policy.  Well firstly, in my affidavit you will see that as recently as about 
18 months ago Mr Jackson Mthembu, the then Chairperson of the NEC 
Sub-Committee and Communications repeated that SDB Control remains 
Government policy, long after Ms Muthambi.  There are many other Media 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 162 of 169 
 
articles if the research Team Google’s, will find as to my knowledge Ms 
Lindiwe Zulu in the last fleeting exchange I had with her, had also – she 
was the Chairperson prior to Mr Mthembu becoming the Chair, also 
expressed her concern to me privately that, you know that was not 
consistent Government policy, but she did not take it more, it was a 
fleeting exchange in the House, but I should also say as far as I 
understand it Chairperson and I consulted with some people, the Court 
right up till the Constitutional Court you were served never pronounced on 
the legality or otherwise of Set Top Box Control. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no it did not. 
10 
MR CARRIM:   They simply said does the Minister have the power? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR CARRIM:   It is only today Chairperson, listening to you, obviously 
because you were there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CARRIM:   I discover it was such a mad narrow majority. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CARRIM:   Now there is something Chairperson that people out there 
I think should think about.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR CARRIM:   Which is we were never going to give eTV as subsidy.  
There was no such thing.  It is like then saying the Government is giving 
a 7 billion Rand subsidy to the car industry, or all the tax incentives we 
give to business, it is powerful the course in developed democracies and 
here.  Their intention was to actually squeeze eTV.  They were cooing 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 163 of 169 
 
that they got their way and Mr Bekker and MultiChoice and Naspers were 
furious as if Mr Bekker’s moods or MultiChoice’s moods must determine 
Government policy but it was never the intention even now people ask 
me, why did you want to give eTV a subsidy?  There is no such thing.  It 
is an absurd surrealistic claim.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR CARRIM:   And I subsequently met eTV after the facilitation process 
ended and it is recorded in the minutes Ms Norman, I met each of them 
individual, as a politician now to strike a political deal since the objective 
facilitation process.  I met Mr Sheik and Mr Golding and I said to them I 
10 
do not know why you guys are claiming a victory.  This is not about you.  
You are fat cats too of a smaller nature.  It is about the new emerging 
African entrepreneurs.  Five of whom were about to be issued licences in 
ICASA.  Chairperson I have explained to Mr Bekker, I cannot take the 
budget and used it as my personal money box and give it to, because I 
happened to bump, Mr Sheik was a comrade in the 80’s, why must I 
apologize?  He worked very hard.  He was part of the liberation movement 
as you know so well.  Now, I mean I hardly had anything to do with him, 
he is in, I am in Msunduzi, Pietermaritzburg.  He is in eThekwini, Durban.  
We served in the same structure like 600 the other activists in that 
20 
structure.  I have never met him since 1994 except fleetingly once at the 
airport. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CARRIM:   And firstly, it was very racist Chairperson, I mean I got a 
thick skin, we are a highly racialized society.  So, first there were people 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 164 of 169 
 
in SABC obviously and MultiChoice saying aha, you see Carrim is 
agreeing to it because he is buddy-buddy with Yunis Sheik.  Maybe you 
can speak to Yunis Sheik.  I would not qualify it, as a comrade, hundreds 
of comrades.  Secondly then they said no, no, you see Yunus has got the 
same name as Yunis.  I covered that in my response already.  Then they 
said 
no, 
because 
they 
Indians, 
oh 
please, 
I 
am 
a 
Marxist, 
unapologetically so Chairperson, he does not belong to the same school.  
Even in the NIC we belonged to two different schools right.  Then they 
said no – no Carrim is not going with Sheik he is going with Marcel 
Golding, because you see Marcel Golding was a workerist, and Carrim is 
10 
a left power man. Sorry I do not know if that is the right word, oh man 
please there is no such thing.  So, when they lost all of that, you know 
what they then did?  They said ah do you see?  It is his advisors.  Now 
they obviously playing the race card again.  Advisors what they did not 
realise was Setumo Mohapi, let me repeat Chairperson, brilliant CEO of 
Sentech.  The most influential person on me, apart from Government 
policy and ANC policy was Setumo who writes notes that are simple and a 
journalist like me can convert with little editing.  Mr Roy Kruger, Mr David 
Nidri, right, was a long-term activist in the movement, right?  And the 
Wanga Glangamandla and Rosy, they were the Team Chairperson. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that is fine. 
MR CARRIM:   And then I thanked them again for their excellent work.    
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much Mr Carrim.  Thank you for coming 
to give evidence and to share what you know about this issue of digital 
migration during your term as Minister.  Thank you very much for coming 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 165 of 169 
 
…(intervenes). 
MR CARRIM:   Sir, I do not want to be rude but. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CARRIM:   If those e-mails are authenticated and I have read them, 
and if I had only had access to them, my affidavit not spend me hours and 
hours digging.  It is there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CARRIM:   I am willing if you so need me, it is your decision to come 
back and give some of the politics of those e-mails and I can fill in the 
events that are making more sense to me now Chairperson.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR CARRIM:   If only I had those e-mails, and Mr Nidri has to apologise 
to me for saying ah man Yunus there was nothing there but it was there 
for 5 years, I only saw it on Friday, if you need me, I am willing. Thank 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no thank you very much, the Legal Team hears 
what you say.  Once they have been authenticated, I am sure they will be 
in touch with you but thank you very much.  You are now excused.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair.  The next witness, Ms 
Mkobo is present.  The only challenge is that one of the implicated 
20 
persons by her in her statement Mr Tiaan Olivier has written to the 
Commission yesterday challenging some of the minutes that have been 
given to him.  He is challenging that those minutes are not accurate.  I 
have not had an opportunity to deal with those aspects with Ms Mkobo but 
we have arranged that she would go through them overnight.  With your 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 166 of 169 
 
leave Chair may she be allowed to testify tomorrow morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   But depending what the Chair says, we can 
continue with her evidence and then we can do the authentication of the 
minutes later, because the ones that you have received from the SABC 
have been authenticated by the – by Ms Bhy, yes, to save time maybe we 
could …(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   How many minutes are affected by Mr Olivier’s 
challenge? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   That is the difficulty Chair, he has not – we 
10 
wrote back to him, and we said to him please identify those that you 
believe, you say are not accurate.  And he simply in his response in which 
we got, he simply goes and makes a very broad general statement, so 
maybe we could proceed and deal with that later? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, if Ms Mkobo believes that they are accurate 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then well it just depends how much is involved 
because if it is minutes of one meeting that are something like 5 pages, 
you know, it is one thing, but if it is minutes of a number of meetings it 
might be, it might require more time. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes.  I am in your hands Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The situation tomorrow, how do we stand tomorrow? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   We have arranged Chair with the stream – 
the law enforcement stream, that they must have a witness ready for 
tomorrow but I do not think we will be even two hours with Ms Mkobo 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 167 of 169 
 
because most of the ground has been covered by the evidence of Mr 
Carrim and as you might have notice Chair, Ms Mkobo does have a 
confirmatory affidavit attached to Mr Carrim’s evidence.  So she will 
simply deal with very few matters that only she would know about and – 
and that should not, if we start at 10:00 I believe that by tea time we 
should be done with her.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, and then the Law Enforcement work stream has 
got how many witnesses? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   They have indicated that they have three 
this week Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that is this week, but for tomorrow? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   For tomorrow I know that they have one 
person, that Nicholson had advised me that, Advocate Nicholson advised 
me that that witness is going to be a long issue, I think the one did not 
finish on the last occasion.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   I have forgotten the name of the witness.  
He is going to finish that witness, but he believes that 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   He believes that he could take a while, but I 
20 
could verify those facts. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, no that is fine.  Okay so, you were suggesting 
that maybe we adjourn for the day and then you can attend to the issue of 
these and so on.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Queries, yes thank you. 
25 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 218 
 
Page 168 of 169 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us do that and then tomorrow we will resume 
at 10:00.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise.
