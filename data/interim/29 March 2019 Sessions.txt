PROCEEDINGS HELD ON 29 MARCH 2019  
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Pretorius, good morning everybody. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Good morning Chair. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Good morning Honourable Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Mr Agrizzi.  I do understand you wanted to see me Mr 
Pretorius before we could start. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps that could be done. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it something we can deal with.. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  During one of the adjournments Chair  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The matters are unrelated to the current. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  That is fine so.  Okay.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Morning Mr Agrizzi. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Morning Advocate Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 28 is where we left off on page 29 
of your statement.  In the next few pages you detail actions you have taken to amongst 
other things bring evidence before this commission. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And I understand the reason that this evidence 
is being advanced by you is to deny in effect any allegations that you have been 
20 
deliberately delaying your cooperation or managing your cooperation and for that 
purpose you going to lead evidence now about the steps you have taken leading up to 
your appearances before the commission. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So would you take the Chair through that 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 3 of 138 
 
please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair originally in 2016 I actually had spoken to Brian 
Biebuyck and I had spoken to him all along that I was concerned.  And then during 
2017 and 2018 I worked directly with the Hawks their Commercial Crimes Unit that was 
located in Visagie Street.  And I dealt with a certain detective Joey Tugane  I also gave 
them a complete case file of what I prepared and I had handed it over to them.  That 
also included some threats that had been received because I had taken the threats very 
seriously.  Nothing ever happened.  I never heard anything.  I then out of desperation 
phoned up Advocate Glynnis Breytenbach and she met me one evening at the 
Sheraton Hotel with another Doctor I cannot remember who and she told me the 
10 
process to follow and then she had meetings with me at my house.  I then met with 
acting on here advice I met with an attorney who was helping me at that stage called 
Gerhard Wagenaar who was located in Pretoria.  Who thereafter contacted people from 
the Hawks and the NPA as well people from the commission.  But I had already 
contacted the commission as well.  I also then had a meeting with Advocate Willie 
Hofmeyr at his offices in order to get urgent assistance because at that stage he was 
the one who had done the SIU report.  And I wanted assistance in regards to the 
corruption case that had been opened against Bosasa ten years ago.  And I wanted 
help.  I then contacted – I got a telephone number of Reverend Stimela from the 
commission in all about August 2018 and I sent him a message.  So concerned that I 
20 
had tried absolutely everything to seek advice on how to deal with the whistleblowing.  I 
had no option but to actually reach out and I then drafted a press release that I wanted 
to mention this to everybody and request you know that – that I whistle blow and that 
there are people that need to whistle blow because things had escalated with threats 
and all that type of thing.  So an email was sent to various anti-corruption organisations 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 4 of 138 
 
as well as to various state departments as well that deals with issues of these nature.  
And then an article emanating from the brief was posted on News24. A copy of this was 
attached to my initial affidavit.  I then received a call from a Colonel Lazarus from the 
Hawks during September/October 2018 and that was after the press release of the 21 
August 2018.  I indicated at all times that I would avail myself for a meeting which then 
took place in the chambers of Advocate Roux.  At the meeting we discussed the 
assistance and how we could assist putting this whole matter together I think the one 
thing that came out of the meeting was that you know they need assistance to tie up the 
loose ends and there were 600 lever arch files that needed to be dealt with. So we – I 
was personally at the meeting and Mr Andries Van Tonder was with me at the meeting.  
10 
Gerhard Wagenaar was present at the meeting and we offered assistance there.  I was 
also in contact with my previous attorney Garhard Wagenaar who informed me that he 
is working on this matter and this is back to August.  And he would meet the relevant 
authorities in this regard.  But what was very concerning to me was he was meeting the 
authorities and I was not there.  So on the 22 November and I want to give you a bit of 
a prelude to why everything was so rushed.  22 November I told Mr Wagenaar that I 
was terminating his services and he then undertook to provide me with a statement to 
provide to state capture.  I agreed but in the meantime I had arranged with my present 
attorneys Advocate Mannie Witz and Attorney Daniel Witz from Witz Incorporated to 
come on board.  And I immediately informed the authorities thereof as well as Captain 
20 
Lazarus – sorry Lazarus and Brigadier Makanyane as well.  On the 9 January when Mr 
Wagenaar returned from leave I was promised a statement – an affidavit.  Chair I felt 
that this has been delaying, delaying, delaying and I had a meeting across the road at 
Hillside House with Mr Wagenaar and with his legal assistant, myself and Mr Van 
Tonder and I reiterated again that you had promised both myself and the commission 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 5 of 138 
 
affidavits and nothing was forthcoming.  I raised my discontent with him and I explained 
to him that it is starting to make it look as if I do not cooperate with the commission.  So 
it looks bad on me and on Andries and on the other whistle blowers.  And furthermore it 
puts me in a predicament where people think that perhaps I am trying to withhold 
information which was not the case.  Eventually he conceded that it was his fault and I 
just want to put on the record Chair that I had paid him upfront for everything.  I then 
requested that they send the information on no less than three emails as well as 
requests from the investigators to provide me all the documentation I had given to him.  
The answer was no unless I give a letter confirming that I will not hold him liable for 
anything.  To date notwithstanding all those requests made telephonic, emails 
10 
everything nothing has been forthcoming.  That information was the only information I 
had at my disposal.  Some of them included discs and that.  I explain in depth that the 
documents I needed – needed to be given to the commission and to the state capture 
investigators and I made sure that Colonel Heap and Frank Dutton were aware of this.  
I have given – handed over everything that I possess that might have some information 
including my laptops, my iPads.  I have asked the commission to hold everything that I 
have given over including documents in their possession until such time as the Hawks 
require such.  They can then take over.  I have also assisted SARS and the liquidators 
with regards to the investigation on African Global.  Because there has been a lot of 
removal and destroying of documentation that has taken place.  And it is a concern.  I 
20 
actually – I am concerned about it because the more documentation that goes missing 
the less we have to be able to uncover everything.  In order to help the commission as 
well I even went as far as providing them with a 360 degree photographic view of the 
office park and the various offices where everything is kept.  I have related – the reason 
– oh sorry I have also provided the investigations team with the service access codes 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 6 of 138 
 
that I had at that stage and I have also related – I have given absolutely everything over 
that I can.  I am – all I have right now is the brain that can remember things.  I have 
related the above events in detail so that any allegations that I am holding back is 
refuted.  My intention was to come here and provide the commission with the full detail 
and everything to my recollection.  I also wish to state that even when I became aware 
of and I had personal knowledge of the corrupt activities being conducted I was so 
involved with the complete culture and I mentioned it at the beginning when I started of 
the cult that was taking place that I failed to report these.  I am not at once admonishing 
the fact that I also benefited.  I received holidays.  I had a good lifestyle and ja I just 
wanted to be frank with you Chair.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No thank you very much Mr Agrizzi. Now you have just mentioned 
and you did mention yesterday too that there is still information or documents that you 
have been wanting to get. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which you have not got?  Now are the investigators of the 
commission aware of the documents that they are – aware of the documents that you 
want to have but have not been able to have.  Are they – have they given assistance in 
trying to get those documents or what is happening? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The investigators have been extremely assistive.  They have 
really gone out of their way.  I have given them names of people. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Telephone numbers, contact numbers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  A list. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 7 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Everything they have gone… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  They busy working through it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But I think it is a long and a tedious process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But I do think that the time needs to come eventually when 
there will be search or seizure warrant… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes., 
 MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And I can actually sit with everybody  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And with the team that was involved  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And piece together everything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
 MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You know they have been assisting but I understand 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That they have got a lot on their plate. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine.  I – we will talk to the head of the legal team Mr 
Pretorius and the head of the investigation team Mr Nombembe to find out if there are 
any challenges and – and to see that everything is done to make sure that documents 
that would be helpful to this commission in that you are aware of are obtained.  Okay.  
Thank you very much.   
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 8 of 138 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Agrizzi from paragraph 50 onwards you 
deal with Mr Cedric Frolick and evidence relative to your dealings with him or what you 
know about his dealings in relation to Bosasa?  Would you relate those to the Chair 
please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair Cedric Frolick was first introduced to me by Cheeky 
Watson.  It was telephonically during a period when there was a lot of attack from the 
media.  He has been a long standing friend of Cheeky Watson and the Watson’s and at 
that stage he told me that – he phoned to tell me that Cedric Frolick would be visiting 
the office park with a certain other gentleman.  I did not know who at that stage until 
Gavin Watson came and told me what the purpose of the meeting was.  And the 
10 
purpose of the meeting was basically to visit and to showcase the Mogale Business 
Park as it was called then to the two gentlemen.  So that they could understand the 
magnitude of the business and see the diversity of the actual business in the Business 
Park and how a quasi-BEE company was performing in terms of development in 
Southern Africa.  Gavin stressed to us that Cedric Frolick would be instrumental in 
assisting to cross the impasse that had been developed with Vincent Smith.  So 
Cedrick… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just remind the Chair please what position die 
Vincent Smith hold at that stage? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Vincent Smith was at that stage if I recall correctly was the 
20 
chairman of the Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services and Justice.  So he would 
be able to – he believed that he was the chair of chairs and he had a very good 
relationship with Vincent Smith.  He was from Port Elizabeth and he would be able to 
assist in sorting out this problem that they had with Vincent Smith.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And did you… 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 9 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Vincent Smith at that stage was very anti-Bosasa.  He did not 
want to even meet with Bosasa. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes carry on please.  Did a visit take place? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes the visit took place. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Who went and where did you go? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well what happened was I got a last minute call to tell me that 
a gentleman by the name of Butana Komphela was visiting as well and that he was 
disabled and that we needed to make special arrangements.  So I had to arrange a golf 
cart because a normal tour that I used to do around the office park with Gavin Watson 
would take four and a half hours.  So it was a lot of walking and a lot of getting in and – 
10 
getting into offices and out of offices.  So I made special arrangements.  I cannot 
remember exactly – I seem to recall that I had to book the flights as well for the 
gentlemen coming up.   I recall that before we saw the visitors off we took them on a 
whole office park tour, had lunch with them in the diner as always.  It was decided in a 
meeting – we sat in the boardroom.  It was myself in the boardroom, Gavin Watson, if I 
recall correctly one or two of the directors were in and out but the meeting really 
centred around myself, Gavin Watson, Mr Butana Komphela, Mr Cedric Frolick and at 
one stage there was a discussion that ensued and we were discussing the way forward 
on how to deal with Vincent Smith.  And I recall that I had to draft a document and get a 
document ready and Cedric Frolick would arrange with Ms Bailey I remember the name 
20 
– I had a school teacher at the name – well that same name so I remembered that 
name.  Ms Bailey to meet with Vincent Smith at the Parliamentary offices.  So I had to 
draw up this document and get it ready and showcase on the benefits of having 
outsourced Correctional Services and Justice to Vincent Smith.  The introduction, the 
formal introduction letter was done and the – was to be used as a cover on the existing 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 10 of 138 
 
portfolio.  So it was a – quite a thick document, very similar to this file.   
CHAIRPERSON:  May I ask you at this stage. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Frolick and Mr Komphela. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were invited to see this park – this business park 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that they would do what with that information? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  My understanding was that they must see the benefit that 
Bosasa has produced and BEE working.  So that they could take that information and 
10 
they could talk from a position of knowing and a position of understanding what Bosasa 
was about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Talk in parliament at the portfolio committee or talk where? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Convince Vincent Smith. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh the purpose was that they could then talk to Mr Vincent Smith 
and convince him that in effect Bosasa was not such a bad company. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct and explain what they had seen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And explain what they had seen. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So that they could win him over.  Because Vincent Smith at 
that stage was extremely anti-Bosasa. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And I would not say it in a – he had right to be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So he was standing up for what was right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes,  yes.  So the purpose was so that they could use this 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 11 of 138 
 
information to convince him or persuade him to change his attitude towards Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct.  So there was a specific time when we were 
discussing it and debating it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe I could also ask, do you know whether the two men who 
made this visit were part of the Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services together 
with Mr Smith or were they not involved in that committee? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Not as far as I know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright.  It was specifically at that meeting as well when I drew up the 
letter of introduction  and I remember asking the question Gavin do you want to sign it?  
Because on every single letter that went out in the company to a client or a potential 
client was always signed by two people.  Gavin always said you must have a whitey 
and a darkey or it depends your audience.  If it is to parliament and I asked him I said 
“Gavin are you going to sign it because I do not want to sign it alone because it is going 
to look – here you talking about a BEE company and I must sign the letter.  Are you 
going to sign it and who else?  Joe or Papa or?  He said ‘no you get Gibson and Njenje 
to sign it.  Gibson and Njenje was then for a very short period the chairman of Bosasa.  
He was not actively involved with the business at all but he was there as a figure head. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So I was told no you get him to sign it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Gavin Watson was specific he said I do not want to 
compromise myself with the other ANC people to be seen as trying to what is the right 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 12 of 138 
 
word – to try and impose myself on Vincent Smith. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So that is why I was told Gibson and Njenje will sign it and I 
was also told – because I did not want to go to the meeting I do not like those type of 
meetings.  I did not want to go to the meeting and – but Gavin said I have to go to the 
meeting because his – how do I put this politically correct?  Let me not go there.  In 
other words the mix had to be right.  That is the right way to maybe put it.  That Gibson 
and Njenje but also that I was there to showcase and to explain the company which 
was very strange for me because normally they would utilise Papa Leshabane or Joe 
Gumede as a spokesperson to go and propose this thing but he insisted that I go and 
10 
that Gibson goes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the – I am sorry – and the mix you talking about is the racial mix 
of the composition of those who would represent Bosasa at the meeting? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did Gavin Watson ever address Cedrick 
Frolick directly in relation to any influence over Vincent Smith? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes he did. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What was said? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well there was a specific meeting in the meeting – a specific 
time in the meeting where Gavin Watson told Cedric to do whatever is possible to 
ensure that we could win over Vincent Smith.  Or alternatively to try and move him out 
of that position so that he could not be detrimental to Bosasa and the contract.  So it 
was during this discussion and I remember vividly Mr Komphela because he was 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 13 of 138 
 
walking on a crutch I had to open the door for him because he wanted to take a call and 
he was standing at the door well halfway in the door so he was on his phone and I was 
holding the door open.  I remember that vividly.  Whilst we were discussing this 
approach to Vincent Smith Gavin then excused himself – so he had the discussion, 
excused himself.  Now the boardroom is located right next the vault.  Excused himself, 
walked out, went to the vault and then came back.  Anything?  Must I continue? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes carry on what did you see then? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So when he came back from the vault I stayed in the – when 
he was in the vault I stayed in the boardroom with Mr Cedric Frolick and Mr Komphela 
and Gavin returned and he called him.  He said, come here.  And they were in the 
10 
passageway and there was those years’ double doors and I could see through the door 
and he had opened his jacket pocket and he put a security bag in the pocket.  And you 
know it is obvious I knew exactly what was in the security bag and it was some money. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who put the security bag in whose pocket? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Watson put it in Frolick’s pocket. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In Mr Frolick’s? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Jacket pocket? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You referred to a security bag and you referred 
in your earlier evidence particularly when the video was being shown two security bags. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Were they the same? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Same thing. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 14 of 138 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and you say in paragraph 61 that Gavin 
Watson always reiterated that everything possible had to be done to deal with Vincent 
Smith? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  At that… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just tell the Chair about that please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  At that stage Vincent Smith was the thorn in the flesh.  He was 
the person that would contra anything that Bosasa had done. He would raise issues 
with regards to Bosasa. He was a major concern.  And he was actually at that stage 
doing what was right.  All these questions, all his points were very, very valid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And around about what year are we talking about here?  I see in your 
10 
statement there does not seem to be any… 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  2000/ 2010 around there I think. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I cannot recall the exact dates. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Once I start getting all my… 
CHAIRPERSON:  All the documents that … 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  All my – and emails and that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Then I can start finding the exact dates. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And what I would do I will do a full timeline. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  For the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you very much. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 15 of 138 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  There was a time you will recall when Advocate 
Willie Hofmeyr addressed the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In relation to the SIU report. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That existed at the time.  Is that correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That was around 2009? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  These events of which you speak here when in 
10 
time did they relate to the SIU revelations before the parliamentary committee? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Probably 2010 around 2008/2010/2011. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  And I recall that there was some 
opposition to Mr Smith allowing Mr Hofmeyr to address the Parliamentary Committee, is 
that correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Most definitely.  There were emails and letters that were sent 
to the state attorney to Willie Hofmeyr’s office to the – to try and prevent that from 
happening. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright carry on please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Before they left I debriefed Gavin Watson on the discussions 
20 
that when he left … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Mr Pretorius I do not know if I have missed something but 
I would like to know why there were attempts to prevent him I do not know if you are 
going to cover that with him? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us just take that step by step. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 16 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At around the time of which you are now 
speaking in your evidence Vincent Smith as chair of the Parliamentary Portfolio 
Committee would presumably have been instrumental in allowing Willie Hofmeyr to 
present to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was about the same time. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The topic of the presentation would be the SIU 
report into Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Which had also reached public domain at 
10 
around that time? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And certain people were not happy about Willie 
Hofmeyr being allowed to speak to the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee about the 
contents of the SIU report and the allegations contained in that report? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Who were those parties and what did they do? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I would have to go into my records.  I do not think I mentioned 
it.  I did not actually – I know what you are talking about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Advocate Pretorius is reminding me of something now but … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  There were people that were very unhappy.  I remember that 
together with Brian Biebuyck we authored a letter to various people and at one stage 
we were going to bring an application – I cannot remember if that was ever done – to 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 17 of 138 
 
the state attorney and to Willie Hofmeyr not to present any detail. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So essentially what you are saying is I 
understand it as that Bosasa in a general sense was not very happy about this 
presentation before the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee chaired by Mr Smith? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No most definitely not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Bosasa – Bosasa or people connected with Bosasa were some 
of the people who were trying to prevent Mr Willie Hofmeyr from making a presentation 
to the Portfolio Committee? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair there were letters sent to and fro. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And as soon as I get access I will get those letters to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You were telling the Chair Mr Agrizzi about 
your debriefing of Gavin Watson after he had left the boardroom or of events that 
occurred after he had left the boardroom? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes Chair.  So if after every meeting we would have to sit and 
debrief each other.  Or I would have to brief him on what was said whilst he was in the 
vault.  And I basically said to him, look we had small chat and small talk.  There was – I 
did not want to discuss anything without him there and I explained to him that you know 
Cedric Frolick was really impressed and Mr Komphela was really impressed with the 
20 
office park and what we doing.  That was basically the debrief and he also then told me 
explicitly that Cedric Frolick I do not need to worry about he is – because I would 
always question, who is the person?  Where does he fit in?  Can he help?  And he 
would say to me, do not worry about it he is a hundred percent on board. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That is Cedric Frolick  
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 18 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is a hundred percent on board. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct.  He mentioned he had been with the family for years.  
He dealt with Cheeky and he dealt with Valance as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I remember that when I was reading your statement I got the 
impression that what you were saying was that when Mr Gavin Watson gave the 
security bag to Mr Frolick Mr Komphela was still on the phone.  You must just confirm if 
my understanding is correct?  I got the impression that he might not have seen what 
was happening I do not know.  I just want you to… 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well if you look at the boardroom, the boardroom at that stage 
10 
was shaped in a U. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So there were two wooden double doors that opened up to the 
boardroom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And I was, I always sit near the coffee station which is on the 
opposite side.  Mr Komphela was sitting at the head of the table where Gavin was 
sitting and he was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I cannot remember when Gavin put the; he did not, I doubt he 
20 
saw it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But I cannot remember if he was on the phone or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He might have just got off the phone. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 19 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But Gavin had come back, but before Gavin walked into the 
boardroom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He was at the door and he called Cedric Frolick out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Would you relate the evidence in paragraph 63 
please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The one thing I remember standing outside as they were 
being picked up by the driver to take them back to the airport.  I remember vividly that 
10 
Gavin said to me that we have to remember every month we have to arrange R40 000 
that must be delivered to Cedric Frolick.  He says this would be a standard 
arrangement and Watson would arrange to take it with him whenever he went down to 
Port Elizabeth or he would give it to his brother, Valence, to take down for him to Port 
Elizabeth as well.  So I asked him but you know how are you going to take this on a 
plane through security, you know.  How do you take R40 000?  It was not massive you 
know.  It is maybe four bundles of money.  Are you going to take this on the plane and 
you know, he sat and he just laughed at me.  He says do not worry they never check 
and I always get the Bosasa guys when Gavin would arrive at the airport would 
surround him and carry his bag and everything and there was such a lot of people 
20 
around him that nobody really worried to check his bags. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Were there any other benefits of which you 
have knowledge? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I managed to get from one of the whistle blowers that is 
still inside, they sent me, they had a copy of an invoice and an email that was sent to 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 20 of 138 
 
me by Dr Jurgen Smith which Cheeky had sent him the invoice for Cedric Frolick and 
he had said to him that Cheeky had called him and said Bosasa must pay for this as 
well.  There are others but we need to get them and it is a process. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But I am sure the investigation team will assist. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So attached there was a small invoice for R2 744. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And it was for City Lodge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And it was dated 14 September 2010. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And the reference there was VHR25856, Guest Frolick, Mr C. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And it is attached, I think it is [intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Annexure KK. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  KK. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us go to page 118 please.  On 
14 December 2010 it is apparent that there was an email sent from Dr Smith to 
yourself.  Subject line “Invoice from Sure Blakes Travel Agency (Pty) Ltd” and the email 
20 
reads: 
“Angelo, Cheeky told me that this invoice must also be paid by 
Bosasa.  Please advise, doc.” 
Was that invoice paid? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 21 of 138 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And if one goes to page 119 one will see the 
invoice.  It is actually an invoice made to EP Rugby c/o of Mr D Watson. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  For accommodation at the City Lodge 
O R Tambo? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did EP Rugby pay that invoice? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, Bosasa paid all the invoices with relation to travelling for 
Mr Cedric Frolick and Mr Komphela.  I just need to get all the other invoices.  Although 
it shows EP Rugby it was, Cheeky Watson would book stuff on Bosasa and this was 
10 
one of them. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Cheeky Watson is Daniel Watson? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Daniel Watson. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Mr D Watson. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He is the one who arranged that Cedric Frolick and 
Mr Komphela [intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The invoice at page 119 on your evidence was 
paid by Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct.  You will see the email, the email is from 
Dr Smith and it says clearly there you know that Cheeky said to him this must be paid 
20 
for Bosasa because it was Bosasa’s, he did work for Bosasa. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You relate an incident in paragraph 65 that 
shortly after the events of which you have just spoken. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Tell the Chair about that please. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 22 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Shortly after this visit and that I was informed by Gavin that I 
needed to go to his brother in Port Elizabeth and I had to meet with Valence Watson 
and I also needed to take a parcel of cash which he had given to me which was 
R40 000 and I remember because I was very nervous about going through an airport 
with money.  So it was specifically in R200 notes and it was a small package so it could 
fit in my briefcase.  I did what I was told to do.  Stupidly I went and I took the package 
with me and I then hired a vehicle.  No, I did not hire a vehicle Chair sorry.  I did not.  I 
then took the package, got into the vehicle.  I was collected, taken to Valence Watson’s 
house in Waverley.  I think it was in, I cannot remember.  It is Waverley something. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the, would that be the suburb, name of the suburb or 
10 
something or is that a complex? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I do not, I cannot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The name Waverley is in my mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I will find the exact address. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But I, I remember the house vividly though. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was beautifully stone built. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Stone and he mentioned to me that he actually had got an 
Italian craftsman to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Help him with the stone work and that.  So I remember the 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 23 of 138 
 
house vividly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And we were actually waiting at one stage to see Mr Frolick. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And he took me and he showed me an old gym.  A gym that 
he had built and he said he never ever used the gym.  It was a beautiful place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And then Cedric Frolick arrived. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that was Mr Cheeky Watson’s residence/ 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, no Valence Watson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay, okay.  Thank you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Valence Watson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I recall that while I was waiting he showed me the gym as I 
mentioned to you and then Cedric Frolick arrived at Valance’s house.  We sat in the 
lounge.  I remember we sat upstairs in his lounge.  His wife came and said goodbye.  
She was going out and he made us coffee and gave us some coffee and we started, 
they started talking about political issues that had happened in Port Elizabeth over that 
period.  There was some, I did not really pay attention.  I was on my phone checking 
emails.  I tried to stay away from getting into the discussion.  Then he started talking 
20 
about the strategy on how to handle Vincent Smith and what we needed to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do you recall more or less how long after Mr Frolick’s and 
Mr Komphela’s visit to the business park it was when you travelled to Port Elizabeth for 
this purpose? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I would like to get all my records. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 24 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  To establish. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But it was not long.  It was about 10 days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So would that have been the first payment after the visit? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So I gave that to Valence Watson.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The package you are talking about. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  With cash? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct.  So. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But just to go back. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What had, you did say this part.  I just want to make sure I 
understand.  What had Mr Gavin Watson, who did he say this money that you had to 
carry to Port Elizabeth was for? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I must give it to Valence to give to Cedric. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He said Valence knew about it. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So I gave it to Valence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He knew about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you were not going to, you were not to give it to. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 25 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Frolick yourself? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had to give it to Mr Valence Watson? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And he was going to give it to Cedric Frolick. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So I gave it to him and later I saw him give it to him.  When 
we, I think it was about when we were about to leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He actually took the package and he said this is yours. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and was this in a security bag as? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was in the same bag. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was not opened.  I did not open it or anything like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I gave it as it was handed over. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you gave it to Mr Valence Watson? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And at the time when you are about to part you saw 
Mr Valence Watson give the same packet to Mr Frolick? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I sat on a leather couch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  There was a Persian carpet in front of me. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 26 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  My briefcase was next to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  As I arrived I took it out.  I gave it to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And he put it on another chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Where he was sitting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Alright.  Then he got up.  He made coffee, came back. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  We had the discussion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  When we left he took it.  As he was walking out of the lounge 
he gave it to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  He took the bag and gave it to Cedric Frolick? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What had, I am sorry who had packed money into that bag?  Was it 
you or was it somebody else? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, it was Gavin Watson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in your presence or not in your presence/ 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, it was not in my presence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But I did tell him please do not make it 100s or R50 notes, 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 27 of 138 
 
because I have got to carry this rubbish through the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The thing and Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Me being seeing that stuff for as long as I have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You know exactly how much is there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So R20 000, R200 notes are packed 100. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So it is R20 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is two packs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Next to each other. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What happened within the next week? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Within a week of that meeting Gavin got a call from 
Cedric Frolick to say that he, I must accompany; Gavin then came to me and said I 
must accompany Gibson Njenje.  We must fly down, alright the day before for an 
20 
introductory meeting with Vincent Smith. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Fly down to where? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  To Cape Town. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For what purpose? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Because there was going to be a meeting with Vincent Smith. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 28 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The following day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And who was to coordinate this visit? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It would be coordinated by Cedric Frolick. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And were you requested to make any 
preparations for the visit? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well I had already sent booklets down and I do not mention it 
in my thing, but I had already sent a package down, but I brought with exactly the same 
package with the same letter to be handed over to him.  It was a box with the Bosasa 
10 
logos on it and it was all the portfolios of the company inside as well as a video of the 
benefits of having Bosasa there. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did you travel to Cape Town? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, we did. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Were you accompanied by anybody? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  As far as I remember myself and Mr Njenje flew down 
together.  We stayed in the same hotel.  I hired a vehicle and we stayed in a hotel, 
beautiful hotel, but normally close to Parliament where all politicians stay when they 
come down.  Very, very nice really top class hotel.  I cannot remember the name 
though. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Would there be any records of this visit? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  At the hotel? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of the flights, car hire and the like? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, most definitely. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Who were they charged to? 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 29 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  They were charged to Bosasa. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And who organised the travel arrangements? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  If I remember correctly the travel person at that stage was a 
lady by the name of Magdel Wilson. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At Blakes Travel? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  She would have arranged it, but sorry? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At Blakes Travel? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  No, she worked for Bosasa.  At Blakes Travel 
Brian Blake would be able to pull that information for us as well as SAA, if they have 
subpoena they will be able to pull all the records and I would be able to tell you exactly 
10 
which hotel it was, how much we had to pay and all that type of thing.  It was always a 
direct bill back.  So I never used the credit card there. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did the meeting with Vincent Smith eventuate? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, well I actually had breakfast with Gibson Njenje where we 
discussed how we are going to approach this and I do not want to implicate him, 
because he did nothing wrong but he is very knowledgeable as well.  So he, you know, 
he stood back a bit.  He did not actually participate in the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the discussion? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  In the discussion with me.  I just briefed him you know.  I said 
well you are just here really to follow me. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  To make me look, you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Dilute my whiteness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 30 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is what basically it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So at the exact, at the time you could see he was not 
comfortable with it, but he was doing it because Gavin had asked him to do it.  So what 
happened then was we were taken through the security process.  In Parliament there is 
a scanner.  We walked through the scanners and we signed in.  Cedric Frolick met us in 
front of Parliament there and he took us through and he put us in an office to wait and 
we had to wait in the specific office.  I do not think it was the office of Vincent Smith, 
because it was an empty, it was like a meeting room but with a desk and a chair and all 
that and I remember we sat in there for quite a while before Cedric Frolick brought in 
10 
Vincent Smith and he walked in and he was visibly annoyed that we were there and it 
was [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was he not expecting you? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No.  I do not think he was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair, either he was expecting somebody else or he was 
expecting that Cedric Frolick had maybe brought Gibson Njenje, but I do not think he 
expected to see me there.  I had never met him before.  So I actually googled him to 
find out a bit about him on the web, but he was very abrupt.  I basically said to him here 
is the document with, you know, an introduction and I tried to explain to him and he said 
20 
look I am busy.  I have got a meeting now.  I have to leave and he left and it was a bit 
embarrassing, because the meeting actually did not go well at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did it look like his attitude towards Bosasa had not changed? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Most definitely not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As at that time? 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 31 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Most definitely not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So I left the company brochures with him.  I gave them to him.  
What he did with them I do not know.  Then Cedric Frolick basically took us on a brief 
tour of the building itself and I bumped into one or two people who will confirm that they 
saw me there.  You know, a specific incident that I remember was, I mean we had lunch 
in the canteen.  They have lovely food there and we had lunch in the canteen and he 
put it on his card, Mr Frolick, for the lunch for myself, himself and Gibson Njenje.  So 
we sat openly with all the parliamentarians or MPs sitting around.  So it was quite 
impressive and then he basically showed us the assembly.  Showed us a couple of 
10 
empty spots and that and after that we left.  We flew back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you only saw and spoke to Mr Frolick after you had had this brief 
encounter with Mr Vincent Smith?  I am saying encounter because I am not sure 
whether it ended up being a meeting or not. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was not a meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was an introduction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was supposed to be a meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It did not go there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, but my question is whether on that day you only saw Mr Frolick 
after and not before the meeting. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No.  He brought us, he fetched us from the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From the hotel? 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 32 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  From the entrance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, in front of. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  We phoned him and he fetched us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, of Parliament? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Of Parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  We went through the security with him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And then he took us, we had to still sign in the book. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And he took us through and we walked a little bit around 
Parliament. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And then he took us to a specific office, alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes and left you there? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And he said just wait here and myself and Gibson Njenje 
waited there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And then we waited for quite a while and I was briefing 
20 
Mr Njenje on what documents I had prepared. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So that he knew in case for this meeting that we were going to 
have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 33 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI: 
 
And 
then 
when 
Cedric Frolick 
came 
back 
with 
Mr Vincent Smith who was with him and he was very abrupt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, so when Mr Vincent Smith came into that office he was with 
Mr Frolick? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Thank you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And then at the lunch, I mean I did not want to embarrass 
Mr Frolick by saying this meeting did not happen did not go very well.  We have just 
wasted R25 000 on travelling and you know we have wasted our time and your time 
and he said no, do not worry.  This is how politicians are.  He said, but at least there is, 
10 
we have broken, we are starting to break the ice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I am not sure whether with that very brief encounter and the 
attitude of Mr Smith that ice had been broken. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I was worried because I had to go back and report to 
Mr Watson what had happened.  I would have to phone him as soon as I had left the 
office and I said to Gibson Njenje I said I do not know if I can tell Gavin that this as a 
good meeting, because everybody when they have meetings would say no, it was a 
brilliant meeting.  I said no, this was not a very good meeting this, you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But a specific incident comes to mind Chair and that was I 
20 
remember I was sitting in the boardroom with another meeting.  Gavin called me out of 
it and he said by the way I am meeting with the Minister of Justice and Constitutional 
Development. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  More or less when did this meeting take place? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Gee it was, I remember there was a conference in Port 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 34 of 138 
 
Elizabeth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just, your voice sometimes go down. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  There was a conference in Port Elizabeth.  My dates, I am 
terrible with dates.  It was a conference in Port Elizabeth.  It must have been.  It was 
recent, it was about 2015 around there.  So there was a conference in Port Elizabeth 
and Gavin called me out of the boardroom meeting.  It was actually one of my HOD 
10 
meetings.  So I will be able to check the date when I get my notes and he called me out 
and he says listen here, sorted and he says the Lord works in mysterious ways.  He 
said, he told me about that there was an ANC meeting or rally or something in Port 
Elizabeth and Cedric Frolick was going to help him organise the accommodation for 
Masutha and he would be able to have a meeting [intervenes]. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That is Minister Masutha? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Minister Masutha.  So I said well that is great.  I mean, you 
know, you have been wanting to see him for a long time. You have not been able to get 
to him.  Sesinyi Seopela could not get a meeting going with Minister Masutha and 
Gavin Watson.  So it would be; he explained to me exactly what had happened.  That 
20 
Cedric Frolick had offered Minister Masutha accommodation in one of, they have a 
property down there called like a game reserve, wild life estate where you can build 
houses and I am not sure if it was there specifically.  I cannot exactly remember, but 
what Gavin told me is that it was one of his houses down there that he had actually 
arranged that Minister Masutha could stay at, because the argument was that 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 35 of 138 
 
Cedric Frolick who had been organising the accommodation and everything for the 
parliamentarians and the politicians or the politicians from the ANC who would say to 
him no everything is full.  There is no space and we will get you, I have got a special 
place for you and that meeting then, he stayed in the house and the meeting then took 
place.  Gavin told me exactly how he had planned it and I remember it because he 
even the next day he had gone to Richmond Mti with myself and he had explained in 
detail how he is going to very similar with the discussions he had on recording where 
the talks about how he is going to handle the meeting with ex-President Zuma.  He 
explained that as well to Mti that you know that he can sort this out.  He is going to 
have a meeting with him, a breakfast and then after breakfast, you know, then it will be 
10 
sorted out.  He will develop that relationship and he was excited about it.  He was 
extremely excited if, Gavin was like a kid with new toys if he got to meet a 
parliamentarian or politician.  So that happened and it was reported on the press as 
well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I just want you to go back a little bit, because I seem to hear, I 
seem to hear you say something like he that is Mr Gavin Watson and/or Mr Frolick kind 
of planned? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To make sure that conditions or ANC people would be made to 
believe that there was no accommodation.  It was full and then end up or be offered 
20 
accommodation provided by Bosasa or by Mr Gavin Watson?  Is my understanding of 
what you are saying correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You are 100 percent correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 36 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I am telling you I did see them in caucuses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But I was told. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that is what he said? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That he had caucused this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And he had prepared this with Cedric Frolick. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So in short you were made aware Mr Agrizzi of 
plans to accommodate Minister Masutha in Port Elizabeth? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I was well aware of it, yes before the time. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And in connection with that plan the intention 
of which you knew was that Gavin Watson would have a meeting with 
Minister Masutha? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Do you know firstly whether that meeting took 
place of your own knowledge and secondly what happened at that meeting? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It did happen.  The meeting did take place.  If I remember 
correctly Gavin went there with Valance, his brother.  Gavin is not that well known in 
political circles more so Ronnie and Valance and Cheeky and I think that is why he took 
20 
Valance.  As I said previously Gavin would never allow meetings if only one person 
went.  He always took someone with him or we had to take someone with us.  So it was 
Valance and Gavin that went to the meeting. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Do you have any knowledge of the contents of 
that meeting/? 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 37 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was very, very quiet.  It was very similar to the meeting I had 
had with Vincent Smith.  I do not think it was a success at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you were not at the meeting, but your understanding is that that 
meeting did not turn out to be a success? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, it was not a success.  Normally if a meeting was 
successful Gavin would phone me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And he would say to me oh you know I had a brilliant meeting. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He said he is going to help us.  No, this meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He did not really comment much on, he told me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The meeting was good. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But he did not say to the extent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You know that he would normally if a meeting went well. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You must remember I have worked with him for 18 years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I know, I know exactly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know how he is like if he has had a good meeting/ 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 38 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  If he had a good meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I do not think the press would have needed to report on it 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In paragraph 8 you return to the relationship 
between Cedric Frolick and African Global Operations as it was then? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Please tell the Chair of the events of 2016 and 
2017 in that regard. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair in late 2016 a tender was submitted for the catering 
contracts for Correctional Services.  The then Commissioner was a gentleman by the 
name of Zack Modise and he was being attended to by Papa Leshabane.  That was the 
contact and Sesinyi Seopela.  During that period I was concerned about the catering 
tender for Correctional Services.  As a matter of fact I was so concerned and I do not 
know why I forgot to put it in here, but there was another consultant that we used.  I 
think I mentioned it in my first affidavit where we used another consultant 
Reggie Nkabinde and Sam Sekgota.  I think if I recall we do mention it in the first 
affidavit, but I was really concerned about this and when we had submitted the tender 
the tender had not been caucused or anything like, it was a straight tender but 
20 
interestingly enough I got information that we were the cheapest and at that stage, 
when I say “we” I am putting myself in that period of time.  At that stage we as Bosasa 
were the cheapest and we should have got everything.  The 10 management areas, but 
it appeared that they had issued out two other management areas to other companies.  
So on advice from Gavin Watson we took the litigation route, okay and the reason why 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 39 of 138 
 
we did that was purely because Gavin Watson advised me look I want you to take the 
Department of Corrections to court and you make sure that Brian Biebuyck is on top of 
it and that stage he employed an advocate as well.  I recall it vividly and we drew up an 
argument and the papers were ready.  I remember this because I was sick at home.  I 
was actually on a drip and on occasion sitting at the dining room table attending to 
checking papers for Brian Biebuyck and so the arguments, the papers everything had 
been prepared.  Then the day before the application was to be heard Gavin Watson 
arrived there with some of the Directors and they sat around the table and says we 
have taken a resolution.  The attorneys were there.  Brian Biebuyck was there with the 
Advocate Etienne Theron.  He says we have taken a decision.  I said what decision 
10 
have you taken.  He said no we are not going to go ahead with this court application.  I 
said but I asked you this in December/November.  In the beginning I asked you why do 
this.  You do not pull out the gun and then do not use it.  If you start something you 
follow it through.  He said no, we have got political advice that this would be suicide if 
we went ahead with the application and I argued with him.  I said to him, I said you 
know Gavin you must remember something we are 100 percent in the right here.  We 
have a legal footing here, it’s not going back, we’re not saying that we caucused – we 
never caucused this, we never dealt with anybody on this, we haven’t paid off anybody 
for this new contract, why now do you want to turn back, and it got a bit heated, it got 
so heated at one point that he said to me I’ve been told politically I can’t do it, I said I 
20 
don’t believe you, and it was the first time that I’d started because I wanted to test him, 
the first time I’d really started and got upset with him and maybe it was the medication I 
was on or whatever, remember I just came out of a coma a week before that, and I 
don’t know if it was my medication or whatever it was but I lost my temper, I actually at 
one stage, he says ja phone, hear from the horse’s mouth, and he put me on the phone 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 40 of 138 
 
and Cedric Frolic confirmed with me over the phone, phoned that litigation must be 
withdrawn.   
 
Well at that stage I was really annoyed with everybody, my wife came and 
she chased them out of the house, she said listen you’ve been with him for an hour  
now, he’s now got to rest, because I was actually supposed to be in bed, get out of the 
house, and I remember that Etienne Theron and Brian Biebuyck were there and they 
shook their heads, they said we cannot believe what is happening here, and I actually 
called them a bunch of idiots when they left, I was wrong there, but I did and they left. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was your understanding of what they were saying they could 
not believe what is the ...(intervention)  
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The turnaround of the decision to retract the application but 
interestingly Chair what had  happened was because I had fallen ill and I had booked 
myself into hospital on the 25th of December I think it was I didn’t have a chance to 
make the delivery, that was one specific delivery I had to make that was out of the norm 
for Richmond Mti and I didn’t get to make it because he wasn’t around, he was 
somewhere else and then I got sick so now we’re talking, I think it was about the 9 th of 
January that the delivery had to be made and when Gavin walked into the house the 
first thing he says is oh where’s Mti’s stuff and the cash and my wife, I had said to my 
wife go up to the safe, in the bedroom I have a small safe and there was a bag in there, 
I said get it for him, let him take his money, you know let him take it, I don’t want 
20 
anything to do with this anymore anyways, so ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Was  that already in a security bag or ...(intervention)  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja, it was packed, I just didn’t deliver it, I was told to deliver it 
but we missed each other and I couldn’t deliver it, but in that bag, I can tell you now, 
was R175 000 and I remember it vividly because it was one of these post-it stickers in 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 41 of 138 
 
yellow written on the bag “don’t touch R175 000 Gavin to collect”. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If we can go back to paragraph 79 and the 
circumstances surrounding the intended withdrawal of the application of what you have 
spoken, you say in that paragraph. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So during 2016/2017 African Global was involved in litigation 
with the Department of  Correctional Services ...(intervention)  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let me ask the question, I’m sorry.  You say in 
that paragraph that Frolic and Smith, Vincent Smith, were consulted. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Please tell the Chair about that. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Originally I – before we put in the application, before I did 
anything you know legally I would consult with Gavin and I would double-check, 
because Gavin had a habit of starting something and then turning it back because he 
didn’t want to look bad with the politicians or whatever, so I then asked him, I said have 
you checked this with Vincent Smith, he says yes I’ve checked it we must go ahead 
with it, and at that specific meeting ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry before you proceed, the last time you spoke about Mr Smith 
he had not changed his attitude towards Bosasa, now how come you now talk about 
him being consulted? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay let me explain Chair, it’s a long period of time between – 
he was friendly towards Bosasa after the meeting that we held in Rivonia Road at the 
one hotel there, in my first affidavit I cover it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh this was after. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  This is after, this is 2016/2017 ja. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 42 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright, then I understand. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That’s a meeting that was held ...(intervention)  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Seven or eight years later. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:   More or less, no I wouldn’t say that, I can’t remember exactly 
now, I don’t have my other affidavit here but that was the meeting where we had 
Magashula there, and Ms Winnie Mgwena there, and Cecilia Shepela and they had fish 
ordered from the restaurant, Ocean or Fish Market. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, I guess now I can see it’s after ja.  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So that happened then, that meeting happened and then he 
was pro-us, he worked with Bosasa. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so you asked whether he had been consulted? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja, I asked has he been consulted, he said why don’t you 
check, if you check my phone records I actually did phone him and checked, I said are 
you aware of this retraction and he said yes and he put down the phone.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So I – sorry it slipped my mind now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay but they both said that and agreed that the litigation 
must be withdrawn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And did you find out what Plan B was going to be or if there 
20 
was going to be Plan B to achieve what the application would have achieved or was it 
simply that it was, the application was to be withdrawn or not to be pursued and that 
was going to be the end of the story? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You know Chair at that stage I was – remember I had resigned 
in the August, and I was just out of hospital, I didn’t know yet that he had put a claim on 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 43 of 138 
 
my life insurance so I was annoyed but I wasn’t to the point where I would you know 
confront him too much, but I was fed-up, I had made up my mind and I didn’t even  
bother asking him what Plan B was, I actually afterwards I came back, Etienne Theron, 
the Advocate and Brian Biebuyck, the attorney, were still sitting at a big white table I 
had on my patio, it was a dining room table, on the patio and I said to them I’ve had 
enough, I’ve had enough of this, and they said they can’t believe what’s happening, it’s 
absolutely ridiculous and they then left and I apologised to them for losing my temper.  
As a matter of fact what then happened was Gavin Watson then sent me an apology for 
upsetting me, and he sent my wife an apology as well that they had upset me, I don’t 
think they realised how sick I was. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just to get the sequence of events right in 
relation to Mr Smith, the visit to Parliament about which you testified coincided more or 
less with the release of the SIU report for the first time. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was more or less that time. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that must have been about 2009/2010. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I think you said. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  According to your first statement in paragraph 
20 
24.1 page 44 of your first – page 43 of your first statement, the meeting with Vincent 
Smith at the hotel in Rivonia Road took place during 2011. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the events which you know talking 
regarding the advice to withdraw the litigation from Frolic and Smith that would have 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 44 of 138 
 
taken place during 2016/2017? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was 2016, I remember that vividly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well in your previous evidence and statement I don’t remember that 
you had mentioned that Bosasa had sought to use Mr Frolic in order to win Mr Smith 
over but I made a mistake and I want to ask you this question, do you know whether Mr 
Smith was won over because of Mr Frolic’s efforts or was it just independently because 
of other efforts that were being made by Bosasa, or both? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It could be both Chair, I don’t know specifically about Mr Frolic 
but I do know that it was Winnie Mgwena and it was Magashula, I think it’s Magashula, 
was the guy that won him over eventually, because I remember the meeting that we 
10 
held that I was invited to by Gavin Watson that took place in 2011 was at a hotel and I 
remember vividly that it was a second meeting that Gavin had had, he never took me to 
the first meeting but this was the second meeting that Seopela had coordinated the 
meeting place, Smith was there, Winnie Mgwena was there, Magashula was there, 
Gavin Watson was there, I remember even what was ordered from – it’s like yesterday, 
Seopela phoned a guy  by the name of Nico, I remember he spoke to Nico, and he 
ordered fish from a fishmonger in Rivonia, or somewhere in Rivonia and I’m allergic, I 
was at that stage I was scared of eating fish so I ordered a rump steak with vegetables, 
and they had fish, line fish that was cooked in foil, and that’s how vividly it is in my 
mind.  I can even take you to the – the investigators to the room where we had actually 
20 
had the meeting and they could maybe check who had booked it and who had paid it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Before we go down the menu further you 
mentioned Magashule, is it Magagula or ...(intervention)  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Makakula, I can’t remember, it’s either Makashula or 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 45 of 138 
 
Magagula but it’s not Ace Magashula, it’s  not him, Magagula. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You used that name when you last gave 
evidence, not Magashula. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No it’s Magagula, but ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you recall the spelling, M-h?  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No I don’t, I never ever wrote anything to him, he was part of 
the Portfolio Committee so you will be able to pick it up from that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  If you are able to see it in the previous statement if it’s 
there maybe you can give us the spelling, if it is the same person. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It’s transcribed in the evidence as M-a-g-a-g-u-l-a. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is a surname called that and it is pronounced as Makakula, ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Agrizzi during the time of your illness. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What happened to the payments for which you 
were responsible? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Most of the payments had been made early in December 
because I had just come from my son’s wedding, I had family from overseas around 
and that so all the payments that needed to be done were done, there were just some 
20 
extra payments that needed to be done. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You deal with those in paragraph 81? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That’s what constituted the R175 000. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right, then you go on at paragraph 82 to deal 
with circumstances relevant to Danny Mansell’s work in Bosasa. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 46 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Deal with that please. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I met Danny Mansell the very first time when I went to 
Dijambo those years, I met Danny Mansell.  He was exceptionally close to Gavin 
Watson, well he was a shareholder as well and they would go on holidays and that 
together, but Danny Mansell and Gavin Watson had been involved with some dealings 
with the SBDC in Port Elizabeth and that actually cost Danny Mansell his job, and 
Gavin Watson had done something at the SBDC with Danny and because of that they 
had lost that job and strangely enough Dr Smith told me the whole – the story, because 
Dr Smith was involved with SBDC as well, and that’s how this whole thing came 
10 
together was with the involvement of Ronnie Watson, with the ladies from Dijambo 
Holdings that all got together an that’s the history of how Danny was involved with 
Gavin. 
 
As I stated in my previous statement Danny left Bosasa, there was an 
acrimonious fight, when Gavin gets upset with you forget it.  There was a very 
acrimonious fight, I remember it was at a place called the Big Five in Krugersdorp in 
front of all the senior staff, it was very embarrassing and Danny then decided he was 
going to exit, he was paid an amount of money and he had left, but then – and Danny 
had gone farming with cattle, but my relationship with Danny Mansell wasn’t very good, 
because Danny blamed me for interfering with Gavin, which I never did, I just did what I 
20 
was told to do, but amongst other things Danny suddenly reappeared on the scene late 
2003/2004 and I had met him once or twice and at that stage the company had bought 
two facilities, one was a facility, an old mining hostel in Randfontein called Choonels 
and the other one was a hostel as well called Luiperdsvlei, and Danny was actively 
involved with doing that with the building and the construction with (indistinct).  Sorry 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 47 of 138 
 
am I diverting from the – sorry Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You are a little but carry on. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Alright, no, I’m just giving you the history of this situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So Danny made it his job to try and get on my good side, for 
whatever reason, he tried to make amends and I don’t harbour grudges so I welcomed 
him in.  He was staying at the Cedar Lodge at that stage and Gavin had just given his 
son and himself a contract to remove trees at Choonels Hostel which has now been, 
because of radio activeness they closed it down but they’ve given the work as well to 
do the building of the walls around Choonels and around Luiperdsvlei to a company  
10 
called Rekele Construction, (indistinct) Hoeksma, but I noticed that Gavin was working 
with Danny and with Mti and with Patrick Gillingham and I will explain – I will go into 
detail on it but the one thing that Danny Mansell was involved with and there’s no 
denying about it, it’s all in black and white, was he was involved with directly with the 
meetings with Gavin Watson and with Mti and with Gillingham in the beginning, so they 
were having meetings and amongst other things he was involved in arranging for the 
payments from Bosasa to his company which was called Grantfor, and it’s a company 
that’s reflected in the SIU report as well, but Grantfor basically did all the building for 
the houses, they paid it over and that type of thing, so after once all that had been 
done, I just want to go to my notes here because after that, after having done all the 
20 
technical management and managing the technical department as well for Bosasa so 
he was building, managing the technical department, he started becoming part of the 
company and he would invoice the company on a regular basis and things would go 
ahead. 
 
Do you want me to carry on? 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 48 of 138 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No it’s not necessary to go any further than 
you have in your statement, unless you specifically wish to. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay, no sorry, I’m not following the statement Chair, sorry, I’m 
just telling you as it happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that’s fine. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So then there was a company that was formed by Jared 
Mansell and his wife is Lisa, so they called L & J Civils, that’s how they go the name L 
& J, so L & J Civils was an entity that they also used to handle things for Patrick 
Gillingham and Richmond Mti. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The books of Grantfor and L & J Civils were 
10 
they ever dealt with? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair the books for L & J were dealt with, I would often walk 
into the office and Tony Perry would be sitting with Jared, Danny Mansell and they were 
busy with chequebooks and stubs and they were doing a reconciliation of what needed 
to be paid for Grantfor and there were payments then made by Bosasa to Grantfor. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So Grantfor and L & J Civil were the 
companies that were used to purchase and construct, purchase for and construct 
houses to which you’ve referred elsewhere in your evidence both on the previous 
occasion and now. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But Bosasa financed this through those two 
companies. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That’s right because afterwards you will recall that I said when 
we had to do clean-up for Gavin we couldn’t really change the substance on the 
computer system that said Grantfor so what we had to do was pull the invoices and 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 49 of 138 
 
change the invoices physically to reflect something totally different, instead of reflecting 
work done for Patrick Gillingham  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes but once again it appears that between 
Bosasa and the work it was doing or the work it was financing intermediary companies 
were used. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct, always arm’s length.  I just want to see if there’s 
anything I missed on my statement. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well you may just mention the information in 
paragraph 87. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes even after leaving, even to today, Danny Mansell created 
10 
a company, what happened was he was very nervous, so he wanted to get out of the 
country and he immigrated and he established a company over there, a company called 
Safe as Fences America, and it’s got an American flag  and I think a South African flag 
next to it on the logo, I can actually produce invoices that he would send through, and 
the agreement was that he would get 7 000 dollars per month for the rest of his life.  He 
would just invoice Bosasa for consulting work done or work done from over there to 
here and that 7 000 US Dollars I would have to approve and I would have to send it off 
through the normal processes but that was an agreement reached with him and Gavin, 
and I questioned that agreement and I was told just shut-up you know, if you want to 
ask too many questions, the door is right round the corner. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So – yes, is that what you wanted to say?   
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You deal in paragraph 88 with the role played 
by the then Company Secretary, Mr Tony Perry, tell the Chair about that please. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  This a very critical point in the testimony Chair because Tony 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 50 of 138 
 
Perry was brought into Bosasa by Gavin Watson, Tony Perry had worked with Gavin 
Watson previously.  There had been issues and there was court cases, I remember 
Tony telling me that there was court cases where he had to attest to certain things on 
behalf of Gavin and there was issues there, but I’m sure the investigators will find that 
all out, but he was responsible for writing up contracts and documenting deals. 
 
Now I remember specifically the transaction that he did with Richmond Mti 
and Gavin Watson.  That was the document if Chair remembers correctly that we had to 
look for and search for and eventually we found it now being who I am I was inquisitive, 
I made a copy of it, but I don’t have a copy anymore, but on that document was an 
agreement with per diem cost that was allocated and agreed upon between Gavin and 
10 
Richmond Mti that would be paid as a commission and the signatories there was Gavin 
Watson and Richmond Mti and Tony Perry.  So it’s critical that that information – that 
Chair knows that, that document I can’t find it for the life of me, and it’s gone missing 
but Tony Perry was very closely associated with the Watson family and they kept him 
very close, so he did all the administration type of things, rebuilding the company, that 
was his task, it was to create a confused structure and handle the BEE stuff of the 
company, across agreements, that type of thing, setting up of new entities, because 
previously it was just Bosasa, so he was there from 2002/2001 if I recall correctly and 
he was involved with this whole process.  He was ...(intervention)  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You say Tony Perry joined the Bosasa Group in 
20 
about 2003? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was about then, 2002/2003 maybe.  My dates Chair are 
what they are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You know please bear in mind I’m working off a few notes here 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 51 of 138 
 
and there, a few old books I might have but most of my stuff is still there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps you should go to paragraph 90 then, 
you’ve dealt with 88 and 89 in general terms, and talk about the incident that happened 
early 2004. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay, in 2004 the boardroom, the same boardroom where we 
met Cedric Frolick , Gavin was sitting in the boardroom, he would sit there and read the 
newspaper after ten o’clock, and he was sitting in the boardroom and he was – I 
remember the door was closed, but at that stage the boardroom was dry-walling, so 
there was dry-walling between the loo and the boardroom, there was thin dry-walling, 
10 
so whatever anybody said in the boardroom you would hear.  I was in the loo and I was 
listening to this conversation and I was answering, I don’t want to get too graphic but I 
was answering emails on my phone as well, so I was listening and I was answering 
emails and I heard Gavin say to Tony Perry just register it, don’t argue with me, 
Richmond wants it and it must get done and that was regarding Leonora Investments 
which had to be registered by Tony Perry, so he was instructed by Gavin Watson to 
register Leonora Investments for Richmond Mti or the Leonora Trust, I can’t remember 
if it was a trust or investment, but I remember that vividly. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then you deal in paragraph 93 with the 
document that had gone missing.  You will recall your evidence in January of this year 
20 
where you spoke of a document actually signed by Gavin Watson, there were 
instructions to destroy documents, you destroyed documents but you retained a 
document signed by Gavin Watson. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is that the same document you are now talking 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 52 of 138 
 
about it. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That’s the document I mentioned earlier. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That is the document that you told the Chair 
that you did not destroy but you returned to Gavin Watson. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I made a copy of it, so if I can take you back, I made a copy – 
when we found the document I didn’t tell anybody I made a copy of it, I was still in my 
old house, I remember it, I drove up the driveway, quickly made a copy of it and then 
went back downstairs, got in the car and drove to Gavin’s house. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And it’s that, on that occasion that Gavin 
Watson according to your evidence and other evidence the document was destroyed 
10 
and disposed of by Gavin Watson? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That’s the document he tore up, put in a bag, put water with it, 
made a mash out of it and flushed it down the toilet. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right, is  that what you talk about in paragraph 
93? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What did that document contain, remind the 
Chair please. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That document was an agreement in terms of the catering 
contract specifically and it mentioned another contract, I think it was a contract for 
20 
accommodating youth at Luiperdsvlei, but that document there spelled out what the 
commission basis would be that Richmond Mti would receive. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And the person that drew up that document was Tony Perry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you recall when it would have been more or less, I know it’s a 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 53 of 138 
 
long time ago, when, roundabout what year it would have been drawn up. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Torn up? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mid-2000’s or thereabouts? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No I will tell you Chair it was when I had the American visitors 
with me because I was at a lodge called Tiningi Lodge in Madikwe when I got the call to 
leave everything and to go through, to come to the office, I still had to arrange, so once 
the travel agent, who refuses to talk to me, starts talking to me or the investigators, we 
will pick up all those things and get the exact dates for you as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is there anything else before we deal with the 
10 
events under the heading billed or Arthur Kotzen  & Fred Allibone? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  There’s one issue that I think I need to raise and that’s in 
terms of Better Fence and Bezulu, so whilst I was at home, I was playing with my 
nephews one Sunday I got  call from Gavin Watson to ask, and I mentioned it in my 
previous affidavit, to discuss the fencing contract, or what would I do to a piece of fence 
to make it unique and patent that they could patent and that’s when Tony Perry was 
actually in the meeting so the meeting consisted of Danny Mansell, Tony Perry, Gavin 
Watson, Michael Rohdenberg and it was I think a gentleman by the name of Peter 
Ramoet in that meeting from Belgium and in that meeting is when they phoned me and 
I remember even speaking to Tony then because he was in Cape Town at the meeting 
20 
where they discussed Bosasa acquiring a 26% BEE share in Better Fence in exchange 
for the contract for Correctional Services.  My recollection was about 2004. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If you would deal with the subject matter in 
paragraph 96 and following please, involving Arthur Kotzen and Fred Allibone. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 54 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So in 2006 and 2006 Bosasa was extremely cash flush.  I 
think we had over R300 million in the bank.  So it was a very good business and Gavin 
Watson decided to go into a Prawn Aqua Culture Project with a chap by the name of – 
what is his first name?  Was it Kevin, no I – cannot remember. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Kevin Mills you deal with him in paragraph 96. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I cannot remember if it is Kevin Mills or if it is Kevin K Wills or 
something else Wills.  I cannot remember the first name.  The first name eludes me at 
the moment sorry.  Kevin Wills.  I raised my concerns that this was essentially not our 
core business at that time.  Our core business was providing facilities management, 
security infrastructure resources, youth development and that type of thing.  So this 
10 
was totally out of our business dealings.  And I was very negative towards it but he 
went ahead and he did not want to budge on it.  And at that stage he felt that it was a 
good business opportunity.  So he got involved with Khuga and he was given a piece of 
land in Khuga.  How he got it I do not know but I do not what – he liaised [indistinct] so I 
was not involved much at all.  Where I was involved was dealing with Fred Allibone and 
Arthur Kotzen.  So I had to employ Arthur Kotzen’s son as well Jason.  He was 
employed in our IT department so that is how I knew Arthur and I got on with Arthur.  So 
Arthur Kotzen at that stage had a small building company you know these building – 
bakkie brgades we call them.  So Gavin decided no he wanted to use Arthur Kotzen to 
build SeaArk. And I still commented I said, you know I do not know if it is such a good 
20 
idea because this guy has got two bakkies and a cement mixer.  I do not think – if you 
dong that kind of construction for R300 million you use somebody decent.  But there 
were numerous insurmountable issues with EIA’s at SeaArk at this stage.  So he 
deployed a whole lot of people from Bosasa down to SeaArk at Khuga to help build with 
that.  That included the architects and all that type of thing.  And he then bought the 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 55 of 138 
 
company for R15 million.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That is he bought Build All? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Build All.  So he bought Build All for R15 million.  So the 
transaction was concluded and the payment was made and why I mentioned that he 
bought it was because it was very important that he controlled Arthur Kotzen and Fred 
Allibone as well.  So one day I was actually driving in the car with Gavin – so every time 
we drove around I would drive the car and at that stage he had a Porsche Cayenne and 
I enjoyed driving the car because I could go fast with it and all that type of thing.  And 
on the car he was speaker phone with Arthur Kotzen.  And I knew it was Arthur Kotzen 
because it shows on the dial who you on the line with.  And he was just saying to him, 
10 
just listen here just go ahead and revamp the guy’s house, just do it.  And you know 
Arthur was saying ja but how do we cover it and he says just pay it, just sort it out.  
When I started asking questions on whose house they were revamping Gavin just said 
to me he said, listen stop your fishing alright and just focus on your driving.  It is an old 
friend that he is looking after.  Alright.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did you learn who this person was? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  It was a gentleman by the name Twabo Ndube. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is that the person mentioned in paragraph 
100? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct.  And it was something to do with the EIA’s and 
20 
SeaArk and his involvement and his association with the people down in Port Elizabeth. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did you find out what position was held by Mr 
Ndube? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I did a search I was curious and I did a search and I think it 
was the MEC – he was a MEC of sorts based in Port Elizabeth.   
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 56 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that name Twabo is that how it was not Thabo? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is how it was – that is how it was spelt on the – I 
remember the spelling. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the business card or something? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, no on the screen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the screen? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Of the cell phone thing of the car. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is how it was spelt.  Sorry that is not how it was spelt.  It 
is spelt like that I think I have got it on my cell phone that is how he spelt it because he 
10 
sent me the message number as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then you mention SeaArk and its potential 
uses for Bosasa in paragraph 102.   
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja I was told SeaArk when it was operational that this was an 
ideal model to be used to get international funding.  So at one stage we had the 
Chinese bank or somebody looking at it from China.  We had so many visitors to 
SeaArk it was unbelievable.  I was not there.  I was not – I had lost interest in this.  I did 
not want to get involved in it. But I was told – always told it was a game changer.  Every 
meeting we had this was a game changer and I am not involved with it because I am 
20 
obstropolous.  So it was a big bone of contention.  And … 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did you notice that payments were being 
made? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Through or from SeaArk? 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 57 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair there was an incident that kept occurring and it was R1 
million a month that was going out of the country to a company called SRI if I remember 
correctly.  It was – it is not – sorry it has just come to me now it is not Kevin Wills it is 
David K Wills, David Kevin Wills.  Sorry that is my mistake I just need to correct that on 
the thing.  It is David Kevin Wills.  That is a typing error.  Sorry Chair I just want to 
correct that.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us go back to the payments made offshore. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So these were… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Deal with that paragraph 102. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So there was a bulk payment that was made to the value of 
10 
about R35 million.  But then there was payments every single month of R700 000.00 to 
R1 million.  I cannot recall the exact amount it was.  It was not the exact R700 000,00 
or a R1 million it was an in between that.  It was R752 000,00 or something like that.  
That is why I have used 700.  And these payments would continuously go out and it 
was draining all the profits of the company.  Between the construction and these 
payments I mean it was ridiculous.  So I started making queries.  I started querying 
these things because I thought you know I have got a responsibility towards the people 
in the company and the company as well.  We cannot just be maverick with our money.  
And I was told, no, no Gavin owns 51% of SRI Shrimp something.- Resource. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What did you believe about the SRI? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   Did you have any view about SRI? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I – my opinion was that this was a scam because why would 
you want to invest in a company offshore and have to go through the rigmarole when at 
that stage South Africa was actually doing very well.  So you would rather get money in 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 58 of 138 
 
to run the project than push money out.  And it was a debate that I would have quite 
often. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright perhaps that is a matter for further 
investigation. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well I can tell you that I actually at one stage when everything 
went south and I then asked Brian Biebuyck to trace SRI and to go legally after SRI and 
see where the money is when we can get it back.  And I was told just leave it by Gavin 
Watson, just do not touch it, just leave it. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  In paragraph 103 you refer to… 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Requests made of Fred Allibone, Arthur 
Kotzen,  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  We had a conference. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Who made those requests? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  We had a conference if I can explain the background?  We 
had a conference at one of the resorts here in Magaliesburg I think it was Mount Grace 
Hotel with the whole company there and we had a conference and I was sitting having 
coffee with Arthur Kotzen and Fred Allibone and we were talking about fencing.  
Because he was tasked to put up a fence around Gavin Watson’s house the beta fence 
that we used.  And I remember Fred Allibone was sitting there and Arthur said to me 
20 
you must write that in the black book.  He said don’t forget to write something in the 
black book because Gavin had told him.  And I said well what – are you also keeping 
black books?  And Fred said to me, he said, ja that Gavin tasked him to write any 
expenses for Parliamentarians, politicians and that in their black book. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry just before you go on you mentioned 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 59 of 138 
 
Parliamentarians or politicians. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry, politicians. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Politicians.  In which area? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I cannot recall the area itself. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Where were Allibone and Kotzen active? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Oh they were in Port Elizabeth. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So where would these politicians be? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well they would be in Port Elizabeth. Well that is an 
assumption that they were for them. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and then paragraph 104 to 107 you deal 
10 
with  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  A direction to destroy evidence.  You have 
already told the Chair about that. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Is there anything new? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No Chair I am hoping that – the just one issue for the 
investigations team or the Hawks if they pick up on this.  There is a chap by the name 
Gerhard who is the son-in-law to Arthur Kotzen, the computers are with him and the 
records are with him. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Now this occurred and this was not made clear 
earlier during the time that the SIU were conducting search and seizure operations at 
Bosasa before 2010. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And at that time I understand that there was an 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 60 of 138 
 
instruction to collect the computers and to bury them at the SeaArk site.  Which 
computers are being referred to here? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Those are Danny Mansells’ computers for Grand 4 and L and 
J Civils. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And you have described the role that 
these companies played in relation to construction of houses and provision of other 
benefits? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  As an inter – as intermediary companies 
between the recipients of the benefits and Bosasa? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The instruction was given to collect those 
computers and to bury them at Khuga SeaArk site at Khuga? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes that was done. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  And I understand from your evidence 
that that was not actually ever done? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, no it was buried. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It was buried? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Then it was dug up.  Andries Van Tonder… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  [indistinct] it was buried and then there was a 
further instruction to excavate the computers and burn them. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right that was never done. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 61 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No it was excavated but it was kept – what happened was 
Andries Van Tonder Chair was told to go and oversee this project.  But Andries he was 
not interested much in [indistinct] as well I mean you know you got to go dig up things 
and go and burn them.  So Gavin would often say to a person, go and check up on 
somebody.  Go and – you go and you do this – you check that this person has got the 
computers out, they have dug them up and they have burnt them.  And you be there 
and you supervise it.  And Andries did not do it.  It is very difficult sometimes if – it is as 
if you know a Cardinal says to a – I should stop using that.  But if somebody says to 
your boss you know I want you – if you are reporting to a boss and you now go to the 
boss and you say, I have come to check up that you have done the work for the boss.  
10 
He is on the same level as you now it looks bad.  So you kind of do not do it you know.  
You tell Gavin yes we will do it, we will do it and then you just tell him no, it is all sorted 
out.  But the computers were never ever burnt.  They were stored in the garage of the 
son-in-law of Arthur Kotzen. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we will deal with the related incident about 
which you have given 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Some evidence.  Perhaps you will give more 
evidence after the short adjournment.  Is this a convenient time Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes before you do that I just want to get the name of the person with 
20 
whom you said the computers are? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  His name is Gerhard I do not have his surname unfortunately. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Gerhard. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He married the daughter of Arthur Kotzen and he was involved 
in the construction business at SeaArk.  Mr Fred Allibone will know exactly because 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 62 of 138 
 
they are related.  They are all inter-related. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes we will take the short adjournment and we will resume at 
half past eleven. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Agrizzi you spoke 
yesterday of a certain party recently going to Coega to excavate the SeaArk site to 
10 
apparently look for something presumably these computers? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second Mr Pretorius.  Thank you.  You may proceed. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It may be important because it may relate to 
the quality and nature of the investigations currently being conducted and you will talk 
about your own arrest in due course.  Are you prepared to tell the Chair what you know 
of who conducted this failed excavation? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I received a call and I think it was a message and I will 
have to check if it was a message or a call, but from a lady who was in Port Elizabeth 
20 
and I think the name was Angela Gillan I think if I am not mistaken.  So I know to 
search on my computer or on my cellphone later, but I received a call to say do you 
know about the Hawks digging up and excavating the whole beach front and I said to 
her look I cannot talk at this stage.  I do not want to discuss anything with anybody at 
this stage, but I thought it was apt to mention to the investigators that it is pointless they 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 63 of 138 
 
are going to try and dig up because apparently they excavate and they saw there was 
some different type of soil where they excavated and they, it looked like it had been 
re-excavated and it had been excavated before they re-excavated it.  So that is 
basically what was happening and. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The concern I had is that why not come and talk, why not just 
pick up the phone.  Phone me, I can give you all the information like I have done with 
the Commission.  If you want me to I will even fly down there, because even with the; I 
just want to add it in, even with Fred Allibone Andries van Tonder I asked him and we 
agreed that he flies down and goes and sees Fred Allibone to see if Fred Allibone will 
10 
give us the document, the black, the book that they had and information with regards to 
the politicians houses.  So we are trying to help like that and well he went down and 
then I received a message two days ago from Fred Allibone to say no, no the matter is 
sorted.  He has given all the stuff to his attorneys.  So that is, we got, but we are trying 
to help wherever we can. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  When would this failed excavation have taken 
place? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was about two/three weeks ago. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, again, but was your understanding that the book is still in 
20 
existence? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  We went to find out, but he was very elusive. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  When Andries van Tonder spoke to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 64 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It looked like he had been told not to meet with Andries. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  There are two separate issues. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That we should clarify. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Buried at some stage in the sea sand. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At SeaArk were computers? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is right.  Grande Four and Allan J Civils. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Those documents. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Those were then subsequently taken away and 
put in a garage as you said? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Notwithstanding that fact of which you knew 
and could have given assistance the Hawks went to excavate again on that same site? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well we were told it was the Hawks by this person from the 
Herald. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  That may be a subject for further 
20 
investigation. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The black book kept by Allibone that is a 
different document? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 65 of 138 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And that is the document that you say maybe 
with attorneys? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Then if we can move on then to 
paragraph 108 and there you deal with Kgwerano Fleet and [indistinct] dealings with 
Bosasa.  Please tell the Chair about that and you can follow the summary on pages 41 
and 42. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It would be sufficient. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Alright.  So Chair my dealings with the fleet management was 
10 
really, I was involved as the Operations guy but I was not too involved in the actual 
business, but what happened was it was a joint venture between a chap by the name of 
Brian Gwebu, Itu Moraba and WesBank at that stage that had the contract with a 
company called Kgwerano Financial Services which then provided fleet management 
for the SMS Fleets to Government on an RT62 I think it was called the contract and that 
basically managed 15 000 vehicles for Government. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  SMS is Senior Management Service? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So these would be vehicles driven by Senior 
Government Officials? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you say that there was a joint venture 
between a Mr Moraba and a Mr Gwebu in a vehicle called Kgwerano? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Not a vehicle. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 66 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  With a WesBank at this stage. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  An entity called Kgwerano? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  That eventually came into the hands of 
Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just explain that please. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That eventually Gavin Watson decided that he wanted to buy 
it and he bought the shares of Mr Moraba and Mr Gwebu.  I think he paid R20 million 
for the shares.  It was a very good contract and at one stage it was, the reason why we 
10 
had gone on an acquisition trail to buy other companies that were supposedly servicing 
that contract.  So we bought those companies and eventually we got rid of them again 
because they were not actually servicing that contract and it was all a big farce, but I 
was not part of RT62 at all for the provision of the fleet management, the tender itself.  
At that stage Gavin had employed two accountants one by the name of Vicus Slade 
and the other one was Alan Chapman and they were appointed to run the RT62 
contract as well as some other people as well, okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just to go back. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Because we have digressed a little there was a 
20 
tender. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is right. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Issued by Government. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  For the provision of fleet vehicles and 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 67 of 138 
 
management of fleet vehicles under the rubric of the National Department of Transport? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And these were vehicles for Senior 
Government Officials? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Or members of the SMS, Senior Management 
Service? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  People who were entitled to get the subsidised vehicles. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  Then if you go to paragraph 112 please. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I was told that the contract was awarded, the contract to 
10 
Bosasa it should be Kgwerano, had been prearranged and actually was unlawful.  I was 
openly told that.  This was told to me by Papa Leshabane.  At that stage Papa was not 
involved with Kgwerano but he had a major issue with Kgwerano.  At that stage he told 
me as well that they were paying a chap by the name of [indistinct].  I do not know if 
that is spelt right. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just for the record Kgwerano is spelt K-G-W-E-
R-A-N-O? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct.  So there is no confusion there was Kgwerano 
Financial Services and Kgwerano Fleet Management.  It was two different entities. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And we are talking hereof? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Kgwerano Financial Services, okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then tell the Chair please about the joint 
venture that was then created. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Can I just explain the involvement of Brian Gwebu and 
Itu Moraba?  Sorry. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 68 of 138 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes please do. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So Brian Gwebu and Itu Moraba, Alan Chapman, Vikus Slade 
they were responsible for Kgwerano.  I took no responsibility or accountability for 
Kgwerano whatsoever.  Only later on did we when we had to get rid of the other people 
and start running it properly ourselves otherwise we would have made major losses in 
the company.  So at a later stage there was another new joint venture and that was 
called Phavis World which was basically for dignitaries like yourself when you go to 
Cape Town and you need to hire a vehicle.  It had to go through Phavis World.  That is 
what. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  P-H-A-V-I-S? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  W-O-R-L-D? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct, yes.  So it was a joint venture with Avis Fleet and 
Kgwerano, not Bosasa.  Well you know Kgwerano/Bosasa was the same company.  It 
really, they were interlinked.  So this entity Phavis World was also awarded the fleet 
services tender to provide the rental vehicles to Avis dealership to deal with ministerial 
and people such as yourself that needed a hired vehicle whenever you flew around.  I 
was not involved with the process right in the beginning, but I started realising that this 
joint venture was not working out and it was actually costing us as a company at that 
stage and when I refer to us I am putting myself back in that time period.  It was costing 
20 
the company money.  They were not collecting on time all that.  So my suggestion was 
that as a company we exit out of this transaction, because it was a waste of time.  So 
Gavin instructed me then to go and see Avis, a Mr Clive Els who I met then for the first 
time and requested that Bosasa be released from this joint venture.  Alan Chapman had 
just left the employ of the joint venture and of Bosasa and of Kgwerano and 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 69 of 138 
 
Brian Gwebu and Itu Moraba had left as well.  So they were not there anymore.  So I 
was told once again to go with Papa Leshabane and enter into discussions with 
Clive Els at Avis and a few meetings ensued.  We held them at the Avis Offices.  It is 
near Kempton Park and at a later stage a payment was made by Avis in excess of 
R23.5 million and the agreement was that this was supposedly the share, the Bosasa 
share in the joint venture, but the value of the shares were not that, because Avis had 
used another entity to make the profits in.  So there was no profits in that company 
anyway.  It was just liabilities. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry, just pause there. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us summarise if we may. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Before we go on.  There was a joint venture 
between Avis and Kgwerano? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is, well Phavis World was the joint venture, yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the joint venture was called Phavis World? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is right. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Kgwerano was linked to Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right. In essence they were one and the 
20 
same? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  My point exactly. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The purpose of this joint venture was to 
provide rental vehicles to ministerial and Senior Government Officials? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 70 of 138 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It was unsuccessful? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You are 100 percent right. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You were then ordered to dissolve this joint 
venture.  Is that correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Or to allow Avis to buy Bosasa out? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and then you deal with the terms of the 
buyout and how that occurred in paragraph 117. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well Avis agreed to it.  Clive Els agreed to it.  There was a 
10 
lady by the name of Jacky who was there as well in the meeting.  Sesinyi Seopela was 
in the meeting.  Papa Leshabane was in the meeting and the agreement was very clear 
yes we will pay you R23.5 million, but we want you guys to make sure that this contract 
gets extended. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Who said that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Clive Els. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  So Avis said yes we will buy you, 
Bosasa, out of this? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Joint venture. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But we, Avis, want you to ensure that the 
contract is extended? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The Government is extended? 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 71 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  What was the value of in your 
estimation or to your knowledge of the Bosasa share in this joint venture? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is very difficult to give a value on it, but the value I would say 
at maximum, good will and everything was about maybe 18/R19 million if that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Let us approach it another way.  What 
was the amount paid by Avis for the Bosasa share in the joint venture? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  About R23.5 million.  I remember the amount because they 
would only release the cheque once they had got the extension letter from the 
Department of Transport. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And what was that amount of R23.5 million 
intended to cover? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That would cover Bosasa shareholding or whatever 
arrangement there was.  As I said I was not integrally involved in the set up but I was 
involved in the dissolving of it.  What it covered was Bosasa’s contributions as a 
shareholder and there was an amount that was kept separate that would be used by 
Seopela and Leshabane to make sure that they get the extension. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So to answer your question there was an amount set aside for 
gratification. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In order to ensure the extension of the 
contract? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And was the contract extended? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes it was. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 72 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why to Avis’ knowledge as far as you know was it important for them 
to ask Bosasa to see to the extension of the contract when Bosasa was pulling out and 
why would they not think that they could get the extension themselves? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Because Chair the influence that Bosasa had with 
Government was very high. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that know to Avis at the time as well? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Most definitely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 118 and following, you deal with 
certain further information regarding Ms Dudu Myeni.  Could you tell the Chair about 
10 
that please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I thought that it might be apt to add in some extra clarity points 
and one of my notices is that I first met Dudu Myeni at the Sheraton Hotel.  I was well 
aware of the fact at all times that Gavin Watson had committed to paying the R300 000 
in cash to Myeni for onward payment to “The Jacob Zuma Foundation”.  I mentioned 
earlier that I cannot understand why a foundation would receive cash.  It is very risky, 
but it had to be cash.  I am not aware of any time that it was paid in a cheque, but on 
occasions I would even have to pack the money and prepare it.  This time Dudu Myeni 
was the Chair of the Jacob Zuma Foundation and then Chair I want to bring to the point 
that subsequent to my testimony Dudu Myeni made a statement on the eNCA. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  This is your testimony in January? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Regarding meetings held at the Bosasa Offices and stated 
that she has only ever attended one official visit which was the visit of President Zuma 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 73 of 138 
 
at the stage to SeaArk and where he spent four hours on the Bosasa Campus with 
Gavin Watson and the rest of the directorate.  This is not true.  There were meetings 
held on a few occasions at the Bosasa Offices.  One such meeting was regarding a 
fracking transaction. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You have testified about that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In January? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct.  So there are two meetings and a further meeting 
took place after a meeting held in the conference venue.  So the meeting, the third 
meeting, took place not at the offices, but I was called to a meeting held at the 
10 
Intercontinental, I think it is the Sheraton Hotel at O R Tambo Airport.  A meeting took 
place there in a conference venue.  In a room where they have a conference layout.  
There were snacks and everything provided to us.  When we met she had arranged the 
meeting where we were going to meet with the then CEO Nico Bezuidenhout of SAA.  
At the meeting what was discussed; pre the meeting was a tender that had gone in for 
security services and she also wanted to look at the opportunity of taking over that 
security contract as well as the catering contracts for South African Airways.  Now just 
to give you some [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So all in all that is about how many meetings at different venues/ 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So it was, four meetings. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Four meetings? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which you attended? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 74 of 138 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then you recall. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  If I can give the Chair a little bit of information to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The catering contract and the. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Security contract, I realise this was going south.  It was not 
going a good way and I painted a picture to Gavin Watson that I do not even want to 
look at it, because I said to him there is no money in it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Alright.  I said there is just, there is no money in it.  Let us 
10 
rather leave it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And funny enough he agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what was your real reason?  I understand that was not your real 
reason. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair it was not the real reason.  The real reason was I 
wanted to stay as far away as I could from SAA and Dudu Myeni. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And the foundation and all that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:   
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was; we would get ourselves, personally I did not want to 
get involved in it.  I just did not want to touch it. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 75 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I did not say that to Gavin.  I just said to him to look it is not a 
feasible contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Deal with the incident in paragraph 121 please. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Alright.  In August 2016 my wife and I were on route from O R 
Tambo on an SAA flight to King Shaka Airport.  I think it is King Shaka in KZN.  We 
were going on a bit of a break.  I had resigned and my phone had been off and I was 
just taking a break.  There were two old people who I look after in KZN and I said to my 
wife let us go down and see them and take a break for three/four days.  I am away from 
10 
everybody.  Let the fresh air of the sea clear my mind.  So I was seated and I remember 
as you walk into the aircraft on the left hand side you get row one then you get row two 
and we were seated in row two on seats I think it is D, E and F.  Alight, so there was a 
space between myself and my wife and the next minute Dudu Myeni walked in and she 
sat in row one right next to the window.  I was also seated next to the window and she 
turned around and she. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So immediately behind her? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  She saw me when she walked in.  She recognised me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but in terms of seating. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am saying you were seated immediately behind her? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Directly behind her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay and she turned around and greeted me and my wife.  I 
introduced her.  I said this is my wife, but I was very aloof.  You know, already now I 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 76 of 138 
 
thought now this is a conspiracy plan, because I am in the plane and I have just 
resigned how come this is happening.  So I did not want to say anything or do anything, 
you know, because I did not want also I do not want to talk negative but I was aloof with 
her and then she asked me straight out, she asked me what is wrong with you.  I said 
no, look I do not want to talk.  She did not know I had resigned and then I said to her I 
said you know I have resigned.  She asked me how Gavin Watson is.  I said I do not 
know I have resigned.  So perhaps that is what she is referring to.  So that was the fifth 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just for the record Chair I am told that the 
10 
evidence in the first statement of Mr Agrizzi regarding Ms Myeni is dealt with in 
paragraphs 41 and 42 of that statement.  Can we then go onto paragraph 122 where 
you deal with matters relating to Gavin Watson? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair to the best of my recollection these are some of the 
occasions when I was personally present when there were bribes witnessed, taking 
place, gratification taking place with various members of the ruling party and various 
departments within the Government.  He always made it clear to me that the 
connections that were made were to ensure constant flow of tenders and business that 
would benefit Bosasa and the contracts would come and Gavin was Bosasa.  He was, I 
mean the pinnacle.  He was the man.  He was Bosasa.  Every single newsletter you 
20 
opened up, it was Gavin.  Every single email that you received from Truth Online or 
WhatsOnline it was the brand, it was Gavin.  Not anybody but all Gavin.  So he had 
over the years built up these connections with the various ANC politicians and the main 
decision makers relating to the awarding of these tenders to Bosasa.  He had the 
contacts.  He had the people.  He was the Godfather as they called him.  Even his 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 77 of 138 
 
nephews called him the Godfather.  He was the Godfather of Bosasa.  Everything went 
through him.  He made decisions on everything.  What amounts were paid out, he 
controlled the cash.  Gavin himself decided on the decisions on who would get what.  
Even in salaries and wages, he would decide who would get what.  He would like 
somebody who was working in a kitchen and say no, no that guy must get an increase 
or he must get R1 000 extra.  He just did it.  So he made those decisions. He made the 
decisions on firing people.  There are many times I had to fire people that I did not feel 
comfortable, but he had made the decision.  Sometimes I would just transfer the person 
from head office to somewhere else so he did not know, because I did not have 
grounds to fire the person.  I also wish to state further there are some of the occasions 
10 
when I was personally present when the corruption took place within various members 
of the, it is a duplication sorry.  There is a duplication sorry.  I will just carry, I will just 
talk.  During my employment throughout all the years Gavin was in control and he acted 
in concert with the fellow Directors.  So the Directors we had were his people.  They 
basically, everything Gavin said went.  They always said yes.  If there was one person 
who used to argue and debate and everybody will tell you that if you ask them and they 
come and give testimony ask them who would debate.  It would be me.  I would often 
engage in debates.  When it came to dealing with people, when it came to how you 
handle people I would debate to a point, but I knew that I was cutting it very fine and I 
had to always maintain that respect level otherwise I would fall short, but I could debate 
20 
to a point. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You make comments of a general nature in 
paragraph 123.  Much of it is a summary of what you have said before in your evidence 
both in January and yesterday and today. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 78 of 138 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You deal in more detail with specific incidents 
at paragraph 124 and following.  Are you happy to go there or do you wish to say more 
before you get to paragraph 124? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I just want to mention one thing and one of the things are 
prepayments of contracts.  So that is one thing that Gavin has to guard against, 
because if we take some of the contracts that we did by having these gratifications you 
get paid up front hundreds of thousands, hundreds of millions of Rand.  One of them 
was Phezulu Fencing where I think without delivering anything we had been paid R500 
million and it is still happening in Government today.  So it is a concern I just want to 
raise that you know one needs to be very careful about that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would the contracts have provided for that kind of prepayment 
normally? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair there is no reason why a contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Should provide for prepayment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And if it was provided for it was always because somebody 
said. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Intervenes]. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Listen by the way we will organise a prepayment. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  This is what you need to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, but normally to your understanding.  It would not be provided for 
in any contract.  It would be arrangements that were made outside of the contract? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Normally, unless special arrangements were made. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 79 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  With the person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And whenever there is prepayments you know there is 
something fishy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say you know that to the extent that Bosasa may still be 
having contracts with Government departments you say those prepayments have not 
stopped? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I can talk about two occasions.  One is Phezulu one is 
Sondolo three, one is one of the youth centres where they did prepayments. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, before any delivery was. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Effected, ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Would you deal with the incidents in paragraph 
124 and following please Mr Agrizzi? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair the first time I was privy to seeing cash being paid 
directly to Mti was when I attended the first visit to Mti’s house and it is in a complex 
20 
called Savannah Hills 101.  I remember that, because you would have to tell security 
where you were going where Gavin paid him openly in front of me.  It was not a secret.  
He just did it in front of me and I remember vividly if you walk through the house you 
always walk through the garage.  There was a study on the right hand side.  We went 
into the study.  The study had a sliding side with a curtain.  You move the curtain, the 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 80 of 138 
 
safe was there and he would open up the safe with a key.  It was a key safe not 
electronic and he would pack the money in there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What was the amount on that occasion? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  R65 000. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  R65 000 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  65 000, right and paragraph 125 you testify 
further as to factual evidence. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.  There was a second occasion that I saw it which was 
10 
when we met him in the restaurant called, now I am not too sure because I do not 
normally go to this restaurant.  It was either Codfather or Godfather, but it in Rivonia.  It 
is just off Rivonia Road.  You turn on left.  I was told to take, to meet Gavin there and 
you know we were there and we walked in and Mti was there and Gavin says no, I 
usually come here and this is where I meet with Mti and we had lunch.  They had had, if 
I recall they had had lunch already and I just had a snack when I got there and I 
remember that they vividly, because when we were at the restaurant they were still 
doing renovations or they were busy working on renovations there and at the same time 
and it is not in my statement, but I was told to make a phone call.  So the investigators 
would be able to check my old records.  I was told to make a phone call to a certain 
20 
gentleman who I would call and it was because he had made statements about Bosasa 
that had been reported to Gavin Watson and upset Gavin and he told me immediately 
when I got there, phone this person tell him to stop his nonsense, so I know the person 
and I will give the records to the investigators, to corroborate the information I’m giving 
you. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 81 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But basically it was I can’t remember the exact day, but on 
that – it was a Friday afternoon he didn’t have a uniform on and his car, which was a 
greyish metallic car (indistinct) was parked down – on the outside of the restaurant on 
the road and Watson’s car was parked on the other side and while they were saying 
goodbye and that he opened his boot remotely…(intervention) 
CHAIRPERSON:  He being? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Mti. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He opened his boot remotely and Gavin then took his 
10 
briefcase out of his car’s boot and he walked to the car and he – I remember he lifted 
up a brown satchel that had, like a crocodile print on it, it was normal, like a briefcase 
satchel, brown one with a crocodile type print on it and Gavin took the money out of his 
bag and put it into his back and then closed Mti’s Touareg boot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this time it wasn’t a security bag that was used? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No it was a security bag. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was a security bag. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja it was a full security bag, it was bigger than normal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, do you estimate that the amount…(intervention) 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I estimated it because it was close proximity, I estimated it at 
20 
about 150. 
CHAIRPERSON:  R150 000. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  R150 000 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:   But it was eye opening to me because it was done in broad 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 82 of 138 
 
daylight.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And then at paragraph 127 you talk about 
activities in Gavin Watson’s vault. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Thee were occasions where Gavin would call me to his vault 
when he was packing the cash, very similar to what you saw on the video but he would 
specifically count out the amounts for Mti and others and say to me to keep it with me 
till the morning.  So he would give it to me, I would have to the lock it in the boot of my 
car and the next morning I knew I would have to meet him at seven thirty or 7 o’clock at 
the gates of Savanna Hills which was the complex where Mti was and I would always- 
10 
well I would always be there early and he would arrive and then I would drive through 
the gate with him.  So when we arrived at his house, I mean, this is how flippant it was, 
the one garage door would be open and you would walk through the garage door, there 
was always golf equipment and shoes and everything on the side, walk through the 
door and you’d go to the study and we would just wait there and then he would come 
down.  There was a lady, a domestic that he had there all the years called, Vuyi, I even 
know her name, Vuyelwa was the domestic’s name and she would bring us a tray with 
some coffee cups and coffee and hot water and that’s how it happened and then every 
time I’d have to take the bag out of the boot of the car and then go through and he 
would put the bag on his desk, he would unpack it and he was – and it would be packed 
20 
in the safe. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Before you go on to paragraph 130 the Chair 
will recall that video played of Gavin Watson and others in his vault where cash 
appeared to have been packed out.  Was that, to you knowledge, a regular occurrence 
or a once-off occurrence? 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 83 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No these were monthly occurrences.  I just want to add 
something you know I recall now, this must have been about 2010 because it was with 
the 2010 world games and I still remember he had a lot of memorabilia there and I said 
to him, come on give me some of your memorabilia, so he gave me a set of coins that 
were minted, I don’t think the value is much but just so that I declared it now.  So I 
remember it was about 2010…(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Who gave you these coins? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Mti. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Do you still have them? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No I gave them away, I thought they were gold they weren’t. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    Paragraph 130 would you just deal briefly 
with it. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So Mti was an avid golfer he would always spend time on the 
golf course – I did I thought they were gold Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Laughter) 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry I detracted there, so Mti was an avid golfer and he 
would – he’d love his golf he was always on the golf course he always was with people 
and he played golf with some of the people in corrections and, you know, things start 
coming back now to me but I remember walking in one morning and Gavin says to me, 
he says, all this I paid for all the golf clubs and he said look here’s even a special one 
20 
that was made specifically for him.  Now I’m not a golfer but I believe he had to go to 
the pro shop and they have like a bespoke section where they make golf clubs as well 
and you practice and he explained the whole thing to me and they made it according to 
him as well.  So that I recall that all the golf clubs had been bought and as I said to the 
investigators an easy analysis is to take an analysis of all the credit cards of Gavin 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 84 of 138 
 
Watson, he’s not a golfer and you’ll see the golf clubs have been paid by Bosasa all the 
credit cards that he owns are credit cards paid for by Bosasa, so Bosasa would have 
reflected with making payments for the golf clubs but there were various other incidents 
Chair.  There was once incident where there’s a clothing shop in Sandton, I’m not going 
to mention the names well it’s up to the advocate if I must…(intervention) 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It’s in your statement as public knowledge. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:   So there’s a – I was taken to a shop and I was told there’s 
account here, just get them paid please and it’s a little shop called Greys in Sandton 
City and I remember it vividly because you go up the escalator coming from the square 
side – I don’t shop there personally but you go up the escalator and it’s on the left-hand 
10 
or the right-hand side, one of the two, it’s a bit confusing but I remember going into the 
shop and having to get the slips and then having to get them paid and there’s a short 
Xhosa speaking man there that he only dealt with the Watson’s and with Mti and I 
remember one day as well just going in there and I thought let me have a look and buy 
a pair of – I actually was going in there, sorry, to buy a shirt for Gavin Watson for his 
birthday present from the company and I walked in there and the short gentleman said 
to me, oh by the way when is Mti coming back because there’s a sports jacket which I 
altered for him, a Boss sports jacket.  So if the investigators go there, they will pick up 
all these records and Gavin Watson’s size – Mti is my size so you’d be able to 
differentiate on the sizes bought.  There was another incident where I went – I was 
20 
down in December, I used to go look at – visit the old people down there and I was – I 
got a call from Mti which was strange that I got the call in December and I thought, ag 
Gavin must have his phone off so he asked me where I was and I said, no I’m in 
Umhlanga and at that stage I was at the shopping centre at Umhlanga I was having, I 
think a lunch or something with my family and he says oh meet me I’ve just found a 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 85 of 138 
 
nice shop here in Umhlanga and it was up the road.  So I said alright well – I wasn’t 
about to debate or not and he went to specifically a rescue shop.  It’s a shoe shop that 
imports Italian shoes, and I know the shop because I, once or twice have been in the 
shop and I’ve spoken to the lady there and it’s got a nice heritage because they make 
shoes for the Pope.  So that’s why I went in there and, you know, I bought one or two 
pairs for myself but they’re very expensive shoes and he’d found two pairs of shoes 
that he really liked and I phoned Gavin – I walked outside quickly and phoned Gavin 
and he said sort it out and it was R19 000 for the two pairs of shoes and I paid for it and 
– well my credit card wouldn’t take any more so that was maxed out then he just said 
use your Bosasa credit card and just pay for it.    
10 
So you’ll see these type of things on my credit card slips.  Then unfortunately 
my statement doesn’t run chronologically but I see there when – ja this is important 
because when Mti resigned from Correctional services Gavin Watson – I was sitting 
with Doc Smith at the time, Gavin Watson came in and he said he’s just gone through 
Mti’s new employment contract the 2010 FIFA World organising committee and he 
wanted Doc to have a look at it, he was very proud of the matter and a few weeks later 
then Sondolo IT was appointed…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry Mr Agrizzi, my recollection from either your previous 
evidence of the evidence of other witnesses – I think your evidence, my recollection is 
that you said Mti left Correctional Services, I think end of 2007. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I think it was 2007/2008. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the world cup was in 2010. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in the light of that, I wonder if that first sentence is correct to say 
when Mti resigned as the Commissioner of the Department of Correctional Services, 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 86 of 138 
 
you recall Gavin Watson coming to me to say he had just gone through Mti’s new 
employment contract with the 2010 FIFA organising committee. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I remember it was before the 2010 world cup because 
he was appointed into the organising committee. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh much earlier? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes and I’ll tell you why I know that for a fact is because I 
assisted him drafting the security plan for the world cup. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because the organising committee of course existed much earlier. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And I remember it because I had to – I was called to a 
meeting where I had to draft the security plan for the world cup with Mti and I – he still 
complimented me because he got a standing ovation in Switzerland, I think where he 
presented it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and who go the standing ovation? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Mti got it, I did the work, I did all the paperwork, I had to do it, I 
was instructed to do it by Gavin, so I did the presentation for him and the – I still might 
have a copy of it.  So a few weeks later after this appointment, then Sondolo IT was 
appointed to set up the bi-metric and access control systems for the organising 
committee offices.  So I remember because it was a problem a minute, there was no 
20 
tender or anything like that but it was a major problem because I remember that we had 
a major – Danny Jordaan would have to go and get in and his bi-metrics wouldn’t 
always work so there was a constant running up and down to sort it out so I remember 
it vividly as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Wasn’t Mr Mti’s involvement with the world cup organising committee 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 87 of 138 
 
on the basis of him being employed as such or was he bringing in a business that he 
was going to get some business – I don’t have the tenders but – or you don’t know? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I think the pressure was too much in the press and with the 
SIU report had come out in 2009 that maybe that was the intention, I don’t know but 
there was no – he was working for them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So he was working for Danny Jordaan. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And then after 2010 Mti had one meeting with Gavin Watson, 
myself was very concerned because of the SIU reports and he had to show some sort 
10 
of income into his bank accounts.  So – and this Chair is where this whole thing goes 
really bad because now, like with my son, now I’ve got to involve my brother.  So Gavin 
Watson says to me, oh but your brother’s got a business you must put Mti there. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What was Mti’s request? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well his request was that he gets employed by a company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was he out of the organising committee…(intervention). 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes he had just left the organising committee, it was about six 
month, eight months, so it was 2011 probably. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay oh so after the world cup? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So I was duped into this thing and I took him to my brother 
and my brother is – literally we raised - I raised him, my parents died when we were 
very young so – he stayed with me and went through schooling and that.  So the 
problem is that now I was kind of in a stick because I’m going to try and please the two 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 88 of 138 
 
gentlemen here and I’ve got to – and I know my brother is not going to be happy with 
me because he’s straight down the line and he’s going to be upset.  So Mti went and 
had a look at the place and I took him there I said, well…(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:    This is your brother’s place? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes it’s a small – at that stage it was a small business he 
started with a bit of help from me, well he actually started by himself and then I helped 
him grow it and it was a small business in the manufacturing – and he wasn’t happy 
with me at all and Mti just said, no, no I want to buy a part of this business and he wrote 
out two cheques to make it look authentic and Gavin was on my back to say here you 
must help him out you know and your brother needs BEE to grow and all this and my 
10 
brother wasn’t interested, I don’t even know if he cashed the cheques, I don’t think he 
did but Gavin was very concerned that he had to keep Mti (indistinct) him all these 
people content because the SIU report had come out and everybody was very jittery 
and they knew – and Gavin knew that if Mti and Gillingham turn on him then – I mean I 
could turn on him he wasn’t worried about me turning but if Mti and Gillingham turned 
on him then he would be caught out as the main architect of everything.  So he was 
very pressurised to keep them happy and content so he would do anything to make 
them happy.  So at a later stage then I had to arrange a meeting with Mti and the 
attorney to reassure Mti that the process was under control and that he would be 
protected. So it was at that specific meeting that Mti explained as well, to the attorney 
20 
Brian Biebuyck that he was told by Nomgcobo Jiba to do a letter regarding the 
representation regarding the accused and why prosecution should not take place.  So if 
you recall that letter that I had the document and handwritten notes I had made copies 
of that and given the originals to him – to Brian Biebuyck and he then sat in that 
meeting and explained the set-up of how this thing must happen to Brian Biebuyck and 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 89 of 138 
 
based on that a letter was drafted.  Now I’m trying to get a copy of the letter as well that 
was drafted and that was after consultation but it was at that specific meeting as well 
that Mti said he had met with the lady and that’s what happened.  So a further meeting 
then took place which was – Gavin insisted on it, my brother’s new premises because 
he had moved premises he had grown and I had helped him get another premises 
which was attended by Gavin Watson and Mti as well as myself and where Gavin tried 
to coerce my brother into taking on Richmond Mti again but my brother, understanding 
the predicament I was in, I was sitting there, I had this looming case where I’m 
mentioned as the CEO in the SIU report and my brother knew about it because we’re 
open with each other and he just skirted the issue until we left and then I’ve made other 
10 
testimony in the previous affidavit, I think, where I state that a payment needed to go to 
Mti but it had to go through my brother’s company and after one or two he said that’s it, 
he’s not doing this anymore for nobody, not even for me. 
 
I testified already regarding the documents I received from the MPA and I 
handed those with the handwritten note, the originals to Brian Biebuyck.  Brian 
Biebuyck then sought advice on the matter, Brian then produced a lengthy document 
addressed to the NDPP it was dated the 28th of September 2010.  I recall that 
date…(intervention). 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  NDDP should be NDPP? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ag sorry. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  No just for the record. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry my apologies. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Carry on. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  This information, this representation made was pursuant to the 
meeting with Mti – sorry Chair am I talking loud enough? 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 90 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I can hear you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay, no I was just told that I’m not talking loud enough, so 
this document was pursuant to the meeting with Brian Biebuyck and pursuant to them 
getting the documents from advocate Jiba that Richmond Mti had provided that and 
advocate Jiba, in the meeting he had with Jackie Lapinka who was the secretary of 
advocate Lawrence Mrewbi who was the head of the special commercial crimes unit 
and it was basically, on that premise that I was constantly reminded that there’s no 
purpose in me whistleblowing by Brian Biebuyck, I would be told, if you want to go 
through that route my boy, you’re going to get nowhere and I was constantly, every day 
I met and I mentioned it, I was reminded that, don’t even think of it there’s no protection 
10 
for you.  So there were several meetings also conducted with Gavin and Valence 
Watson, sometimes with Ronnie Watson as well and Kevin Wakeford as well where I 
was basically told – and this was at the 2009/2010 period 2011, where I was basically 
told – so there were meetings held where I was told, listen, this is a pact, you break that 
pact you’re on your own and we’ll deal with you and that’s probably why I’m getting 
threats at the moment but the fact is these meetings did take place and I can recall on 
two occasions at the Michael Angelo, that was the favourite spot at one stage, next to 
Piccolo Mondo restaurant, there’s a lounge area with a water – with the fish in it and the 
meetings would take place there and I remember one occasion there was that pastor 
Benny Hinn was having a big conference here, so those are the timelines that I can 
20 
refer to and on another occasion Morgan Freeman was in the country and he was 
staying there as well I think – well he was there and he was acting in a role of a movie 
that they were making but I remember those vividly and those meetings, we were told, 
listen if you do not stick to this story we are telling you now we’ll sort you out and it 
concerned me, that’s why I stuck.  There was also numerous meeting that were taking 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 91 of 138 
 
place that would take place at the residence of Mr Valence Watson, he was living up 
here, I don’t know why he had a house here in Morningside with his sons and 
occasionally Kevin Wakeford would be called into those meetings as well.  Kevin was 
always seen as a strategist of the Watsons.   
Sometimes I’d get a call to say, meet us at Tasha’s in Morningside.  If you go 
to Tasha’s there they had their own table there, I suppose it was their table, right on the 
end on the left-hand side towards the back and I would have to have breakfast with 
them there.  On occasions Sesinyi Seopela would be there as well and the reason he 
was there, he knew the Watsons well, he knew Valence Watson he went to gym with 
the kids it even got to the stage where Gavin would buy him supplements and gym stuff 
10 
and all that – all the vitamins and powders and all that stuff that they drink when they 
got to gym, I wouldn’t know as you can see. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Agrizzi much of the evidence in paragraph 
144 to 149 has already been touched on by you, either in your evidence in January or 
yesterday and today, is there anything in those paragraphs you would like to emphasise 
before we move on to paragraph 150? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The one thing I think that’s important is that myself, Andries 
van Tonder, Frans Voster and even Carlos Bonefacio we warned – not so much Carlos 
that Gavin Watson had seen a photo of the dockets that it was pursuant to the meeting 
he had with the ex-President Zuma at Nkandla and with Joe Gumede and the 
20 
discussions that Joe Gumede had, had with the Hawks, I just want to re-emphasise that 
and he said he’s name is not on there and you better tow the line or else you’re on your 
own and that’s what’s happened – sorry advocate Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Perhaps you should just mention the roles that 
had been allocated to various persons in terms of what you’ve referred to as the 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 92 of 138 
 
Watson pact paragraph 149. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So this pact Chair was started and there were roles defined, 
so Gavin defined the roles, he would handle anything political we were not to get 
involved with it, he would caucus he would work with Sesinyi Seopela and Richmond 
Mti and that’s how they would Caucus it because Seopela is very influential in the MPA 
and the Hawks and all that, so they would work that.  In terms of the finances, getting 
bonds, getting any – dealing with the banks, Andries van Tonder was responsible for 
that but one thing that Gavin insisted on is that when you go and see FNB who was the 
bankers, if you go and see them, because they would always raise queries, you take 
Kevin with you and you play this as a political attack on a BEE company and Kevin was 
10 
a master at doing that, I mean, he had written all these books and he’s a very intelligent 
man so when he came into the meeting, the banks sat and listened.  So that would 
often secure their confidence in the process whenever there was negativity and of 
course when he wrote the book, The Assault on the Rand, everybody sits up and listens 
when the man walks into the room.  I would have to deal with the – make sure the 
operational business runs well so that no one can ever say we did a bad thing 
operationally so the business itself had to run well, the food had to be good, security 
service had to be good and all that but I also had to deal with the legal aspects, he did 
not want anybody else dealing with the – he didn’t actually want his family knowing 
about it.  At that stage Sonja Jonker was the attorney and she was best suited to 
20 
handle the legal – he said no, you handle it I want you to deal with Brian Biebuyck 
directly and you handle all legal aspects with Brian Biebuyck and you report back to me 
on it.  So that was the pact, my responsibilities as well was to make sure that Patrick 
Gillingham didn’t jump ship and to make sure that Danny Mansell was kept happy 
overseas, that was given to me, I was told to do that. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 93 of 138 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You may have dealt with it before, in fact I think 
you have, at least to some extent, but please deal with the evidence in paragraph 146. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  146, sorry advocate? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Paragraph 146. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  This is – whatever happened Chair, Gavin Watson would 
always – he wouldn’t sign anything, so he never had an office he used to sit a lot in my 
office and Andries’ office and he would sit in, I think Colleen Basonna’s office, 
sometimes later on when he didn’t trust us anymore but he wouldn’t have a secretary, 
there was no secretary, Gavin Watson would not sign anything, nothing, nothing would 
have his signature on, so he used to remind us, he used to say to us, you know chaps, 
10 
remember my signature appears nowhere, my name appears nowhere and he’d say – 
and this is what upset Andries van Tonder immensely that he refused to go to these 
prayer meetings.  One morning he would say, he said you know, man if they arrest us 
we would be like Paul and Silas praising the Lord in prison, and I used to say to him, ja 
Paul and Silas okay but Paul and Silas and 48 others is where the problem is.  So he 
thought it was a joke, he actually thought this whole thing would just not happen and he 
was oblivious to it, he said, I’ve got everything under control, I’m not worried. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The extract concerning Paul and Silas you 
would have been aware of the context in which that statement was made by Gavin 
Watson? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja I was reminded. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And when he said that you would be in prison 
together what did he mean. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He said that you would praise the Lord, sing and then what 
happened to Paul and Silas is when they started singing and praising the Lord the 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 94 of 138 
 
chains fell off and the walls fell – the doors opened isn’t it? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I’ll trust to your knowledge the… 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I’m a good Catholic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Mr Agrizzi I’ve heard from different witnesses, including yourself 
that Mr Gavin Watson did not have an office, did not have a secretary, whenever he 
was or he had to be at Bosasa, whose office did he use, how did he handle the 
situation of not having an office? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  He didn’t like paper, he once told me that some ANC stalwart 
had taught him to remember everything, Chris Hani told him to remember everything.  
Now I don’t know if it’s true or not but he said don’t write anything down you must 
10 
remember everything and he just didn’t have an office, I mean, he would sit in my 
office, the only paper he had was the newspaper that he would read and he would sit in 
my office and people would come in and out of my office all the time and meet with him 
there or he would sit in the boardroom and people would go and meet with him there or 
he would have lunches and that type of thing, that’s how he operated he didn’t have an 
office and he was proud of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – if I recall correctly he was the CEO isn’t it? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would suggest to me that he would be spending a lot of time in 
the company, in the premises. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well he spent time at the premises but normally at about 
eleven o’clock he would go out to his meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So he would – he would go to meetings while I was there.  He 
would go to meetings or he would walk around and go and sit in someone else’s office 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 95 of 138 
 
and that type of thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But there was an executive wing at Bosasa that was access 
controlled and that was where he would spend his time, in there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And that was like what in a boardroom? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Like some empty office? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes he would sit in a – there was no empty offices but he 
would sit in the boardroom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Or he would come and sit in my office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Or he would sit in Andries Van Tonder’s office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  When Tony Perry was there he would sit in Tony Perry’s office 
quite a lot. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You deal in paragraph 150 and following Mr 
Agrizzi with… 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  With circumstances related to Papa 
Leshabane. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Please go through that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Papa Leshabane had various roles in the Bosasa Group.  He 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 96 of 138 
 
was the spokesperson for Bosasa.  He was the one who had to deal with political 
issues and news issues and things that come up but he was also the head of Human 
Resources.  So he had to look after Human Resources.  He was also the head of 
Karano and Lindela and he was also responsible for marketing.  So they had started 
becoming very secretive of the alliances that they had built up.  You see Chair what 
happened was I started showing my feelings in 2013 really and they started to become 
very secretive over who they dealing with and who they speaking to.  But sometimes 
they would let slip and sometimes they would be open about it.  And I remember with 
me asking questions they did not like that.  So they started retracting all the information 
away and they would deal with Gavin.  You would suddenly find that they had been in 
10 
the boardroom with Gavin.  They would come out and I would get an instruction.  So 
that type of thing would happen.  They did not like the fact that – that I was questioning 
where all this cash was going.  So some of them even one being Papa Leshabane 
would go to Gavin directly and just say no I am not dealing with Angelo, I do not trust 
him.  And there was open you know there was contempt as I can put it.  Not only from 
his side from my side as well because often I would be annoyed because we would get 
requests to pay hundreds of thousands of rands out for functions from the directors.  I 
mean I recall even at one stage the company was battling and we did not have money. 
We telling staff you cannot fly to go to a site you have to drive there to Durban instead 
of flying but then he was splashing out on Jazz festivals because he was inviting 
20 
politicians and people to Jazz festivals and booking out boxes and that type of thing.  
And they were annoyed with me because at one stage I stopped the company from 
buying boxes at the sports stadiums.  We had a box in every single sports stadium and 
it was costing a fortune.  And that was what created some of the animosity I believe and 
why they started retracting and rather going to Gavin and they knew if they said it was a 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 97 of 138 
 
political thing they would get the money for it.  And one such event that created a major 
problem was – and I was laughing when I saw our President said no after parties at 
SONA.  Was we actually paid for a full after party at SONA.  There was a gentleman 
who owned a restaurant called Cubana in Cape Town.  Now I do not know which 
Cubana it is I have never been there but I believe it is called Cubana and it is owned by 
the previous chairperson or DG called – a gentleman by the name of Chauke.  Because 
I remember Papa always used to refer to this gentleman and we paid for the SONA – 
well for the – everything at this Cubana the one – it cost us hundreds of thousands of 
rand.  And at those type of things I used to get upset about it.  So he would go directly 
to Gavin Watson to get approval for it and I would just get the bill.  
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I understood from what you have just said that 
a person such as Papa Leshabane would not consult you anymore but would rather go 
to Gavin Watson after the relationship had deteriorated.  My impression from your 
evidence was that right from the beginning they went to Gavin Watson. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  A lot of the time.  Well yes they would have to go to Gavin 
Watson with me but then they started excluding taking me with and would go directly to 
him. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right and then in paragraph 155.  Please deal 
with that. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well originally what would happen is why Brian Gwebu 
20 
because of the Korana contract would go and fetch cash from Gavin to pay people at 
the Department of Transport.  That was then taken over when Brian Gwebu left by Papa 
Leshabane and Seopela. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me ask this and I do not know if I asked it last time when you 
were giving evidence. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 98 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was there actually any contract that Bosasa got for which they did 
not pay bribes? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No Chair. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I am sorry I did not hear that question Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I was asking whether there was ever any contract that Bosasa 
got for which they did not pay bribes and the answer was no. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Oh I see.  I see.  You perhaps did mention the 
later contract which you testified about this morning where you said you have got that 
contract above board and for merit? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well it was above board and for merit but the people were still 
getting paid. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I see. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the department.  It was continuous payments.  I mean Chair I have 
not even raised here because it is not a state capture issue but I can tell you of banks 
that were duped by other companies within the group but it is not a state capture issue.  
But I mean I have made – I have sent them notices.  I said listen guys let me help you.  
Where panels were put up – what do you call them – solar panels where they used 
inferior panels and my people had to make stickers.  But that is not a state capture 
issue so I have not raised it. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Just one question in relation to Mr 
Watson, Mr Leshabane and Mr Gumede. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  As I understand your evidence and the 
evidence of others  
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 99 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Those three persons were the senior persons 
within Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I would say that Joe Gumede was the chairman of Bosasa.  
He was – he was more dealing on the security side.  He had the contacts in the Hawks 
and the police and Mr Papa Leshabane knew the politicians very well and they worked 
together.  But that a little person as well was Mr Seopela that did the liaison with the 
politicians.  He was – he was not employed by Bosasa.  He never wore a Bosasa 
uniform.  The only one time I have seen him wear a Bosasa uniform was in a photo that 
was taken at Lethuli House. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes we will come to Mr Seopela in a moment. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I just want to deal with Mr Watson, Mr 
Leshabane and Mr Gumede. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes they were the most influential. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In a particular context.   
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Those three persons were senior or the most 
senior within the Bosasa Group of companies. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  As officials or chair or CEO or in whatever 
capacity or role. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  When you were arrested 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 100 of 138 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Shortly after the evidence you gave in January. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Those three were not arrested? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  It is an opinion at this stage but it is consistent 
with all your other evidence is there any possibility whatsoever that those three persons 
were not integrally involved in the unlawful activities of Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Those three persons were integrally involved in the unlawful 
activities of Bosasa. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And there is evidence to show that? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Have you ever heard any explanation of why 
they were not arrested? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I have heard rumours.  I cannot comment – I cannot give an 
opinion on that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us deal then with paragraph 156.  You deal 
there with Mr Seopela.  Tell the Chair about those matters please. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Where I first met Mr Seopela we were having a breakfast with 
Danny Mansell and Andries Van Tonder was with me and the Watson kids were with us 
and Gavin Watson was there and Papa Leshabane was there and we were having 
20 
breakfast at Tasha’s.  And in the corner of my – in the corner there was Sesinye 
Seopela standing.  And Gavin called him over and that is when I first met him and I was 
told how influential he was.  He came from a stable where he was trained by Peter 
Bokaba and he was a driver for him and a bodyguard for him.  But he was extremely 
secretive over who he worked with.  He – you could see he was trained up to keep his 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 101 of 138 
 
mouth closed and not discuss it.  But I was well aware that he had met with various 
ministers.  I knew he had access to ministers.  You can see in the one video that was 
published by the press which was after I had left in Imbezo they refer to him as the 
commander.  Because he would command and deal with the various people.  So he 
was – Gavin always refers to him as commander. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  What was the extent of the relationship 
between Gavin Watson and Mr Seopela? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:   No extremely close.  Exceptionally close.  I mean I eluded to 
– I had mentioned in the first one he even paid – his brother one day fell ill and his 
brother had a heart – heart problem and – I know the company made the payment to 
10 
sort out his brother and pay for his brother and everything.  So I remember that.  Gavin 
even knew his mother and would speak to his mother over the phone and things like 
that. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did Watson and Seopela – that is Gavin 
Watson ever work on bids or tenders? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No most definitely.  In the one video that was put out by the 
press Gavin actually stands up and in Imbezo and he actually calls Seopela and he 
says come up here and Seopela is never in the press.  He does not like to be seen and 
he is always in the background and he inadvert – you could see he was not comfortable 
in the video of coming up and he says now commander tell them what we have to do at 
20 
nights.  And they talk about having to caucus tenders at night and Joe Gumede gets 
pulled into the conversation.  He says yes and Joe you have to – we have to go around 
fixing up tenders with people at night because they have been submitted incorrectly.  I 
was not at that meeting but it was on the video. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Do you have any personal knowledge of 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 102 of 138 
 
money being transferred and cash between yourself or anyone else and Mr Seopela? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I would have to meet Seopela.  He would phone me and he 
would say have you got the payment ready for IDT’s payment for instance.  And I would 
say yes I have got it ready, where must I meet you?  And he would say well meet me at 
a garage or at a restaurant or whatever but he would never take the money there.  He 
would say now we would have lunch maybe but then after that he would say, follow me 
and I would have to follow him in his car and he would stop on a non-descript road – he 
was very clever – and he would say alright stop here and then I would have to open my 
boot and I would have to give him the bags and he always had a lot of junk in his boot, 
clothes and old t-shirts and everything.  Then he would move them aside, put them 
10 
inside and then put all the junk – it really looked bad and put that on top of it.  And I 
once asked him I said, so why do you do this?  He says, no if I get stopped then they 
won’t check my boot. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright you have given evidence previously in 
regard to the contents of paragraph 160.  Please just deal very briefly with paragraph 
159 if you would? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  159.  Chair Sesinye Seopela was instrumental in arranging the 
very first meeting with Vincent Smith where I was asked to accompany Gavin Watson.  
So it is actually a bit – it is a bit wrong that because he was instrumental in arranging 
the first meeting I had with Vincent Smith.  A previous meeting had taken place with 
20 
Gavin Watson already.  So the meeting I am talking about here is the first meeting at 
the hotel where we went up the first floor and had the Fishmonger food that Seopela 
ordered from Nico.  It is that one. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If you would then have regard to paragraphs 
162 to 164 it is there on record you have dealt with much of it but please have a look at 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 103 of 138 
 
those paragraphs and then tell the Chair what you believe is important from those 
paragraphs please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I started calling Mr Seopela the 2.5% man because the 
transactions would always be 2.5% of the value of the contract.  So I knew I had to 
make a provision and everybody I mean the people that worked in my bid office on the 
costings knew that 2.5% had to be added to the price because that was the amount that 
would have to be paid out in gratuities or gratification.  And what was interesting was 
that even though Bosasa had provided him with the company credit card which he used 
and a fuel card and access to Blakes Travel on the VIP account sometimes he would 
hire cars on the company account to attend certain meetings.  So he would never go in 
10 
the same car.  I was one day very upset because the company had to buy him a white 
S5 Audi Cabriolet – not cabriolet sorry S5 coupe and I got to the airport one day and I 
recognised the car and there was a layer of dust on it and I – I thought why on earth 
would you park your – this car and not use it?  Why hire a car and then park this car?  
Because I knew he was driving around in a C class Mercedes that was hired from 
Blakes Travel.  I could not understand why he would do that.  And then I started 
realising that he did not want to be tracked or anybody to see where he went.   And this 
was important because especially when large amounts of cash were being paid out.  
Sometimes he would arrive in a Toyota Corolla or in a Mercedes.  He would be very 
careful in which vehicle he would arrive in.  You actually lost track of how many vehicles 
20 
but Blakes Travel and Avis will have the records of the different vehicles he had hired. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Was Mr Seopela in possession of information 
in regard to the progress of the award of tenders and the SIU matter and other matters 
relating to the business of Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Most of the time.  Chair at one stage every bit of information 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 104 of 138 
 
that I got I would have to phone him and relay to him and he would always shout at me 
on the phone because I would use names.  I just – this person says this.  He would say, 
do not use names, use codes.  So we started using code names for people.  And what 
had happened was when I got information I would have to tell him or when myself, 
Gavin Watson were together with Seopela we would often have – meet at lunches then 
I would say to him, this is what this person has said and he would say I will check for 
you and he would come back to us and he would say yes but this is not really how it 
was meant and this is actually how it is happening.  So he had a network second to 
none.  I mean I was walking in Sandton Square one day with my – I was there myself.  I 
went to go and get a Vodacom contract for one of the kids and I remember bumping 
10 
into him there and he was with one of the – is it NDPP’s?  One of the NDPP’s.  He was 
walking hand in hand with the guy.  And he said oh do you know this person?  First I did 
not recognise the person then he introduced me to the person.  So he had influence.  I 
mean he was walking around Sandton City with this gentleman with no bodyguards or 
anything in the open and introduced me to the person. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Let us move then to Mr Gumede.  We can – 
you deal with him in paragraphs 165 to 167. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Relate those passages to the Chair please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So the most important was Jonas Gumede was in charge of 
20 
all the security aspects of the company including security at head office.  The ACSA 
contract, the Post Office contract and he was the head of security and also made the 
head of – the chairman as well.  But more importantly he fronted a lot for Gavin 
Watson. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry before you go on when you say he was 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 105 of 138 
 
head of security is that the security within Bosasa or security contracts of Bosasa or 
both? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Anything security related.  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So outside contracts… 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Outside and inside. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  As well as internal security? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct.  But he was also involved with Lindela.  He was 
involved – these directors were involved in every aspect of the business.  Joe Gumede 
also was responsible for the employees trust and there were other companies like side 
companies like Better Fence, like Inkonjane, Ntsimbintle Mining where Joe was put on 
10 
the board by Gavin and he held shareholding for Gavin via double agreements and type 
of thing as well. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  You mentioned earlier that you were 
introduced to the National Director of Public Prosecutiions by Mr Seopela, is that 
correct? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Who was that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was a gentleman by the name of Menzi Simelane.  I cannot 
remember if at that stage he was or he had been moved or – I cannot remember at that 
time. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  If he was still or he was not but that was the level of influence. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Alright.  Can we deal with the Department of 
Education? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 106 of 138 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Northern Cape, Kimberley. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Tell the Chair about those matters please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair one of the other directors Trevor Mtengwa who was a 
director of Sondolo IT he is the gentleman who was very close to Dudu Myeni.  But – 
and this happened without my knowledge and then I found out about it and then I 
started confronting people about it.  But we employed a technician called Bekke Ngena 
and Bekke Ngena’s sister works for the Department of Education in the Northern Cape 
area that is what it is called. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  When you say we employed, who employed? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Trevor Mtengwa. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Ms Ngena. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Trevor – I did not employ anybody.  I just was there but Trevor 
Mtengwa employed him and at that stage it would have been Papa Leshabane, Joe 
Gumede that would have signed off. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes but Mtengwa employ in his personal capacity or through a 
company? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No it was through Sondolo IT that time. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Continue please. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So basically they tried to keep me out the loop but there was a 
20 
CCTV and an access control contract that was awarded to them for about R10.5 million 
at this stage.  I was totally out of the loop.  I know for a fact there was no tender that 
was prepared for it.  It was an estimate, a cost and it was forwarded and there was no 
tender process and it was made out to be an emergency requirement.  I never flew 
down to Kimberley.  The only time I ever went to Kimberley was when I went for a 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 107 of 138 
 
conference with the company.  But this specific tender was kept far away from me and it 
was during the latter part when I was just about to resign the first time. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Well do you know about it? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes I do. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  If it was far away from you? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes I do.  No it happened while I was there. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Was that not far away? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No it was there. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That you know about it. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was – Advocate Pretorius what would happen is that things 
10 
would happen but I would always have to find out about them because I would also 
have to sign off the accounts.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay.  Carry on please. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So he approached me at one stage and mentioned that he 
had established a relationship with Bekke Ngena’s sister and that she held this portfolio 
and that there were key departments.  And the reason why he had come to me and 
spoken to me about it was because there were incidents where I actually wanted one of 
the – one of the operational personnel had reported to me that Bekke Ngena was not 
performing in the company.  So I actually wanted disciplinary action taken.  And that is 
when Trevor Mtengwa came to me and he said to me that listen you cannot do anything 
20 
there because his sister is this person and we working on this contract with the 
Department of Education.  And he also then requested Bosasa to provide a bribe.  He 
asked me… 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Do you know of this personally? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 108 of 138 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did he speak to you about that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Trevor Mtengwa? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja he did speak to me. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes.  Okay.   
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You know at that stage he also said, we need to look after this 
woman.  That was his words to me.  And I said to him, I said you know there is 
protocols you have to follow you got to go speak to Gavin about this and you should be 
dealing with Gavin if it is a formal arrangement for a large contract.  I said to him that is 
what you got to do.  And they were very, very allusive with this contract.  They did not 
10 
want me involved.  But I – what I did  establish was that we did do the installation 
because the client who the installation was done for ultimately complained vehemently 
and actually picked up the phone and phoned me one day and said that the systems 
are not working and has paid for nothing and he is not happy about it.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So you were aware in relation to the 
Department of Education in the Northern Cape? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That bribe money was requested to facilitate 
the award of certain contracts? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Do you know whether bribe money was 
actually paid? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair there was an amount of R1.250 million that was paid 
out. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To whom and for what purpose? 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 109 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was paid out to the sister of this Bekke Ngena and Trevor 
Mtengwa managed the project and he handled the bribery there.  I did not even pack it.  
I just knew that – I asked him but where did you make provision for it?  And they 
showed me in the costings that they had made provision for administration of R1.2 
million. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So… 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  25 million. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So the bribe money was included in the 
contract price? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It was always.  Yes they… 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  As always. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja but it was reflected as an admin fee or as a extraordinary 
fee or something like that or software. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And what was the purpose of the bribe?   What 
contract was involved? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well the contract that was directly involved to that I saw was 
the contact to provide security and had access control systems and there was 
specifically bollards that were problematic for the client that needed to be installed as 
well. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Where? 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  At the Department of Education the main building. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In Kimberley? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  In Kimberley. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Was there other work provided for or provided 
by Bosasa in the Northern Cape? 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 110 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair normally with a new contract with opportunity I would be 
involved in it specifically.  They excluded me on this one.  I know that because what 
happened was there were flights arranged for Sunworx’s people which was another 
company which was owned 51% by Sondolo IT which is a solar panel installation 
company.  There was a deal done for the Department of Education as well for Sunworx.  
I was excluded from it and it was around the time when I had left.  So I actually make 
mention that I know about it and I am sure the investigators will pick up on it but I 
cannot vouch for the information. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Chair it is almost one o’clock.  We will finish 
today and hopefully earlier than four o’clock.  But there are a couple of matters I would 
10 
like to attend to over the lunch hour before the evidence is concluded. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Then we will adjourn for lunch and resume at two.  We 
adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, let us proceed Mr Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Agrizzi at paragraph 174 
and following you deal briefly with matters related to the Department of Justice and 
Constitutional Development.  Would you tell the Chair briefly about that please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair the contract that was awarded to us was irregular.  I was 
20 
not involved with the award of it, but I was aware of the fact that it was irregular and it 
received a lot of resistance from the Procurement Department within the Department of 
Justice and the Finance Department within the Department of Justice and 
Constitutional Development.  I relied, as the main Operations Officer I relied a lot on the 
feedback that was given to me by my various heads of department within the company.  
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 111 of 138 
 
The person responsible at that stage for the actual roll out of the contract was a 
Mr Trevor Mathenjwa and I was sure that he had everything under control, but however 
in 2016 the Court Managers were dissatisfied with the services that were being 
rendered.  How I picked this up was I implemented a Customer Relations desk at the 
office which I would get my personal PA to at least make 10 calls a day to the various 
Court Managers to find out how they were happy, if they were happy or not.  What 
concerned me was that all the records that started coming back was that people were 
very unhappy with the services and it concerned me because you know I expected 
everything to be on track.  At the end of the day I had to deploy a special team to go out 
into the offices of the various courts and to go and do a survey for me and to rectify the 
10 
problem whatever the problem might be.  They had paid a lot of money for the system 
and I was not going to allow it to be a bad installation on my part.  We eventually did 
rectify it.  However what concerned me the most was that we had been charging the 
Department of Justice and Constitutional Development for a monthly maintenance fee 
and these were just being signed off and paid.  So it concerned me and why I am 
mentioning it and bringing it to the attention is that this type of things happen when 
people in charge are not doing their job because they are being captured or being 
looked after.  So it is a major concern.  It was a major concern for me that people were 
getting money, but because they were being looked after these problems never ever 
got escalated.  Eventually I believe the problem was sorted out, but to what extent it is 
20 
now I do not know and I think there is still a maintenance fee involved that is still being 
charged and that covers the points that I wanted to raise as in addition to it that I had 
left out on my previous one. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So is it correct that the services being provided 
were not in accordance with the contract standards? 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 112 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  There was monitoring whatsoever. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  A maintenance fee was being paid by the 
Department of Justice to Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But it was being followed up? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Or reported or the defects were not being 
followed up or reported you say because people were being paid off? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Can we go then to USAASA School Tablet and 
10 
Connectivity Project and tell the Chair briefly about that please? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I will just give you a little bit of background so that you 
are, you have perspective on this.  Quite a few years ago I was involved with Sunward 
Park High School implementing e-learning so to speak where we had iPads for children 
and it worked successfully there.  I was then approached by one of our Directors 
Fez Mzazi, Fezile is his full name, Mzazi who was a Director at Sondolo IT.  He 
mentioned to me that he had contacts within USAASA who had been given the contract 
to award iPads for schools and there was a contract issued out for Gauteng Schools.  It 
was a major contract and because Sunward Park High School had been so successful 
we went ahead and we did the tender, but what I do have to declare here is that an 
20 
initial sum of R500 000 was paid into cash which was handed by Fez Mzazi.  I was in 
the vault when it was given to him and he was to go and sort out the people that worked 
in the procurement of this tender and Bosasa was then awarded or Sondolo was 
awarded a substantial portion of the tender.  The tender was subsequently cancelled or 
it did not perform but because we had been awarded I think it was a total of 10 schools 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 113 of 138 
 
the maintenance contract just continued running and they just continued paying the 
contract.  The initial transaction though was concluded by Fez Mzazi and 
Gavin Watson’s input in that.  I was on the side line.  I was making sure the operational 
management of it was taking place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was issuing this tender, who was giving this contract, not 
USAASA [intervenes]? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, it was Sondolo IT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, I am not asking who was given.  Who was giving? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  USAASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  USAASA. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is called USAASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What does USAASA stand for?  I thought it is a sports organisation.  
So I am sure I am wrong. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, it is a. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What does USAASA stand for?  Do you know? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  USAASA I do not know, but they were dealing with it.  
USAASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Their offices were in, close to the Mall of Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That is where their offices were. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what are they about? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  They. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is their business? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  They implementation, I think they are like an implementation 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 114 of 138 
 
agent similar to the IDT.  For some or other reason Gauteng had got them to do, they 
are in communications and that type of [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They are not a Government body? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  It is a Government body. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a Government body? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, USAASA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So the initial amount was paid.  I do not have all the details of 
the contract at this stage because they are contained in all my files. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  However pursuant to being awarded the first initial part of the 
contract there was a meeting that took place that was arranged by Gavin Watson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And it was with the person, the senior person I think at the 
stage was the CEO of Bosasa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I remember having the meeting.  I was called to the Sandton 
Square.  There is a restaurant called Pigalle upstairs and I was called into a meeting 
within a closed off glass area and we had a meeting around a table and at that meeting 
the gentleman said listen look after me.  I look after you.  I do not know if he. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who said that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The gentleman on the other side of the table who was with 
Gavin Watson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  All I remember is he was well built gentleman. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 115 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And, I am just giving you this because this is one of the things 
that happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And that basically at that meeting he was told categorically in 
front of me you know Gavin Watson said to him I will look after you financially.  Do not 
worry and the guy did have, he accepted it.  He said yes we can work together.  It was 
just before I left.  So. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I do not know what has transpired since then. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But I add it in just so that you are aware. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, thank you.  Thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Mr Agrizzi just for the record it maybe that the 
correct acronym is USAASA and that is the, just bear with me a moment.  The Universal 
Service and Access Agency of South Africa which is a State Owned Entity established 
under the Electronic Communications Act. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  To provide digital education. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  At all levels.  Then if you would go on and deal 
with Mogale City please. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair these incidents of capture do not only happen on the 
larger national departments, but they happen right at municipality level and so much 
more prevalent was the level at Randfontein Municipality where sometimes tenders 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 116 of 138 
 
were just not even issued out.  They were ordered on emergency type provisions and 
these kind of tenders although they might only be 10 or 12 or R13 million add up, 
because at the end of the day you see that municipalities are bankrupt because of this 
type of action and that is why I think it is important to raise it.  There were numerous 
irregularities that have occurred within Randfontein Municipality.  For some time I 
actually avoided doing any business with the municipalities.  I had been, we had been 
offered at that stage security contracts.  I turned them down.  There was at a stage 
where the Directors had meetings with Municipal Managers.  I refused to attend.  I 
refused to put in tenders or I would overprice tenders so that we had no chance of 
getting them anyway, because I just felt that it was wrong on the people in the 
10 
municipality area to actually put them under that type of thing, but the most recent 
installation occurred just when I left.  I refused the installation.  I said I would not do it, 
because it was without a tender, but then what happened is in March they started 
installing the camera system and I just want to allude quickly to this whole Dahua issue.  
Dahua is a company from China that grew exceptionally fast, but I refused to utilise 
their product because I believe that it was inferior. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Did you have these powers to refuse as you 
say? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Not entirely, but I would motivate why we could not use them.  
So I would motivate it partially.  I would kick up a storm.  I would just say that you know 
20 
there is way no we can use this product because of A, B, C and D and nine times out of 
10 I would have the support of the Senior Technical Team who I had around me.  So it 
was very difficult then for the Directors to put pressure on me. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  In any event I interrupted you.  Please 
continue. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 117 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Not a problem.  Alright.  So in March 2017 there was an 
employee who we employed called Mr Riaan van der Merwe who approached me.  Now 
in March 2017 I had already, I had not gone back to Bosasa yet, but they were paying 
me so I just let them carry on phoning me and that and I would offer advice and that.  At 
that stage I had asked that my resignation be made official and I had actually done a 
letter to Mr Brian Biebuyck and said this is the format I want.  I want this to be told to all 
the staff at the Board Meeting at the staff meetings and the Board Meeting.  So it was 
official that I had left.  They refused to do it.  As a matter of fact they only notified the 
staff of my leaving in August 2017, if I recall correctly and they just said that I had left. 
CHAIRPERSON:   
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Can we deal with the contents at paragraph 
188? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry.  Sorry, Chair I get distracted. 
“In 
March 2017 
an 
employee 
of 
Sondolo 
IT 
Mr Riaan van der Merwe approached me to arrange a meeting 
between the local CEO of Dahua...” 
His name is not there, but it is Mr Kwon.  I have never met him. 
“…and Andile Ramaphosa.  Dahua is Dahua Technology a 
provider of video surveillance products and services.  I did not 
attend this meeting albeit I accepted the meeting invite.” 
20 
So even though I accepted the meeting, I pressed yes.  I did not intend, I had no 
intention of attending the meeting.  I actually said in the message back to say that 
Leon van Tonder should be at the meeting. 
“The agreement with the municipal person…” 
And this is what I know first-hand from seeing it and from actually getting in the car and 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 118 of 138 
 
being driven by one of the technicians to the site. 
“…the municipal person dealt with was that that a proportionate 
amount of cash would be paid to himself in respect of the 
provision on the system.  Dahua System would also be 
provided for his personal residence at no charge.  Evidence of 
the installation can be seen at the property situated in 
Randfontein.  So the property itself and the person’s house I 
actually went to and I could not believe that they had done it 
again and I went and I had a look at it.  I had a look at the 
installation at the Randfontein Municipality and it is exactly 
10 
what it is.  So the camera system the system used at 
Randfontein Municipality is the same system that has been put 
into the house of the person who signed off the order without 
going through the tender process.” 
Now this happened after my departure and why I am raising this Chair is that you 
understand that even though I was there it was going to happen.  If I was not there it 
was still going to happen anyway.  They had a way of doing it, but I visited the site.  I 
actually went to the site.  One of the whistle blowers had told me about this and I think 
they might be coming to give testimony and I went to the residence and I can confirm 
that the same product has been installed exactly the same installation process has 
20 
happened at the other installations with other people’s houses.  The only difference this 
time was that the installation was done with using the Dahua brand and I have given 
the addresses and information to the Commission investigators to have a look at. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The next heading you have there is 
Mr Gwede Mantashe.  Please deal with that. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 119 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I thought it would be apt for me to add certain pertinent 
points that might not have been covered in my first submission to the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The one thing is I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt is 
that all those installations were paid by Bosasa Operations and not by a Director as 
alluded to and the reason I say that is because how this whole thing started was that 
firstly it was kept away from me by Papa Leshabane.  They had arranged with one of 
the other technical heads, Francois Cronje, to go out and to a site survey at a property 
in Boksburg, Sunny Park.  I think it is around there and the first installation what they 
did was they appointed a contractor.  So they got a subcontractor to come and do the 
10 
installation.  I did not know about this until such time as the subcontractor needed to be 
paid and I as a rule I do not believe one should use subcontractors if you are in that 
business yourself.  So why subcontract out.  I do not believe it is a good thing.  Rather 
create the work inside the company and create the profits inside the company, but they 
had used a subcontractor.  So I refused to sign this off for the subcontractor and I 
queried this as it was a concern to me.  Francois Cronje then submitted the invoices 
again to me, but he was being very evasive.  At one stage I had actually suspended him 
because of similar instances as well where they kept things away from me and they did 
not tell me the truth.  So only after I start to really scratch and query the matter did 
Papa Leshabane approach me and he said he had arranged this with Gavin Watson.  
20 
So bearing in mind at that time already they were very cautious of me and they would 
rather divert directly to Gavin.  So I confronted Gavin Watson on this.  You know, why 
are you doing this.  Why are you, you know, not telling me about these things and he 
said to me no, no he has never done it.  He never knew about it and pushed the buttons 
a little bit more and then I found out that he admitted to me that he did authorise it.  So I 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 120 of 138 
 
was annoyed about it and I took, I said no there is no subcontractors to be used, but I 
knew that Papa Leshabane had committed the company to doing the installations and I 
then got Richard Le Roux to continue with it and he made the payments which he got 
money from Jacques van Zyl the cash money, because everything was paid in cash 
and he bought the equipment and he installed it.  So there is no possibly way that 
Leshabane could have made a donation of that amount to them.  The other thing that 
one needs to consider is that people are banding around amounts of R14 000 for an 
installation of R15 000.  Chair that is not nearly where it is.  The actual installation of 
that type of size and the costings are available and the Commission has done a great 
job by going to the, even the lodges where the people had to be accommodated to do 
10 
these installations and get there, but you are looking for a total installation for instance 
at Carla of R145 000 excluding VAT and that is a basic installation.  That is what 
happens when you get professionals out to do, you are talking CAT 5 cabling, fibre all 
that type of thing.  These are top notch installations where you can actually view your 
house on a cellphone.  So they are top notch. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Just before you go on. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Sorry. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Do you have personal knowledge of the quality 
of installations done for various officials? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, I do. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You also have knowledge of the pricing? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, I do. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Your estimate of the total cost of installations 
for three sites for Mr Mantashe, what would that be approximately? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Conservatively, R650 000. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 121 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  All three put together? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And your calculations are set out in paragraph 
198? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  199 and 200? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct and let me give you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So with regard to the; okay, let me maybe ask this way.  Was the 
equipment, the lights, the fencing that was used always the same for all the people who 
10 
benefited from what I think you previously called special projects or maybe one of the 
witnesses said special projects.  Was it the same equipment or did it differ? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The equipment was exactly the same.  It was Cathexis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  IP recorders. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And it would have been either Hikvision cameras. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Or Samsung cameras. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That was the standard.  Now again they might use Bosch, but 
as far as I recall Bosch was not being used for special projects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So it was a standard system I believe when I ran Operations 
that one must always stick to the standard. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 122 of 138 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And operate like a conveyor belt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So if your people are trained on that system. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Then implement that system. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And it would not have deviated and we would not have used 
DVTel or one of the other cheaper brands in the market. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So the important part was for me when I looked at this report 
and I actually spoke to Richard Le Roux afterwards.  I said to him you know one thing 
you guys always forget is you forget to quantify labour. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You forget to quantify ancillary costs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You forget to quantify the transport. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And those are the expensive costs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  The accommodation for instance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Those are really expensive costs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Staffing salaries, so a technician always looks at the cost of 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 123 of 138 
 
the equipment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And he will say oh that is R150 000 or R300 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But the other R300 000 is made up in salaries, wages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Accommodation, all that type of thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So you saw some of this equipment.  So you know exactly what 
you are talking about? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  What would happen is after doing an installation they would 
10 
have to bring me a report.  It did not matter if it was private projects or any projects. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I would want a file with the scope. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And the job completed so I could evaluate if it had been done 
properly or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, and when it comes to payment you say there is absolutely no 
doubt in your mind the payment came from Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair the payments were covered up in cash. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So the account that the technicians opened up at Regal and 
these suppliers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Were opened up, they opened it up in my name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 124 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So I can go to Regal and I can pull all the invoices for the 
investigators. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Everything is in, actually it is a COD account. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But they put it under my name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You mention in paragraph 205 Bosasa’s 
purpose in assisting Mr Mantashe. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  What I think is important is that one understands that at first 
10 
Gavin was elusive.  He said to me he did not know about, then he admitted it and when 
he admitted to me he explained to me why.  He says well I am telling you now it was 
done because Mr Mantashe is a brilliant connection to have.  At that stage he was the 
SG and who controls the rest of the people as the SG.  That is what I was told. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But you do not mention any assistance that 
Mr Mantashe actually gave. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI: 
 
You 
know 
it 
exactly 
the 
same 
situation 
with 
Minister Mokonyane.  You know, I did not know what other assistance behind the 
scenes is happening.  I do not know these things. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  May we deal then with the Mpumalanga 
20 
Department of Health.  You mention that in paragraphs 206 to 210. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I have added some of these in because they are small, 
but these are examples of how it happens and the facts.  So in 2016, November I was 
then informed by Joe Gumede that he was the Chairperson of the Bosasa Group and I 
had just come back to Bosasa and he had been successful in negotiating a deal for 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 125 of 138 
 
security at the hospitals in Mpumalanga.  At that stage he wanted to arrange payment 
for the coordinator or the person who worked on the contract for the Department of 
Health in Mpumalanga as he had promised a success fee over to the person.  So that 
arrangement was made.  He had committed himself and that; I immediately, I was 
annoyed because I said number one, you discuss these things before you make 
promises.  So I do not really want to even deal with it.  I said to him that you know I just 
find this thing is getting a bit too much now.  I had come back.  Gavin Watson had 
promised me one of the reasons he got me back was he said no things are going to 
change, but here exactly the same thing was happening.  So I was very annoyed about 
it and I voiced my opinion on it with Gavin Watson.  I said it should not be entertained 
10 
and that in my opinion was also where my relations with Joe Gumede which had been 
very good before.  I mean we had gone driving together.  We had stayed at hotels on 
holidays together.  We had, he had had suppers at my house.  You know and that is 
where our relationship started breaking down was because I just let my, I let them have 
my attitude which was I have had enough of this guys.  I am sick and tired of this.  You 
promised me it would not happen anymore.  You got me back on false pretences and 
that was in November and I remember I was totally discontented with the whole 
situation.  Joe Gumede then mentioned to Gavin Watson, he said I am getting to clever 
and he raised his discontent openly in a meeting to say that listen I do not want to work 
with this guy anymore. 
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But you were aware you say or you were told 
in paragraph 209 that a, what I presume is a gratification, was in fact paid? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes it was. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And there was also a request I understand 
from your statement that you attend to the servicing of a vehicle? 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 126 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  This is. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Of this person involved. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  This is the second servicing of a vehicle and I spoke to 
Frans Vorster afterwards because I refused to sign it.  I said I am not doing it.  I refuse 
to sign it.  I said you can get it paid, get Gavin to sign it or Joe Gumede to sign it and 
that is. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then you knew of the gratification? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And you processed the request to 
Gavin Watson? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct.  No, I did not even process it to him.  I said I am not 
doing it myself.  I then forwarded Joe Gumede the document back.  I gave it back to 
him.  He then had it signed off by Gavin Watson to get payment and that same 
document is where Gavin Watson actually he scratches out the name of the person, but 
you can still read it of who the repairs where.  I think the repairs were quite 
considerable and he then signs the, Gavin Watson signs the document for the person 
and Frans Vorster then had to process payment on it.  So that document is available as 
well. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  The fact that Gavin Watson signed that 
document and also the document you referred to earlier, the Gillingham agreement, you 
20 
recall that? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Was that the exception? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Totally and I can tell you why it was the exception, it was 
because I had tested the patience of Gavin Watson and the Directors in terms of this 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 127 of 138 
 
corruption far enough and this was by, it was done out of spite to say oh well I bring it to 
me Joe.  I will sign it.  I will get it paid and, because nobody in accounts would sign if 
there was not a signature on it and that is where scratched out a name and he actually 
signed the document and if I am not mistaken I think Frans Vorster mentions the 
document in his affidavit as well. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You then deal with the company that is being 
referred to by other witnesses, Lamazest. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair Lamazest happened really, it was a pinnacle when there 
was a major concern about the investigation on the SIU side and when Gavin saw that 
visibly the; certain of the and I am going to use the word we used at Bosasa, the Whites 
10 
were concerned and they would raise the issues, and Lamazest was created to 
basically look after the White employees, the senior White management and it would be 
a company that would be established that would charge a fee to Bosasa for special 
skills.  That then changed and he had actually called myself and Andries van Tonder 
into a meeting and I think the meeting was at Andries van Tonder’s office where he said 
look he is establishing this company.  This is to look after us because he cannot give us 
direct shareholding, but this is now the company that will have a long term agreement 
with Bosasa and we can then have the dividends of this company which at that stage 
was nothing untoward.  It was a company.  It would be registered and we charged for 
scarce skills, but he did not want anybody else to know about it.  He did not want the 
20 
Directors to know about and it had to be formed hush, hush.  Peet Venter was involved 
with the forming of that company and that entity, the registering of it and all that, but it 
was never used for those intended purposes.  So Lamazest became a mechanism to 
pull funds out of the Bosasa Group of Companies and to be able to pay for services, 
building kids homes and various other things that were not related to the company’s 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 128 of 138 
 
business and it became a real bone of contention in the company because we were told 
then that you know it is not possible to remunerate Andries van Tonder, myself from 
Lamazest, but we should rather look at a new arm’s length company and the promises 
that were made were just not kept.  So this entity was used as a cover up for expenses 
strictly just for the family and for nothing else, for their own benefit and their own 
enrichment.  So that is how the profits were taken.  Most of the profits were taken out of 
the Bosasa Group of Companies and that is Lamazest. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  There are three issues that I would still like you 
to deal with please, the legal team would like you to deal with, firstly the war room that 
you spoke of, the assistance given to the governing party in relation to elections. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  We’ve taken from the media, News 24 a 
screenshot of a video of which I presume you’re aware? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Would you look at it please, we’ve marked it 
Annexure MM.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Why must this take such a long route? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I’m sorry I didn’t follow the long route Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The (indistinct) should just have gone there, why must it go all the 
20 
way that side.  It should have – it needed to go to the witness and Ms Refile is the 
closest of everybody.   
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Sorry Chair, if there’s another exhibit I 
definitely will pass it to him the next time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that’s alright, I’m sure she will pass it to the witness. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 129 of 138 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Having dealt with that matter, in respect of the 
apologies Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that’s alright. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Can we go to Exhibit MM.  I put this before you 
firstly to confirm is this the type of installation to which you referred in your evidence to 
assist the ruling party on their election campaigns. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Well the screen shot you’ve got is only about 30% of it, so yes 
you will see there I mean distinctively all the screens have got the logo on, each 
cubicle, I think there are 30 cubicles of 32 in total, plus to the left of this you’ve got a big 
boardroom, but that’s only 30% of it, so this doesn’t warrant actually the size that it was. 
10 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes but what is significant about this it shows 
the quantity of flat screen TV’s and computers that would have been used in the centre. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No but you’ve missed out on the biggest of all and that was 
the screen that is the size of chair’s backdrop, sorry, I’m just ...(intervention)  
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So with your additions it would give some 
indication of the expense involved? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Geez it was millions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But apart from the size does the picture that one see in Exhibit MM 
reflect more or less what that war room as I think you called, was it the war room? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does it reflect more or less what would have been inside? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, no this is an exact, this is one section, what I’m saying is 
that this is not the whole section, this is only 30% of the ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  But it certainly is part of this ...(intervention)  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes most definitely, as a matter of fact the gentleman, the 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 130 of 138 
 
young gentleman sitting behind the computer screen there was one of the programmers 
that was responsible for programming, for writing a program and there was a brilliant 
young lady called Elise Eland, that wrote the program to actually manage the Call 
Centre for the ANC and it would give them live time what is happening in the Call 
Centre and what is happening on the ground. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  For how long was this operation there in 2012 in Mangaung? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I don’t know if this was Mangaung or this was national. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, oh, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  This looks like national. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh this would have been national. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes that was national. 
CHAIRPERSON:  National. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So Mangaung was exactly the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And Mangaung I think lasted two months and I think this was 
National, it probably lasted two/three months as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I thought when you spoke about Mangaung I thought that you 
were talking about an operation that was maintained for the duration of the elective 
conference in Mangaung in 2012? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No running up, run up to it as well. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  So where would it have been stationed in for example in relation 
to or ahead of the Mangaung conference where would this operation have been 
stationed? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  At Bosasa Head Office. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At Bosasa Head Office. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 131 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So the Call Centre at Bosasa Head Office houses I think 
there’s a 100 call centre seats, so it’s split in two, on the one side is operational and on 
the left hand – on the right hand side is operational, on the left hand side was reserved 
for this type of operation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so – but – and whenever you have run this type of operations on 
different elective conferences or elections it would have been from Bosasa offices. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, and in terms of cost you talk of millions, are you able to 
indicate, maybe you have already done so, indicate what kind of cost may have, one 
may been talking about for a particular election or elective conference? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair you’ve caught me out now and I don’t want to lie to you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  But it is reflected, the actual amount is reflected in this report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So it’s on the news report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay the one you are talking about? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay and that report you said is with some ...(intervention)  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  With news – I saw it in the same report and I still commented 
how accurate they actually were, but it was in quite a few million. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay, no thank you. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You will recall yesterday Mr Agrizzi that you 
gave evidence concerning Mr Gillingham, his suspension and ultimate resignation and 
the assistance given by Bosasa, you placed that evidence on record. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 132 of 138 
 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  I might have missed the detail, I am not sure 
that I did, but you mentioned BDK Attorneys. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That’s correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Who paid their fees in respect of Mr 
Gillingham?  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Their fees were paid by the arm’s length company called 
Synco Prop, so what would happen is Synco Prop invoiced Bosasa, Bosasa would pay 
Synco Prop and Synco Prop would pay the account.  If I can just add there that was the 
arm’s length company  with the hole in the ground, that we were given as a gift. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes, yes I remember that evidence.  Then Mr 
10 
Agrizzi you mentioned yesterday and this was not in your statement, that an amount, I 
think it was R12million, was or some amount was paid and you said you used the 
words “to the top six”. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Please provide the Chair with detail in that 
regard, as much as you can. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair I have asked that the investigation team pull the bank 
accounts of Bosasa and you will see the exact amount, now I said R10million, I can’t 
remember if it R8million, R10million or R12million but I do remember the cheque vividly 
because what happened was a delegation went to present the cheque to the top six. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  A delegation from Bosasa? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So it was Gavin Watson, Sesinyi Seopela, if I’m not mistaken 
Etu Marobba was part of the delegation and there was one or two of the other directors, 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 133 of 138 
 
either Pappa or Joe that went with.  We had to make sure that the money was in the 
bank so that the cheques would clear.  I remember sitting in the meeting where the 
amounts were discussed to the value of eight or twelve million Rand and I don’t want to 
quote a figure and I’m not sure but it was a substantial amount I recall.   
 
That amount will reflect in the bank accounts of Bosasa as being paid. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was it a cash cheque? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Chair if I remember correctly it was a cheque directed to the 
ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it would have had their – you would have remembered if it was a 
cash cheque for such a big amount. 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And it’s very easy to track because we would have got, I 
remember Andries van Tonder I think it was or myself that would have phoned the bank 
and told them to arrange clearance on that cheque. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  So it was a substantial amount and it was on a weekend that 
they attended this meeting and in lieu of that we got some t-shirts and some blankets 
and I don’t know what else. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, and you can’t remember, or can you, roundabout what year 
was this? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  2004/2005/2006 around that period of time. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay, but now yesterday you talked about the top six, and that 
may have given the impression that maybe you were talking about individuals in the top 
six, you are talking about the organisation. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes, I don’t mean individuals. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, you don’t mean individuals. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 134 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No definitely not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but also if it was written as a cheque and the organisation was 
there it would seem that it was not one of the situations where Bosasa would not like it 
to be traced back to them. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No it was, I mean ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  So they were – they may have just been donating. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  They were donating and ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  And of course ... 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  We know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay so there would be, should be easy to find records of that 
10 
but you say it was a donation. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja ,okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  And the reference to the top six would not be 
accurate, I assume that you meant to refer to the organisation as a whole? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  That’s what I meant, they mentioned to me that there’s a 
specific sitting called the top six. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.   
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  And that’s the sitting that they had to go and present to, so 
there was a formal, there was a conference that was taking place, and what happened 
20 
was they went there and they went and presented it to the top six, which was a formal  
body, I don’t know the politics, I’m not a political student but apparently there’s a 
grouping called the Top Six people in the ANC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  But you are clear that the donation was to the 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 135 of 138 
 
organisation as a whole? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  No, that’s what I read right from the start, I am not saying it 
went to people. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Then just one more point please of a very 
general nature.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry Mr Pretorius, so from your understanding it might have 
been handed to what you were told the Top Six or one or more of those people who 
would have received it on behalf of the organisation? 
10 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, okay. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  I’m sorry if I made it – I didn’t mean to confuse anybody. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, okay. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  One more point of a general nature please Mr 
Agrizzi you’ve given detailed evidence of the practices of corruption in which you say 
Bosasa was involved over a long period of time. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  You yourself have conceded ...(intervention)  
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Yes.   
20 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  That in one degree or another you were 
involved or aware of the corruption from the inception of the period right up until your 
resignation. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Your involvement in corrupt activities may have 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 136 of 138 
 
differed from time to time, but in essence you were either aware or participated 
throughout the period? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  You are correct. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  For what period of time did these activities 
continue? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  They really became prevalent from 2005, that I started picking 
up things, 2004/2005, right the way through to when I left. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So that’s at least 13 years? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Ja. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Right.  Chair I have no further questions. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Mr Agrizzi through your – throughout your evidence 
yesterday and today there have been areas where you have indicated that there are 
documents that would assist you and would assist the Commission that you have not 
been able to get.  I am concerned that you have not been able to get documents that 
may well be very relevant to the work of the Commission after so many months since 
you came out publicly about the issues that you have testified about, which from what I 
think you said last time may have been August last year when you came out publicly, is 
that right? 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  When I made my public to the world. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the world ja.  I am keen that such documents as might be relevant 
20 
to the work of the Commission should be obtained as soon as possible, unless there is 
a valid reason why we should not get them.  I therefore would like, and I know that your 
counsel is listening as well and Mr Pretorius is listening, I would like that if at all 
possible a list of all the documents that you believe are relevant that are somewhere 
that you – in respect of which you wish to be assisted to get them, that a list be put 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 137 of 138 
 
together and be furnished to the Commission’s Legal team so that – and they would 
make a copy available to me, so that we can have a timeframe within which efforts, 
serious efforts must be made to get the documents that are relevant and then I can be 
informed through the legal team how much progress is being made. 
 
We don’t have a lot of time to finish the work of the Commission so I would 
like that to happen and as I say your counsel hears what I am, Mr Pretorius is also 
hearing that, so that as soon as possible we can have a full picture out of the 
experiences and activities that you have told the Commission about, but Mr Pretorius is 
that fine from your side? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Investigations are ongoing and there are 
10 
various sources of documents that at present are being explored and some of the 
outcome of that may be available as soon as Monday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay, thank you.  Otherwise you are done with your questions? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Done for today, earlier than expected Chair, we 
in fact thought that the evidence might continue into Monday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  So we are well ahead of schedule. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Thank you very much Mr Agrizzi for coming back, and 
thank you for continuing to – offering to continue to assist the Commission with further 
issues that need to be investigated.  I understand that there are people who may be – 
20 
may have been implicated in your evidence that have applied or will be applying for 
leave to cross-examine you, those applications will be dealt with in due course, and if 
leave is granted to them to cross-examine you, you certainly would be asked to come 
back and make yourself available.   
 
Thank you very much, you are excused. 
29 MARCH 2019 – DAY 76 
 
Page 138 of 138 
 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Thank you Chair and thank you very much for the way I have 
been treated by the Commission and the investigators and I will continue to help all the 
relevant legislative, the Hawks, the Police, SARS and the Commission with any 
information that I can assist with, but thank you very much, I hope it helps build this 
country. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no thank you very much. 
MR ANGELO AGRIZZI:  Thank you, thank you Advocate Pretorius. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Thank you Mr Agrizzi.  Chair it may be 
appropriate to put on record that the various applications that are being received in 
terms of the rules particularly in relation to the first tranche of evidence given by Mr 
10 
Agrizzi have been received, processed and have now been passed on to the Legal 
team of Mr Agrizzi for his comment and decisions will be made after presentation to you 
in coming days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, no that’s fine.  So once there have been responses or 
once Mr Agrizzi has commented you will let me know and I will deal with them in due 
course. 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, thank you.  On Monday should we start at normal time? 
ADV PAUL JOSEPH PRETORIUS SC:  Yes please Chair, the witness who will attend 
on Monday is away this weekend and needs to be interviewed finally before 
20 
proceedings start on Monday, so there will be pressure, but there is no pressure on 
time for the conclusion of the evidence relating to Bosasa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  We are going to adjourn for today then, and we will start 
at ten o’clock on Monday, we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 1 APRIL 2019
