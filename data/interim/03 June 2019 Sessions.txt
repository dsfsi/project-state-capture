Page 3 of 225 
 
by Mr Sundaram in both his main and the supplementary affidavits.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  There is only one out of the 
ordinary manner of service one of the implicated persons and that is Mr 
Moegsien Williams.  He was served via whatsapp because the 
commission had difficulty – they establish communication with him but 
later on could not.  But then the only alternative was to serve the 
notice via whatsapp and he has not responded.  May I also place on 
record that out of the fourteen – thirteen implicated persons only one 
person has reacted to the notice and that is Mr Aplene  and his 
10 
submissions Mr Chairman are the one that are contained in that lever 
arch file with is Exhibit CC1[d]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Maybe just for clarity 
sake I may just place on record that Mr Aplene does not wish to cross -
examine Mr Sundaram at this stage however he does say in the very 
last paragraph of his statement – of his submission that in the event 
that Mr Sundaram implicates him then at that stage he will re -consider 
his position and he may apply for leave to cross -examine him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.

MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Where you studied and 
10 
qualified as a journalist and where you worked?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So I did most of my schooling in Delhi in 
India at the Father Agnel School and I have a degree in Journalism 
from the University of Delhi.  This I got in 1994.  So since the time I 
graduated from college I have been wording straight through as a 
journalist.  I have also worked as a consultant – a media consultant 
and somewhere down the line you know since I had been a television 
journalist and also set up – help set up stations I am a bit of a 
journalist and a start-up personnel.  I started my career like I said in 
1994 immediately after my graduation with the Business World 
20 
Magazine with is one of the leading business magazines in India part of 
the Anandabazar Patrika Group.  From there I joine d the Zee Telefilms 
which is – which has got a station called Zee News which is one of the 
oldest television stations there back in 1996.  I was there for about 
seven years starting off as a reporter and working my way up through 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 9 of 225 
 
the ranks.  I have headed the bureaus in Chennai in South India and 
Bombay.  I was a bureau chief for Zee News for a few years.  After Zee 
Telefilms I joined New Delhi Television which is a very well respected 
television network in India.  I was there for about four years.  After 
which I joined an international television network which is the Al 
Jazeera television.  I was there for two years I was the India 
correspondent based out of New Delhi and I travelled through the 
region to Sri Lanka to other parts of South Asia to report for  Al 
Jazeera.  Immediately after that I started – I joined a start-up which 
was New Ex.  I was part of the leadership team there that took the 
10 
station to launch and this is where I had my experience in helping 
launch channels from an editorial stand point.  After New Ex I joined 
the India Today Group which is one of the largest oldest television 
networks in India.  I was there for four years as an Editor.  Post which I 
went back and joined a station which is called News Nation which was 
just starting up at that time.  So I was the first executive editor there 
helping the station launch.  Part of the leadership team that launched 
that station.  Immediately after which I was contacted by Mr Laxmi Goel 
who was part of S L Media the joint venture partner of ANN7 with the 
Gupta family and asked whether I would be interested to go to South 
20 
Africa to set up ANN7.  Which I did you know and what – why they 
found me a suitable candidate for this was because I had exposure to 
international media having worked with Al Jaz eera for two years.  Also  
I had experience in being part of the leadership teams that set up 
stations in India and launched stations successfully.  Post my 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 10 of 225 
 
experiences at ANN7 I came back to India I was a consultant with the 
Rajasthan Patrika Group here a nd I went on from there to launch two 
stations in the south of India.  One was called – is called New 7 Tamil 
which is a Tamil language news station, a 24 hours news station which 
is still in operations and is doing very well.  Post which I launched 
Kaveri News very recently which again is a station which is based out 
of Chennai in Tamil Nadu province in India.  I came back to Delhi late 
last year because I had been on dialysis for two years and you know 
these long hours of working and I had to go for dialy sis every second 
day was taking a toll on my health and we had already decided to go for 
10 
a kidney transplant with I got done in January this year.  So I quit my 
job last year and I have been asked by my doctors to take rest and not 
get any full time employ ment for six months.   It has been five months 
now since my transplant and that is a brief sketch of my career so far.

Page 20 of 225 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  But I started off in New Delhi working out 
[indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes that is what I also wanted to – so before you 
came to South Africa you already started performing your du ties in New 
Delhi? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you have just indicated exactly what you were 
doing. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Interviewing potential candidates, employees?  
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So you were – the contract was concluded in 
May – 1 May 2013 it was for two years.  You were going to come to 
South Africa but before you came to South Africa you started 
performing your duties in New Delhi? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Then 
20 
you then had to come to South Africa after the one month of 
preparation in setting up or planning – your planning.  So could you 
just tell us how did you go about the process of applying for a visa and 
how you got into South Africa?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Okay you see applying for the visa when I 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 21 of 225 
 
was – you know when I got – decided to take up this position I had 
done a bit of research on the internet and what I read there was for 
work permits to be issued in South Africa there had to be an 
advertisement that needed to be placed in a paper here and if they do 
not find a suitable position – a person in South Africa for that positio n 
and then these things would be – you know a work permit would be 
issued.  But – and I thought that it would take a long time for the work 
permit to be issued to me and I asked Mr Laxmi Goel about it.  But he 
told me that you know they had what he called a setting with the high 
office in South Africa and that the visa would be done in no time.  He 
10 
asked me to get a yellow fever vaccine, a note from a local police 
station giving me a security clearance and a medical certificate from a 
government doctor saying that I do not have tuberculosis if I remember 
correctly and I agave – I handed those documents on to him.  I was 
also told that the procedure for the visas for the people going from here 
would bypass the normal procedure and that the details of these pe ople 
were to be sent to Mr Ashu Chawla in – in South Africa who was part of 
the companies that the Gupta family ran here.  I found out later that he 
was a CEO for South African Computers and he would then speak with 
high officials here I was told at the Pr esident’s office who would then 
20 
direct the relevant departments to expedite the visas and also bypass 
some of the requirements that may be needed.  So I found to my 
surprise that my visa was cleared fairly quickly within a matter of a day.  
You know they had gone in there, submitted the documents.  I did not 
have to go personally.  I was not interviewed at all at any point nor do I 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 22 of 225 
 
remember any of my other colleagues being interviewed by any official 
at the South African high commission in New Delhi.  We ha d handed 
over our documents, the passport plus the other documents to Mr Laxmi 
Goel’s office to his secretary and she had then arranged for it to be 
taken to the South African high commission.  Calls were made to Mr 
Ashu Chawla and the work was done.  I do  remember very distinctly 
that during that time [indistinct] Kumar who was a person who would – 
who had recently been hired as part of the HR team in his enthusiasm 
had gone to the South African high commission with the passports 
without informing Mr Ashu Chawla and of course he was denied access.  
10 
He asked to speak with somebody at the – at the visa section there and 
I think the point person we were told was Mr Shakil.  He asked to speak 
to Mr Shakil and he was told that there was no Shakil who worked 
there.  So – but of course the next day Mr Laxmi Goel gave him a 
dressing down told him that if there are visas to be processed the 
process to be followed was for Mr Ashu Chawla to be informed for him 
to then use his influence in the government to give instruc tions to the 
high commission in New Delhi for them to issue those visas.  And very 
true to that the visas that I had applied for and my colleagues who 
came in from Delhi applied for came in very quickly on our application.  
20 
All the things that I had read on the internet about the time it would 
take and the procedure was bypassed for these visas.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So are saying that you 
never had to apply for either a work permit or an intracompany visa, 
this was all done for you at the o ffice of Mr Laxmi Goel?  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 23 of 225 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No I – I had to fill out the visa form.  I had 
to get a vaccination for the yellow fever.  I had to get a certificate from 
a government doctor who happened to be a neighbour so I got it signed 
from him.  And also there was a police verification so which is basically 
a certificate which is issued by a police officer of a particular rank 
which is quite easy to get.  So I got all the documents together and 
handed it with the visa form to Laxmi Goel’s office and that  is it and 
within a very short time the passport came back with the visa.  I was 
not interviewed.  I did not face – I did not have to go to the high 
commission.  By – I did not have to face an interview or any of that.  
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now the visa that you 
talking about which you received is that the one that appears at page – 
same bundle Exhibit CC1[a] at page 27?  In fact that is a copy of your 
passport.  It should be E3 at page 28.   
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes this is the visa and those are the 
stamps of the exit and entry as well.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now let us…Yes.  Now let 
us… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry that is CC1[c] 28 you say?  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Page 28 that is correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second.   
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And then could you just read 
into the record what does E3 – what is written on E3?  What type of 
visa is that? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  It is an intracompany transfer permit.  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104

which was issued to me. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and the name – it has your 
name and your passport number?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And then there are certain 
conditions there.  In fact it has got the dat es.  Could you just read what 
were those dates issued where and when?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I cannot read out of this but I will read it out

if it is correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The first word seems to be “secondment”.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  “Secondment”.  That is correct. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes.  It says …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well as I see it seems to be: 
“Secondment to …” 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  To include Infinity Media …  
CHAIRPERSON:  “Infinity Media …” 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Editor for 24 months. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  “As editor for …”

CHAIRPERSON:  And are you able to complete?  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 26 of 225 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Now extend may not change conditions to 
ensure local skills are transferred within period. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I – I wonder Ms Norman in case …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Unless you are able to read this …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Easily whether if you – if you have a …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Could make a copy for 
(intervenes)? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Look at his – at the actual …  
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Passport?

ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Wearing glasses.  Yes, thank 
20 
you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.

whether what you read … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Is (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Accords with his understanding of what is written in 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 27 of 225 
 
his passport. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you 
Mr Chairman.  It reads: 
“Intra-company transfer permit.”  
It has got Mr Sundaram R and it has got (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think – I think where it says …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  (Intervenes) secondment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Temporary residence permit – is it not? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  It has got temporary …  
CHAIRPERSON:  And issued and so on.

transfer within period.  Director-General Home Affairs and then if you …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you must also read what is above what you 
have read.  I think we should have started at the top.  
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Do you want to – to read that as well? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  I will start:  it is control 
number A04701810 and t hen on the write hand corner yo u have got 
DHA1635 Republic of South Africa and then you have intra -company 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 28 of 225 
 
transfer permit and the name Sundaram  R and passport number 
K9491213 …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And then it goes the part that 
we have already read. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Is that – does that accord with 
what … 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  What you received? 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then maybe you can also read up there – is it not 
written valid until and then conditions work – at the top or … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  It would be number – that 
is enter on or before.  Is that the one Mr  Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  No, no what you see … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It seems two pages … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes Mr Chair but what – what 
20 
you are seeing are the stamps.  We are going to take him through 
those. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  You are reading from the 
stamps of entry …  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 29 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And exit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you, okay.  Thank you.  
Thank you.  Is it correct then that for the intra -company was it your 
understanding that you would have to work for a particular company the 
same company that has a branch or Head Office in Johannesburg.  Is 
that how you understood it?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That is how I understood it. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  But I was told by Mr Laxmi Goel that this is 
perfectly legal and – you know - they – they would not issue it 
otherwise.  That it was issued by the High Commission.  They went 
through the process and if it were really the case it would not be.  So I 
was assured at that time that this is a permit which is the right 
document for me to travel and work in South Africa.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Then on the – on top of 
that then it is – you will see that there is  date stamps.  When did you 
actually leave India or New Delhi to come to South Africa?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I left on 3 June 2013 which is six years from 
20 
today.  It is exactly six years. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, okay and if you look at 
your passport you will find that stamp …  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  It is just above what you have 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 30 of 225 
 
read on your visa. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and then below – next to it 
you also see that ther e is another entry stamp.  Is that correct?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Just next to – to the one that is 
the round stamp and then there is one …  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Square. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And then it is written OR Tambo 
… 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes (intervenes). 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  International Airport. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So there is one stamp of my exit from Delhi 
for the same date and one entry …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Of the same day, yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And then – and then that one 
from – that is written OR Tambo …  
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  What is the valid date?  What 
are the dates that appear on that stamp?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That is 2 September 2013. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  No, no.  You – no, not that one.  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 31 of 225 
 
You are reading the one that is square.  Not the round one.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Okay, the square one is 3  June … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  2013. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and then valid until?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  This is till 2 May 2015. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  No, it is – it is 20 May on mine. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  20 May - ja 20 May. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Is it 20 May 2015? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And then below that you have 
got conditions.  What are the conditions?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  It says work. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Work and then we are going to 
come to the stamp but what we might just as well mention is the one 
that is round that is also written OR Tambo …  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  What does that signify? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That is an exit stamp. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  That is when you left South 
20 
Africa? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That is correct yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  To go back to New Delhi …  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And that was the date? 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 32 of 225 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That is 2 September 2013. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  We were going 
to deal with that later in your – in your evidence.  So this is what you 
carried to South Africa  coming in and out of the country?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Just for clarity sake am I 
correct or is it so that you were never employed by Mr  Laxmi Goel’s 
company? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And is it also correct that 
10 
Infinity Media Network is only a company that was in South Africa or did 
it operate also in New Delhi?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  To the best of my knowledge there is no 
company called Infinity Media that works in India.   The Infinity Media 
that – that I signed a contract for was a company that is in South 
Africa. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So if at the end of the day 
it is found that your entry did not comply with the laws of the country it 
would apply to your visa and to all the other visas that were received 
by your – by your colleagues at the time?  
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  I would like to take you 
just still on the visa issue before we leave it I would like to refer the  
Chairperson to EXHIBIT CC1D Mr  Chairman which is the big lever arch 
file next to you.  These are the submissions by Mr  Apleni who was the 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 33 of 225 
 
former Director-General of Home Affairs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before you do that just too …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was your understanding of what was meant by 
intra-company transfer? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  What I was told at that time after I had 
agreed to employment at Infinity was that the class of visa which would 
allow me to work and hav e a temporary residence in South Africa is 
called an intra-company transfer and I was told that since there is a 
joint venture between Essel Media which is a company that 
10 
Mr Laxmi Goel owned and Mr Gupta’s company the Gupta family owned 
a company here that it was a – it was a transfer between the two joint 
venture partners from – you know – from one joint venture partner to 
the other.  So it was all the same – it was all part of Infinity Media but I 
was told since it was a company which was joint venture wh ich had two 
different principals.  So it was a transfer from one principal’s – one 
principal into the – into the main company.  So that was my 
understanding of a – of what an intra-company transfer was.  That is 
what I was told by Mr  Laxmi Goel at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the one company to the extent that in – 
20 
intra-company transfer meant that you were been transferred from 
within one part of the same company to another part of the same 
company to the extent that that is what it meant.  One, are you sa ying 
that you were not in – employed by Infinity Media in India before you 
were employed by Infinity Media in terms of which you were going to 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 34 of 225 
 
come to South Africa? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I had a contract with Infinity Media which 
was valid from 1 May but I was working …  
CHAIRPERSON:  No I accept that.  Before that (intervenes).  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Before that I was working for another 
company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I was working for Alfa DCOM which has got 
nothing to do with … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Essel Media or any of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That is a total different entity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that company had nothing to do with Infinity 
Media and it had nothing to do with any company that may have h ad a 
joint venture with Infinity Media?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No.  It was a totally different entity.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Maybe just to deal 
– still dealing with your – with your visa issue and ju st refer you – if I 
20 
may refer the Chairperson to EXHIBIT CC1D which is the submission by 
Mr Apleni who was the form Director-General of Home Affairs during 
that period.  He has put up documents.  I just want to refer you to a 
document that makes reference to your passport and your visa and that 
will be at page 228. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 35 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is 228 in the … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  In the lever arch file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Lever arch file? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What – what divider? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And that is CC1D. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which divider? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  It will be six – under nine – 
sorry – divider nine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay, I have got it. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  If I may refer 
you Mr Sundaram to item 31 on that page.  Have you found it?  Are you 
there Mr Sundaram? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes I am. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  If you look at 
item 31 what is written there?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  It has my name Sundaram Rajesh and it has 
got my passport number and it is given the category of visa which was 
intra-company transfer permit issued on 22  May 2013 and valid for two 
years and it says it is valid/reside.  
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  We are – Mr Chairman we 
are going to deal with what prompted these investigations much later in 
Mr Sundaram’s evidence but I just want to just deal with the numbers 
and – and the visa itself at this stage.  If I may just – sorry – I just 
want to take you to another page quickly and then if you go to page 319 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 36 of 225 
 
of that same bundle that is the EXHIBIT CC1D which is the lever arch 
file under item 9.  If you look at page 3 -1-9 that is the copy of your 
passport.  Am I correct - the one that you have just referred to earli er? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  3-1-9? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, 3-1-9. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes this is a copy of my passport.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And then if you turn over the 
page that is page 320 you have a copy of your visa.  Is that t he same 
that we were dealing with?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes it is. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  That the same, thank you.  We 
are going to – because you deal with the issues about Home Affai rs 
much later in your statement and we – I do not want to confuse issues.  
We are going to park this for a while and I would like us to tell the 
Commission then about your arrival in South Africa.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Then you have got your visa.  
You have got your passport.  You are at the airport – 2 June – 3 June 
20 
when you left New Delhi – 2013. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And when you arrived where did 
you work? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  When I arrived here I was taken to a 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 37 of 225 
 
guesthouse which is owned by the – the Gupta family and I – I mean I 
just want to give a short description of how it was now.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  It was like a labour camp.  You kn ow there 
were three rooms and about six or seven people who would stay there 
and I was a little surprised – you know – because both (indistinct) and I 
were (indistinct) in the senior management team and we would have 
expected or – you know - from our experiences stayed at a hotel 
probably till the time other arrangements were made but we were put in 
this guesthouse which had one person from Nepal who was on a visit 
10 
visa who was – who told us that he was being paid a salary in India.  
He was not getting a sa lary here and he was to cook for all the 
labourers who had come from India who were – who were engaged in 
the construction of the – of the studio and he had also to cook for the 
people three meals a day for the people who were staying at the 
guesthouse and also to clean their clothes, to do all the housekeeping 
work and he would not have a single Rand to spend on himself because 
all the money that he got was at Mr  Laxmi Goel’s office in India and 
that money was then sent – you know – taken by his uncle and taken to 
Nepal from there.  So it was a very shocking kind of environment – you 
20 
know – because the – the bathroom there had clothes strewn all over 
the place and it was a mess really.  One of my colleagues who come 
with me Mr (indistinct) was sent to anoth er guesthouse and he gave me 
a call in the middle of the night on the same night that we arrived here 
that there were rats running around that guest house.  So – and he 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 38 of 225 
 
called me up and said Mr  Sundaram (indistinct).  You know is this the 
place that we are going to work.  So – so yes that was a brief 
description of where we stayed and then of course I – the office that I 
worked at was the Midrand Office of ANN7 which also housed the New 
Age Newspaper as well.  That is the office from which we worked.  The 
New Age Office we were given a small space there on the first floor.  
On 
the 
same 
floor 
where 
Mr  Atul Gupta 
had 
an 
office.  
Mr Nazeem Howa had an office.  There was a conference room out of 
which we were working out of.  The ANN7 Studio at that time was sti ll 
under construction and we could not work from there.  So the first few 
10 
weeks we were working from the New Age Office to the right of the 
compound. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  If I may just quickly take 
you to paragraph of your statement that i s EXHIBIT CC1A at page 1 of 
your statement. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  We are still going to deal 
with you having written your book.  That is going to come last because 
you did that after you left South Africa.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  So I will skip those paragraphs.  
I am skipping them deliberately.  Now just tell us then you get into 
South Africa and you start working in South Africa and you are telling 
the Commission about what you di scovered in paragraph 4.  What is 
that? 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 39 of 225 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Well at the time of my employment when I 
agreed to join Infinity Media I was not told that there was – I was told 
there was a third partner but I was told that that is a local entity.  I was 
never told that that was the President’s son or the President had an 
interest in this.  My decision to join would have been different perhaps 
if I had known about it but after I came here over a period of a few 
weeks I was getting a sense that there is an invo lvement of the 
President in this entire project and operations which was confirmed 
immediately after the first meeting that we had with the President.  I 
was told at that time unofficially that Duduzane  Zuma was one of the 
10 
partners here.  I was told there were three partners.  One, being 
Laxmi Goel – the Indian businessman.  Then the Gupta family and the 
third was Duduzane.  I was told at that time that each of them owned 
about one third of the shares in the company and that these were the 
three entities that owned the news station that I was setting up.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now because you have 
made the 
allegation 
the 
Commission 
had 
undertaken 
its 
own 
investigations.  I would like to refer you – Mr Chairman may I refer you 
now to EXHIBIT CC1C which is also one of the presentation files and it 
is written additional information.  Mr  Sundaram could you have a look 
20 
at that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Could you turn to page 30 
Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  3-0? 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 40 of 225 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  3-0 that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Maybe just to identify the 
document properly might want to just refer the Chairperson to page – 
sorry – there is a stamp from the company.  These are fin ancial records 
– financial statements of Infinity Media which were received, submitted 
to the Commission by KPMG.  If I may refer the Chairperson to page 7 
just to identify the company that actually conducted the audit.  Page 7 
Mr Chairman of the same docu ment.  KPMG is written there and it 
shows independent auditor ’s report – page 7. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on a second. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well what is the page number …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Page 7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the whole exhibit? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  The exhibit is CC1C and then 
page number would be add info 0-0-7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Four … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  0-0-7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  0-0-7? 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  0-0-7? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  0-0-7 Mr Chairman, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay, yes I have got that. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  I just – just to 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 41 of 225 
 
identify the document properly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  I would like the Chairperson to 
have a look at the left hand corner of the – it is KPMG.  So these are 
the auditors that submitted this information to the Commission.  Now if 
we turn then …  
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is written independent auditor’s repor t? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Auditor’s report that is correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there a date to it? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  There is a date.  Mr  Chairman if 
10 
you turn to page 8 …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Page 8 has Mr Wessels who 
signed it – Chartered Accountant …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Registered Auditor Director 
14 August 2015. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then if you may 
now turn to page 30. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Oh I beg your pardon.  Oh, 
sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On - on the face of it does it tell what company it 
relates to? 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 42 of 225 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  It does Mr Chair. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Is it addressed to the shareholders of Infinity 
Media … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Infinity Media … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Network. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Proprietary Limited? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then at page 30 
we have as a heading there “Infinity Media Networks Proprietary 
Limited” and then it has notes to the financial statements but paragraph 
20 is where I would like to draw the attention of the Chairperson to ...  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  and the witness’ attention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Mr Sundaram if you read 
paragraph 20 you see the heading there is written  what? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  “Related Party Transactions”. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and then you have … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Identity I think – Identity of related parties.  Is that 
right? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN 
SC: 
 
That 
is 
on 
20.1, 
yes 
Mr Chairman.  I just want to read that line. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 43 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, oh “Related Party Transactions”, yes.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine, yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And then the second line has 
got a number of shares.  Do you see that?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Number of shares. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then we have a 
percentage of holding.  Do you see that?  
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And then below that in 20.1 you 
have “Identity of Related Parties”?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  There is related parties 
there and then we have – I would just like to draw your attention t o 
Essel Media.  You see that?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And then Essel Media has - 
what is the number of shares that it holds?  
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  35 percent. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  35 percent and then you have 
got (indistinct) Proprietary Limited that holds?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  9 percent. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  and you have got – sorry – I 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 44 of 225 
 
skipped Oakbay.  Oakbay Investment Proprietary – right the first one.  I 
beg your pardon. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That is 35 percent as well. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  That is 35 percent and then you 
have got the next one the last one.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Ja (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on, hang on Ms  Norman. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us do it …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  We start from the beginning. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the proper sequence, ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Alright, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You keep on skipping. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  I skipped – I skipped one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Okay.  Let us start from the 
beginning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  20.1 we have got there “Identity 
of Related Parties” alright do you see that?  
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And then following that is the 
company’s share capital as held by.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and then the first company 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 45 of 225 
 
you have there is Oakbay Investments Proprietary Limited?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And what is the shareholding?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  35 percent. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and then it is followed by 
Essel Media …  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And what is the shareholding?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  35 percent.  This is Laxmi Goel’s company. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and then you we have 
10 
(indistinct) Proprietary Limited and what is the shareholding?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  9 percent. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And then you have Mabengela 
Investments Proprietary Limited and what is the shareholding?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  21 percent. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  21 percent.  Now that because 
we have to satisfy ourselves that if you place that information it is in 
fact - because you have mentioned that it was Mr  Duduzane Zuma’s 
company.  Then the Commission looked at the information that is kept 
by CIPRO within the country.  If I may just ask the Chairperson to turn 
20 
to page – of the same bundle – if I may just give you the page where 
Mabengela Investments is dealt with.  Sorry – maybe before we do that 
MR Chairman just for sequence sake at page 0 -6-8 of the same 
document.  You will find that that page is from CSI Company Trace and 
then it has got the name of the company that was been searched there 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 46 of 225 
 
is Infinity Media Networks.  Do you see that?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  On the same document and 
then you will see that – I just want you to identify whether the Mr  Goel 
that you talk about is – is listed on there or is there another Goel 
because there are two different spellings.  You have got Arpit  Goel and 
then the third name you have got Laxmi  Goel which one are you 
referring to? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Laxmi Narain Goel is the full name of 
Laxmi Goel. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Laxmi Goel.  So … 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And Arpit Goel is his son.  There are twins.  
So one of the twins is Arpit Goel. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and you have a list of 
names there of the people who were Directors and those who 
subsequently resigned from that company.  You see that?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said Arpit Goel – Mr Arpit Goel is the son of 
Laxmi Narain Goel.  Is that right? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I see that … 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 47 of 225 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  The spelling. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The spelling is different.  Arp it’s spelling - in terms of 
the surname is – G-O-E-L and … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  G-O 
CHAIRPERSON:  The other is G-O-Y-A-L.  Do you know …? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  You see because in India there are certain 
surnames like Goel they are spelt differently but all of them are the 
same thing – you know.  It is the same …  
CHAIRPERSON:  And everybody knows it is the same thing?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay alright. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  It is a caste surname. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Then you 
have got a list of all those Directors.  You might want to just mention 
those names please for the record.

Arpit Goel, 
Christiaan (indistinct), 
Laxmi Narain Goel, Atul Kumar Gupta, 
Varun Gupta,

ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now and then if I take you 
through to page 0-7-6 or just – just to complete that paragraph. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  You see that there is Director 
status next to the names that you have mentioned.  There is ID number, 
Director status and appointment date of those persons.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Okay and then if you turn to 
page 0-7-6.  I beg your pardon Mr Chairman the … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am wondering whether …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Having read those names he should say anything 
about the status – the Director status – some – some or all seem to 
have resigned. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, I wanted to take him, let 
me take him to page 57. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that’s fine. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Thank you.  Mr Sundaram I am 
so sorry I did not ask whether we will take the break at eleven or

MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes based on these documents. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes thank you, then what is it 
that made you say that you heard that the President’s son was involved 
in this, was there any involvement of either the President or – former 
President or his son that made you make this statement that you make 
in paragraph four? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Well what I found during my experience 
here was that, although Duduzane Zuma was the person who was a 
director, was a shareholder in the company it was President Zuma who 
was more actively involved in terms of the meetings that I had were 
10 
more like review by shareholders on the status project, on the 
television project, you know.  So the reports that they gave there during 
those 
meetings 
were 
like 
s hareholder 
meetings. 
 
Duduzane’s 
involvement in the setting of the station or the running of the business 
was minimal I would say, you now, there was just one meeting where he 
had a small appearance and there was not much in terms of business 
that he contributed to that meeting but President Zuma was very much 
involved in the running of the station, in the sense that there were 
regular review meetings where (indistinct) was given to him and he 
would give feedback to that as well.  Also confidential informat ion

which, as somebody who set up many stations across (indistinct) would 
know, you know there’s some confidential information which you don’t 
really give out so early in the project.  That was disclosed to the 
President, now I would have thought as somebo dy when I knew – when 
I did not know of the President’s son’s involvement in this, I thought it 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 55 of 225 
 
was a little funny that you’d hand out a document which had all the 
secrets of the project to a public office and leave a presentation there 
with all those details, with so many people in his office would have 
access to that and it could, clearly, have leaked but they didn’t really 
seem to care, they trusted them 100% and it was only later on that I 
realised that it’s because he had a much bigger interest in the station. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes you deal with these 
meetings in detail in your supplementary statement.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:     Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:    Maybe it’s appropriate that 
10 
you jump from what you’ve stated there to go – so you can deal with 
the meetings one by one as you’ve done in your supplementary 
statement.  May I refer the Chairperson to CC1B at page 2 of the 
supplementary statement.  Thank you, you deal with the – when was 
the first meeting where you say the Presiden t was present, where was 
the meeting and who was present at the meeting and deal with the 
discussions at that meeting?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Okay the first meeting of the Gupta’s was 
on the 22 n d of June 2013, the meeting took place at his residence in 
Pretoria and the meeting was attended by (indistinct) from the New Age 
20 
Newspaper as well as members of the Gupta family, to be very specific 
there was Ajay Gupta, there was (indistinct) Gupta there, there was 
moegsiem Williams who was the head of the delegati on in terms of the 
protocol, the was Nazeem Howa, there was (indistinct) who was the 
head of business from (indistinct) in this project and there was me who 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 56 of 225 
 
was part of the project.  This entire meeting was coordinated by Mr 
(indistinct) and he too was par t of the meeting and from –the President 
was there on his own, there were no other aids that were present 
during these meetings. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes just tell the Chairperson, 
how did you get to be invited to this meeting, just start from t he 
beginning, called you to say you must attend and how did you get there 
to the President’s official residence?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Okay so this was – I think this meeting 
took place just a few days after I arrived in South Africa.  So about a 
10 
week before this meeting, I was told by Mr (indistinct) Gupta that we 
would have a meeting with the President, at that time I did not know 
that Mr Duduzane was part of this – you know that he was a 
shareholder in the company.  I was told that it’s a formal meeting  we 
would meet them and tell them about the project.  So I thought it was 
probably a formal introduction, you know with the head of State about a 
new media venture that’s coming up just to brief him about what it was.  
He asked me to prepare a presentation , a text presentation with, you 
know, what were the differentiating features of the content that we 
proposed, what were – how were we different in terms of the 
20 
technology, how would were we different in terms of the studio set -up 
and design and all the oth er features of the television station.  So I 
prepared this, I was told to send the details to Mr Askram who was part 
– I think he was the creative director at the New Age Newspaper, I was 
asked to send him the details and they said that he’s going to dress -up 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 57 of 225 
 
the presentation in terms of putting it into a spiral bind, cutting out 
pictures from the internet and kind of dressing it up in the sense and 
Askram was told to make three copies of the presentation.  One which I 
would have in my hand one which Mr (in distinct) Gupta and Ajay Gupta 
would have and a copy of it would be presented to President Zuma at 
his residence.  So these documents, I gave out the information it was , 
you know made into a PowerPoint presentation and print -outs were 
taken, spiral bound with a plastic sheet on top and it looked like a 
proper business presentation and we kept it ready but, you know, 
everyday I would think, you know, we would (indistinct) prepare it, 
10 
solidly prepare it, (indistinct) we were told that the President was 
travelling outside of the space and that he would come back.  He came 
back on a Saturday and on the 22 n d of June, which was a Sunday, we 
were given time at 9h30 I got a call on the Saturday evening from Mr 
(indistinct) Gupta, very late at night when we had come  back from work 
and he told me that there’s a meeting that’s going to take place at 9h30 
tomorrow he said that somebody would pick us up from the Midrand 
office, that we should be there bright and early and reach the 
President’s residence.  I was also told  that the others would follow in a 
convoy immediately afterwards.  At that time – you know the next day 
20 
Aaron and I – we were staying – we were sharing an apartment in 
Midrand so we went straight to the office, got copies of the 
presentation with us we wer e waiting and Aslam? told us that he would 
give our telephone number – our car number to the President’s office 
(indistinct) so that we wouldn’t have any issue getting in.  It was a 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 58 of 225 
 
guard from the fleet of the Gupta family and we gave – Aslam gave that 
number 
to 
(indistinct) 
who 
then 
gave 
it 
to 
the 
President’s 
office…(intervention)  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Sorry Chairperson it’s quarter 
past eleven, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes thank you we’ll take the short adjournment, tea 
adjournment and we will resume at half past eleven. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed Ms Norman. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Thank you.  Mr Sundaram yes 
would you then proceed.  You got a call and you were told that 
someone was going to fetch you  to the meeting? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes could you continue from 
there? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Switch on your microphone. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Oh sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes.  So I was told that somebody would 
20 
come and fetch me.  We would asked to report at the Midrand office 
which we did in the morning.  So – at the appointment time there was a 
driver from the Gupta family’s fleet of cars that had come in there.  So I 
still remember that he greeted us with something that people that in 
rural India greet each other with you know so we got a little surprise 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 59 of 225 
 
because here is a white South African person and he is greeting us in a 
way that they would in rural India.  So…  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  How did he greet you? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  He said Ram, ram. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  So Ram ram. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So – and then he had on this – on the car 
stereo he had a lot of hindi music playing which me and – which Arun 
Aggarwal and I we did not particularly like so we asked him to switch 
10 
back to the station.  Of course we reached President Zuma’s residence 
ahead of time and as we had been told earlier the car – the vehicle 
number had already been given.  We were flagged in and we did not 
have much difficulty finding our way into a waiting room where we 
found Ms Rashu Javla.  One thing that did strike me was the relative 
lack of security because I had gone to interview heads of sta te before 
and have covered them at various countries and here I found that the – 
we were – there was nobody who sort out passports or identity details 
before we were allowed in.  None of – the bags that were being taken 
were put under an x-ray scanner.  I mean there is more security here 
20 
that I see than there at the President’s residence.  I do not know if it 
was a special consideration it was since we were part of the Gupta 
delegation or if security is generally not required to be very high in 
South African as it is in South Asia where a basically a reporter had 
seen this.  Also we were ushered into this room to the right of the 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 60 of 225 
 
residence – of the entrance of the building and that was not a general 
waiting area because I saw the only – the delegation that had come 
with the Gupta family was to use that room.  When we entered that 
room Arun Aggarwal Goel and I we found Ashu Chawla already sitting 
there with his phone plugged into the wall socket you know just 
charging and he seemed a little anxious and he was answering all the 
questions that we were asking him.  This is the first time I was meeting 
Ashu Chawla and heard a lot about him.  About he is the point person 
at the President’s office.  Anything – any work that needs to be done in 
terms of visas or any o f that he was the guy who would speed things up 
10 
for the Guptas.  We were also told that Moegsien Williams, Nazeem 
Howa, Atul and Ajay Gupta would be traveling in a convoy and would 
reach sometime after we had reached for that meeting.  And true 
enough they came in a few minutes later and Atul Gupta was from the 
very beginning very impatient about the fact that he wanted to start the 
meeting and get it over with quickly.  The President of course had been 
out of Pretoria for a few days and he had a series of meetings.  When I 
came and I realised that there were a lot of cars parked outside so a 
few of the ministers had also come in for pending work that needed to 
be addressed urgently.  And he was in another room we were told 
20 
conducting meetings.  So Atul – Ajay Gupta would keep telling Ashu 
Chawla to go to the President’s office and tell them that the Gupta 
brothers were waiting.  At one point I think about half an hour into the 
waiting time he got very impatient and said that you know we cannot be 
waiting here forever you know the President cannot make us wait.  So 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 61 of 225 
 
he asked Ashu Chawla to go and tell the President’s office that we are 
going now.  Ashu Chawla came back in a few minutes and he said well 
please wait because the President’s coming out of the meeti ng that he 
is right now and he will come here very shortly.  And within a few 
minutes President Zuma came into the meeting room.  He was 
apologetic.  He said he was sorry that he had a lot of guests that day 
and a lot of pending work that needed to be done  although it was 
Sunday it had been a heavy morning for him.  And he came in and sat 
down.  So there was a certain protocol that was followed for these 
meetings you know at his residence.  The President sat on a particular 
10 
chair then the head of the delega tion what was Moegsien Williams sat 
in the chair next to him.  Then Nazeem Howa and then the Gupta 
brothers would sit on a couch opposite them and then across the table 
from there is where Arun Aggarwal Goel and I – I sat for these 
meetings.  So the very first meeting started off like this and you know 
we found it a little funny because when we were told that we will go to 
the President’s house and have a meeting for two hours Arun Aggarwal 
and I who had coming from India we were a little – we thought it was a 
little funny that the head of state would have two hours to dedicate to a 
new media television station which is not even started yet and we 
20 
thought that the Gupta – Atul Gupta was probably exaggerating that we 
would probably get five minutes of the Pre sident and we would be 
ushered out.  But at the end of that meeting we were really surprised 
because not only did the President take a very detailed briefing about 
the project he asked us questions, kept a copy of the report with him 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 62 of 225 
 
and said that he is going to keep the copy, study it and next time when 
we meet he would ask a few more questions and give a few more 
suggestions. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Just on that – just on that. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  About it. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  What exactly did you present to 
the former President at that meeting?  That is we talking about the first 
meeting? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Okay so I – we presented to him what we 
were told by Atul Gupta which is an outlook on how the station would be 
10 
– you know because we had already commissioned the design of the 
studio.  We had already commissioned the logo and the name and all of 
that.  So the logo was commissioned.  Also a status report on how the 
project was headed.  The various things about procurement of 
equipment now to the design and fabrication of the studio.  A status 
report really on how things were.  Also he wanted me to prepare a note 
on how the content of this television would be different from what 
already exists in South Africa.  So in terms of the lo ok and feel or this 
station you know how are we going to be different there?  So it was in a 
sense a report which had all the details about the station.  It was a 
20 
status update on where the – where the project was at.  Something of a 
– of a shareholder rev iew kind of a presentation more than a kind of 
presentation that you would give the head of state on a formal kind of a 
meeting. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  So at that point the name of the 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 63 of 225 
 
station was already known?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  It has been decided? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Okay were you present when 
this decision was taken as to what the station was going to be called?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No I was not present when that decision 
was taken but I believe there was a meeting before – the first meeting 
before the first meeting that I went into where President Zuma and the 
Gupta brothers had a meeting.  Perhaps with Nazeem and Moegsien 
10 
where the President had suggested to them tha t it should be called Like 
CNN it should be ANN Africa News Network where there would be an 
African perspective of news to international news like CNN was Atlanta, 
Centric perspective of world news an American journalist from China, 
India, Africa, telling the world about what was happening there.  This – 
the idea was to have an Africa news network much on the same lines 
where a South African journalist would you know to start with would 
report on South Africa but the idea was to have a South African 
journalist reporting from across the world you know much like what 
CNN was doing.  And the – when the first meeting happened I very 
20 
distinctly remember Mr Ajay Gupta telling the President that look Sir we 
calling it ANN7 and this is just like you suggested.  And we putting a 7 
because ANN was already taken so we did the next best thing we just 
put a numeric at the end of it and we found that that name was not 
taken so we decided to take that.  And President Zuma seemed to 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 64 of 225 
 
appreciate that a lot.  Also I think this is something that – this is 
something that they played a lot during these meetings.   You know 
they would keep telling me that the President when you speak with him 
should feel like whatever he has said is – we listening to it and we are 
executing that.  But they would also say that we will listen to what he 
says and if he like it we will execute it if not we will not.  So it – so that 
was the sense that I was getting about how they were dealing with 
President Zuma.  Also I got a sense of they had a very go od rapport 
with the President.  They had very good ties.  When we went into these 
three meetings there were – there was occasion when we were in a 
10 
visiting room and there would be relatives of the President.  His 
daughter in one instance I remember and the y greeted him very – each 
other very warmly.  The need – the Gupta brothers seemed to know 
everybody in the family on a first name basis.  Almost like they were 
family.  So that is something that I found in these meeting.  Also 
President Zuma was very warm to them.  I would also I think 
significantly say that these meetings happened after the Waterkloof 
incident.  So if at all I had any doubts in my mind whether that had 
soured relationships the relationship between the President and the 
Gupta family I would say no absolutely not because the warmth with 
20 
which they met in those meetings there was nothing that would indicate 
that the Waterkloof incident had had any impact on the relationship that 
they shared. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So then – so we still at 
the first meeting? 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 65 of 225 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  While these discussions are 
taking place what was the end result of that meeting?  What was 
resolved at that meeting?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Well these meetings were cut up into two 
parts you know.  The first part was where the television team would 
present to the President the status on how the project was proceeding.  
The second half was the new age and other businesses which the – 
which the Gupta brothers wanted to dis cuss.  And during those – during 
the second part Arun Aggarwal Goel and I were asked to move out of 
10 
the meeting and you know stay out because that was something that 
they did not want us to be part of.  So at the end of the first meeting 
the presentation was given.  The President said that he is going to take 
a look at the presentation.  He asked us to leave a copy with him.  And 
he said that when we meet next he is going to give us our feedback on 
the same suggestions and also how we could improve this fur ther. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then – so then after 
that meeting then I would take it that you left.  When you left did you 
all go? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  We all went together because we had – we 
20 
had come in our car and we had gone back in t he same car.  The other 
parts of the delegation which is the Gupta brothers, Moegsien Williams 
and Nazeem Howa and Ashu Chawla came afterwards. But what I found 
out from the conversation that we had you know post that meeting was 
that there were other issu es related to the New Age advertising and 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 66 of 225 
 
also the T&A business briefings that were aired on SABC were also 
discussed.  You know if there were certain ministers who they had 
difficulty approaching to get – for those interactions or they would ask 
President Zuma to use his influence to get them in there.  Also if they 
wanted a particular ministry to pay for the venue and details like that 
and there was reluctance there they would go to him to get that sort – 
things sorted out.   
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  So… 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  When you arrived at this 
10 
meeting were you formally introduced to the former President?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes.  I was because like I said there was a 
packing order there was a protocol ther e so Moegsien Williams was the 
one who was heading the delegation.  The Gupta brothers then 
introduced I think it was Ajay Gupta if I am not mistaken he said that 
there are two new people here for this meeting and then he introduced 
Arun Aggarwal and me to the President so he greeted us very warmly.  
He shook our hands and sat down on his chair before the meeting 
started.   
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes.  So other than you then 
20 
making presentation to him as to what you had done and what your 
plans were about the station did – was – did the President put in – give 
you any input to it or did he simply say look thank you I will consider 
what you have put up and I will get back to you?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Oh to the best of my knowledge he – in the 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 67 of 225 
 
very first meeting there were you know since he had coming from that 
meeting and all so he had come back after some time. He had taken the 
document from us and said that he is going to get back.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  A bit more inputs as we go along. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he did not make any input or any substantive input 
at that meeting to…  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  If I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the presentation?  
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  If I am given permission to refer to the 
condensed of my book because that is based on a diary that I was 
maintaining at that time and immediate recollection because this was 
written in 2013.  If I am given permission?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you can…  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I would just want to cross-check this and…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you can do that. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That relates to the first meeting hey?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you can do that ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  But you quote from your book 
there Mr Sundaram if I may just direct your attention.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104

ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  You quote from your book 
starting from page 4.

10 
want to make the reference or do you just want to – you have dealt with 
what happened …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think he just wants to have a …  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Ja I just want to… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Run through his eyes and see. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Oh just run through it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If – to refresh your memory.

03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 69 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  What we can do we can move on and during the lunch 
break you can just have a look. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And after lunch you can tell us whatever you picked 
up. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that alright? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I can do that – I will do that. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but what I do want to ask you is how long did that 
10 
meeting take?  You told us that the President  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had come from another meeting.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which he had left. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before it could finish. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I understand you to say he was going to go back 
to that meeting. 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So how long did the meeting with you and the Gupta 
delegation last? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I see – with the television team it was just 
Arun Aggarwal and I we were there for about an hour and after we left it 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 70 of 225 
 
continued for another hour/ hour and a half maybe so about two or two 
and a half hours on that day the President spent with the Gupta 
delegation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but is my understanding of your evidence correct 
and part of it might be because I have read your statement and maybe 
you have not said so.  Is my understanding correct that the President 
was still to go back to the meeting from which he had come?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And he said that there was some ministers 
10 
who were also waiting in the other room.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  In the meeting that he had come from. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  So he spent about an hour in regard to the 
first part or what you call the first part of the meeting.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And after you and somebody else had been asked to 
leave the meeting it was another hour before the meeting was…  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was concluded. 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now after you had left the meeting did you wait for 
the other members of the delegation until the y had finished with the 
other part of the meeting?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No since – we had come in our own car. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 71 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  We left from there because there was other 
work that had to be done so we left from there.  But when they came 
back – when this – the remainder of the delegation came back the – we 
sat together and I could hear from them what had happened and you 
know what was discussed and things like that.  So what I remember 
from that discussion is about you know talking to  the President about 
the New Age newspaper, about business related to that and also 
business related to the other businesses.  And also what I remember 
distinctly is about certain office ministerial colleagues influenced them 
10 
through the President to come and attend the TNA – the breakfast 
briefing that were taking place.  What I understood was that they were 
finding reluctance or some resistance from some of the ministers to 
attend them especially after Waterkloof.  The Gupta name many of the 
ministers did not want to associate with and want to come there 
because you know this SABC the business briefings that were had on 
SABC tied Atul Gupta who was very prominent fixture there so he would 
be on the main table and the dignitary who would come had to sit on 
the same table with him in full public glare because this was telecast 
live on SABC.  So some of the ministers had some reservation about 
20 
doing that especially since there was a lot of bad press that the Gupta 
family was getting.  So to – but this was something which was a very 
profitable venture for the Gupta’s and the New Age.  So they – their 
part that this would be affected and they wanted the President to ask 
his ministerial colleagues to come and attend those briefings because 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 72 of 225 
 
they did not want the pr ofitability of that venture to stop in any way.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if you – if after the first part of your meeting you 
took your car and left you would not have known how long the second 
part of the meeting took?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Well – because you know when they came 
back to office you know I had asked now we had found out that it was 
about another hour – between an hour and an hour and a half that they 
had spent.  So I have – I remember those meetings when they came 
back there were reviews.  There was something called the executive 
committee meetings that will happen where we exchange notes and..  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but it is not like you saw when they came out of 
the meeting/ 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No I am… 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know if you had not left and you were waiting 
outside and waiting for them to come out and they came out then that 
would be… 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Then I would know for sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but…  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I am basing it on the information and input 
that I got… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja on the discussion that subsequently happened?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you also mentioned that what you have written in 
your book in regard to that first meeting and I assume in regard to 
other meetings that you talk about in your statement as well is based 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 73 of 225 
 
on a diary that you – where you made entries at the time, is that 
correct? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I would not call it a diary but there were 
various documents, some mails that were sent out where I could refer 
the dates to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So it was not a diary it was…  
CHAIRPERSON:  It does not – it was not a diary. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  It was not a diary but it was …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Documents? 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  A bunch of documents or you know certain 
things that I could remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Like the 22 n d of – or you know like for 
instance the last meeting that I had with them I remember because that 
was one day before the launch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So I can just go back and say that the date 
is this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  This was the date of the launch and I came 
back so. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Okay. 
 
Okay. 
 
Otherwise 
there 
was 
no 
contemporaneous record of what had been discussed?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  You see I wrote the manuscript of this book 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 74 of 225 
 
within a few months of leaving South Africa.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So it was fresh in my memory at that time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And it was all written at that time  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And put there.  So the book was released.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  In last year March. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  But the manuscript was ready in 2013 and 
there were certain challenges tha t were there so it could not come out.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay thank you. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  
Maybe just to take you back to paragraph 19.1 of your statement that is 
where you quoting from the book?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes.  There is something that 
you mentioned there as to a number 9 and who is number 9 and why do 
you make reference to a number 9 in that paragraph?  
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes I… 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  That is page 5. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes because you know they had said that 
the entire meeting with President Zuma should be kept as secretive as 
possible and the – there should be a lot of confidentiality around it.  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 75 of 225 
 
But of course what they said is that if we do discuss about the meeting 
because we had to make a presentation and the inputs had to be 
discussed with the senior management and if you were discussing 
before others we should not mention the President by name.  That is 
what Atul Gupta said.  He said we should refer to him as number 9.  So 
I found that a little intriguing and asked him why number 9, why not 
number 3 or number 7 or number 10.  He said number 9 was the code 
that was given to President Zuma when he was part of the ANC and you 
know he was part of an intelligence grouping during the apartheid years 
and that is a code name that he would want to use in this case.  And 
10 
whenever he called me up like for instance when he called me up the 
day before the meeting he said we have to meet number 9 tomorrow at 
9:30 he did not refer him by name.  So they had told us that it should 
not be mentioned to anybody and not with the team in India not with the 
team in South Africa and it should be just these four, five people who 
were part of the entire plan ning plus Aslam who was a close confidante 
who would you know finally give a form to the presentation in terms of 
you know printing it out and putting the photographs and the logos and 
all of that.   
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Maybe I will just 
20 
have to take you back and just looking at your – at your – the 
quotations that you make from the book.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Because I think these matters 
are quite important.  Now if you – were you offered when yo u entered 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 76 of 225 
 
because you simply went to – when then the President entered the 
room but I want to know were you offered any like beverages whilst you 
were waiting for the President?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Oh yes we had a lady from the President’s 
office who came in and asked us you know if anybody would need any 
beverages and that was in that waiting room which was to the right of 
the entrance.  There were people who had ordered the beverages they 
came and it was consumed.  And also I think I remember at that tim e 
Atul Gupta had very jokingly said that you are journalists you do not 
have any shoes you not taking hospitality on tax payers money.  So 
10 
then I him that you know well I pay my taxes here as well so [indistinct] 
there is no reason for us to – and then he made a claim at that time.  
He said that while many companies in India fudge their account books. 
You know there is one set of accounts that they have for internal 
consumption and one set of accounts that is for the tax department 
which meant that there wa s a lot fudging that was happening. He 
claimed at that time that they did not do any fudging in their businesses 
here in South Africa.  So – but of course that was just the small talk 
that was happening while we were waiting for the President.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes.  And then you make 
20 
mention of what happened when Ms Ashu Chawla sprang to his feet to 
touch someone else’s feet could you just explain to the Chairperson 
what that was all about?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Well I think there was – you know that is 
part of a – the feudal culture in India is for you to go and touch the feet 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 77 of 225 
 
of – I would call it the feudal culture but it is also a respect to the 
elders. We go and touch people’s feet.  But you know it is something 
that is looked down upon in India especially in a corporate kind of a 
setup.  You know in a family setup sons routinely touch the feet of their 
parents or their uncles and aunts.  But it is generally not the done thing 
in an office in a professional environment.  But what I found the re was 
that people were supposed to reaffirm their loyalty to the Gupta 
brothers by touching their feet especially the lawyers like Aslam would 
do that very regularly.  Also Ashu Chawla was somebody who would 
touch the brothers feet every time that he saw them and they would 
10 
very reluctantly ask them to sit up.  Of course you know when 
somebody touches your feet you are supposed to bless them and say 
that may you have a long life or whatever.  But they would just ask him 
to get up and move it.  This was par t of the culture.  They were – the – 
many people who had come from India who were working with the 
Gupta family for many years who – who thought nothing wrong in 
touching the brothers feet when they saw them and that is Ashu did as 
well.  You know as soon Ajay Gupta and Atul Gupta came in he bowed 
to touch their feet. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes.  You mention…  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is – I am sorry. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  I beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it you touch their feet if they are barefo ot or touch 
their shoes if they are – or do you only use – do that if they are 
barefoot? 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 78 of 225 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No it is just a sign of respect you know.  So 
regardless of whether they are wearing the shoes or not you are 
supposed to touch them ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  And I just want 
to deal now with your input as the consultant editor you are in the 
planning of all of this.  You mention in some of the quotations from the 
book that there is something that Atul wanted lots of graphi cs which 
you felt that was less sophisticated.  Could you just deal with that 
aspect so that we can see what your contribution really was insofar as 
the setting up of the station was?  
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Certainly. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Oh that is just a conversation that I had 
while we were waiting for the President.  You know there was a 
television set in which – and there was DSTV remote that he had in his 
hand.  He would flip channels, various television channels and  – and he 
said that he – he liked the television station that we were about to set 
up to be – to have a lot of clutter on the screen he said he wanted to 
dazzle the people of South Africa.  Well I suggested to him that it was 
much – you know you just have two eyes and you can focus on one 
20 
thing on the screen so it is best to have a minimal approach when it 
came to the elements on the screen.  But he insisted there that he 
would want you know like a top band, a bottom band, the lower third to 
have multiple layers, to even have a band on the side which will have 
more details.  Which is something that some channels in India the Hindi 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 79 of 225 
 
stations do.  So I tried to reason with him at that time that is not how it 
should be done and that is not how contemporary styli ng is you know.  
Because minimal is good, less is more when it comes to television 
because you cannot overuse the graphics.  He of course had a 
disagreement on that.  Coming to my scope of work in all of this It was 
- basically I was the glue that was supp osed to hold the whole thing 
together in terms of editorial process, the editorial employees, the 
technical staff, the broadcast staff, the vendors who were to come and 
– the cleaners – from the vendors side would come and make sure that 
– you know – everything happened in a pre-planned sequential way so 
10 
that the launch was flawless but what I found was that I encountered 
every step a very suspicious Atul  Gupta who would want things to be 
done quicker than what the professionals were not listening to him.  To 
give you an analogy of the construction industry.  If a wall takes five 
days to construct – you know - you are supposed to put the bricks and 
then – you know- there is cement.  There is curing that takes place.  
Without understanding the process he woul d say I want that wall done 
in one day.  Then – and somebody tries to reason with him he would 
say oh that is an excuse – you know.  You are just delaying it for me.  
They were in tearing hurry to set the station up and now I realise it was 
20 
because they wanted to have the station up and running.  They did not 
really care how the content was. It was just that they wanted to start 
making profits as soon as possible and channel that as dividends to the 
stakeholders.  So really the – the content or the look and  feel of the 
station was secondary because just get it up as soon as possible and 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 80 of 225 
 
get it started.  Get the Government Departments to give you revenues 
and that is what the (indistinct) was about.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then in 
paragraph 19.36 if you may just have a look.  That is where you deal 
with your direct interaction with the President at that meeting.  Could 
you just look at that and testify to it please?  
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is that? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  At page 14 Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  1-4? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN 
SC: 
 
1-4 
yes 
at 
paragraph 
10 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That relates to the first meeting still?  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Still the first meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  At paragraph 19.36. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes.  See because President Zuma – one of 
the mandates that I had for this meeting was to also tell him how the 
content is going to be differentiated.  So what I saw and I had very little 
time to see what the c ompetition was.  I saw that – you know – there 
had to be a fair representation for the provinces which is what 
20 
(indistinct) – you know.  So we said that we are going to have of course 
the name been African News Network.  We said that we will have a 
correspondent in each part of Africa.  In as many of the cities as 
possible.  Also there would be representation in terms of reporting staff 
in the provinces and there would be a provincial bulletin that would 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 81 of 225 
 
come out once or twice day.  There would be an Africa  Bulletin that 
would be part of the – apart from the rolling bulletins that would go 
throughout the day.  In terms of programming we had told him the kind 
of emphasis that we had on sports and international news and 
entertainment and lifestyle.  I explaine d to him how we would get 
international news through subscription to various agencies.  Also 
these agencies had specific feeds on – on say Hollywood and how we 
would get the latest footage from them and also in terms of sports the 
kind of coverage that we planned kind of bulletins and how those 
bulletins would be not just an anchor sitting behind the desk and 
10 
reading off a teleprompter but – you know – the different elements of 
the studio and how we would use that to make it different.  So – and he 
will listen to all of this very intently and he was very impressed by the 
fact that we would have emphasis on the provinces more – news from 
the provinces – because he said that that is something that the 
competition was not doing and that is what was required for  him.  Also 
the fact that we would have reporters in the various capitals across 
Africa or something.  That – that he found interesting as well.  I 
remember. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and then there is some 
20 
interaction at paragraph 19.38.  Could you just tell the Chairperson 
about that? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes.  So this is something that he said we 
should not have – you know.  That – he thought that - he mentioned the 
channel by name – ENCA.  He said that that station had a lot of 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 82 of 225 
 
reputation of bulletins at that time and he said that that is something 
that he found very boring.  So he said – you know – you should have a 
lot of fresh bulletins and each bulletin should not be the same set 
behind them and the same camera angles but it should have as many 
set – it should be as different as possible.  So if you have a set – then 
I explained to him about how we had multiple camera angles that were 
possible, multiple backgrounds that were possible.  So it was not just 
hazy screens at the back but you coul d actually have people – the 
entire newsroom busy in the background and you could have an anchor 
reading a news bulletin from there.  So I explained all of that to him.  I 
10 
also remember that he had an aversion for the – you know – the 
humorous programming that was the - a program featuring a puppet.  
He said that there should be no lampooning of politicians.  He 
absolutely hated that and he said you should not have that on your 
station because that is something - he said that there should be no 
lampooning of politicians.  You know that really should not be done and 
… 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  He said that I forbid anybody from having 
that on the station.  So we all laughed it off but of course I was told 
20 
later that if he said he does not want it then we cannot have any of that 
on – on it. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So then – then after that 
then you left the meeting after all these interactions?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 83 of 225 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  You left the presentation and 
you left? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Could you please tell the 
Chairperson then about the second meeting?  How it came about and 
what was the purpose of that meeting (intervenes)?  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am – I am sorry.  Maybe he should make the point 
that is made in paragraph 19.34. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Point 34? 
CHAIRPERSON:  19.34 page 14. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Oh yes, yes.  Yes, yes at page 
14.  Are you there? 
CHAIRPERSON:  And actually …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Maybe just read … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually 19.33 he may have answered in part …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When I asked him a question but I think it is 
important. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  May – may he then be allowed 
to just read those paragraphs Mr  Chairperson because …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes he can read them. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 84 of 225 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  19.33/19.34. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  “Ajay introduced me and Arun – 
this Rajesh Arun – he is the editor of the television 
of the project and this is Arun  Agrawal.  Aramjee is 
the business head.  They have both come from 
India recently and have many years of e xperience 
working with large international networks.  You 
know the other gentleman.  I soon have to go back 
to the meeting I left behind.  I know that I have a lot 
of things to discuss but like they say in Zulu we 
10 
must skin the animal today.  We will leave  the rest 
for later President Zuma said.  So I will ask Rajesh 
to give you a quick overview of the project even 
answering any questions you may have and then we 
will ask the TV team to leave and we can discuss 
issues related to the newspaper.  Ajay said po inting 
to me.  I handed President Zuma a copy of the 
presentation.” 
19.34: 
“See the logo on the presentation.  So it is ANN7.  
20 
Like you said we are calling the channel Africa 
News Network.  We are following all the things you 
told us sir.  Ajay told Presid ent Zuma and pointed to 
the logo.  The President seemed impressed.”  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Maybe … 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 85 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then I think for the sake of completeness you can 
read 19.35. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Five. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM: 
 
“He 
smiled 
at 
Ajay 
in 
acknowledgement. 
 
This 
will 
be 
the 
most 
technologically advanced television station in South 
Africa.  The broadcast newsroom automation and 
production systems we have are used by the top 
news networks of the world.  Our news gathering 
reach will be the widest among out peers with 
10 
bureaus, studios and live sources proposed in every 
province.” 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now after the first sentence in 19 – in paragraph 
19.35 the first sentence says: 
“He smiled at Ajay in acknowledgement.”  
Then after that you seem to open quotations.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not see where you close the quotations but 
before we look at that who is talking after that?  
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That is I think …  
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes). 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That is me because I have been asked to 
make a presentation to him and tell him …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that is you talking now there?  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 86 of 225 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So the quotation closed 19.36. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That is when I say …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No that is fine.  You can continu e. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  If you are happy with it?  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, does it go up to 19 …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Point 42? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Would you perhaps prefer 
that he reads all of that Mr  Chairperson? 
CHAIRPERSON:  No not necessarily. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  So that we do not …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I just wanted to – to the extent that … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Some - I thought somebody was being quoted and I 
20 
wanted to know how far. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  That - that goes, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is – that is your presentation?  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 87 of 225 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But is my understanding correct that you quote your 
presentation up to the end of paragraph 19.42?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just have a look … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the end of … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN 
SC: 
 
Yes, 
before 
the 
second 
meeting. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Maybe you could make 
the statement that you make in paragraph 19.40.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Oh. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  You want me to read that?  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Okay.  After … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I actually – I am sorry.  I actually think that – well he 
20 
must tell us important features of that presentation t o the extent that he 
might not have.  If he … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whatever he has already dealt with he does not need 
to repeat …  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 88 of 225 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I think 19.40 seems to be important … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As well as 19.39. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  19.39.  Maybe … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He could start at 19 …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Point 39. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe should start at 19.38. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  That he has already dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, he has taken care of that?  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Then 19.39. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Point 39. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And 19.40. 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Okay.  19 …  
CHAIRPERSON:  You can just read that. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  19.37 has a few details about how 
technologically we would be different in terms of the robotic cameras, 
state of the art production control room and all of that which I 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 89 of 225 
 
explained there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Coming to 13.9?  13.39? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  19.39 sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM: 
 
“I 
should 
also 
leave.  
President Zuma got up to and warmly shook our 
hands.  He then walked us to the door and shook 
10 
hands again before we left.  All three meetings I 
had with President Zuma ended this way.  Nazeem, 
Moegsien, Ajay and Atul stayed on.  I was told later 
by a Minister – by a Member of the New Age 
Marketing Team that these discussions were crucial 
for the people to get Government advertising and 
bring hard to convince Ministers and officials in as 
guests on the New Age Business briefing.”  
So this is something which I had explained earlier as well.  You know – 
so they were very open about it the people who were loo king at the 
20 
marketing of the New Age that these meetings were crucial from a 
revenue standpoint for the newspaper because this is where the 
convincing about getting advertised.  Now remember which I mentioned 
in another part of my statement here is that th ere was one particular 
meeting I remember Mr  Ajay Gupta was very agitated about the fact the 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 90 of 225 
 
Independent Election Commission had a multiple million Rand budget 
for advertising but they were not giving any of that to the New Age.  So 
they took it up with th e President in one of the meeting and very 
strongly put forth to him that – you know – the Independent Election 
Commission was not giving a share of the pie to the New Age and they 
were assured at that time that - that President would look into the – the 
matter.  So the point I am making is that these meetings are very 
crucial from a revenue standpoint for the New Age Newspaper.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  The Chairperson asked you to 
look at 19.40 as well. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  40? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Oh. 
“After the Waterkloof scandal some Ministers and 
officials seemed reluctant to be seen in public with 
Atul or on a platform posted by his newspaper.   
These Ministers and officials were convinced after a 
nudge from the President Atul told me.  The bad 
20 
press and public outcry following the incident did 
not seem to have made any difference to the 
relationship between President Zuma and the Gupta 
brothers. 
 
In 
the 
three 
meetings 
with 
President Zuma that I was part of the two brothers 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 91 of 225 
 
bonded 
well 
with 
the 
President 
and 
joked 
occasionally about the scandal.  It was like nothing 
had happened.” 
So they even made jokes about the scandal – you know - like I 
remember when the President would say something and say oh but then 
this happened during Waterkloof – you know – I would not be allowed to 
get guests now.  Things like that – you know – which the President did 
not seem to mind and they would have a hearty laug h about it as well.  
So – and also there was reluctance among many Ministers to be seen 
on the same platform and they did seem to come later because they 
10 
were convinced to come for these meetings.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you and then 19.42 
because in 19.41 or this is what you have just covered (intervenes).  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  The 41 that is a continuation. 
“The brothers …” 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  “…had fairly free access to the 
President’s residence and Zuma let his Ministers 
waiting for us to attend the meeting with the 
20 
Guptas.  Atul once showed me newspaper clippings 
of President Zuma defending his friendship with the 
Gupta family in Parliament.  Zuma was a force – 
was forced to publically defend his relationship with 
the Gupta’s for the first time since the plane 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 92 of 225 
 
landing scandal dismissing all allegations against 
him in relation to the Guptas as rumours he said.  
See I told you the bond that we have with the 
President is deep.” 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was saying that? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  This was Atul. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  4-2 now? 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  “The media and the DA will try its 
best to create a rift between us but –but he will 
stand by us like a rock.  The President will defend 
always he said showing me the newspaper clipping.  
I found the discussion of commercial issues of the 
New Age and ANN7 entry in.  There have been a lot 
of – there had been a lot of noise about the New 
Age and the way the Government supported it and it 
seemed to me that these discussions were probably 
20 
around a similar kind of support for ANN7.”  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and this noise you would 
have seen or heard yourself?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No.  What I say about this noise basically 
on social media …  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 93 of 225 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And some sections of the mainstream media 
would also suggest some of it but mostly on social media where there 
would be people who are opinion makers who I would trust who would 
question how this newspaper which is not audited in terms of its 
circulation would command a rate of which it did and how there were 
certain Government Departments and agencies which would actually 
give it the rates that it was commanding despite not having any audited 
circulation figures. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  So then you 
10 
left the first meeting.  Could you please tell the Chairperson about the 
second meeting? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  The second meeting – I am sorry I do not 
remember the date but it was in July  2013.  It was again a Sunday.  So 
this was a day the President was relatively free and he asked us to 
come in the morning.  This time (intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  The first meeting had been in June you said.  Is that 
right? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The first one? 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes.  On the 22 n d … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the second was in J uly? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  July. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes and the meeting was attended exactly 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 94 of 225 
 
by the same people which is Ajay and Atul  Gupta.  There was 
Nazeem Howa.  There was Moegsien  Williams.  There was (indistinct).  
It was coordinated by Ashu  Chawla who also sat in during the meeting 
and this time around we were told that we would be picked up – if I 
remember correctly by Ashu  Chawla.  So – and the thrust of the second 
meeting was on …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  The first meeting I think you said was on 
a Sunday? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right and the second meeting was also on a 
Sunday? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Also on a Sunday, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  But this time in the month of July 2013.  I 
do not remember the exact date because if I had not been – there was 
little reference that I had for this.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Where did Mr Chawla pick 
you up? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  He picked us up from – from the Midrand 
20 
Office and we moved from there – if I remember correctly. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you went to the meeting were you told what 
this meeting was intended to be about?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Oh we were told that it would be much in 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 95 of 225 
 
the lines of the first meeting.  There would be a review of what had 
happened so far and we were also told …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Just a follow up meeting?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  A follow up meeting …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And also there would be inputs that we get 
from the President based on presentation that we had given him.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Also some guidelines on editorial matters as 
well.  So that is …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Something that was told. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you and that is – that is 
what you deal with in paragraph 22 at page 17?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So the meeting reviewed the progress of 
various aspects of the project like the construction of the studio, the 
arrival of broadcast equipment (intervenes).  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Do you remember around what time the 
meeting would have starte d?  I think the first one you said was for …  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Was for 09:30. 
CHAIRPERSON:  09:30 but you came there and you waited for quite 
time before it started?  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 96 of 225 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes.  To the best of my knowledge this was 
also in the morning … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  It was a morning appointment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  There was a third appointment which I 
remember distinctly was in the evening.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Because that was the time w hen we were 
told in the morning had he to leave.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Let us just talk about 
editorial policy. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Who would ordinarily be 
responsible for determining editorial policy?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  What most stations do is that they do not 
have the editorial policy on the fly.  It is a document which is already 
created and which is the Bible as far as what journalists need to follow.  
That they do not have to go back to the editor every time they have – 
20 
you know – a decision to make.  It is a document that is to be kept 
ready and given to each new recruit who comes in and it should factor 
in things like how the news should – there should be a sense of 
balance in the news.  If there are three parties to a particular news 
story that you are doing.  All three should be given adequate 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 97 of 225 
 
representation in the news report that is there in terms of their 
comment.  If there is – there are charges brought out against a 
particular person then he should be given a right to respond to those 
charges.  If he does not respond then that should be entered into the 
things – you know.  So things like this which would ensure a balance a 
sense of neutrality are part of th e editorial policy but – but what I found 
here was that it was more of a propaganda station that they wanted to 
set up rather than a professional television station for news because 
right in this meeting we were told that this should be a station that 
should not just be centred around the African National Congress but to 
10 
the close (indistinct) around President Zuma.  So he would tell us 
things like how …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on, hang on Mr Sundaram.  I think the question 
is ordinarily who would be responsible for formulating editorial policy?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  It will have to be the – the editor and the 
senior editorial team …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And nobody else.  The professional editors 
the journalists. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that as far as you know is universal? 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or almost universal? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Ja that should be the case …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  For most professional … 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 98 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Stations and newspapers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and that has been your experience in the 
various … 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Media houses … 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In which you have worked?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Absolutely yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Ms Norman you can proceed. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Mr Chairman and 
also because you as a consulting editor and the editorial team you 
would be responsible for the editorial policy. You would also make sure 
that you make sure that the independence of – of the media journalism 
and everything else and ethical issues to be adhered to would be 
incorporated in that policy.  Am I right?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Well I – when I came in here I was told that 
the editorial policy is something th at I should not be looking at.  It was 
already decided by the News Age Editorial Policy and we would be 
following the same thing.  So – so for me I understood that time that my 
20 
role in this station would be in terms of just setting it up and I had 
decided pretty early on that I would leave because there was no 
position for an editor in this station.  They just wanted a rubberstamp 
which I thought I would not be but we were – I was told clearly that 
they would be following an editorial policy which was somet hing that 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 99 of 225 
 
was found on the website of the New Age and that is pretty much what 
it would be and of course there was guidance that the President was 
supposed to give us where he said that this would be a station that 
would not just look at the ANC and – and propagate it out of the story 
but within the ANC the team – the (indistinct) of President Zuma was to 
be highlighted and put out.  I am sure he said that we should not 
engage in any direct propaganda in terms of negative stories against 
the rivals.  They s hould – he said that it would be done in a subtle 
fashion.  So that - you know – the credibility of the station is also 
maintained and at the same time – you know – you do the propaganda 
10 
that is intended behind the station.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You use the word “guidance”.  Is that your own word 
or is that what you were told the former President was going give?  Is it 
your own word that you attach to what you were told he was going to 
give or is it the word that was used to tell you what he would do?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Balance? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Guidance. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Which word? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I thought – guidance.  I thought you said …  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Ja guidance. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were told that …  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes.  You see we were told – you know - 
because Ajay Gupta would say please listen to the President carefully 
because we would want to convey to him or we want – we would want 
the President to know that we value what he is saying very much.  So 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 100 of 225 
 
the message that goes to th e President is that we are following his 
guidelines.  That he is the boss.  We are following his guidelines but - 
but he would also tell me that we do not have to listen to everything 
that he says.  You know – we just need to tell him to his face that - you 
know – we are going by what he – what he said but if we like it we take 
it.  If we do not we do not but which meant that – I mean had no 
independent decision making authority in that.  It is if the Guptas liked 
it they would take it.  If they not they wo uld not but to his face they 
would say sir this is what is suggested and this is what you are doing.  
So that is the idea that I had about it and of course President  Zuma’s 
10 
guidance is something that they wanted me as the editor to listen to 
and implement but subject to final approval from the Guptas.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you 
Mr Chairman.  Then so the second meeting then – because you had 
given the form President the presentation and then what was discussed 
then at this meeting.  You have mentioned that the editorial policy was 
one of the matters that we discussed …  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And was that presentation dealt 
20 
with at the second meeting?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I think there were certain things that he 
brought out there – you know.  So for instance the editorial policy is 
one and if I remember correctly there were – you know - I have quoted 
extensively from – from my book …  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 101 of 225 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And this as well and I want to refer to that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You can deal with it. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can deal with it. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that fine with you Ms Norman? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes thank you Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Maybe for record purposes your 
10 
extract is on pages 117 to 122 of your book.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That is correct yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe – maybe we have not – he has not said what 
his book is on record. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  On record yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe you should ask him to …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Oh thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To say what – to identify his book. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Just to give the title. I am 
20 
sure you know it off by heart.  Could you just ...?  
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the title of the book?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  The title of the book is:  Indentured – 
Behind the Scenes at Gupta TV. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 102 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you are the author? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes and it is published by Jacana Media.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And then you confirm the 
contents of the book … 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  As being true and correct …  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  According to your recollection? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So I have given details here about how we 
were picked up by Ashu Chawla and taken.  Then also about how the 
seating arrangement there was identical (intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja tell us about that. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Well the same people who attended the first 
20 
meeting attended the second meeting.  The seating was identical.  You 
know - there was a chair that reserved for the President.  The Head of 
the Gupta delegation was Moegsien  Williams because he was the oldest 
member of the (indistinct) asked to sit on the chair next to the 
President followed by Nazeem Howa.  To the right of the Pr esident the 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 103 of 225 
 
Gupta brothers sat on a couch and across the table from the couch 
(indistinct) and I sat facing the Gupta brothers and the President and …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Just before you move forward 
you say that in paragraph 24 this was like a  shareholders review 
meeting. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes it was. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Why do you say that?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Because – you know – it was a review 
meeting because in the first meeting we showed him the logo that had 
been designed by the designer in India and the second meeting we took 
10 
to him the animated logo which had the music and the sting and all of 
that – you know.  So that is – that is something that plays out on the 
top of the hour before each – each bulletin starts.  So we took that to 
him for his approval.  Although the contract with the person who made 
that design was that he just have one – one shot at it and – you know – 
if it is approved.  So if the President had said that he did not like it 
there was no way that they could go back and get it done again but 
they – they got it to him for his approval.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Is there anything you 
want to highlight between the interaction you had with Mr  Ashu Chawla 
20 
when you were proceed – sorry – I forgot that part when you were 
proceeding to the President’s official residence.  Is there anything you 
want highlight about the interactions you had with him in his car?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  He was somebody who was always edgy – 
you know.  He was somebody who was always preoccupied.  You know 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 104 of 225 
 
that there were 10 things going on in his mind and his handshakes were 
not – you know – they were limp handshakes that he would give out to 
people almost distracted at all times.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Who was that?  I missed that. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Mr Ashu Chawla. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So – and he told us about how he had lived 
in South Africa for about 17 years right from the time and – at that time 
for 17 years – right from the time when Atul  Gupta had come to South 
10 
Africa to set up Sahara Computers he had been part of the team.  I 
have also noted that – you know – rarely smiled but when he spoke 
about his association with Atul Gupta that was a diamond.  We actually 
saw him smile at that point and he also said that he saw himself as a 
regular South African because he had lived here for so long but his 
interest in music was very funny because this was the kind of raunchy 
music that is in the – in Bollywood films and he would play that out loud 
in his car stereo.  So – so from what we saw of him he was somebody 
who was extremely shy.  He was a backroom operator for the Gupta 
family and not somebody who was open to answering too many 
20 
questions or getting - engaging in small talk.  Just if he is driving he 
just keeps driving and answering in monosyllables.  So he was – he 
was like a kind of person and we could almost see that he was very 
nervous about this meeting because he was the person who was 
charged with coordinating this meeting.  So from making sure that the 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 105 of 225 
 
vehicles – the vehicle numbers were given to the President’s office 
before hand to making sure the people were picked up, you know, that 
was co-ordinated to ensure that the President was th ere when the 
Gupta family – brothers arrived, all of that was part of his responsibility 
and that seemed to, you know, kind of keep him in a state which was 
always pre-occupied and – so when he answered questions it was 
almost like his mind was not there.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and in paragraph 25.6 
which you already testified to. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  But there is something that you 
say Rajesh said to you. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes, the seating arrangemen ts I 
(indistinct) to that for the last meeting, Rajesh (indistinct) President to 
give us a broad overview of editorial policy and also some suggestions 
on who we should hire as presenters.  We will hear what he has to say 
but we will not have to do – but we will only do what we think suits our 
vision, Ajay Gupta told us. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    So also about the presenters there was a 
20 
problem because there were many journalists who would not consider 
joining (indistinct) and the kind of reputation that the Gupta’s had so 
they – that was an issue that they wanted to take to the President and 
seek suggestions from him on who they should hire and the President 
did 
assure 
us 
in 
that 
meeting 
that 
he 
would 
make 
a 
few 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 106 of 225 
 
recommendations including Jimmy Manyi who he said was a perfect fit 
for this kind of position and he said that you should call him to the 
studio to audition and if it works out he should definitely be hired.  He 
also suggested a few other names, I do not remember tho se names but 
some of them, I remember were people who were sons and daughters of 
his colleagues of the ANC who he said had good potential and already 
working as journalists at radio stations and he said, you should give 
them a call, tell them that I told y ou to get in touch with them and get 
these things underway.  So that was also, you know, problem solving in 
that sense.  The problem was that the journalists were not joining and 
10 
they took the problem to the President in that meeting and he 
suggested that he would recommend a few names and we could 
approach a few other journalists who he knew very well and say that 
the President asked us to speak with you and will you come and join.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and then in paragraph 25.7 
you deal with what the graphic designers had given you.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes, yes so we played out that graphic 
design and you know and he seemed to be impressed with the graphic 
design as well so we loaded a copy on the laptop and we showed it to 
him. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry Ms Norman did you ask him to deal with 
25.7. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes I’m asking him to deal with 
it thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Oh okay. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 107 of 225 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Maybe… 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    As it was just a formality and we were not 
bound by what he was saying, I was happy to play the game they were 
playing with the president, I noted – ja so I did not know what to make 
of it at that time you know because these were contradictory things that 
he was telling is that one, we will go to the President, seek an 
appointment and ask him what the (indistinct) policy should be on the 
guidelines that he wanted for the television station, on the other hand 
he’s telling us, but we don’t have to listen to all of that, just give him a 
sense that we’re listening to him but we don’t really have to listen to 
10 
him, you know, if we, in our judgement think that what the President 
said is wrong we don’t  have to tell him it’s wrong on his face you know, 
we will go back and do what we want…(interve ntion)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that what you call in paragraph 25.7 of your 
statement, supplementary statement, is that what you call the game 
they were playing with the President?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Ja so it was a game that I thought they 
were playing with the President, you know, we’re going and seeking an 
appointment with him asking him for his views and then saying that well 
we won’t do it so why bother in the first place. Of course by now I’d 
20 
known that the President’s son was a shareholder and what was 
happening was a review.  So while they valued him as a partner in this, 
they wanted to show that they valued him as a partner, but none of the 
advice that was given was – it didn’t really matter, so they said, take 
the advice if you like it, you know, if i t’s implementable we’ll do it 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 108 of 225 
 
otherwise just throw it into the dustbin and we’ll do what we want to do 
and the President, at the next meeting when we came back, you know, 
whatever was possible which we were doing anyways, they would show 
to the President, see like you said we are doing this, like you said we 
are doing that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :    Thank you. So then you said 
then you loaded this – is this the logo (indistinct). 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NOR MAN SC:  That you were working on. 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes so President – okay at that time we 
loaded on the (indistinct) before that meeting Ashraf Jaffer said there 
were a lot of people from the President’s family who were visiting him 
so – and that he would be joining us very shortly while we waiting in 
the very same room which is to the right of the entrance – it was a 
room which had the seating arrangement and on the corner of which 
there was an electric socket on which Ashraf would charge his phone  at 
all times.  So the President arrived shortly and this was a time when he 
had a lot of family members on a Sunday waiting for him in his room 
and he took time out of a family engagement on a Sunday to come and 
20 
spend time here and as far as I remember…(i ntervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry was there much waiting for the meeting to 
start this time?   
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    I don’t remember there was much waiting, 
the first meeting there was and Ajay was getting impatient but I don’t 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 109 of 225 
 
remember for the second meeting there was much of thing but I do 
remember that there were family members with him at that time and he 
took time that he was spending with his family which he’d allocated for 
his family out.  In the first meeting it was time that he was spending 
with his cabinet colleagues which he took out and came here, here he 
made his family wait and come out for this meeting.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:    And 25.9 you talk about when 
the president then arrived. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes the President then arrived shortly 
thereafter and he was shown the channel ID, he was asked to see – so 
10 
he – the President saw it once, now what these channel ID’s are, 
they’re just a few seconds long between 15 and 30 seconds, so if you 
saw it once you may have missed some  of the elements so the 
President saw it three, maybe four times and you know he would pause 
it and see it again to see what the transitions and the graphics were, 
also the music that we added to the graphical elements whether they 
were in sync, he would s top and start and ask us to play it again and 
then he gave us approval and he had a copy of the presentation which 
we had given him the last time and he said he had studied it and he 
said he had a few suggestions that he wanted to give us based on that.  
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and then in 25.10 who said 
you mustn’t convert this into a channel for the ANC?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    This is President Zuma’s advice on 
editorial policy well he said that it should be a channel that, you know – 
I think the general understanding was that the mainstream media in 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 110 of 225 
 
South Africa was not giving an opportunity to come out with the ANC’s 
views, President Zuma’s views that they were amicable in some senses 
to him, so they needed a station that would come out and pr opagate his 
side of the ANC side of news events.  Now having said that, the 
President did not want this to be an out and out propaganda station, he 
wanted it to have (indistinct) of credibility.  So he said that it should 
not block out rivals with the ANC it should not block out political parties 
which were rivals to the ANC as well.  So there should be, you know – 
he said that the push in our favour should be subtle, the push in the 
favour of the (indistinct) around him and the ANC should be subtle.  So 
10 
if are talking about is rivals, it’s not like you black them out entirely or 
block their content entirely but it should be that you show them, show 
them in a negative light so that, in the subtleties the message is 
conveyed and you don’t say it with the word s directly so it doesn’t look 
like not (indistinct) propaganda station as well.  So this is something 
that he said directly and this time he made a reference to ENC and said 
that the ENC only presents the  government and him negatively that’s 
the impression that he had when he was speaking to me.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and then just read the last 
sentence as well of that – what you just read negatively, after that.  
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    We need a channel that presents the 
positives that the government is doing, Zuma said, looking at me.  Now 
I must add here also that this is something which was on the website of 
the New Age in terms of what their editorial policy was.  They said that 
they would look at constructive criticism so – which is not what a news 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 111 of 225 
 
station is supposed to – a news station is supposed to show – is to 
question power, to show a mirror to authority, that’s what a station is 
supposed to do, not just show the positive sides of things but like I said 
by this time I had already kno wn that this is not a station that I want to 
associate – although I was getting a fantastic salary and every time I 
would mention this to any of the senior guys, they’d tell me, oh you’re 
getting a fat salary just sit on that fancy chair and, you know enjo y your 
life why would you do that but for – from the stations that I’d worked in 
before, the kind of journalism that I believed in, this kind of thing is 
something which made me decide pretty early on that I would not want 
10 
to be in the station for much longer than after launch.  And why did I 
want to stay till after launch, because I’d already, on my own credibility 
and reputation had asked other senior journalists from India to come 
and join the station who had come, not only themselves but with their 
families and got their children in school and for me to now jump off 
before the launch would have been not the right thing to do at that time 
but I had decided then that this is not a station that I had any long -term 
plans for and that I would quit, so all of this was just re-enforcing that 
belief for me. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes, just – as a lay  person, is 
20 
it possible for a journalist to do what you were asked to do in that 
paragraph, look you portrayed certain things in a particular way and 
you portray other things in a particular way to perhaps push a 
particular narrative.  Is it possible for journalists to actually do that?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Well they shouldn’t be doing that but I’m 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 112 of 225 
 
sure if somebody thinks that their job at a station depends  on doing 
this and they had no other option, there are journalists who would be 
forced to do this, I mean, there would be some who would refuse to do 
it and just move out but if it is between unemployment and economic 
hardships at the other end or compromi sing on your values, there would 
be certain journalists who would be willing to do this as well.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :     Yes and then during your time 
at AN7, I know I’m jumping a bit, would you say that whatever it is as 
the editor at the time, whatever it is that was sold to the public or sent 
out publically from that TV station, was reliable news and you did not 
10 
do things the way in which 25.10 suggested?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    I would say that my role as an editor was 
for about a few weeks after the launch and most of my time was taken 
up in setting up the station.  So you know, it was really a struggle, on 
the one hand setting the station, training the staff, getting the 
processes in place and on the other hand dealing with Atul Gupta who’s 
like a dragon breathing on my shoulder about how things had to be 
done fast and all of that.  There was a tremendous amount of pressure 
that he was putting on the technical team.  In my experience a station 
should be launched only after about a month of dry  runs.  We did a lot 
20 
of mugs, like for instance, the graphic systems would be made in 
Europe somewhere, the main servers would have come from America, 
the lighting systems would have come from another part of the world, 
the cameras may have come from Japan .  For these systems to speak, 
you know, once the integration happens there are a lot of bugs that are 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 113 of 225 
 
thrown up, the (indistinct) comes from another company and you know 
for it to all start working together it takes about a month where the 
technical team and the editorial team should work closely eliminate 
those bugs and only the launch – then the launch should happen but in 
this case what had happened was Ajay Gupta and Atul Gupta had 
already decided the launch date without consulting the professionals 
and for us it was – we knew that there was a train coming in the 
opposite direction at double the speed and we’re on the same track, we 
had our hands tied behind our back and we had to go in for that launch 
and we knew it was a disaster but as professionals we had to commit 
10 
suicide, you know, there was no other option for us because the 
technical team was under constant pressure, the vendors were 
supposed to deliver, for instance, the studio cameras came on the last 
day, the day that the launch was supposed to take place they were still 
fitting the robotic cameras.  Now these robotic cameras require the 
vendor to come in and for training to be given, there are a lot of bugs 
that are there.  In terms of the bugs, if I can explain, on the day of the 
launch there were – the teleprompter would black out suddenly, you 
know, it would go blank totally and the anchors who were reading it 
were not professional broadcast anchors but they models who were 
20 
being trained and the (indistinct) since they did not want to hire a ny 
South Africans because they thought they would be more expensive, 
they got people from India who spoke very little English, so the cues 
would go (indistinct) and the teleprompter failed and the anchor who’s 
not a professional journalist would be sitting  there petrified because – 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 114 of 225 
 
the standard operating procedure is for the PCR to tell her, that look, 
there’s a technical failure, why don’t you just announce a break right 
now and come back, we’ll fix the bug and we’ll come back here but they 
would come back to her in Hindi and she would not know what is 
happening and all of that and there was a world out there looking at the 
launch and they would tweet about all of that, take pictures and put it 
out and that was, I think, the most depressing time of my life because, 
you know, in my entire career I had never seen a train wreck like that 
and you know, to be heading that – very little say in the way things 
were, it was the saddest, saddest phase of my life and through no fault 
10 
of mine because this is something that Atul Gupta and Ajay Gupta had 
done for the pure greed, you know, they knew that the station had to 
start on time because then the revenues would start to come on time 
and then all the shareholders would start getting their cuts of the 
dividend earlier than possible, they were not really bothered about it.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes so those were the logistical 
nightmares that you experienced, I’m interested more in content.  If I 
go back and I watch the news that AN7 showed and communicated to 
the public, during the period, just immediately after it’s launch until you 
left, can I comfortably say as a South African citizen, what I watched 
20 
was reliable news? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    I wouldn’t say that because I remember 
there were editorial meeting s that we held with – you know because the 
people that we’d hired for the kind of budgets that we had were very 
young journalists, very hardworking journalists, I mean I’ve set up 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 115 of 225 
 
stations and I know that the bunch that we had here were very, very 
hardworking, they wouldn’t complain about the long working hours or 
the fact that there was problems with the systems and these were 
young journalists who were idealists, you know, so most of the times I  
found that the editorial meetings were hijacked by Nazeem H owa who 
would say things like, you know, if there was a (indistinct) press 
conference don’t even cover that or there’s a new political party that 
being formed well why should we give them any access.  My thoughts 
on this would have been that anybody who is  a political entity, it’s not 
my business as a journalist to decide that I’m going to allow the to 
10 
have a voice or not, my business was to cover that and let the people 
decide if they want to hear it or not, you know.  Which was not the 
case, because like I said the word I’m using is hijacked, it was hijacked 
by people like Nazeem Howa and Moegsiem Williams who would trust 
the same philosophy they had done in the New Age onto this you know 
and I had (indistinct) to take a backseat and this was a few days be fore 
I resigned and decided to move out.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes so this – people bring this 
content to the editorial team, you are part of that team, I just want to 
understand would you allow them to highjack it and push it the way they 
20 
wanted it to go or would you as the responsible editor that you are, say, 
you cannot do this, this is not done and therefore I will not support the 
publication of this particular news, or how did it work?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Well I would register my complaint, tell 
them that this is the thing but of course Mr Nazeem Howa was the CEO 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 116 of 225 
 
and for all practical purposes he said that he was a journalist before he 
came in there and for me, well I had experience working in India, in Sri 
Lanka and the Middle East and som e bits in Pakistan, this was my very 
first time in South Africa so I had to give in to the fact that he was a 
person that knew the political situation in South Africa far better than 
me and the options I had was to either move out of it to either lead, 
which I couldn’t because clearly I had just come to South Africa a few 
weeks before or a few months before or to get out of the way and I 
chose to get out of the way because I did not agree with what was 
happening.  If I were to apply the rules of journalism that I had learned 
10 
in journalism school and which I had followed all my life, I would have 
said, all political parties, if they have a press conference, please cover 
it, if there’s any view that anybody has out there, please cover it, put it 
on the air and let the people decide.  We should not get into censorship 
at any point specially in editorial policy, especially when you have an 
editorial team which is as young as what we had at that time, there 
should not have been any scope for influencing the young minds on 
how to do their journalism because most of the young people who had 
joined us as reporters at that time had come from Universities where 
they knew what good journalism was about, how they were supposed to 
20 
go about it, that was being corrupted by t he kind of views that Mr 
Nazeem Howa was giving in the editorial meetings.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes you see I’m not a journalist 
I just want to understand whose responsibility it is to make sure that 
news that goes out is reliable news, whose re sponsibility is it? 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 117 of 225 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    It is the editors responsibility and it is the 
collective responsibility of the editorial team but I think the buck stops 
with the editor and I was frustrated, you know, and I was told more than 
one occasion that look, you have a fancy salary, you have a fancy chair 
to sit on, why don’t you just sit there, you’ve already set up the station 
and you know, look the other way and I was quoted – I was also told 
that look at Moegsiem Williams you’ll see him, you know, At ul Gupta 
has got a cell phone on which the movement of all the journalists in the 
New Age can be monitored 24hour basis.  He knows how many minutes 
a journalist at the New Age is taking a cigarette break or has gone out 
10 
to have coffee or if he’s gone out on an assignment, how long has he 
taken to come back.  That is the kind of monitoring that Atul Gupta 
used to do of the team and he had people within the newsroom, 
including Mr Aslim whose job it was to report back to him on each and 
every development that was happening in the newsroom.  What were 
the editors – he went to the extent that, how long is the toilet break 
that people are taking or something that he knew, he had CCTV 
cameras all around.  If Mr Moegsiem Williams could live with that at 
New Age why couldn’t you live with whatever was happening, you know, 
let them micromanage for you. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes, would you then say that 
having given that – you’ve given some justification for it as to why you 
would have, perhaps turned a blind eye to what you were supposed to 
do but would you agree with me then that by doing so you might have 
compromised what came out of that news station because of the 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 118 of 225 
 
various reasons that you’ve given that you’ve got someone interfering 
with the editorial matters and also there’s threats that look, if you don’t 
do what you’ve been told to do you might have to leave.  Was there a 
point where you felt you know that, look, here I allowed myself to be 
put in a position where any editor shouldn’t be put in?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Well you know, one of the reasons why I 
decided to come to South Africa was, the kind of romance that I 
associated with South Africa.  Growing up in India, we – I used to read 
the papers everyday about the struggles that were happening, the 
leaders like, Nelson Mandela, the kind of – the various actors I was 
10 
very inspired by that, it was part of the textbooks when we were 
studying the garment if India was very much, you know, part of a band 
that was there on the apartheid regime here.  I stil l remember the first 
passport that I got had printed on it, you know, that on this passport 
you cannot travel to the Republic of South Africa which is part of the 
garment of India’s policy on the apartheid regime.  So for me, coming 
to South Africa and wor king with the young team of South Africans was 
a dream of sorts, you know, so I thought it was worthwhile for me to 
leave my young daughters and family to come for this project and 
convince my family about it but I have regret right now that I was part 
20 
of a team that I set up a television station for what I see was the mafia 
for purposes of propaganda which is not something that I wanted to do 
and I think this is the biggest regret that I have in my life and one of 
the reason why I wrote the book, you know,  if I wanted I could have just 
started on with my life and gone on but I took a few months off to write 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 119 of 225 
 
the book immediately after I came back, because I knew that it was not 
enough for me to just have run away from there, I had to tell the story 
to the others.  Even now, after the book was written I went through a 
kidney transplant just a few months ago, and you know, after writing the 
book, if I did not come and testify here, the regret that I had would 
have stayed with me.  So this is, in some senses, a kind of closure for 
me, you know, that I can come and testify here and tell you the 
circumstances in which I served, the circumstances in which I quit, the 
circumstances in which they became very hostile and almost had to run, 
you know, I feared for my life and the future of my children in the last 
10 
days here.  So yes, I do regret the fact that I set up a station for the 
mafia which was to be used for propaganda and – but to be honest I 
had thought – you know because I wasn’t a (indistinct) at that time 
because if I had quit a few days after I had joined, I would put the 
careers of the colleagues that I’d got with me in jeopardy, that already 
got their kids out of school and it’s very difficult to get admission in 
schools in India, once you’ve taken them out you know, and then they 
had relocated here, they put their kids in schools and for me to quit and 
leave without the channel settling in any way would have been unfair 
but I had taken a decision very early that I would quit the station, this 
20 
is not the place I want to work but allude after I launch it, you know, I 
was the captain of the ship I wouldn’t desert it in the middle I would 
take it to a particular conclusion which is the launch (indistinct) I do 
not agree with any of this and I would quit and I wou ld go. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:   So can we then – just to 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 120 of 225 
 
summarise that, can we accept that whatever came out, during the time 
just after the launch, until you left, was compromised news which 
happened under your watch?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    I would agree with that, I would say yes.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :   Yes thank you 
CHAIRPERSON:    You have told us about the first meeting and you’ve 
told us about the second meeting. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You told us about the people who attended these two 
meetings, as far as I recall you didn’t include – you didn’t say that Mr 
10 
Duduzane Zuma was present at any of these first two meetings.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    No he wasn’t as a matter of fact he was 
not involved in any of the decision making it was his father who was – 
who would act like a shareholder in this, he did make a few 
appearances…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had you met him by the time of the second meeting, 
had you met Mr Duduzane Zuma?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    No I haven’t. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this was what – the second meeting happened 
when you were in your second month in South Africa or what?  
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes in July. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In July, that you arrived in…  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    In June. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In June. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 121 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Early June? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes it was the 3 r d of June, so today is the 
sixth year…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh ja first week of June?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So it was now July, so it was your second month. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had not met him yet?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had met – had you met all the other Directors of 
10 
the company in (indistinct) media as you understood them at that stag e, 
other than him? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes I’d met Laxmi Goel, I’d met the Gupta 
brothers, I’d met Moegsiem and I’d met Nazeem Howa.  I did not meet 
Duduzane until the day of the third meeting.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So was he the only Director of your employer that you 
had not met by the time of the second meeting?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay, alright. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:   Thank you, Mr Chairman I’m 
20 
told 
that 
it’s 
1 
o’clock, 
may 
we 
then 
adjourn 
for 
lunch 
until…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes okay we’ll adjourn for lunch now and we’ll 
resume at 2 o’clock.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 122 of 225 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  I beg your pardon.  Just to 
bring to your attention during the lunch or the long adjournment we 
were furnished with an affidavit which is deposed to by Mr Moegsien 
Williams together with letters and some annexures to it.  We beg leave 
to simply hand this up for your information at this stage and that we 
propose that we would like to deal with it in the morning if that is 
possible? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think read – have time to read unless you say you 
10 
have read it? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  I have read it but because the 
Chairperson and Mr Sundaram have not had time to have a look at it I 
was going to propose that maybe we deal with it in the morning or 
would you like me to read it into the record?  
CHAIRPERSON:  But what is the affidavit about?  Is it an application 
for anything? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  There is no notice of motion.  It 
is just an affidavit but the letter from the attorneys makes this 
statement which I think…  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think reflect on it exactly what should happen ja.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  And let you know in the 
morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja because…  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Thank you.  Thank you Mr 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 123 of 225 
 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot just send a statement.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  An affidavit without indicating what the purpose is.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes that is what is also 
puzzling us.  Thank you.  Thank you.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you need to – to examine it and – and we take it 
from there. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you very much.  Thank 
you Mr Chairman.  Thank you may we then proceed?  Mr Sundaram 
10 
could you just go back… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe I must just check this.  Mr Sundaram is 
available in South African for how long?  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  He is available tomorrow.  He is 
leaving tomorrow at – in the evening.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now the implicated persons got enough time to apply 
for leave to cross-examine and the time expired and there was no 
application. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe make sure that when we adjourn I do get 
that affidavit informally. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you can deal with it formally tomorrow 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 124 of 225 
 
morning. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  As you please Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that to the extent that it may contain a version that 
should be put to Mr Sundaram. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That can be explored. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  We will do that. Tha nk 
you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Thank you.   
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Thank you.  We – on page – 
page 20?  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  You wanted to highlight… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Also – so we – we need to check whether the person 
who has given – who has deposed to that affidavit as indicted that he 
or she is available to take the witness stand.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not necessarily tomorrow. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If and when required to by the commission.   
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes we will do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know when they apply for leave to cross -examine. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 125 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  They deal with that. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now he or she is not applying for leave to cross -
examine. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it might be helpful to know that  the person is 
making his or her version on the understanding that if required they 
have no problem coming to testify to that version.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Testify.  We will do that Mr 
Chairman.  Thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you very much.  Yes 
thank you Mr Sundaram there is one – you wanted to highlight 
something in 25.11 at page 9 – 21 I beg your pardon yes?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes – oh yes I – the part of the meeting you 
know he – President Zuma had giv en us an example of how the 
coverage should be.  So he was telling us that in a few days from that 
meeting he would be going to Mpumalanga and that he would expect 
that ENCA and the other stations would give him a bad publicity about 
it and he also said that they would go there to the local area and get 
20 
sound bites from the people about how the policies and the 
programmes of the government were not working and that is what they 
would highlight when they do a story on that.  So that is when Ajay 
Gupta suggested that we would send a team with you on that – on the 
flight that you going to and we do a positive coverage.  To which he 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 126 of 225 
 
said… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was that coverage be that of the New Age the 
newspaper? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No for the television station whic h was still 
being… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Had it started? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No it had not started there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  But he wanted to get it into a practice and 
[indistinct] that is the time when we were – when we were – we had our 
10 
teams out and they were going out and filming. So – but what the 
President said that if you come there with me on the flight it would be a 
very shallow kind of a report that you can put out and it may not – it 
will seem like propaganda because you will go and  talk to people and 
sound bites of how things are working and all of that.  But what he 
wanted instead was an advanced team of reporters to go before each 
visit that he made to various provinces and to do stories about how the 
programmes were working indeed and then follow it up with a visit so 
that overall you know it was not just a report on that particular day but 
a series of reports that came before his visit and which – you know so 
20 
the viewer was reinforced when the President came there and he gave 
a speech and put that out.  So – so to which Ajay Gupta said that yes 
you know we will send a team with you and we will send an advanced 
team as well because we have got various bureaus across the country 
and they could do – be the advanced team that sends us  these visuals.  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 127 of 225 
 
So it was planning down to that level that happened during the – during 
the second meetings in terms of the editorial approach that one was to 
take. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  And you – do 
you want to highlight something on that page other than what you have 
just testified to? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Oh you see also there was a brief that was 
given to the President about the technology that was available.  For 
instance the satellite trucks that they had they – our broadcast vans 
and also each of the bureaus had a live device which was – which 
10 
primarily worked on the – on bandwidth.   So he was told that these 
devices were available and that the station could go live with any of 
events from anywhere in the country.  So tho se were the briefings that 
were given to him about he could use the technology that was available 
with the station for his own publicity and all of that and which is 
something that he listened to very – paid a lot of attention to. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMA N SC:  Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But – were you – you were dealing with what is in 
25.18. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Point 11. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right paragraph 25.18?  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes my apology yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No 11, 12, 13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  He has compressed I think 11, 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 128 of 225 
 
12 and 13. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  He has summarised basically 
what is in 20 – yes 11, 12 and 13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that in paragraph 25.13 you – you have I think 
within quotes among others this statement that you attribute to Mr Ajay 
Gupta at the meeting ‘we can send reporters with you and we will also 
send reporters in advance’. 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ‘The positives of the government will surely be 
highlighted’ and then you say Ajay answered with folded hands.  Could 
you remember all those details when you wrote the book?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I wrote the book within…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Without any – any notes that you had made?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No I wrote this book – the book was 
released in 2018 but I wrote this book within months of leaving there.  
You know I started as soon as I left I had – was in touch with Bridget 
Impey from Jacana Media and I had started writing from my 
20 
recollection.  So I had started writing all of this immediately then and 
sending the chapters across to my publisher.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us say the – you started writing about what – 
about a month after you left, about two months after you left, about 
three months how long? 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 129 of 225 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No immediately as soon as I reached I had 
taken a break I decided that I will not take up any other assignment 
until the time I had the book out of my head.  So I travelled to – I 
started writing in Delhi then I – you know I thought that I needed 
seclusion to write so I travelled to Nepal to Kathmandu to Pokhara then 
I came back.  There was a conference I had to attend in New Jersey…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm yes but I am trying to get the time…  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So within days. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That I – that lapsed since you left and you started 
writing the book? 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I think it was a matter of days.  You know as 
soon as I came back to Delhi I had immediately started writing the book 
and I think even in the interviews that I was giving at that time to the 
media I had told them that I am writing this book and that I would have 
– it will be a tell all book and it will have all the details tha t I have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But of course the second meeting was during your – 
the second meeting that you have testified about had – took place 
during your second meeting – second month in South Africa which was 
July? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And as I understand your – your statement you only 
left around September is that right?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So between the date of that meeting in July – second 
meeting to the time that you left you had not written any notes that 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 130 of 225 
 
recorded to what had happened at the meeting?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I had not recorded any notes but I did 
remember because these were very important meetings during my – 
[indistinct] there the meeting with the President and I had remembered 
all the details also v ery vividly because there were not usual meetings 
and usual conversations.  They were very unusual and a lot of the 
things really stuck in my head because…  
CHAIRPERSON:  No I am just – I am just – think about remembering 
that when he said – made a certain statement he had – his hands were 
folded.   
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was – were his hands folded throughout the whole 
meeting? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No you see whenever he said something 
like this where he needed validation you know he would f old his hand 
and say that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  You know in a sign of sincerity that he was 
saying it with all sincerity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  But that is something that I remembered 
because – because here was somebody w ho was trying to sell an idea 
to the President. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And he wanted to appear and he did that.  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 131 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  You know in those meetings and that is 
something that I remember because these where cha racters and these 
were you know the kind of gestures that they make which really sticks 
to ones’ mind. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And when I was writing that book I just put 
all of that in together.  Because I remember these things very vividl y. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Like I remember them because they were 
10 
very unusual because I had never been part of such meetings ever 
before where such things were discussed.  And I do remember the 
mannerisms, the body language that were there . 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  In meetings that did not involve the President 
was Mr Ajay Gupta in the habit of folding his arms like that maybe or is 
it something that you only saw at these meetings with the President?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Only in these meetings with the President 
because other meetings I see basically it was Atul Gupta who was the 
hands on person from the family. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Who was looking at this.  Ajay’s interest in 
this would come when you meeting the President or he would have an 
occasional visit with his – you know half a dozen body guards that he 
would come from time to time.  But apart from that he was not directly 
associated with the day to day operations there.  It was more Atul 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 132 of 225 
 
Gupta. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes./ 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Who was the [indistinct] because you know 
hands on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Almost on a 24/7 basis on this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Thank you.  Thank you Mr 
Chairman.  And then you in paragraph 25.1 5 because you have already 
dealt with the names that the President had given you of persons that 
10 
you were supposed to approach.  You deal with that in 25.14.  Then 
25.15. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes so I thought that this was getting into 
an internal HR meeting as well because you know he allocated to us of 
a time on a Sunday where he was supposed to spend time with his 
family with the ANN7.  And like I have said before you know his interest 
in the meetings was like a full shareholder.  He wanted to know the 
details, he wanted to help out.  There were issues that the other 
directors could not resolve that were being brought to his notice being 
the President for him to resolve and one of the issues that was brought 
20 
also was about – and I have written there about how the commercial 
aspects of all of this really intrigued me at that time.  And also the 
statements that were being made you know like how the DA – somebody 
said there was – we had a very effective PR machinery and they would 
churn out press releases every day twisting facts and turning them 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 133 of 225 
 
against the government.  So this is the kind of statements that were 
being made there.  And also the fact about who to hire you know which 
was – something which was an internal decision was also taken to the 
President.  Like the – so that was something that was also discussed 
there during that time.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  And then you seemed to have 
posed a question with Nazeem and what he told you?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes you see because I had asked him you 
know because until that time it was not very clear to me on why we 
were giving these presentations to President Zuma we were just told 
10 
and we were doing it.  So we had a very hectic schedule you know it 
was almost working from morning until late in the nig ht in the process 
of setting up the station.  All of us were actually even the young 
reporters, young team that had come in there were putting in 12, 13, 14 
hours some days.  They would come in very early and go back in a 
dropping that they got from the office which was well after ten o’clock 
in the night.  So I thought it was a little funny that we spending so 
much time there you know hours giving a briefing to the [indistinct].  
You know why we were doing that so he told me that oh do you not 
know already that his son is a shareholder in this and that is when I got 
20 
to know about it – about his direct involvement in the project.  And also 
about the potential conflict of interest.  I was also told about around 
that time that why the President was involved in  this project was 
because he would then influence commercial decisions as well in terms 
of the advertising that they will get from the various [indistinct] 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 134 of 225 
 
agencies and ministries and since his son was a shareholder in it he 
would get a portion of that.  So this is something that was 
acknowledged very openly by the team that including Nazeem and it 
was something that was very valuable to the staff there you know to the 
senior management that that was the arrangement we had – the 
president would help get the  government advertising and the influence 
in other ways using his high office and whatever commercial benefits 
that came of it a portion of that would go back to his son and which I 
thought was a clear conflict of interest which everybody seemed to be 
very happy about at that point.  So the whole idea was that Mr Laxmi 
10 
Goel who was in the joint venture would bring in the - you know since 
he came from a family of broadcasters he would make the investments 
and the technology.  The actual real estate the offic e and the influence 
would be the Gupta family and Duduzane was there because then he 
would use his father’s office to get commercial benefits for the 
television station which would then be shared by all the three partners.  
And Mr Duduzane would get to the  extent of ownership that he had in 
the station a share of the profits.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And all of that – that is not 
something that was discussed at any of the meetings is what you heard 
20 
outside the meetings where the President was – was present.  Because 
my understanding is that you were not part of the meetings that we 
dealing with business. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No I was not – I was not part of that.  That 
was you know we were – Arum Aggarwal and me we were asked to 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 135 of 225 
 
move out and only then those things took place.  But how we found out 
about that was whenever there was what is known as an executive 
committee meeting which was all the executives meetings in the 
morning to discuss what are the challenges, what are the issues, what 
are the achievements.  Some of those issues which were discussed in 
the second half were brought in there.  That is how I knew about the 
independent collection commission how you know the New Age had to 
speak with the President to get a share of the – the millions of dollars 
that they had – millions of rands that they had in advertising.   Or the 
kind of influence you know for instance in that executive committee 
10 
there will be somebody from – from the marketing team who would 
come and say well we want such and such a  minister and we also want 
his ministry to pay for the venue and the breakfast that is provided 
there but they seem a little reluctant so probably we should take it up 
in the next meetings and – with President Zuma and he would use his 
influence to get that minister to come for this.  And any of the other 
challenges that they had would be discussed there and that is how I 
came to know about what was happening in the second half of the 
meetings. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Alright okay.  Thank you.  And 
20 
then – so is there anything else in 25.18 that you want to highlight 
before we move onto the third meeting?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Ja so this is how it was you know.  But they 
had a similar model which was working for the New Age and that is the 
model that they want to replicate here.  The difference being that they 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 136 of 225 
 
would have Laxmi Goel here who would bring in the investments that 
would go into setting up the infrastructure and this was pretty much the 
routine that was there.  The utility of each of the part ners was Laxmi 
Goel would bring in the money that would make the infrastructure the 
Gupta Brothers would have the real estate and you know they will 
provide the infrastructure in terms of the situation in South Africa and 
President Zuma through Duduzane wo uld ensure that there was a 
healthy flow of commercials that came in from the government side and 
each of them got a share of that money through their ownership as 
dividends as {indistinct]. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Okay thank you.  And then 
could you then tell the Chairperson about the third meeting that you 
say took place and when did it take place and where?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Oh this was in the first week of August 2013 
I do not remember the exact date but unlike the other meetings this 
took place in the evening.  I remember that…  I am sorry.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It will be important to – for the commission to look at 
the – at government advertisements that went into both the N ew Age 
20 
and ANN7 over a certain period of time and to see how it grew.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it did grow.  I know that there was evidence given I 
think last year or even early this year.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 137 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  In relation to GCIS.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  That is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is important to have a clear idea of all 
government departments and parastatals to what extent there may have 
been government advertisements that we nt there and to what extent if 
any. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It might have been different from government 
advertisements that go – that went to any other TV station.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or newspapers and compare.  I know that when I was 
– I had evidence in relation to GCIS I was shown grafts.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  That is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As to how it grew from a certain level to a certain 
level in regard to certain departments inc luding certain premier ’s 
offices and so on.  I still have a recollection of that  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it would be important to have a look at that with 
reference to the dates of the meetings that the witness is talking abo ut. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was the position before?  What was the position 
after?  Does it appear like there was a change an increase or not?  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As a matter of fact. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes thank you Chair. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 138 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then what one can make of that is another matter.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes there is a bit that we have 
done with the one witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  That we intend to call. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Where she has only 
concentrated on the SABC and all the other TV stations.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  And yes but it is limited.  But I 
10 
hear you Chair we could p erhaps just expand on that before we call 
that witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Thank you.  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yes Mr 
Sundaram you said you cannot recall the date it was in 2013 and in 
relation to the launch of the ANN7 when exactly do you think it took 
20 
place?  Was it a day before the launch or was it…  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No this was about a few weeks before the 
launch. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So because the launch was in – a few 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 139 of 225 
 
weeks before because I think this is in August some time.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I would not recall the exact date but the las t meeting 
which is the fourth meeting was one day before the launch that is when 
the President came to the Midrand office of ANN7.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  But this happened in – at the residence, the 
same place in Pretoria at his residence.  We first went to the room on 
the right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is now the third meeting?  
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  The third meeting yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes, 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So we first…  
CHAIRPERSON:  I think start from how it came about that you were told 
about the meeting and so on. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Ja I was told in the morning you know while 
I was busy with production of the drive [indistinct] bulletins that we 
were making.  I was told that we have to go in the evening to meet the  
President and that we have to take samples of the best bulletins that 
we produced.  So I was not proud of the bulletins we were making at 
20 
that time because half the equipment had not come, the training was 
not complete and this was just something that we were doing for 
internal consumption.  So I was not very happy with showing that as a 
proof of what the quality of the station would be at that time. But I was 
told that oh you do not worry about that the President would not know 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 140 of 225 
 
about quality and production and all of that.  You bring whatever is 
there and we will show it to him.  Because I think there was a thought 
that you know you can show him a lot of presentations on paper but if 
he actually sees a bulletin – if he actually sees a graphic that will 
convey much more to his mind that just seeing empty presentations. So 
they were very – very eager to show what was being produced.  And 
this was also the first meeting in which Duduzane was present.  So I 
remember the – we were ushered into the room – meeting on the right 
where Duduzane had come in and he was told by the Gupta brothers 
that you know we have a surprise for you today and we have a bulletin 
10 
which we have produced and all of that.  And in preparation for the 
meeting Ashu Chawla was asked to arrange for a player you know we 
had recorded the bulletin on a chip and that chip was to be played 
before the President on a player.  And also there was a broadcast 
monitor that was brought in for this particular meeting.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm before you proceed I am sorry.  The first two 
meetings as I understand your evidence were at the President’s official 
residence in Pretoria? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the third meeting at the same venue?  
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Ja the same venue.  It was the sam e venue. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the same room?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  There were two rooms here you know. We 
initially started at the room to the right.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 141 of 225 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  But then when we told Duduzane that we 
have these bulletins that we wan t to show him he said, why do we not 
come to the other room there is a large TV there.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And we can show it to him there.  
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And that was a room which had a lot of 
seating arrangements. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  There was a large TV on one side on the 
10 
wall. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And when we were trying to hook the wires 
we realised that the wire that we had got with us we were short on that 
– the cable was short. So then we decided to go with the plan even to 
show him on the small monitor that we got with us.  So we were told 
that the President is coming into that room and we quickly put that 
together and showed him the bulletins.  But this was the firs t time 
Duduzane – I had met Duduzane and he was actually looking at 
something and he was excited about that the fact that bulletins had 
20 
been produced and he was knowing that it actually got to a stage where 
we were making all of this.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you – before this meeting with that meeting had 
you in the meantime met Mr Duduzane Zuma or were you meeting him 
for the first time at this meeting?  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 142 of 225 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I was meeting him for the first time.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I was actually introduced to him for the first 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  In the room on the right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  You know because that is when he said we 
will go to the other room and he took us all to that other ro om. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm okay. 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Which was there. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  And in paragraph 
26 you mention that Mr Williams was not at that meeting?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  He was not at that meeting because he was 
in Cape Town on that day and also by that time there was serious 
differences that Mr Arun Aggarwal had with the Gupta family.  This was 
a bit of a tough war you know because we had two joint venture 
partners who were deeply suspicious of each other.  Laxmi Goel and 
the Gupta family.  So the reason why they were upset with Arun 
Aggarwal was because he was brought in head of business and he 
20 
represented Mr Laxmi Goel.  But he was not given access to the 
financials of the company. As a matter of fact it was the CFO of th e 
Gupta family who was running the whole operations and every time Mr 
Aggarwal wanted to meet her she would deny him an appointment, keep 
hanging.  If he wanted some information that was not given to him and 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 143 of 225 
 
that is when I realised that there was some kind  of a tussle going on 
between the joint venture partners as well you know in terms of sharing 
financial information.  In terms of sharing where the money that was 
invested or brought into the project was being invested and put out.  So 
there was reluctance on the part of the Gupta’s to share that with them.  
And they also would snub Mr Arun Aggarwal at every occasion that they 
could get to the extent that they would deny him access.  He would 
come and sit in the office the whole day with no work.  He had an  
accountant who was reporting into him and that accountant who was a 
young boy of – in his early twenties was also getting direct instructions 
10 
from the CFO from the Gupta side and also from the Gupta family 
directly. So they were giving him an – a sense that he was not required 
anymore and there and that he is not welcome.  And in that meeting I 
was told very bluntly when I asked Nazeem whether Mr Arun Aggarwal 
should be informed about it.  He said no we do not really need to 
involve him anymore in the project.  So they had decided unilaterally to 
just get rid of him and true enough I think in a few weeks they created 
such conditions that he had to go back to India and – because they had 
clipped his wings and made him ineffective in the operations.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes.  So then at that third 
20 
meeting minus the two. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  It would have been yourself 
who else was there? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  There was Ajay Gupta, Atul Gupta, Nazeem 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 144 of 225 
 
Howa and me and Duduzane who also [indistinct] up and the President 
who came directly to the room on the right of the entrance.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  On the left actually, to the left of the 
entrance. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and when you say it was 
held in the evening what time more or less was it?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I would not remember correctly but this was 
– this – it would be about four or five you know early evening.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Early evening. 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Alright thank you.  And then 
could you then tell the Chairperson what happened what was discussed 
at that meeting? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Well at that meeting they showed the 
President the – you know the bulletins that had been produced.  Like I 
said I was not very keen that they show those to the President because 
those were not produced very well.  We did not have a fully operational 
production control room and most of these bulletins had been produced  
on a nonlinear editing system you know which is basically on a 
20 
timeline.  And it had a lot of rough edges.  Also the angles there were 
very – very raw and you know there were a lot of fumbles and 
hesitations in each of the you know multiple takes that wer e there 
which were not edited out properly.  But they insisted that we show this 
to him.  The President walked into the room and we had connected that 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 145 of 225 
 
television with the small monitor and he saw the bulletin. I – I would 
have thought that – you know – the Head of State and the kind of other 
appointments that he would have he would just probably see if for two 
minutes and then just move on but to my surprise he saw a full 15 
minutes of the bulletin that was produced very intently and that was 
before one of the Gupta brothers said okay.  You have seen it.  So we 
just forward to the next bulletin.  So he said no I want to see the whole 
thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That is when Duduzane came in and said 
10 
that oh - you know - probably daddy wants  to – he is – he is impressed 
by the anchors and he wants to look at them.  That is why he wants to 
watch it and not because of anything else and there was laughter in – 
in the room at that time.  Also Duduzane was the one who introduced to 
his father the fact that these bulletins were made and he said you know 
dad we have got these bulletins but then a few minutes before that he 
did not even know that – you know – what the status of the project was 
or whether the bulletins were being introduced.  He was ju st called a 
few minutes before by the Gupta brothers that they had got bulletins to 
show his father.  So yes and the Gupta brothers were just smiling 
20 
indulgently when he was doing all of that – you know – that charade in 
front of us and his father. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now if the first two meetings were on a Sunday was 
this one also on a Sunday?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  This was a week day.  To the best of my 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 146 of 225 
 
knowledge … 
CHAIRPERSON:  A week day? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And also – you know …  
CHAIRPERSON:  In the evening, during the day?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No this was in the evening. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This was the evening? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  During …? 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Between four and five – if I remember 
correctly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A working day? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Anything in 28.3 and four 
that you want to highlight?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So this is – you know – I have given details 
20 
about how when I was in the production control room with the bulletin 
that is when I got a call saying that we have a President – an 
appointment with the President in the evening.  He wants a quick 
review of the project.  So this is something that was sought by the 
President.  That was the impression that I was given by Atul  Gupta that 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 147 of 225 
 
the President had sought a review – a meeting and that – that he would 
like to see bulletins that we have produced over the  last few days.  We 
have to make him happy to make sure that we take the bulletins to him.  
The majority of the stories show him in good light.  I do not want the 
bulletins to be filled with Malema.  This was around the time when 
Malema had just left the ANC and his – he had started his own political 
party and that was the time also where the – the brothers wanted us to 
have bulletins that were – that were full of good images of the 
President and had very little – but this was the time when we were 
producing bulletins without any putting pressure on the team and they 
10 
had made these bulletins based on the news priorities of the day and it 
was not something that showed the President in good light or Malema 
in bad light or whatever.  So – so when we – when we took this – also – 
you know – the presentation was very raw.  It was not very professional 
but – but I think even this nobody took advantage – you know – the 
President was watching it.  There was just one clip by that time they 
had got from the SABC which was of Julius Malema travelling in a 
helicopter.  So – which Ajay Gupta knew nothing about but he – he 
created a story right in front of the President there because (indistinct) 
seen the bulletin.  There was a story on Malema that he was in a 
20 
chopper.  So he asked me pass the bulletin and told the President look 
– you know - we are showing Malema as somebody who is – you know - 
he is somebody who is corrupt who likes to live in luxury who likes to 
travel in helicopters.  So without saying a word in the voice over the 
people who – because these are the visuals that they are using of him 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 148 of 225 
 
but the truth is that that was the only visual that we had of 
Julius Malema and that is what the team had used there – you know.  
So there was no intention to do that but he tur ned it around and he said 
like you said last time that we should use subtleties like this and that is 
what we have done.  He said that.  He made it up and said that to 
impress the President.  So that is something …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  In 28.4 you mention that 
there were a group of models that were hired and were trained.  Were 
these models trained to read the news?  What were they doing?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Again you know this is something that we 
10 
had to contend with because you know of m any of the professional 
presenters were reluctant to join ANN7 at that time because of its 
association with the Gupta Family.  Many of the credible journalists 
would not want to have anything to do with it and even those like for 
instance Nazeem would sugg est that we could get a few of the 
prominent journalists but the Guptas then would have resolutions about 
hiring them – you know.  They would call them all kinds of obnoxious 
names which I cannot mention right now and say but no we do not want 
that – you know - because that they will be against this or against that.  
So that put us in a – in a situation where we did not have presenters.  
20 
So the only option then was to hire at a higher salary journalists but I 
think also they were very suspicious of the jour nalists.  They thought 
that they would not draw the line that they wanted to.  So – so then that 
is when Atul Gupta got up one day and suggested that let us hire 
models and he asked Aslam or there is a modelling agency that is – 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 149 of 225 
 
something that we have used in the past – asked them to send a dozen 
models and we will train them to be presenters.  You know – I had 
objections at that time not because I did not think those young ladies 
would be able to do it but you know news is something that acquires 
experience.  A sense about what is being read.  Journalism is not just a 
pretty face reading the news but it is much more than that.  It requires 
a deep understanding of the issues.  You are supposed to ask 
questions – you know – especially when it is live television when you 
have live sources that are coming out.  You have to ask questions or 
you end up becoming the laughing stock.  You know if those questions 
10 
are not sharp enough or if they are not focused enough by my 
objections were overruled like many others be fore that and he insisted 
that these anchors come in.  That they be trained by a professional and 
will be important and to their credit they worked really hard, they 
worked long hours but they were not being paid much.  I think the only 
incentive for them was that they would get to feature on the station and 
very much - not very much more than that and they did put on a brave 
face because – you know – here was a time when the technology was 
very, very basic.  Most of the equipment had not come in and – and 
they were still out there and they were struggling to put things together.  
20 
So – so yes most of the – you know – with the fumbles and things were 
getting into the bulletin because the anchor is not fully trained yet and 
those are not professional journalis ts but they were models who were 
really struggling and trying hard to fit into the – the slot that they were 
given. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 150 of 225 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Okay, thank you and then 
you – you then in that very paragraph – 28.6 – I beg your pardon.  You 
then – it appears if this was the end of the meeting because you left at 
07:00 pm.  Were you leaving the official – the President’s official 
residence or were you leaving – where were you leaving at 07:00pm?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Which point is this? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  28.6 – that – the last sentence 
there. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Okay.  So we were leaving from 07:00 pm.  
Sorry. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I would correct myself.  It was not four to 
five but we left at seven  so it was more like 07:30/08:00 that the 
meeting started or 07:30 to …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Oh, so this is the evening back 
to the time when you left …  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  For the meeting? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Okay, thank you. 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I can correct myself. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  It was not four to five.  It was in the evening 
… 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 151 of 225 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  But later. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Alright, okay.  Alright, thank 
you and then you – then you deal with the conversation in the car.  I 
would imagine …  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  28.7. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Ja, because they were very agitated about 
the fact that the Independent Election Commission had not given the 
New Age any advertising.  They knew that there was a multimillion 
Rand budget that the IEC had which was not allocated to the – to New 
10 
Age and they said that they wanted to bring it up and the conversation 
going to the – and it is like the last time I was travelling with Ajay and 
Nazeem. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And they said that we should bring this up 
and we should make sure that the IEC gives us our share of the money 
that they have.  So they were – there was almost a sense of (indistinct) 
both of them that they were obsessed about this topic and they said 
that they will go and talk about this and make sure t hat we get our 
share of this.  So it was almost like how dare the Independent Election 
20 
Commission not pay us – not pay this newspaper and – you know – we 
have to make sure that they do it – we have to make sure that they toe 
the line and any Government Age ncy that has any amount of allocation 
for advertising they very well gives us a share – you know.  So this was 
a point that they wanted to prove with the IEC.  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 152 of 225 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  I beg your pardon, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What you have just said maybe quite important for the 
evidence of another witness how has given evidence before me.  As I 
understand you - and you must just tell me if I understand you correctly 
– you are saying that – was it Nazeem?  You are saying he was 
insisting that you – that is they – must get their share of the advertising 
revenue that the IEC had.  Is that right?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and did you use the word “obsessed” as well or 
did I hear something you did not say?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Obsessed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Obsessed, huh-uh.  In the context of how they wanted 
it. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No Chair.  Ja, what I meant by that was they 
were very agitated about it and - you know – they almost felt like that 
how dare this Government Agency would do it because why this stays in 
my head is that in India the Election Commission is supposed to be a 
constitutional body which is independent of the Government and no 
20 
amount of influence – I mean the political parties – of course now we 
have all kinds of allegations that it is a compromised organisation but 
to – to think that the – you know the Head of State there or the Prime 
Minister’s Office in India could influence a decision of the IEC is 
something that goes against the very character of the constitution.  So 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 153 of 225 
 
I was a little intrigued there – you know – about how the President 
could actually influence the IEC because these are two different bodies 
namely democracy.  So and they were very clear that  they would talk to 
him and that they would get a share because they were assured later 
on that the President would look into and speak with the (intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  No that is fine.  I am trying to under – to 
make sure that I understood you correctly.  I thought you used the word 
obsessed.  So I am just checking whether I heard you correctly.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I think I said obsessed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  But what I meant was that they were very 
agitated and they were … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Very clear that they would go after this 
meeting and (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That they wanted to get their …  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Their share of the revenue?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Advertising revenue? 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes and they believed very formally that if 
they took it up with the President they would get what – what was there 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
M RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And then this was also a point – a case in 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 154 of 225 
 
point – you know – so that any other agency in the future forgot or 
deliberately kept the New Age of their advertising campaign or – or – 
you know – kept them out of the budget that they are advertising.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  This would be a case to point to say even 
that the IEC kept us out and we got them in.  So you – you know …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  You can deny us but then finally you will 
have to give (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes well you see that is interesting because one – 
10 
one would have to look at Mr  Themba Mashego’s evidence.  You might 
not know Mr Themba Mashego.  He was one of the first witnesses who 
gave 
evidence 
before 
this 
Commission 
last 
year. 
 
He 
was 
Director-General of a Government Department then called GCIS and he 
gave evidence here to the effect that Mr  Ajay Gupta approached him 
and his evidence was in part more or less to the effect that 
Mr Ajay Gupta was aware that GCIS or Government had set aside a 
certain of money.  I think 600 …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know – 600 million or whatever – had set it 
20 
aside for advertising and Mr  Mashego told me that in his discussion 
with Mr Ajay Gupta Mr Ajay Gupta seemed to feel very strongly that 
they should be – that is I think the Gupta brothers or their business or 
businesses – should get a certain portion of that revenue and on the 
evidence – on the version that I was told by Mr  Mashego Mr Mashego 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 155 of 225 
 
was 
resistant 
to 
that 
attempt 
and 
according 
to 
his 
version 
Mr Ajay Gupta did not – was not too happy about that and said certain 
things but if you describe the conversation that you had with 
Mr Nazeem and how he conveyed or expressed how much they wanted 
what you call their share of everything it maybe that there are some 
similarities with how Mr Ajay Gupta according to Mr  Mashego described 
how much they wanted a certain share of that revenue but the 
Commission will look at that and compare.  Okay, thank you.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you 
Mr Chairman.  In paragraph 28.7 a suggestion is made there that 
10 
apparently this issue had been raised with the President and that on 
that evening you were going to get the results.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes and I think – if I remember correctly – I 
had a conversation with Ajay Gupta and he said that they had had a 
breakthrough.  He did give me some figures which I do not remember 
right now, but he told me that there was a breakthrough in that – in that 
meeting.  They had managed to get - I do not know if all of that was 
from the IEC but from others.  He gave me a figure of – of some Rands 
and he said that that was how much they had been able to get post that 
meeting.  So …  
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And – and was this part of the 
discussion also held in your presence?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No that was a discussion that I had …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I think the next day when he come to the 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 156 of 225 
 
studio.  So I was just having a conversation with him and he said …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Oh you know – so I asked him about the 
meetings that they had just out of – you know – making small talk and 
he said we – we are already successful and you know in that meeting 
we had taken up a lot of these things and we got busin ess worth X 
amount – you know - which I do not remember correctly but it sound - it 
sounded like a fascinating amount – fantastic amount to me. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  So now you 
are moved to a bigger room where there is a bigger m onitor? 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And then what happens in that 
room? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Well they (indistinct) and there is of course 
we could not use the big TV set which was there because the cable that 
we carrying was not long enough.  So it was plan A which was just to 
connect it to the – to the monitor that we took with us and the President 
starts watching the bulleting and like I said he watched continuously for 
about 15 minutes where Mr  Ajay Gupta forwarded it to th e next bulletin.  
He said no I want to watch the whole thing and then we had Duduzane 
20 
coming in and making this comment which made everybody laugh and 
then – you know – there were visuals of Malema which Ajay  Gupta 
pointed out was done on purpose which he did not think about but he 
was just trying to fool the President to thinking that all the inputs that 
he had given them the last meeting were being followed already.  So 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 157 of 225 
 
that is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was that still the third meeting?  Was that still 
the third meeting? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Ja that was – that was the third meeting 
yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Alright, thank you and then 
28.15 you simply relating to how these visuals were obt ained.  That is 
what you are saying? 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Okay.  Then what was the 
President’s response after he had watched the bulletin – if any? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Well he seemed to be happy.  He thought 
that we were going in the right direction like – you know – (indistinct) 
he had told me more and I had expressed my resolutions about the fact 
that you know this may not be best bulletins for us to show.  Let us wait 
for some more time and - you know – the bulletins evolve.  That is 
when we should show it to him but I think the plan seemed to work 
because the President was happy with this and that was the input I 
20 
remember him giving us - you know.  Saying that he is happy with what 
he saw and this is the right trajectory that – that we are going in. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  You have a quotation in 
paragraph 28.15.  Could you just read that out?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Ja.  28.15: 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 158 of 225 
 
“The team used these visuals because there were 
no visuals available in the archives bought from the 
SABC.  He had just made that up to please the 
President and from the look of it - it seemed he was 
happy.  President Zuma watched all the bulletins.  
You have a good thing on your hands.  This is much 
better than the bulletins on SABC.  Tho se ae 
horrible.  I like the way you have use the graphics.  
It reminds me of the international channels.  If this 
is what you will look like on launch day you will be 
10 
a hit President Zuma said with a smile.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well in that paragraph Mr  Sundaram from the fourth 
line you quote – you put what you say President Zuma said in quotes.  
How is it possible that after a month after two months you could 
remember the exact words?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I would not (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without having recorded … 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I would not claim that these are the exact 
words.  You know – I remember the gist of what he said and the 
emphasis that he had on the fact that you got thing on your hands here.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that I would understand but t his is put in quotes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see from where it says: 
“You have a good thing on your hands this is much 
better then the bulletins on SABC.”  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 159 of 225 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  These – these are things that he said but …  
CHAIRPERSON:  As it is exact words because it is one thing if he made 
the following point – you know. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is one thing and put it in your own words and 
maybe your own words is a mix of his words and your words but you are 
not putting them in – in quotes as if it is word for word what he said.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Ja, I agree with you it may not be word for 
word what he said but then those are points that are there …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Is what … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Has been conveyed in this.  You know like I 
remember he said that you have got them in your hands.  It is much 
better than the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Those are things that he had said.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay.  You must just have a look at that.  Maybe 
overnight if there are any …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Huh-uh. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Statements which you have put on quotes …  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But which you did not intend to say that is word for 
word what he said …  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Sure. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 160 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or whether it is him or anybody. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It needs to be clear. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where you are quoting you ar e saying that is what the 
person said word for word and I do remember.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you do not remember word for word but you 
remember the points you put that in your own words.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Alright. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so do have a look overnight so that you do not 
necessarily give the impression that you remember word for word what 
he or anybody else said …  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If that is not the case. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Sure I will do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you 
Mr Chairman.  Then in paragraph 28.16.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Alright.  So this is around the time that the 
20 
SABC had launched their station and I think a day or two after that.  So 
when they launched their station also you know it was not the best foot 
forward in that sense you know.  They had a few glitches.  So in that 
context is why he said this.  So I am just giving a little of context to the 
statement that he did. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 161 of 225 
 
“The SABC had launched its 24/7 news channel a 
few days ago on 1 August 2013.  This was the 
endorsement the Gupta brothers were looking for.  
They soften President Zuma before this meeting on 
commercials and they could hardly (indistinct).  So 
you see the final product would be much better than 
this President Zuma asked looking at me.  Yes.  It 
will surely be better as we will have completed the 
integration then and we will have much – better – 
more equipment at our disposal and the bulletins 
10 
will be sleeker.” 
So I like I said before you know these bulletins were not produced in 
the PCR as far as I remember.  They were made on a timeline.  So and 
half the equipment in the studio had not even come.  They came on the 
last day – the studio cameras, the robotic cameras, the ji b.  All of that 
came much, much later than this.  They almost came two days, three 
days, four days before the launch.  So – so this I said in all honesty 
that – you know - this is a product which I was not very proud of and I 
was surprised that he would like a product like this and actually say it 
is better than – you know – the SABC bulletin – channel that was 
20 
launched. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Okay and then the caution that 
the Chairperson has just made you will do the same those quotations 
as well. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes, yes. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 162 of 225 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And those paragraphs. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And then – then who was 
saying that he was not very happy with the bulletins.  Is that yourself 
still? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN 
SC: 
 
Continuing 
in 
the 
next 
paragraph? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes.  So I mean – so I told him that you 
know.  We are not very happy with this – you know.  These are just 
10 
practice runs.  So he said well I am happy with even these.  You guys 
keep it up. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So then he was asked to come and 
inaugurate the channel on the 21 s t.  I know you will decline but – so 
this is what one of the Gupta brothers said that you kno w – but you 
must be – you must inaugurate the channel.  You will have – let us do 
an exclusive interview with you at the venue.  Atul said with a broad 
smile and folded hands.  That will not – so this is what the President 
said that that will not send the right message.  It will not do you – your 
20 
credibility any good.  I am – I am a part of the project.  I am always – I 
am always ready to give you an interview after a few weeks Zuma 
replied formally.  So this is something which there in that meeting.  
They requested for an interview with him and for him to come and cut 
the ribbon on the day of the launch.  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 163 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Which he flatly refused.  He 
said that if – if that was to be done then everybody would know from 
day one that – you know – this is a station which – which I am leaked to 
(indistinct) or I came and inaugurated.  They are going to have a soft – 
(coughing).  So he did not want that image to go out but he did come a 
day before the launch. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that Mr Sundaram some months when you 
wrote the book did you remember that Atul – Mr Atul Gupta – said this 
with a broad smile and his hands folded?  
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I do remember distinctly you know because 
there was a lot of drama that was involved in – in the way the Gupta 
brothers attended to the President.  So for instance they know that – 
you know – they were asking the President to come and inaugurate the 
station that was been set up and they are asking him for an interview 
but they would do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, I understand that. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This is months later and you told me that you did not 
record anything. 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I did not record but I have …  
CHAIRPERSON:  So I am – I am just surprised that you  could even 
remember that when Mr  Atul Gupta said this he said it with a broad 
smile and with hands folded. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No but I must submit that – you know - I do 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 164 of 225 
 
remember all of this because just to be clear because I started writing 
the book within days of coming back from South Africa which is 
something that I reported to the media here since it got published.  
Also I remember these meetings very, very distinctly very, very clearly 
in my mind when I was writing the book.  I do remember that whe n he 
was asking for that interview he – he was doing that with the 
mannerism that – that I have described here that you know – very 
sincerely we ask you to come and please inaugurate the station and all 
of that.  So I did – I do remember the body language during that 
meeting especially – you know – when it comes to these critical points 
10 
during that meeting – you know – where they ask the President to come 
and inaugurate the station and also give an exclusive interview to 
(indistinct) and he did that with his hands folded and you know almost 
in - in a way that was pleading him to come.  Although he knew that 
that is something that any politician will jump when get an opportunity 
but President Zuma was smart enough to say that no if I come there 
and do that it will be seen as something which is pro Zuma or you know 
a channel that is linked to me and I would not want to do it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well in the two sentences – two sentences later after 
you said Mr Atul Gupta you quoted what Mr Atul Gupta said with a 
20 
broad smile and his hands folded. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Two sentences or three sentences later you say – no, 
no the following three sentences contain a quotation that you say was 
Mr Zuma’s reply and it says: 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 165 of 225 
 
“That will not send the right message.  It will not do 
your credibility any good.  I am part of the project 
and I am always ready to give an interview after a 
few weeks.” 
Zuma replied firmly.  You remembered all that, firmly with broad smile?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With closed hands after months?  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:   
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  You see because I noted these – these kind 
of – you know – the kind of body language very closely because this is 
10 
something which – you know – was part of the drama that was there – 
you know – with the Gupta brothers because I did not see them use this 
kind of body language elsewhere. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  There was a lot of arrogance.  There was a 
lot of – you know – the attitude that they were some kind of feudal 
lords when it came to the other employees but when it came to the 
President also when it came to – to these kind of issues they would be 
all – you know – folded arms, folded hands and smile and things like 
that which was – you know – which I thought was reserved for the 
20 
President.  It was reserved for him.  We could not see that anywhere 
else.  It was a very brash, arrogant rude face that we saw in the office.  
So I remember this because this is something that I observed at that 
time and made a mental note of and which stays with me – you know – 
when I wrote the book and even now when I read from one of this I get 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 166 of 225 
 
a very vivid image of that meeting that took place.  As far as the court 
from President Zuma is concerned (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on one second.  We spoke earlier on about 
quotations.  You have got a quotation here of what Mr  Abdul Gupta 
said.  You say – actually paragraph 28.17.  It says:  
“I am not very happy with these bulletins.  They are 
just practice runs.”  I re plied. 
So I guess that is you?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then: 
10 
“I'm happy with even this, you guys keep this up.”  President 
Zuma was beaming. 
Do you remember all that?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes I did at that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then next sentence: 
“Sir you must come and press the button to integrate the 
channel on the 21 s t.  I know you have declined before but you 
must integrate the channel.  We will have our editors do an 
exclusive interview with you at the venue.”  
Atul said with a broad smile and his hands folded, and then of course:  
20 
“That will not send the right message, it will not do your 
credibility any good, I am part of the project and I am always 
ready to give an interview after a few weeks.”  
Zuma replied firmly.  All these quotations and the others, you said 
...(intervention)  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 167 of 225 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    The quotations I admit, the quotations I 
admit is you know from my recollection, I put those collections, to the 
best of my knowledge that is it, but as far as the mannerisms are 
concerned, the broad smile and the ... I remember those things and I 
put it there.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But in regard to the one that we started talking about 
I got the impression that you were conceding that was within quotations 
wasn’t what was said word by word or word for word, but it was – you 
sought to articulate the point that was made, did I understand you 
correctly? 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In regard to that one. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The other ones that you – the one for Mr Atul Gupta 
here and the one for President Zuma, former President Zuma, that we 
have just talked about at paragraph 28.17 are those quotations proper 
or even with those – you sought to make points and not to say this is 
what they word for word?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    I would say this is not what they said word 
for word, but I do remember the points that they made on this and this 
20 
conveys what actually had happened, but I do agree that this is only to 
the best of my recollection within a few days of my c oming back from 
South Africa, what I recollected at that time I’ve put it in there.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, but why would you want to put in quotations 
when you are attribute a statement to somebody if you don’t remember 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 168 of 225 
 
it as word for word, I mean you are an e xperienced journalist, you are 
an editor, you know exactly what it means when you put a statement in 
quotations, in quotation marks. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes I agree you know, I agree with you 
there, and I would also say that you know I did this because I wanted 
to, when I was writing a book it was not like writing a news report, so I 
wanted to put it in an narrative style that I wanted to put in there.  
CHAIRPERSON:  No but you can’t put in a narrative form by attributing 
to somebody words that that person did not utter, can you?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    I agree with that, I agree. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So why did you do it?  Because you could make the 
same points without representing that those are the words that were 
said by that person. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:   So what I’ve done is you know to the best 
of my recollection what I could remember I put it there but I think in 
hindsight I should not have put it in quotations, I should have looked at 
it otherwise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No but it concerns me because you are a journ alist, 
journalists write all the time, that’s their job and they know the purpose 
of quoting. 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the rationale for it. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they know that when you can’t remember that this  
is what the person said word for word you don’t put it in quotes.  You 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 169 of 225 
 
make the point, you say this is what the person said or you say or 
words to this effect but you don’t quote them, you quote them when you 
are sure that’s what they said.  Am I not righ t? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    You’re absolutely right, absolutely.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But why would an experienced journalist like you 
attribute to people words in quotes that he knows he can’t say that’s 
what they said word for word?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    I agree with you, that you know I should 
not have done that, but while I was writing the book this was to the 
best of my knowledge you know because I vividly remember each of the 
10 
conversations that I had with ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I know but this ...(intervention)  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    This is not the right way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Sundaram you don’t quote when you say to the 
best of my knowledge. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    I agree. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you recollection is to the best of your 
knowledge you try and write by putting it in an indirect speech you 
know. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or if you do quote and you are – you want the reader 
to know that you are not certain then you do say that you are not 
certain but that’s as your recollection that the person said that, but 
normally you only put a statement in quotes and attribute it to 
somebody if you are sure that that’s what the person said word for 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 170 of 225 
 
word, everything that is within the quotes is what the person said, isn’t 
it? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    I agree with you, so here I mean the 
quotations that I’ve given may not be word for word, I do admit that, but 
it was you know the conversations were there in my head which I took 
out and put in quotes, in hindsight I think I should not have p ut them in 
quotes, but used another way of putting (indistinct) but like I said these 
are the points that I remember very clearly were being said and maybe 
I would say that I should not have put them in quotes, I agree with you 
there. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there are quite a number of quotes isn’t it, that 
are made in your statement?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And part of the difficulty with quotes is – at least 
that’s my experience, is that they convey to the reader that you are 
very clear about what that person said and the reader might think that 
you kept a record somewhere, if you were to be challenged with a – 
where did you get this from, you produced something in writing or a 
recording, and there are of course statements that just stay in you r 
mind, but there seems to be so many that would have stayed in your 
20 
mind in this statement when you didn’t record anything immediately.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    No these things, you know these things 
were very alien to me that I worked before so these thing s stayed in my 
mind and when I came back and I took myself out, I was not on any 
assignment, I went from the (indistinct) and that’s when I wrote the 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 171 of 225 
 
book in absolute solitude in the Himalayas, in Pechora, places like that, 
kept my you know shut my mind ou t for everything else that was there, 
left my family and wrote this book.  Each and everything that is written 
here is to the best of my knowledge what I remembered.   
 
Also the kind of body language that I am referring to here is 
something that I remember very, very distinctly, because that was very 
different from the – that they dealt with other people.  Also when it 
came to President Zuma I had just these four meetings and everything 
that he said there has stayed on with me you know because it’s not 
every day that you meet a Head of State, and you have this thing.  I 
10 
was absolutely focused on each and every word that was being said in 
that meeting, but like I said before you know I think in hindsight I 
should not have quoted them because while these are t o the best of my 
knowledge this is what they had said, but it may not be word for word 
what they said, but the gist of it is contained in this.  Of course like you 
said I worked the whole night to make these references in my statement 
at night and do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, but also this is not a case where you had one 
meeting, you had four?   
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you don’t think you may be mixing up what 
happened in the first meeting with what happened in the second 
meeting and third meeting and fourth meeting, your recollection of what 
happened in each meeting is quite clear, even though you may 
...(intervention)  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 172 of 225 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes absolutely, because you know in a 
television station there is a sequential order in which t hings take place, 
you know for instance the first meeting was about the logo, the second 
meeting was about the animation of that logo, that comes in a 
sequential order, the bulletins come later, so I am absolutely clear that 
this is what happened in each o f the meetings and because I’ve set up 
stations before this, I’ve set up stations after this as well, and this is 
the sequential order in which things come in, and I remember them very 
distinctly because this is the work that I do really and there’s 
absolutely no meeting up as far as the meetings are concerned.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay no that’s fine.  Thank you.  Ms Norman?  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Thank you Mr Chairman.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, can we take a five minutes adjournment.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  As it pleases Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will just take a five minute adjournment.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Five minutes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed Ms Norman. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes thank you Mr Chairman, 
thank you.  You had alluded to the fact that after this meeting, which is 
the third meeting, one of the Gupta brothers told you that they had 
succeeded in bringing in business and you me ntioned a figure in 
paragraph 28.18, did they mention who are they going to be doing this 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 173 of 225 
 
or getting this business from, in any ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  What page are you on? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  I’m on page 29 Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Paragraph 28.18.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Oh sorry, it’s page 29 on top, 
29 on top and then paragraph 28.18.  Oh thank you.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    So this was Ajay Gupta, I met him in the 
studio the next day or a few days later and the conversation was 
10 
around the meeting that we had and we said, that’s when he gave me 
this figure that we had done, that meeting was very productive and at 
the end of the day they got that amo unt of money from the business 
that came.  He didn’t tell me where those – you know what was the 
source of that money, I would think in light of the conversations that we 
had like even some of it could have come from the IEC as well.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  How much is it, could you just 
mention the figure for record purposes?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I just need to refer this and then I will just 
tell you. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Alright.   
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Could you please tell me about the page 
number that you referred to before.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Okay, oh sorry, sorry, let me 
just see that you’ve got the correct bundle first.  EXHIBIT CC1, just 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 174 of 225 
 
check, CC1 A and B, is that the one?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Alright okay if you go under 
there would be a flag in between which is written CC1B.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  CC1B, okay if you turn over you 
will see – look at page 29, two nine, on the top on your  right hand 
corner. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  29 yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  29 you see that? 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Thank you. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  I was referring to paragraph 
28.18. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    18? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    I was told the next day when this – I was 
told that they had secured R20million worth of business the previous 
evening.  By the time I had decided to resign as editor and go back to 
India after the launch. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Ja, so ...(intervention)  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  So you say you were not told 
how they were going to acquire this R20million and which department 
was going to fund or to do business with them.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 175 of 225 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  To the tune of R20million. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes, and then you give the 
reason why you had to resign, or you felt that you had resign, and what 
were those reasons that you give in that paragraph?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Well you know I’ve spoken about the 
dubious commercial dealings that I saw with my own eyes which I didn’t 
want to be a part of, but there were a whole lot of other reasons you 
know.  Right from the time, right from the – where that the last 
(indistinct) not just the visa laws but also labour laws in terms of the 
10 
way they were treating their employees, the way they had total 
disregard for any action that could come their way because they were 
breaking these laws, you know all of these things, you know the total, 
you know the editor’s position was entirely compromised, the editor just 
had to take a spare and sit in a chair and you know everything else was 
done by this group and the fact that this was not a n ew station but what 
they wanted to set up was a propaganda station.  Those were all, some 
of the reasons that made you know had me made up my mind very 
quickly, very early in the project that I did not want to be associated 
with this in the long term becau se you know whatever reputation I had 
20 
got for myself working you know since 1994 on various projects and 
media organisations would just, I would just throw it away if I continued 
any longer in this, but of course I was very uncomfortable with these 
kind of dealings that I was also part of and I was going to these 
meetings and I knew at the end of it they were getting these kind of 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 176 of 225 
 
commercial benefits from it, and this is not what I would call a 
legitimate business deal that was being done.  I have no issues  with a 
newspaper or a television station making profits, but if they are done in 
a violation of laws, if they are done where there is a conflict of interest 
that’s a condition where I do not want to have any part of that.  It’s 
what I am saying ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  So at this point that is what you 
are dealing with in paragraph 28.18 you had not formally resigned but 
you had formulated a view or made a decision that you were going to 
leave? 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:   Yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And then before you did that 
then you had the fourth meeting?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Ja, the fourth meeting was a day before 
the launch because you know there was President Zuma was under a 
lot of pressure from the Gupta’s to give an interview  and come 
(indistinct) and all of that which formally refused, but I think what he 
had agreed to is to come and visit the station and to see you know the 
studios and the PCR and all of that, which he did a day before the 
launch. 
20 
 
Now this was kept very secretive you know because even 
within the team there were very few people who knew about the visit, 
for most of the editorial staff it came a surprise you know because they 
were going about their daily editorial functions and suddenly you have 
the President walk into the meeting, and it was supposed to be 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 177 of 225 
 
supposed to be something which they wanted to keep confidential to 
the extent that there was a camera thing that was recording the 
President’s arrival and departure that at the last he was told that you’re 
not supposed to do that.  The Head of Production had a whole camera 
set up, a chain of cameras set up to record the entire event, they were 
told that they should not do that.  
 
Also there was instructions given to the staff that they should 
not be taking any  pictures of the President you know using their cell 
phones etcetera, so there was an attempt at getting a high profile 
public figure to come to a newsroom that was full of journalists and 
10 
very foolishly there was also an attempt to kind of try and hide it , and 
to keep it confidential, which I found funny at that time you know.   
 
You have journalists in the newsroom who will of course tell 
their friends and you know in other news stations that the president 
came, so there was no point not recording those e vents or allowing 
people to take pictures of the President at that time.  
 
So yes the fourth meeting was a day before the launch you 
know when there were hectic preparations that were happening for the 
launch, when everything I could see was falling apart, you know 
because half the equipment hadn’t come, they were in the process of 
20 
coming, the technical team was calling up the vendors to find out where 
in the world they were, they were trying to track the cameras, and you 
know once the equipment  came in we didn’t know what bugs would 
crop up when we’re starting, or the integration wasn’t done fully, so 
while all of this was happening the President came in and he was given 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 178 of 225 
 
a picture of something which is at the highest level of preparedness 
and totally ready for a launch the next day. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes so in paragraph 29 you say 
this was two days, are you making a mistake when you say one day, 
two days before the launch on the 19 t h of August. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Well I would go with the written submission 
you know.   
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  It would be two days? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes it will be correct so. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Alright, and then you also 
10 
extracted extensively from your book from page 151 to 153.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:   Yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  When you deal with those 
events. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  So where you deal in paragraph 
30 with the attorneys who attended that meeting, the fourth meeting 
that we’re talking about. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And where was it exactly at you 
20 
say it was at the NN7 Studios, whereabout there was it held?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Well this (indistinct) had seven studios 
and the president arrived and he was received outside the building by 
the Ajay Gupta, who was the head, there was – I was called in, I wasn’t 
in that whole meeting I was asked to come in quickly, it was a cold 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 179 of 225 
 
morning remember and there was  - Laxmi Goel had flown down from 
India, I was part of that team that welcomed him.  
 
There was Nazeem and if I remember correctly Moegsien was 
also there but I don’t know 100%, but Nazeem was definitely there, part 
of the team that received him at the gate and then he was brought in 
and he was given a tour of the entire office.  I was asked to explain to 
him the various – the equipment and gear that was in the production 
control room, I explained to him the studios and the various aspects of 
it.  He went to the graphics team, went to the vi deo edit area, all of that 
and then he came into a room where the senior team met with him.  
10 
There was a request again to him for an interview which he declined 
again and then you know there was an (indistinct).  I described the 
other details ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry, so this wasn’t this fourth meeting wasn’t a 
meeting in the normal sense, was it?  You were just showing the 
President was being shown around the studios and so on.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Around, I would call it a meeting also 
because you know there was a holding room where the President had 
come in and you know the senior team was sitting there and they were 
discussing with him, but it was not like the other meetings in the sense 
20 
that there was no ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  But the purpose was really showing him around?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whatever discussion happened ...(intervention)  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes, yes. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 180 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was just normal discussion. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Discussion yes and there was another 
request for him to give an interview which he said that he would give it 
later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja, ja okay, alright, thank you.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And in that paragraph you 
mentioned in paragraph 30 that Mr Duduzane Zuma was  also present? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes, yes, that is correct. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  So I just want to just you will 
tell me whether this is a discrepancy, if you go back to page 24, 
10 
paragraph 27, where you say this meeting was attended by Mr 
Duduzane Suma, the first and last meeting I saw him attend.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No so he was there because I would go 
what was there in the book you know which I – which to the best of my 
knowledge so yes in the meeting in the sense that like the Chairman 
said you know the three meetings were a proper sit-down meeting 
where strategies were discussed and all of that, this one was a meeting 
which was generally we just show him the areas, you know the various 
departments and the various the (indistinct) room and  the studio and 
things like that, so yes Duduzane ...(intervention)     
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  (Inaudible – microphone off) 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Because I made a record of that ja.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, so which 0 so what you 
state in paragraph 27 would still be correct to say that the first and the 
last meeting I saw him attend. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 181 of 225 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Ja, because this was not a meeting in that 
sense you know so ...(intervention)  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  So you distinguish betw een the 
two? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Alright, thank you.  And then so 
you were showing the President around according to you and how long 
did he spend at the studio?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That can you know I think I will go  with what 
is written in the book because as far as I – to the best of my knowledge 
10 
he came in, he sat in the holding area for about ten odd minutes and 
then he spent some time in production control room while the bulletin 
was being rolled which was say ab out fifteen minutes, he asked me 
about the various equipment, you know the video switching equipment, 
the audio equipment and I gave him a description and he stood there 
watching the bulletin.  Then he spent some time in the room where the 
video editing takes place.  He was also taken to the room where the 
graphic production takes place, and he spent a substantial amount of 
time there, about ten minutes in each of those places.  
 
Then he took – he went to the studio where he waited because 
20 
you know it was a live studio so he couldn’t cross and go so he waited 
for some time there, but he observed all the various elements of the 
studio.  Then at some point he also decided that he would go to the 
various departments where the staff was seated, so he went to the 
place where the programming team was seated, he went you know right 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 182 of 225 
 
across the newsroom, shook hands with a lot of people, asked them 
their names, you know engaged in small conversation with some of 
them, so it was almost like a celebrity visiting the news room where 
people were calling out to him and he was waving back at them and 
things like that, so in all I would say he spent about 40 maybe 50 
minutes during that visit in the studio.  
CHAIRPERSON:  How much time? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Between forty and fifty minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh 40 and 50, five zero?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes, five zero. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  So I take it that according to 
what you state in 35.6 that you are the person who actually – because 
somebody had said look they didn’t want this visit to be made public.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  And you are the person who 
said to the camera crew no don’t take any photos of this.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes because you see I was called into  a 
meeting, the Head of Production at that time was Karun Takoree, he 
came up to me and said that we’ve got the cameras, what should we – 
20 
should we be filming this visit so I asked Nazeem and he asked Mr Atul 
Gupta and  Atul Gupta clearly said that he did not want any recording 
on that so while the team was ready to record at the last minute they 
were told not to do a recording, and Karun had to then withdraw all the 
cameramen who had taken advantage positions to make sure that they 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 183 of 225 
 
get a shot of the Presid ent moving in the various departments.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And you are the one who told 
Karun not to do it? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, I am just trying to 
understand for a journalist that would have been some thing that’s quite 
exciting, if somebody says don’t record this a journalist would have 
said record it, whilst they say don’t make it public you would actually 
want to make it public because it’s quite interesting news isn’t it?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Mmm you see because these were not 
10 
ordinary (indistinct) this is not an ordinary newsroom, this was like a 
said almost like  North Korean station that was being set up at that 
time, so you know for me it was clear that you know I either, I either led 
or I got out of the way ,but that time I decided that you know I wouldn’t 
be allowed to lead here, this is a station which is not, you know I had a 
title and a position but I had no leadership role there at all, so would 
they want it to be recorded, I said no I can w ait that because the 
production team was reporting in to me, I told them that if these guys 
don’t want you to record it because if I said that he won’t record it the 
cameraman would have had the brunt of it, the Production Head would 
20 
have got the brunt of it, you know they would have probably lost t heir 
jobs or gotten abused or worse you know so I just said if they’ve taken 
decision on not recording it just don’ do it.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:   Do you know whether 
immediately after the President had  visited the studio whether that 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 184 of 225 
 
came out in any of the news broadcasts?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Of course it did, you know because I think it 
came out in all the papers, some websites as well, because like I said 
you know it was for want of any other word stupid on their part to 
actually believe that they could have a secret visit by a Head of State 
into a newsroom that’s full of journalists who worked in other 
organisations, who have got friends in other organisations and keep it 
all under wraps.  I believe at the end of the day there were questions 
asked of the President’s office and the spokesperson of the 
Presidential Office at that time, Mr Maharaj, had given a statement by 
10 
saying that this is part of the engagement with the media that the 
President gets into from time to time, he also spoke about how he had 
visited another newsroom recently and this was part of the series of 
that, so they did not deny it, the President’s Office did not deny it, and 
many newspapers did carry that at this time, but I would want to say at 
this time that they were under the mistaken notion that they could have 
a very secretive meeting of the President where he interacts with the 
journalists and the staff there, and the technical team and those are – 
and it would remain under wraps.   
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes, and thereafter was there 
20 
any enquiry as to who would have leaked that information amongst the 
journalists that were there?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I don’t think so because you know that was 
something that was there  and also there were a whole lot of other 
battles to be fought at that time you know because we were like I said 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 185 of 225 
 
it was a train wreck waiting to happen, we knew we were on the same 
track as another train coming in the opposite direction at double the 
speed and for us to get into any other investigation at that time would 
have been suicidal because anyways we didn’t have half the equipment 
in place, we didn’t have the training that was required like I said the 
bugs hadn’t been fixed and we were going to laun ch in 48 hours, so we 
had – so I would look at myself then as the captain of the Titanic at 
that time while it was sinking you know, so that was what was on my 
mind and even if they did conduct an enquiry and all of that, I am not 
aware of that you know be cause I cut myself off all of that and I was 
10 
just focusing on how to get the first day right you know, because my 
immediate focus 48 hours before launch that we would despite 
everything that could go wrong how could I salvage the first few hours, 
how could I salvage the first day, which I knew at that time was a losing 
battle. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes, alright, and then you deal 
in – now the President was moving around and then at the end of the 
tour what happened, there’s somewhere where you men tioned where 
you actually spent a bit of time, was it in the silver room in paragraph 
30.10, yes and the reasons why they spent a period of time there.  
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Ja so this is the movement that he spent 
some time in the server room he was told a bout you know because 
there is a fairly large server there which really is the heart of the 
operations where all the graphics and everything is integrated.  He was 
explained that he went to the graphics room, the master control room.  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 186 of 225 
 
The master control room is really the last board before the signal goes 
on air that is where the advertising and the promos are inserted so he 
was told what – about the functionality there.  The video [indistinct] so 
that was the tour that was given to him.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.   
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  He was also shown a few promos that were 
produced by the graphics team.  So those were the promos that were 
there and he seemed impressed on seeing that.  But I thought that he 
most interested you know there was – there were a few technical 
glitches that went on air in terms of the on air graphic system 
10 
collapsed. The life sources started failing as well.  So all of that was 
also happening while he was there.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So he did spend a large part of the time in 
the production control room where he wanted to know about the 
equipment there you know especially the audio system because there 
were a lot of knobs and switches and lights that were there he wanted 
to know what the function of each of those machines were.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes.  And then you say after he 
had had the tour then he left?  
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  And you are one the people that 
saw him off and who else w as in your company? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I think the entire team that received him 
saw him off as well you know because there was a convoy of cars that 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 187 of 225 
 
came in and he sat there and he left from there.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  This evidence tha t you 
have put up in the supplementary affidavit and as we have indicated to 
the Chairperson you extracted it most of it if not all of it from your 
book. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Am I correct? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And if I may just take you to 
your book right at the outset you – this is something that you state.  If 
10 
you have a note – note to the reader. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Oh you did not bring your cop y? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No I have not. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Oh alright.  Mr Chairperson we 
had a copy available to you might I just – just … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you want to refer to something.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the book? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes to page – yes to note to the 
20 
reader.  It is unfortunately it is not a page number it is just after the 
title of the book and the author and then there is note to the reader 
which will show when was th e book published and could we just refer 
the witness to my colleagues’ book just that part so that he can read it.  
Yes could you just read into the record what you stated there?  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 188 of 225 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:   
“The 
events 
[indistinct] 
book 
took 
place 
as 
remembered by Rajesh Sundaram.  We have tried to 
verify whether the meetings and conversations took 
place as described in the book.  Former President 
Jacob Zuma was approached for corroboration as 
were brother Atul and Ajay Gupta.  To date we have 
not received – we have received no response from 
them and they will – they may well have a different 
interpretation of events and by pointing this out we 
10 
leave it to you dear reader to make up your mind.”  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And every time when you 
were quoting from or maybe before I – we leave the book.  Sorry the 
date of publication of the book could you just read that into the record 
before we leave that 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I am sorry Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that a usual note to the reader?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Oh you see the book…  
CHAIRPERSON:  To a reader in books?  
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Oh you see because there is a history to 
this.  I will tell you why because like I said I wrote this book in 2014 but 
there were circumstances then where you know much of the 
corroboration that was needed for this were people who were still 
working with ANN7 at that time and there was also the publisher 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 189 of 225 
 
thought we had to be a hundred percent sure that the legal part of this 
– that we were on the clean. And there were issues there and we were 
advised by the lawyers that you know we cannot go ahead at this point.  
But what happened by 2018 was that we had the Gupta leaks that had 
become public. We had a whole lot of people who were wor king with me 
at that time had left ANN7 they had taken up positions with Al Jezeera.  
Some of them had gone to Turkey to work with DRD.  Some of them had 
come back to India and they were working with the top stations there.  
And they – you know then corroboration was established at that time.  
It was also the time when President Zuma was no longer in office. The 
10 
Gupta brothers had left the country.  The Hawks had gone to their 
Saxonwold home and they found that they were not there. And at that 
time the publisher sent them a notice saying that we are going to 
publish this book within fifteen days and this is the full manuscript of 
the book and could you come back if there is any objection?  It is has 
about a year and a half right now approximately we have not  heard 
back from them.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So – so that is why – you know while the 
book was written I started writing the book in 2013 I gave the full 
20 
manuscript about 2014.  It was published in March 2018 much without 
any changes to the core of the book in 2018.  And after the due process 
was followed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said you started writing the book about days after 
you had left South Africa?  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 190 of 225 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you left South Africa sometime in September 2018.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Ja 2 September. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  2 n d. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the book – you started writing the book within 
days thereafter? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when did you finish writing the book?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Oh I can check that and get back to you but 
it was in the first half of 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You finished it about during the first half of 2014?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Ja to the best of my knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And then you submitted to the publishers or 
what happened? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I –you know I submitted it chapter by 
chapter by email 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh as you were writing. 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were sending it yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So as soon as a chapter was completed I 
would give it by email to the publisher.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 191 of 225 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  [Indistinct] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  And – and then the publisher wanted to 
investigate the story in the book, the contents of the book before 
publishing, is that right?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes.  Because I think there was a process 
that they followed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  There is a legal vetting that happens and  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  This advice from the legal lawyers that were 
10 
sought and there were certain things that they wanted corroboration to 
which we could not get. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Because of the fact that most of the people 
were still working there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  They were employment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And they felt that they had enough corroboration 
to be able to publish it when?  They published it in 2018.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  March. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when did they…  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As far as you know when did they feel that they had 
enough corroboration? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I think… 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 192 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To justify publishing?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  To the best of my knowledge i t was about 
two or three months before that you know because then if you look at 
the events that were unfolding at that time.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Especially some of the corroboration came 
from the Gupta leaks and the emails that were th ere.  And then  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Right around that time most of the people 
who have been mentioned in this book are no longer working with ANN7 
10 
and you know they are available for – to be – to come and 
independently verify some of th e things that have been said in this 
book. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So do you…  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Because if you had launched – you know 
one of the things was also about the safety of those people you know.  
Because if I – if this book comes out and you know t here are people 
who had moved to South Africa with their families and things knowing 
the way the Gupta family operated we thought it was the right thing to 
do to just hold onto the manuscript until we could find a better 
20 
corroboration to the facts of the b ook. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I just thought that I am not used to seeing that 
kind of note to the reader in a book so I was wondering.  Is this 
something you are used to with other books yourself?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No but I think – thought it was fair to tell 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 193 of 225 
 
the people this you know because here this is my version of the facts.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  This is something which the Gupta family 
would not agree with.  This is something that President Zuma would not 
agree with.  To bring that to the notice of the viewers is something that 
was very important which the publisher said that we should do and I 
agreed one hundred percent.  As a journalist I believe all sides of the 
story should be told.  This is my story.  This is – this is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  This is you know to the best of my 
10 
knowledge and recollection these are the facts that I know.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but I – what I am asking is a different question.  
Whether it is your own experiences that it is normal to have this ki nd of 
note to the reader in a book, is that something that you are used to?  I 
am just saying I do not remember having come across any book that 
has got this note. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No it is – it is – I trust it is not normal but 
there are – you know so it is very unique circumstances in which this 
book was written and released over a period of time, over a period of 
years. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it is like – it is like the publisher does not 
have enough confidence in what is said in the book.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And therefore feels that they must alert the reader to 
say I case what is in the book here turns out to be not true do not 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 194 of 225 
 
blame us. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Hm.  No I see of course the publisher would 
be in a much better position to tell that but I think… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But do you – is that your own understanding of this 
note to the reader or do you have a different understanding of this 
note? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No you see my understanding of this note 
and why I think it is important to put that out is that this is the – a 
narration of events as per my – you know to the best of my knowledge 
and this may be disputed by others.  We have – the publishers has 
10 
given them adequate notice to respond to the manuscript.  They were 
given a reasonable period of time to respond. They have chosen not to 
respond.  Even after the publishing of the book it is – you know it was 
published in March last year it is already June now. They have not 
responded. None of the people who were sent notices abo ut this have 
responded.  So clearly if they had something to oppose here – if they 
had compelling evidence against what I have written they would have 
done so.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That is my belief I could be wrong but..;  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay no thank you. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Thank you Mr Chairman.  And 
then maybe just on the book still.  If you could just turn to page 160 of 
the book.   
CHAIRPERSON:  160? 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 195 of 225 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  160 Mr Chairman yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  There you deal with the 
reasons why you decided to resign and you deal with how you crafted 
your letter of resignation.  Could you just testify to that quickly as to 
how? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Okay so this after a few months of setting 
up the station which had been extremely traumatic.  It had taken a toll 
on my health.  It had left me totally exhausted and you know and the 
final unkind blow was the actual launch.  Like I said I had – you know – 
10 
it stressed me a lot to think of the launch that would be and it was my 
worst nightmare come true the way the station launched.  And I had 
decided to quit like I said weeks before I actually did.  And when I 
wrote the resignation letter I wanted to part on very good terms you 
know.  Of course I would probably never want to work with the Gupta’s 
again.  I probably won’t never to be associated with Nazeem Howa or 
Laxmi Goel for that matter but I wrote a very polite letter thanking them 
and telling them that you know this was a good team that I worked with 
and all of that.  Because I wanted to part on very good terms with them 
you know but I knew that I was tot – I was leaving because I was totally 
20 
fed up.  I did not agree with the idea of the station.  Like I said I was 
also conned into coming in and setting up a station for what I believe 
was a mafia like operation for setting up a propaganda station which I 
did not want to in the first place.  I had to stay there because of the 
reasons that I explained because there were coll eagues that were 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 196 of 225 
 
coming there with their families.  I had decided to launch the station 
and go.  But I did not want the parting of ways to be bitter in any way 
you know.  I would – I just thought a resignation which was very polite 
which thanked them. Beca use I thought that was the right thing to do 
and then of course I would then once I left this organisation would have 
nothing to do with ever again that was my intention.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.   And then your letter 
would not have articulate d any of the things that you have raised as 
evidence before the Chairperson today?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No because the resignation letter when I 
10 
wrote that I just wanted it to be a final parting document you know 
before I left and I did not want to have an y bitterness in there.  I never 
thought that – that is a document that would come to me after six years 
you know before a commission.  It – to me you know I had joined a lot 
of organisations, left a lot of organisations.  Some were extremely 
happy things you know as I was always going for a much better 
opportunity when I resigned from an organisation but here for the first 
time in my life you know I was resigning with no other opportunity or 
offer in my hand. Of course I knew that when I went back there wou ld 
be many more opportunities that would present themselves and I just 
20 
had pick and choose but I was not satisfied with the way this came 
about.  I was not happy at all with the fact that there was so much 
micro-management that you know the professionals w ere not allowed to 
work it ended up the way it did.  But I did not want any of the bitterness 
to get into the – to my resignation letter.  I wanted to write a polite 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 197 of 225 
 
letter and just move. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes.  And I would imagine you 
also had to be careful because in the event you wanted another job 
then you would have to mention this that look I launched ANN7 in South 
Africa and I – they might want to use it as a reference, is it not?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Would that have been one of 
the reasons that you…  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That could have been one of the reasons 
but I was very confident you know.  Although after the resignation had 
10 
been given the last conversation that I was having with Mr Laxmi Goel 
he said that you know when you get back we will make sure that you do 
not get another job and things like that.  I was always confident that if I 
got back to India I had enough of a reputation to find more 
assignments. But that could have also been a thought that went into my 
mind that you know just part ways amicably there is no point lobbing 
grenades and leaving that was my idea at that time you know.  Just part 
ways amicably just give the you know say the right things and move on.  
That was my idea. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes.  And then you – in your 
20 
epilogue at page 161…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before the epilogue. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Sorry – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On that same page at 160. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 198 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where you talk about the reasons for your resignation 
you say in the last sentence “I do sincerely hope ANN7 finds in its 
future editors the force that will break this mind -set and I unshackle the 
channel from the bonds that pin it down.”  What were you talkin g about 
there? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No all the things that I – the challenges that 
I faced I thought you know what I meant in this that I really sincerely 
hoped and prayed that they found a South Africa editor at some point in 
the future who would help the m break free from the legacy of the 
Gupta’s, the legacy that they brought of the corruption and all the 
10 
dealings and the associations. President Zuma and the [indistinct] and 
them and all of that you know and would then be able to lead the 
editorial team into a new era which would be what good journalism 
should be about. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh this is not what you said in the letter this is what 
you say in the book? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Ja in the letter – you see I could have said 
a lot of things you know but I…  
CHAIRPERSON:  No I understand what you have said.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I – I when I read it I thought you were recording 
what you said in the letter. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No, no.  This is just a common…  
CHAIRPERSON:  So do you have the letter of resignation somewhere?  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:    Yes in fact it is in the…  
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 199 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can we have a look. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes Mr Chairman.  It is in the 
papers that I mentioned just before we started after lunch.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Could I just hand up – thank 
you.  Mr Sundaram you recall the bundle that I gave you during the 
lunch break. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes.  Thank you.  It is – would 
appear.. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  These pages are part of this other file or not?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No, no this is the application I mentioned 
Mr Chairman from Mr Moegsien …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that you mentioned oh yes okay alright.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  But he has attached the letter 
of resignation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  It would be – the pages are not 
20 
numbered unfortunately it would be page 5.  1, 2, 3 , 4, 5 it is actually 
page 6.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes where it says subject resignation?  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  27 August 2013. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 200 of 225 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay you want to [indistinct]. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. Could 
you then just read out the letter Mr Sundaram.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Is that – is that in fact what is – 
did you send that letter on the 27 August at 18:18?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes I did, I did as far as I recall I think this 
was what I had written and this is…  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  What you have written?  Yes 
10 
could you please read it into the record?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So… 
“Dear Laxmi Goel and [indistinct] I have had the most 
exhilarating three months working within Infinity 
Media it has been by far the best phase of my career.  
Working with the launch team and taking to from 
shell to wonderful gold flush channel has been an 
honour and a privilege.  I have gained a lot from the 
wonderful management team both as a journalist and 
as a manager.  The passion and determination I have 
20 
seen and learnt here will remain with me throughout 
my life.  However at this point I would like to part 
ways with Infinity Media and spend time with my 
ailing mother.  While I would like to be relieved at 
the earliest I assure you that I will stay with the 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 201 of 225 
 
project for as long as I am needed.  Please treat this 
communication as a resignation letter.  I have the 
highest love, regard and respect for the two of you 
and leave with the satisfaction of having played my 
small role in launching a wonderful institution and I 
am sure will – that I am sure will outlive me.  Thank 
you for your love, support and help at every step of 
the way.  I seek your blessings for my future – for my 
journey ahead.  Rajesh Sundaram.”  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  So a reader 
10 
of this letter would say look you really parted – you even sought 
blessing from them so you were quite happy interacting wi th them over 
the three month’s period. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Well I would agree with that – disagree with 
that because I wrote this letter because you know I was filled with a lot 
of anger.  Like I said I had decided to leave much earlier but I had 
always known that you know when you leave and you part ways there 
should not be any of that bitterness…  
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no.  No Mr Sundaram.  Listen to the question.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes thank you Mr Chairman. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman is not talking about what you felt. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Hm but what I have…  
CHAIRPERSON:  She is talking about what somebody reading this book 
what impression they would get of how you felt.  So that is what she is 
asking? 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 202 of 225 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes thank you Mr Chairman. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Well I agree with… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in other words the question is would you agree 
that a person reading this letter of resignation would have thought that 
you left [what is the word you used?] but effectively you ..  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  The Gupta’s you were happy 
with them and even sought their blessings.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you were happy with them.  
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Well  I would think that if they read my book 
and the circumstances under which this resignations came they would 
understand. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No, no, no. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  What I am talking about.  But ja if…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Somebody who has not read your book but just reads 
the letter. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Well they would very easily tend to 
misunderstand they would think I was happy when I quit and all of that 
but you know what puts this letter in context is the book, is the book.   
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC :  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Because I like I said I am not somebody 
who would take bitterness to my grave you know. Of course I had 
differences with them.  Of course I would never work with them again 
but I just wanted you know a severance of ways, a parting of ways 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 203 of 225 
 
which was amicable and just move on you know so that time I meet 
Luxmi Goel somewhere in Delhi it would not be like I am avoiding his 
gaze or what you know or moving in the other direction.  Uncomfortable 
because we had a – these serious differences. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA N ORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So my intention in writing this letter was to 
write a very kind, polite letter which is that is the kind of person I am.  
Put that in their hand and go and I think that is how it would have 
ended unless they had their b ody guards chase after me, unless they 
had all the other events that happened between the time I gave my 
10 
resignation and you know my exit from South Africa.  So things will 
have to be taken into context.  But like I said you know in terms of by 
relationship with Atul Gupta or Laxmi Goel they had been decent in 
their conduct with me and the way the spoke with me they were 
respectful until the time I had resigned until the time the things 
changed when I saw the rude side, the side which was not polite.  
Because this was before I had those bitter experiences.  Before Laxmi 
Goel said that you know you have a two year contract with us you 
cannot leave before that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But Mr Sundaram. 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please hold on.  You have told me the conditions 
under which you were working there ahead of the launch.  Having few 
hours of sleep. You did say of course the salary was great.  That you 
said.  So you had that situation you know and then you did say that you 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 204 of 225 
 
had no – effectively you were not going to play any role in the editorial 
policy of the channel because you were told that had been already been 
decided.  You had – you formed a view quite soon if I understood your 
evidence correctly quite soon after you started working in South Afr ica 
that this was not a place you wanted to be in for a long time.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that must be because you were unhappy with 
what you saw happening there?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But your letter seems to suggest  that you were very 
10 
happy.  So in the process of wanting to leave amicably did you 
misrepresent what your true feelings were about this work place?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I would not say misrepresent you know 
because the kind of person that I am when I write  a letter I – even if 
there is a lot of bitterness and even if there is a lot of things that I did 
not agree with I would not let that reflect in a resignation letter.  I 
would write that in a decent way.  But having said that yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes you know my feelings at that time are 
not reflected in the resignation letter.  I was angry I was …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I was conned into this project.  Also you 
know I could have written all of those things and gott en into a fight with 
them which I wanted to avoid I was too tired by that time.  My health 
had – I had serious issues with my health by which time.  I was 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 205 of 225 
 
basically tired and I was – I knew that this project had taken off and it 
was a butt of a lot of joke s on social media because of the way the 
launch took place and I just wanted an exit.  I agree with you that this – 
this resignation letter did not reflect my mood at that time.  It did not 
reflect my anger.  It did not reflect all the things that I wanted  to say 
but it was a conscious decision on my part that I wanted to write a 
letter which was – which did not – which did not have any bitterness in 
it which thanked them for the opportunity they gave me but which told 
them very firmly that this is where I – that I want to part ways.  This is 
a resignation letter and I just want to move on.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Must I understand what you have just said to mean 
that you took a conscious decision that you must write – you should 
write a letter that did not correctly represent how you felt at the time?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes.  Yes that is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there may have been different ways of writing the 
letter and I just want your comment.  One way would have been to 
ventilate your unhappiness and the reasons  why you were unhappy that 
would be one way.  You did not want that because you wanted the 
parting of ways to be amicable.  Another way would have been to say 
you know what okay I will not ventilate all the reasons why I am 
20 
unhappy but at the same time I a m not going to misrepresent how I feel 
or I am not going to praise these people after what I have experienced 
here.  I will just say I have decided that it is time to move on and I 
would be leaving and that is it. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Hm you see… 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 206 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And not say much but this letter seems to me to – to 
heap praises on your employer. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Sure see I did not see any reason to give 
them reasons why I am quitting they knew about it because I raised 
each and every one of them with that – the laws that they were 
breaking. The violation of the labour laws, visa laws.  Whether it was 
about the compromising the editorial integrity that was happening.  All 
of those issues I had raised and I had found no solution to those. So I 
did not think it was right and about to bring those issues up because 
that is something that they knew already and they had already made up 
10 
my mind that they did not want to address it in the way that I wanted it 
so the only way for me was to go out and at that time the mental 
condition in which I was I thought the best thing would be to write a 
polite mail, thank them, say that you know I had – this was one of the 
best opportunities that I got and just soft soap myself out of the 
situation you know without – because if I told them the [indistinct] 
reason why I am quitting then they will say that it is probably I am 
trying to angle for them to better the conditions so that I can continue 
to stay on that was not my intention.  I had decided to snap my ties 
with them, snap it for good.  Or course I had said here that until they 
20 
find a successor I was willing to continue because I did not want to 
leave them high and dry in the sense that you know just pack my bags 
and move overnight.  I had given them that opportunity if they want it 
which I thought was the fair thing to do – you know – and the kind of 
person who I am even today if I had to do – if I worked in a similar 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 207 of 225 
 
situation I would do the same thing which is to thank them, to politely 
say that I seek your blessings on my journey forward and not – you 
know – look forward not look back to what had happened because those 
things have already been done and dusted and I was very clear that 
they did not want to improve on any of that or make conditions better 
that I stayed on or things like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I just – I just (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  But as at that time when you wrote the letter were the 
three months that you had spent there working there the most 
10 
exhilarating three months and was that  the best phase in your career as 
at that time? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Well I would answer that question in two 
ways.  Was it exhilarating when it came to working with the Guptas and 
interacting with President Zuma and all the dirty tricks and all of that 
was happening absolutely not but was it exhilarating working with the 
young team that I was working with absolutely it was?  Was it 
exhilarating working with the passionate young people the passion that 
they had for learning new techniques, the passion that they had – you 
know - to work according to the high standards of production and 
20 
journalism absolutely.  So to answer your question it was exhilarating 
working with the team who was there …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And interact with the young South Africans 
… 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 208 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Who I was working with … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And I am still very proud to say that I am 
still 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Friends with most of them.  I continue to be 
in touch with them also (indistinct).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And in terms of the – I have set up about 
10 
five stations so far in my life …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And when it comes to the people who I met 
here … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  The youngest who we had hired I have not 
found that calibre or that passion anywhere else.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That I have set up. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So yes but not – not in the sense that ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That I think was …  
CHAIRPERSON:  In relation to your team?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 209 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was true only in relation to (intervenes).  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes, because you know what they did was 
nothing short of a miracle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  In terms of – you know – despite all the 
challenges to set up a station …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That was fit enough to go on air.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Of course whatever deficiencies that were 
10 
there but the very fact that 60 to 70 percent of the staff …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  The people who were – it was their first job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  To be able to train them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  To be able to – I do not know – use their 
passion, to launch the stations as soon as possible because if we have 
got experienced they will just say it is not possible.  You cannot launch 
a station at this short notice …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  But those were young people who put their 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  You know I remember some of them would 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 210 of 225 
 
come in early in the morning – six/seven – and stay on late in the night 
and even then there was one (indistinct) vehicle which was provided 
which would go in the opposite direction and then come back pick these 
people up and they would spend one hour extra in the office because 
the Gupta family could not find it in their pockets to put an extra 
vehicle to take the people (indistinct) but they would expect them to be 
in the office at six in the morning and most of them did not do it 
grudging.  All of them as a matter of fact – I do not know anybody who 
worked that hard for those many hours with full dedication grudgingly.  
They did it with their passion …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And like I said I have never (indistinct) such 
a young team which is passionate about the work like I found in South 
Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may continue. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  I did 
not establish the time that the Chairperson would want to adjourn 
today. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if you – if you wish to finish what you want to 
finish today you can continue …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For some time. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 211 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know what you have in mind.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise we can continue tomorrow.  So there is still 
time if you wan 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  There is still time? 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you want to wrap up or … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Maybe I should wrap up 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  With the issues relating … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  To the letter as well.  Thank 
you Mr Chairman.  So – and as the Chairperson has indicated to you 
then your letter you also leave a window that looked inasmu ch as I am 
putting this to an end but I am still open to assist with the project.  It is 
a wonderful project. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  You see because as I a professional I think 
I cannot just pack my bags and go especially when I am leaving the 
team. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So what I meant by saying that was that of 
course they would – they do not have a succession plan because it was 
very early in the project and it was all haphazard.  So you – you decide 
on getting another person and till that person comes in there I am 
ready to hold fort – you know – but as of today please take this as my 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 212 of 225 
 
resignation letter … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  But I will continue for as long as it takes for 
you to find a new person who is suitable and who can replace me.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  But I was very clear that this is my 
resignation letter.  That is clear.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes and then when you left 
on 2 September had they found a replacement?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No, because then by that time the whole 
10 
sequence of events had changed very quickly and they had gone very 
hostile and there was – they were trying to cause me to stay first and 
then they wanted me to sign a document.  Like I said for the first month 
that I worked from 1 May 2013 to 1 June 2013 I still have not been paid 
for that.  The work that I had did in India – I have not been paid for that 
(indistinct) but I have not pressed for that.  You kn ow – initially at that 
time I said that I want it but they said if you are leaving right now – if 
you have resigning right now we will not give you whatever is due to 
you.  I also – you know – at that time we were working long hours.  We 
were working weekends.  We were working public holidays all of that 
20 
and I had a query that – you know – am I entitled to any overtime on 
this.  I was told that I was not because I was on the management which 
I did not want to believe him.  You know – I do not know whether it is 
true or not but I said that I would want to consult a lawyer to see if that 
is true.  If that is true I would leave that claim but at least the one 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 213 of 225 
 
month – the very first month – I have not been paid.  My salary started 
from the time I came to South Africa and the salary was credited into 
the State Bank of India Branch at Johannesburg.  So I am willing to 
give regards there as well.  The salary was credited from the time I 
came to South Africa but the one month that I spent in India.  I have 
not been paid for that … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Oh. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And I am not claiming that as well.  You 
know – I would not now say that I want that money.  I have given that 
up.  The larger issue here is you know – what happened after I 
10 
resigned and – you know – then thinking that they could intimidate the 
editor by sending bodyguards after them and chasing me and all the 
events that happened that I have described in the book.  My hotel room 
was burgled.  I had – I have never been as scared as that  in my entire 
life and believe I have covered several wars.  I have covered wars and 
(indistinct) but those last few days and hours in South Africa were the 
scariest in my life.  I actually thought that I would die.  That I would not 
see my family again – you know – and the kind of influence that they 
had.  You know – one day after giving the interviews my hotel room was 
burgled.  When I went to the – to the police to file a complaint they said 
20 
that - I told them that I am leaving for India.  They said you cannot file 
the complaint.  The hotel owner does it and the hotel owner filed the 
complaint at that time.  Also I could not go to the Indian High 
Commission because Virendra  Gupta was the High Commission at that 
time was very close – had very close ties with the Gupta family.  So I 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 214 of 225 
 
did not know how that would playout.  So here I was all alone 
thousands of miles away from my family and I could not go to any of my 
colleagues because I would put them into trouble beucse they were 
there with tier families and their children and the fact that I could 
sought refuge at their home.  They would – they would be as much in 
trouble.  So I was out there and that is when I called my wife and then 
she told me that why do you not go to the media and tell them that your 
life is in danger.  That way and then the whole world knows that if 
anything happens to you it is because of the Guptas.  They would 
probably stay off and then she booked me a ticket on South African 
10 
Airways and even till the time I was at the airport and I cl eared 
immigration will I was in the air I was scared that - you know – I will 
probably be brought be back and – you know …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  This would happen.  So of course this 
happened after my resignation …  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And things got worse. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, because I am just thinking 
because had you taken a different approach I am just trying to see what 
20 
else could they have done to you because the media industry would – 
would have backed you up because what you say in your book if I may 
just refer you to that page – page 162 of your book.  You say something 
there which I believe that the entire South African public would have 
supported you had you r esigned and told them the things that you say 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 215 of 225 
 
in the book.  If you could just read that paragraph – those few 
paragraphs on page 162. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  “I consider objectivity …”  
This is 162 right? 
CHAIRPERSON:   
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  “…objectivity to be at the core of 
the journalism.  I was unwittingly drafted and to be 
part of a sinister plan to build – in my opinion – a 
propaganda television station.  I quit because I did 
10 
not want to be part of this.  I quit because I did not 
want to compromise the values that had guided me 
for 20 years as a journalist.  I wrote this book to 
invite constant public scrutiny of this channel.  I 
hope this vigilance will force the channel to be 
objective in the content it produces.”  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So this then you 
formulated at the point when now things – relations between you have 
become hostile but otherwise had they allowed you – I would imagine – 
to just exit in the manner in which you wanted to exit you wo uld not 
20 
have had to write the book.  Am I correct?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  To be very honest probably not because you 
know what I – what I saw there was total contempt – you know - 
because regardless of me being Rajesh  Sundaram and I was before 
them in my last meeting when they sent their bodyguards after me I was 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 216 of 225 
 
the editor of a news station.  So what I thought was that you know 
those 
insults 
that 
were 
being 
heaped 
at 
me 
was 
not 
at 
Rajesh Sundaram but at the – the office of an editor – at a journalist.  
That is what angered me and that continued.  It was not just the 
bodyguards chasing me out but they were constantly trying to play mind 
games with me.  They were constantly – you know – there was an 
attempt to burgle my hotel room.  So that is what really – you know – 
made me think at that time that I – you know – it is not because they 
insulted me or because they chased me out (indistinct) but because of 
the – of the kind of mind-set that thinks journalist or an editor is 
10 
somebody that – that you can have your bodyguards chase and have 
their house burgled and intimidated.  So I – I wrote this book because – 
you know – that is when I decided that this should come out in front of 
the South African public all these details should be known by then as 
well – you know.  It is not just okay for me to not be happy with the 
situation not be happy with all the compromises that are happening and 
just quit and move out but it is also important for me to tell that story 
so that a large audience knows about this and like I sai d there is – if – 
if - we know that ANN7 was made – you know – this is the background 
which you know the channel came into existence.  There was to be a 
20 
constant public vigilance that – you know – for any content that they 
put out there should be constant scrutiny to ensure that they did not 
violate any things that I have written about in this book because the 
people of South Africa need to know the circumstances and the reasons 
why the station was set up. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 217 of 225 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Mr Chairman 
maybe to just close off the resignation issue because there is a letter 
that is referred – that is attached to the bundle – EXHIBIT CC1A and B.  
I am sure you are familiar with that letter Mr  Sundaram.  Could you just 
turn to page 29?  That is a  letter from the lawyers of Infinity Media.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  29? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Page 29.  Have you found it?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  In paragraph 2 of 
that letter they are actually quoting from your – from your letter of 
10 
resignation.  Is that correct?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And then they were saying that 
now you were the cause of whatever hiccups were there at ANN7 and 
they intended to serve you with docume nts supposing – maybe 
summons to claim damages from you.  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Well I responded to this notice that I got or 
an email and I told them that I would go ahead – you know – they were 
basically trying to tell me not to talk to the media or to int eract with the 
public in anyway and I wrote back in an email and I told them that I will 
20 
continue to do that.  Please go ahead file whatever – take whatever 
legal action you have to take against me and I would come to South 
Africa to defend myself because I am convinced about – you know – the 
interviews that I am giving in the media are based on facts that I know 
and I will – I stand by them.  So this letter came to me in 2013.  It is 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 218 of 225 
 
2019 now.  I have not heard back from the lawyers.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So that is the background to this.  Of 
course – you know – I have explained they – you know – I wrote this – I 
do agree that I did write this and - and like I said there were two 
aspects for setting up the station.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  It was working with the wonderful team and 
also with the (indistinct) management team which was there which was 
not the best three years – three months of my life but working with a 
10 
passionate team in setting up and doing the impossible - you know.  
Setting up a station in three months is something which is unheard of 
and which was done here and that was not because of me.  It was 
definitely not because of the Guptas and Nazeem  Howa.  It was 
because of the passion and the hard work and the long hours the 
sweat, blood and toil of the – of the staff who are coming here.  Most of 
whom - for whom it was the first job and most of whom gave everything 
that they had to launch the station and I do not think they h ave 
received a single word of thank you from anybody – you know.  So of 
course at this time I would want to place on record the hard work that 
20 
they put in there to launch the station.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  Thank you 
Mr Chair we will be moving on to new areas tomorrow.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No that is fine. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 219 of 225 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before we adjourn. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is my understanding correct that during the time  when 
you were working for the station you or let me put it this way.  At some 
stage you seemed to say you had raided your issues with the Gupta 
brothers.  Is that correct?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The things that you were unhappy about?  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what had been their response?  
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  You know I remember like for instance the 
abuse of staff.  There is this one time when he actually physically 
assaulted one of the employees and I took him aside an d I told him that 
this is not acceptable.  You know you are undermining the authority of 
the managers here if you go and do this.  If you have any issues let us 
do it in a way things should be done in the office – you know.  One is 
that he did not have any  understanding of the broadcast.  For instance 
if there was a bug in the system and the teleprompter he thought that it 
was sabotage.  That somebody was trying to sabotage his news 
bulletins or if there is – you know – the play out system suddenly had a 
20 
glitch.  He would think it is the guy who is sitting and doing the play out 
– you know who was being paid by his rivals to do that.  He would to 
and abuse them – you know – call them things like monkeys and things 
like that.  So I would take him aside and sa y you cannot do that – you 
know- because you do not understand that is happening here.  So then 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 220 of 225 
 
he would say oh I know I should not be doing that but I am diabetic – 
you know.  So sometimes when I have low sugar or high sugar these 
things happen.  I am sorry about it and the next day the same thing 
would happen – you know.  He would go out and scream at somebody 
or also things like – you know – he could perch himself on the 
mezzanine floor and he would keep looking at what is happening.  Who 
is doing what work without knowing – for instance you know there was a 
person who was on the output desk constantly making (indistinct) for 
the bulletin half hour after half hour, hour after the hour and he was 
glued to his chair because that is what he was supposed to b e doing 
10 
and that is a very stressful job and he would be sitting from there not 
knowing what it was he would call me and say what is that guy doing 
there.  I said he is making (indistinct).  He is the guy who is the output 
head and you know he has got to m ake sure that all the stories are 
factually correct, the sequential order is okay and you know it has all 
the elements like the – the tags and all the factors there.  So how do I 
know that he is working and not watching porn site because he has not 
moved from the chair.  So – you know – as a professional you do not 
want to say to something like that you know because it was somebody 
who had no understanding of what was happening but you know wanting 
20 
to interfere in micromanage …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And making sure that he prevailed.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, and about your views about the involvement of 
Mr Zuma did you articulate your concerns about his – the role he was 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 221 of 225 
 
playing? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No, I did ask a few questions to …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And people who were part of the marketing 
team.  I do not want to name the person because I could get him into 
trouble but it was a well-established fact that that was the ownership 
baton. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  As a journalist I know that if – that was the 
decision I should have taken before I joined.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  If I had known there was a conflict of 
interest I would not have …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  But after I come in as journalist join as an 
editor it is not my business to say the chance (intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  It was for me to quit which is what I did.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and then in your book I was looking for this in 
your statement and it looks like I saw it in your book at page 85 
somewhere in the middle you write:  
“Atul …” 
This is in the context of the breakfast meetings and SABC and the New 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 222 of 225 
 
Age.  I see you write: 
“Atul boasted to me once that he could get any 
National or Provincial Minister he wanted for the 
show.” 
You see that? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you confirm whether that is indeed what 
Mr Atul Gupta said to you? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It is – that part of what you say is quite 
10 
interesting 
also 
because 
Mr  Themba Mashego 
– 
I 
mentioned 
Mr Themba Mashego earlier to you.  Mr  Themba Mashego if I recall his 
evidence correctly testified before me last year and if I remember 
correctly also said something to more or less the same effect as 
something that was said by Mr Ajay Gupta to him that if there was any 
Minister who was not cooperating and this was in this context of - 
according to Mr Mashego – Mr Ajay Gupta wanting Mr Mashego as 
Director-General of GCIS to “cooperate” with regard to the Gupta 
brothers or their businesses getting a certain share of the advertising 
revenue and Mr Mashego – if I recall his evidence – said that 
20 
Mr Ajay Gupta said that if there was any Minister who was not 
cooperating he should tell him in fact which one and – I cannot 
remember the words that he used – but whatever words he used 
according to Mr Mashego – conveyed the impression to me that 
Mr Ajay Gupta was saying that they would report him to former 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 223 of 225 
 
President Zuma or they would say what to do with a Minister who was 
not cooperating.  So here you have you have …  
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Oh yes, because also my introduction like it 
will be … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Mr Sundaram, hang on hang on.  You have in 
your book a statement which seems very similar which seems to 
resonate with what Mr Mashego said namely that – but now this was 
Mr Atul Gupta not Mr Ajay Gupta saying to you for those breakfast 
shows or briefings they could - he could - get any National Minister or 
Provincial Minister that he wanted to the show.  
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Also you know I was told that these 
meetings were insanely profitable.  That was the word Nazeem  Howa 
would use because it was not just when the Mi nister came that it was – 
you know – they would sell the tables around it.  The cost for the 
broadcast was of course with the SABC and the Ministers would come 
and sometimes the Ministers would also be (indistinct) to paying for the 
venue and the meal that was served as well.  So clearly it was pure 
greedy for the Guptas or the New Age because they did not have to 
20 
spend for the broadcast.  They did not have to spend for the venue in 
some cases and whatever – you know – whatever tables were sold at 
those meetings was a pure profit that went into (indistinct).  I still 
remember there was one time when there was one of these meetings 
that was scheduled in Cape Town and I was asked to go with them to 
03 JUNE 2019 – DAY 104 
 
Page 224 of 225 
 
Cape Town for that meeting and they actually flew in a private  jet.  So I 
just asked Nazeem about this.  You know – do you actually enough 
money to fly down?  Why do you not fly commercial because would that 
not make more business sense.  So he said no.  This is insanely 
profitable.  We are going to Cape Town.  I do not know the member the 
Minister who was there but the Ministry had paid for the venue.  They 
had even got the stakeholders to buy tickets and come and see this – 
to be seated there.  So all of that was happening.  So it was like I said 
in most cases it was pure greedy for the Gupta brothers.  They were 
not doing anything.  They were just – and it was most people who would 
10 
come and buy the chairs there because that was an opportunity to 
network with the Minister and the high bureaucrats who came with them 
and that was what was being sold and - you know – and it was 
broadcast on SABC because that was another selling point for the – for 
the Guptas there.  So this is something that they openly admitted and 
whenever there were problems that the marketing team ha d in getting 
any of the Ministers that would be reported in the Executive Committee 
Meeting and then Atul Gupta would make a note of it and it was taken 
up during these meetings with President  Zuma. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, thank you. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. We will – we will adjourn at this stage and then 
we will start at 10 o’ clock tomorrow?
