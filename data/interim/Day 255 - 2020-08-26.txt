PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 26 AUGUST 2020 
CHAIRPERSON: 
  
Good 
morning 
Ms 
Hofmeyr, 
good 
morning everybody. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we ready? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  We are indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair there are a few just administrative 
matters if we could commence with them?  Today we have 
the evidence of Mr Vuyisile Ndzeku who was originally 
10 
scheduled to give evidence in February but we had run out 
of time then and so he is present today to give his 
evidence. 
 
He has requested the assistance of an Isi-Xhosa 
interpreter today and so we have Mr Dunjwa here as our 
interpreter. I understand that he will need to take an oath 
prior to the commencement of the proceedings. 
 
And then Mr Ndzeku’s legal representatives did 
introduce themselves to you on the last occasion but I 
would ask that they just be permitted to place themselves 
20 
on record and I understand there is one aspect they want 
to raise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay let them just place themselves 
on record and they can do so from where they are.  Just 
switch on the microphone so I can hear you.  Yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 4 of 388 
 
ADV ALLI:  Thank you Chair good morning.  My name is Mr 
Y Alli I appear on behalf of Mr Ndzeku and JM Aviation.  I 
am instructed by Mr [00:01:22] of A J Beyet [?] Attorneys.  
Chair there was just one issue we wish to raise this 
morning is the affidavit Mr Jules Aires of JM Aviation has 
filed an affidavit dealing with the issue of the ground power 
units for the EPU.  So the request we wanted to make was 
that that affidavit be read into the record today.  And I will 
explain why we want that to be done. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Sorry Chair could I just interrupt I do 
10 
apologise Mr Alli.  I have just been informed that we are 
not picking up your voice.  I think it might be because you 
are quite far from the microphone and given that Mr Alli is 
going to be addressing on an aspect, I thought it important 
just to make sure that we are picking up his voice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes because we must – we must record.  
If – failing which maybe you can go to the podium they will 
sanitise so that we make sure we – we – what you say. 
ADV ALLI:  That is fine Chair I think I perhaps should just 
pitch my voice in this general direction rather. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us get indications if that is going to 
help.  Maybe to be on the safe side I think just go to the 
podium.   
ADV ALLI:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 5 of 388 
 
ADV ALLI:  So I was saying that dealing with the affidavit 
of Mr Jules Aires so it was our request that the request of 
JM Aviation – that the affidavit of Mr Jules Aires and the 
GPU aspect particularly be read into the record.  I will 
explain the reason why we say that that is necessary is the 
issue of the GPU’s has become an issue that is widely 
associated with JM Aviation but in fact if you read the 
affidavit of Mr Aires two things come through particularly 
Chair is the one that the entire hype that is created around 
the issue of the GPU’s is actually a storm in a teacup.  It is 
10 
not really anything and the GPU’s were in fact sold at the 
market related cost to SAA.  Now I had occasion to discuss 
the issue of the affidavit with my learned friend before the 
commencement of these proceedings.  And her position is 
that it will not be necessary to read the affidavit into the 
proceedings because it will be dealt with during the course 
of the day.  We do not have an issue with that.  If that is 
the position of the commission and the evidence leaders 
that is fine by us.  But for – we- so we will hold over the 
request for so long as the salient facts that appear in the 
20 
affidavit come through.  If that is not the case at the end of 
the day or at the end of Mr Ndzeku’s evidence we will then 
address Chair on that further. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ALLI:  So that is the only issue we wish to raise for 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 6 of 388 
 
the moment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ALLI:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no, no that is fine.  No I am sure that 
its contents will be dealt with in due course.  I think that 
Ms Hofmeyr will indicate what her intentions are or plans 
are with regard to it.  But there is no evidence that will not 
be taken into account and to the extent that it may be 
necessary to make sure that it is publicly known what the – 
what the deponent to that affidavit says that is usually 
10 
taken care of either when the witness comes and gives 
evidence or when the evidence placed on the website of 
the commission for the public to see.  And of course there 
could be an opportunity for somebody to indicate what the 
gist of that affidavit is.  Okay? 
ADV ALLI:  Thank you Chair we appreciate that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.   
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair if I could then request the swearing 
in of the interpreter and then we can proceed? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You have the interpreter ’s oath with 
20 
you? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I do indeed and we have given another 
copy to Mr Dunjwa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So he also has that. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 7 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  And then just administer 
that oath but it is not the one you normally do okay.  But 
ask the – ask the preliminary questions that you normally 
ask but he will then read that oath.  Now that oath is in 
English.  Now the interpreter will have to interpret unless 
Mr Ndzeku’s says for purposes of the oath he has no 
problem reading it in English and understanding it?  Do we 
know if that is the position?  Okay maybe what we will do 
is let it be interpreted just to be on the safe side.  Ja okay.  
The oath we are still doing now is for the interpreter 
10 
actually not for Mr Ndzeku.  I think I got confused.  Ja.  
Okay.  Do that Mr Registrar for the interpreter.  I think 
maybe just remove your mask so that you can be recorded 
properly. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
MR DUNJWA:  Zwelinzima Job Dunjwa. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR DUNJWA:    No. 
REGISTRAR:  Please read the oath as in front of you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you have not asked him if he 
considers it binding on his conscience. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR DUNJWA:  Yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 8 of 388 
 
REGISTRAR:  And then please read the read before you. 
MR DUNJWA:  I, the undersigned hereby state under oath I 
am proficient in English and Isi-Xhosa and am able to 
interpret, translate from English to Isi-Xhosa and visa 
versa. 
 
I called on the – I called onto translate or interpret 
from Isi-Xhosa to English and from English to Isi-Xhosa in 
any proceedings of this commission. 
 
I undertake to do so honestly and to the best of my 
knowledge and ability. 
10 
 
So help me God. 
REGISTRAR:  Please raise your right hand and say, so 
help me God. 
MR DUNJWA:  So help me God. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  Mr Interpreter I did look 
at documents that were supplied to the evidence leader 
relating your experience with regard to interpreting.  How 
long have you been interpreting from English to Isi-Xhosa 
and Isi-Xhosa to English? 
MR DUNJWA:  It is for 21 years. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MR DUNJWA:  21 years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  21? 
MR DUNJWA:  21 years yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  21 years? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 9 of 388 
 
MR DUNJWA:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the courts? 
MR DUNJWA:  In the courts yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Thank you.  And then I 
guess we have to do the oath for Mr Ndzeku. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  And Mr Interpreter you will 
interpret. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MR NDZEKU:  Vuyisile Ndzeku. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the 
prescribed oath? 
MR NDZEKU:  No objection. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on 
your conscience? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give 
will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the 
truth; if so please raise your right hand and say, so help 
me God. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:  Sworn in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Just before we get to 
commence with Mr Ndzeku’s evidence I thought it might be 
useful just to orientate ourselves as to where we are in the 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 10 of 388 
 
aviation in evidence because it has been interspersed with 
much else before the commission.  Mr Ndzeku is a director 
and shareholder of the entity JM Aviation and you will 
recall Chair that in the February session of evidence that 
the aviation work stream presented JM Aviation was a 
company that had had various dealings with SAA and SAA 
Technical.  And it is those matters which we wish to probe 
today. 
 
When Mr Ndzeku was scheduled to give evidence 
on the last occasion in February, we had not yet received 
10 
an affidavit or statement from him.  We did however 
because he was in a sense squeezed out of the time in the 
schedule we did subsequent to that February evidence 
receive a document entitled affidavit albeit not signed or 
deposed to.  Now that was of course explained on the 
basis of the limitations presented by the Covid situation at 
the time.  We take no issue with that but I will certainly 
commence Mr Ndzeku’s evidence by asking him to confirm 
its contents.   
 
My learned friend has also indicated that we did 
20 
also receive an affidavit from Mr Jules Aires and he has 
indicated already today Chair that that affidavit deals with 
amongst other things the GPU’s the ground power units. 
 
Chair I indicated to Mr Alli as he indicated to you 
Chair that there was no need to read that whole affidavit 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 11 of 388 
 
into the record.  It has been taken into account.  I will 
direct you to it in the bundle that we will enter as an 
exhibit into the evidence today.   
 
There will be occasions where I will make reference 
to it but Mr Ndzeku is here today to give evidence.  It is his 
personal knowledge that I am probing and what he is quite 
clear about in his affidavit and he will correct me later if I 
am wrong in this characterisation is that he has fairly 
limited involvement in the operations of JM Aviation so I 
need to probe with him the things about which he does 
10 
have personal knowledge. 
 
Mr Aires’s version is there.  It is before the 
commission. It will be entered into today.  I will refer to it 
once or twice I think but more than that I do not intend to 
do.  But certainly, Mr Aires’ version on the GPU’s will have 
been placed before the commission and will be entered into 
the record today. 
 
Chair if I could then suggest administratively in 
relation to the exhibit.  The exhibit is Exhibit DD26 you will 
see.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  A lot of things have been happening. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So I have been. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Been happening. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So I am approaching with caution at this 
point Chair. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 12 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  There have been – things have been 
evolving. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What we have since been – since been 
doing of late is just to refer to the file as a bundle. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We give it a bundle name, bundle number 
and then say inside the file is not attached to an affidavit 
we will need to have an exhibit number of its own.  So – so 
we have been… 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  We can facilitate that today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And I am greatly indebted to the team at 
the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Who have assisted me in facilitating that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  What we have done is on the first page of 
20 
the index if you open it in the larger file in front of you 
Chair that is the smaller one.  You will see I think that they 
are more wise on these matters than I and so they assisted 
me in facilitating that.  What you will see is that the index 
actually gives a number in the left hand column running 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 13 of 388 
 
from number 1 to number 30. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Those are all the documents in the two 
files before you to which reference will be made today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And so we have usefully been aided by 
what I will then use as the exhibit number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  On the left hand side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  When I refer to them I will go back to the 
index and I will indicate that is Exhibit for example 6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That – so I propose doing that the only 
important point for me though is the pagination because I 
had worked with the pagination for my referencing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So Mr Ndzeku if I could just explain to 
20 
you what we are envisaging and then Chair with your leave 
ask you to enter… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  So basically, what you proposing is 
that the various items on the index. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 14 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would be allocated – the exhibit numbers 
that coincide with the numbers on the left. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there will be Exhibit 1, Exhibit 2 up to 
whatever. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – and – and would the file be labelled 
as a bundle DD26? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes I would suggest that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Because it follows the sequencing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So if we can do that, we will simply call 
the file Bundle DD26. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And then as I go to a particular document 
within those files. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  They do span two files Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But because we using individual numbers 
for the document that should not be a problem for us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 15 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I will indicate which number document we 
are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Engaged with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja no that is fine. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So Mr Ndzeku just to orientate you there 
are two files in front of you.  Those are the files that we 
have indicated for the record are comprised Bundle DD26.  
There is a first thicker file and a second thinner file but I 
will guide you to look at the top… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might have to give him a chance to 
interpret. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And be slower. 
MR NDZEKU:  No Chair it is okay let us go ahead because 
I can … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so far it is fine. 
MR NDZEKU:  If I have got a problem, I will say please ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Alright.  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair as I understand the request for the 
20 
interpreter it was really at a point Mr Ndzeku please 
correct me if I am wrong. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When he gives evidence. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  If there is an aspect that you require 
assistance with you will ask.  Is that correct? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 16 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay, okay.  Does that apply to the 
evidence as well? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Let us confirm.  Mr Ndzeku in the 
evidence are you comfortable responding to be unless you 
require the assistance of the interpreter? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well that is exactly if I have got a problem I 
will ask him to help. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so but you will be happy to start? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Giving evidence in English whenever you 
10 
have a problem then you will request an interpreter. 
MR NDZEKU:  Problem I will ask.  Yes Chair thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright.  That is fine. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Mr Ndzeku.  As I was saying I 
will then direct you to page numbers on the documents 
which you will find in the top right hand corner.  Are you 
comfortable with that?  And Mr Ndzeku just for the record if 
you nod your answer does not get reflected on the record 
so please make sure to give a verbal answer t the 
questions. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And maybe just a bit closer to the 
microphone if you would. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you speak try and not be too far 
from it. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 17 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And when you start giving 
evidence most of the time look at me so I can understand 
you correctly – hear you properly.  Yes but for now Ms 
Hofmeyr is explaining some procedural things. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or are you done? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  The last one is just that – so the 
pagination number top right hand corner will direct you to 
the document.  Then I will have it entered as an exhibit and 
10 
then I will ask my questions in relation to it.  Are you 
comfortable with that?  And again if you could say yes 
loudly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You will have to remember this.  
When you have to give an answer whether it is a yes or a 
no nodding is not good enough.  You have got to say yes 
so that that is captured and is recorded.  Okay alright.  
And you voice do raise your voice as well. 
MR NDZEKU:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright thank you. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Mr Ndzeku.  Chair with your 
leave if I may then commence the evidence? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you.  Mr Ndzeku I would like to 
take you to the first document you will find in the big file in 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 18 of 388 
 
front of you and you will find it after the index and it bears 
a page number 000.1 if you could get that in front of you 
please?   
MR NDZEKU:  The number – is the number 2 or what?  
Number 3? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It is number 1. 
MR NDZEKU:  Number 1 okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you have that document? 
MR NDZEKU:  Number 1 yes I do. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And what is that document? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:  Sorry? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  What is the document? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well it is an affidavit. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I understand it to be your affidavit that 
you provided to the commission, is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I would like you to go to the last page of 
that document if you would.  You will see that at page 
000.14 – 14.  If you page to the last page of the affidavit 
you will find that at page 14.  Just before Tab 2.   
20 
MR NDZEKU:  Is that page 13 or what? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes and then the next page is page 14.  
Do you have that? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes I have got it yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That bears your name but not your 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 19 of 388 
 
signature, is that correct Mr Ndzeku? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Have you considered the contents of this 
document? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well I do not have a signature here. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  I do not have my signature – I do not have 
it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Correct.  Have you read this affidavit? 
MR NDZEKU:  I did no did not no. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So you did not read this document. 
MR NDZEKU:  No. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
Before 
it 
was 
provided 
to 
the 
commission? 
MR NDZEKU:  No.  First time. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Ndzeku this is a document a fourteen 
page document. 
MR NDZEKU:  No but – sorry Counsel you asking me a 
question.  I read it I said no I did not.  It is the first time 
now I am looking at it now. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No I understand that thank you. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Now I would like to follow up. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  After February and the evidence of the 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 20 of 388 
 
commission. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Your attorneys. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Provided the commission with this 14 
page document. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And they said this 14 page document is 
your affidavit.  It sets out your account of the story and the 
events relevant for the commission.  And they explained 
10 
that it could not be signed at the time and deposed to 
because of lockdown realities in the country.  So that is 
why I asked whether you have read this document before 
today.  Have you read the document before today? 
MR NDZEKU:  Before today – no I did not Counsel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you know whether – do you mean you 
have never seen this document before? 
MR NDZEKU:  This one Chair is the first time I am looking 
at it now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that so.  Is there an unsigned affidavit 
20 
that to your knowledge your attorneys prepared for you and 
supplied to the commission or is that something you do not 
know? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well maybe my advisors they can respond 
on that. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 21 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no. 
MR NDZEKU:  This is the first time … 
CHAIRPERSON:  We want to know what you know.  Do you 
know whether your attorneys did prepare. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  An unsigned affidavit. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes Chair yes they did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know that? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes they did yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the position – do you know whether 
10 
they supplied an unsigned affidavit to the commission that 
they said would be your affidavit?  Is that something you 
know, is that something you do not know? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well I can say… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to know what you know. 
MR NDZEKU:  I can say that I do not know Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not know.  Is there is a statement 
that they discussed with you which they said they would 
supply to the commission. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes we did have that discussion. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you remember whether you did sign 
such a statement or you did not? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes I did remember I did sign the statement. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 22 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did sign the statement? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes.  That was – that time long time ago. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – ja.  Would that have been early 
this year? 
MR NDZEKU:  Early this year yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Early this year. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright.  Is it possible that this 
unsigned affidavit is a document that if you were to go 
through you would remember as the document that was 
10 
prepared on your behalf by your attorneys? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes I think so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may be able? 
MR NDZEKU:  May be able yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you have not read it? 
MR NDZEKU:  No I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you have not read it of late? 
MR NDZEKU:  No I did not read it later Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is possible that when you read it you 
might remember that it is your affidavit? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:  Well I think Sir this – they did actually – we 
did – we did have time and then to read and then they 
asked me to sign which is I did sign. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes.  So I think let us just go ahead Chair it 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 23 of 388 
 
must be okay. 
Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Ndzeku can I ask 
you to go to page 1 of the affidavit in front of you?  And 
you will find that at 000.1 the one that bears your name, do 
you see that? 
MR NDZEKU:  Page 1 yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Could I ask you to take a moment 
10 
and read this page and read the next page and the third 
page and just help us with whether this is a document you 
worked on with your attorneys and which reflects your 
version of events? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Ndzeku have you had an opportunity 
to look at the document?  Does the document set out your 
account of the matters that the commission is interested 
in? 
MR NDZEKU:  It does yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It does.  Are the statements in it true and 
20 
correct? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry – I am sorry. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just – just indicate are you now able to 
say whether this document reflects your version of the 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 24 of 388 
 
matters that you are going to testify about? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes it does Chair.  It does. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You remember it? 
MR NDZEKU:  Remember it yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is a great relief Mr Ndzeku because 
todays’ all the preparation for today has been based on 
this document which your attorneys sent through to the 
commission on the 27 March of this year indicating to us it 
was your version albeit not signed and deposed to yet and 
10 
they said you would confirm it under oath today.  So I am 
relieved that we have done that. 
MR NDZEKU:  Sorry Counsel this page 1 this version … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just raise your voice Mr Ndzeku. 
MR NDZEKU:  Did you send it to my attorneys?  Do they 
know about it?  This one? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It is the version that they gave to us. 
MR NDZEKU:  Okay.  No it is fine.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Excellent. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And now you have looked at it and it is 
quite important Mr Ndzeku that you be comfortable with 
what is stated here. 
MR NDZEKU:  Thank you.  Thank you. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 25 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That what is stated here is true and 
correct is that the case?  Please say yes. 
MR NDZEKU: Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  If you are nodding thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And is there any correction that you want 
to make to anything in this fourteen page document? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, let us... Counsel, can you just go 
ahead?  And if I am not comfortable I will explain to that, I 
am not comfortable or maybe I do not remember, you know. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  That is fine.  The reason why 
counsel is saying that is that, she does not want to be unfair 
to you. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, yes.  No, I understand, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She wants to make sure that you are 
comfortable ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   Comfortable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...before we proceed. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
20 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And do...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am just concerned about if he did not 
have a look at it since whatever time, whether he does not 
need to really look at it before we proceed.  I do not know.  
What do you...? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 26 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Chair, I am... mind... I am of a similar 
approach, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Because it really is quite important. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  As I indicated.  This came through in 
March. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  It has been the basis for investigation, 
the preparation for today. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  I would not want to proceed with Mr 
Ndzeku this morning unless he had an opportunity to go 
through it again and pick out any aspect that he says is 
inaccurate or not adequate in expressing his view. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And maybe we take a 15-minute 
adjournment to facilitate that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I think we should.  So Mr Ndzeku, I am 
just concerned.  We do not want to be unfair to you because 
20 
you said you have not read it, I think, recently.  So I am 
thinking that I should give you a chance, maybe 15-minutes 
just to go through it again before we ask questions. 
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry, Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 27 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Everything is in this document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are comfortable? 
MR NDZEKU:   These are the things actually I have been on 
that route. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not have to look at it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
MR 
NDZEKU: 
 
 
If 
the 
counsel 
asks 
me 
questions 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   ...I can tell exactly what was happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, excellent.  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   So I am comfortable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  That is fine. 
MR NDZEKU:   The councillor also should be comfortable. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   But now Chair says to me:  No, I want to give 
you 15-minutes that you must go and see it ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   ...with your lawyers and they must advise 
20 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR NDZEKU:   Chair, I have been on that route.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   It is me. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 28 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are fine? 
MR NDZEKU:   It is my story. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   I do not have a problem.  I just want us to go 
ahead.  I do not want to waste time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, no.  That is fine.  No, no.  I 
am happy.  I just did not want a situation where you, 
because you might not have had a look recently you have a 
problem with that. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I did not look.  I did not have time 
10 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you know the story? 
MR NDZEKU:   And then, I know my story. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Please, do not be offended councillor if I do 
not look in this document, the file document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR NDZEKU:   The thing what is happening, it is my life.  I 
know exactly what was happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   If I do not... if you are saying to me:  Please, 
look at number 2, 3.  You can do that.  You can ask me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   I will tell you my story. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, no.  That is fine.  That is 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 29 of 388 
 
fine. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if there is any question you do not 
understand, just ask counsel to repeat it. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And... ja. 
MR NDZEKU:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Chair, just one final comment so that I 
am assured that Mr Ndzeku and I are on the same page. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m, h’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Mr Ndzeku, you have just confirmed the 
contents of this document as being true and correct under 
oath. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Right.  That is quite an important thing 
because false statements knowingly given under oath, 
constitutes a crime.  It is the crime of perjury.  Are you 
aware of that? 
MR NDZEKU:   I am not aware but you are telling me now. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Indeed. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And that is why I am just wanting to 
explain to you why I place significance on your confirmation 
that this document is a true and correct reflection of your 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 30 of 388 
 
version.  So let me give you an example.  Chair, I am just 
doing this so that we can be sure that we absolutely on the 
same page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  If you go to page 3 of the document in 
front of you Mr Ndzeku.  You say there at paragraph 7: 
“Insofar as the purchase and sale of JPU’s went, I 
have 
no 
personal 
knowledge 
of 
the 
actual 
transaction...” 
 
Now you see, that is the statement given under oath now 
10 
because you have confirmed it under oath.  You say you 
have no personal knowledge of the actual transaction. 
 
I want to explain to you.  That is then your evidence 
before this Commission and if you felt uncomfortable with 
the way in which was framed, you should draw that our 
attention now. 
MR NDZEKU:   I am comfortable. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  You are comfortable? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Excellent. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Then I am happy to proceed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let us proceed.   
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 31 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  So Chair, if I can then request that the 
document we have been dealing with which is reflected in 
the index at the beginning of this file, DD26 as the affidavit 
of Mr Vuyisile Aaron Ndzeku unsigned, be entered as Exhibit 
1 and we will work with it on that basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The unsigned affidavit of Mr Vuyisile 
Aaron Ndzeku appearing at page 1 of Bundle DD26 is 
admitted and will be marked as EXHIBIT 1. 
UNSIGNED AFFIDAVIT OF VUYISILE AARON NDZEKU IS 
ADMITTED AND MARKED AS EXHIBIT 1 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Thank you, Chair.  Mr Ndzeku, just to 
get a little bit of background about you.  If we may 
commence with that?  Could you tell the Chairperson what 
qualifications you hold? 
MR NDZEKU:   None, Chair.  No education. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And what is your experience in the 
Aviation Industry? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, Chair in 1989, I started Swissport.  I 
am the founder of Swissport. 
CHAIRPERSON:   1989? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   1989, we choose VL Smarts Airport. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   That time, we must speak Afrikaans at the 
airport. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 32 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   That time, there was a company called Swift 
Ground Handling.  Swift belonged to Lufthansa.  Now we 
were there and they were on their way to go.  In that airport, 
there were a lot of ground handling, they were there.   
 
Myself and my team, we decided to bring these guys 
together.  That time there was no black empowerment.  We 
decided that at least let us work together with these guys.  
They have got experience.   
 
My first partner it was Peter Kohl and Mike van der Walt 
and then a lot of guys, Afrikaner guys.  We were working 
10 
together there.  We built this company called Zwelibanzi.   
 
After Zwelibanzi, we decided that okay we did not have 
an experience of aviation, especially me.  I am talking about 
me as a businessman.   
 
If you do not have experience, you get people who 
knows.  [speaking vernacular] people who know about the 
business.  So what we did now, we decided to see them and 
then get the people together.  The issue was the licence.   
 
That time there was no African at ACSA.  The first 
gentleman Dirk Ackerman and Barnard.  I went to see them.  
20 
I went to talk to them and I said to them:  Is it possible that 
we can get an opportunity for us to work here?   
 
Because that time the airport was very, very deurmekaar 
with my team.  And he says:  Do you guys have experience?  
We said yes.  There was a company called Swift.   
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 33 of 388 
 
 
They had already two clients and then they also or they 
have some small GPU’s there they had at the airport but they 
wanted to pull out.  Only if maybe we can pay them 
R 2 million for their money.    
 
Chair, I had roundabout R 50 000,00 at Trust Bank.  That 
money, Trust Bank, how did I earn it?  It is because I was 
selling dagga.  I did not take money from nobody.   
 
Now that reference, R 5 000,00 it makes them that at 
least they must give an opportunity that they can give us a 
loan of R 2 million to release those people.   
10 
 
Now we have got the company called Swift Ground 
Handling with these people.  What we will have to do now, 
they have to get guys from overseas.   
 
The first guys we got, it was Daluxolo.  The second, it 
was Service Act.  The third it was Swissport.  Now all these 
guys, they are coming in.  I am not going to mention people’s 
names.  I had partners.  By that time I was not alone.   
 
When these people came, they told us that:  Listen, we 
are prepared to come onboard provided that we can get 51%.  
My partner said:  No, no.  We will have to go 70/30.   
20 
 
I do not understand exactly what is 70/30 and what, 51% 
and what.  We agreed that they will bring in the funding.  
They will bring expertise.  And then the company start.   
 
Swissport was born that time in 1989 with only two 
airlines with 20 people.  Swissport, it went all the way.  No 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 34 of 388 
 
problem.  No corruption.  No person is crying that they did 
this and this and this.   
 
People that are working during difficult times because 
we wanted to work at Jan Smuts.  They changed Jan Smuts 
Airport to O.R. Tambo.  I have been there.  Now what 
happened Chair.   
 
The Swissport guys now, they decided that now they do 
not have the funding.  And that funding, they need to actually 
to get money.  Brian Joffe came onboard.  He says:  Listen, I 
will buy 51% of the company.  49%.  Provided.  And then I 
10 
am coming onboard.   
 
I decided, no instead of working with Brian Joffe, let us 
go and talk to other people, then they can give us funding.  
No corruption.  Everybody was working.   
 
Chair, this company started with only two people with 
only two airlines with 20 people.  If it was not covered, 
Swissport employed 4 500 people.  We did exactly 200 
flights a day.  10 of June, 11 of July 2020, Swissport did 
exactly 1 500 a day.  No corruption.   
 
No one says:  Can you do this and this and this?  There 
20 
was no such thing.  So I have been in that company for a 
long time.   I have been at that airport for a long time.  So 
that is why I said, there is nothing here I can look because if 
counsel is asking me the questions, I can respond.  I thank 
you. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 35 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I just want to say that I think Mr 
Ndzeku is very fluent in English. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  In English. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  [laughs] 
MR NDZEKU:   Quite right.  I have got no problem.  I will 
ask. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR NDZEKU:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Thank you so much, Mr Ndzeku.  Can I 
10 
ask you to turn up the... in your file which we have indicated 
as Bundle DD26, tab 9.  Would you go to tab 9 in the file and 
then find page 14 under that tab. 
MR NDZEKU:   Please, counsel ask me.   
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  I ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   I do not want to look at anything, please.  
Because I do not understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   If you can, counsel, I can respond. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Mr Ndzeku.  I was about to say, he 
20 
did indicate earlier on... as I understood him, that you can 
ask him anything. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  No, indeed. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 36 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   He will be able to answer. 
MR NDZEKU:   Answer, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   There maybe ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Chair... 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...situations where you need him to have a 
look. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  H’m.  Yes, like now.  I need him to 
confirm if it is his signature on a particular page. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  So I would like him to go to the 
10 
document, bearing his signature.  If you will turn up tab 9 
and go to page 14? 
MR NDZEKU:   Is it... what is it?  9? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  9. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Thank you and go to page 14 of tab 9. 
MR NDZEKU:   Page 14, right? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Yes, one four. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why you are not using the red page 
numbers, Ms Hofmeyr? 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  I am using the top... sorry, chair.  Yours 
might be different to mine.  It is DD26-Ban-014.  Do you 
have that Chair? 
MR NDZEKU:   Is what...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Under tab 9. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 37 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   It is ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No.  Ja, yours is different.  Under tab 9, 
you 
have 
the 
first 
page 
after 
tab 
9 
is 
30. 
 
DD26 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  No, then your tabs are put in the 
wrong place. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are looking at the big file, yes: 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  I am Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  That is a concern but ...[intervenes]  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The page number of the document at the 
bottom of the document is 5. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Oh, I see what has happened.  Okay.  
Thank you. 
MR NDZEKU:   Did you say DD26, page 9 or what is it? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Apologies, Chair.  It is actually my 
error. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  If you could go to tab 6? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And in tab 6 you will find page 14 
Chair.  If I am wrong, then I must give up for today.  [laughs] 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Because ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, tab 6 is page 14.  I have got. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 38 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Excellent. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It says offer to purchase. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Wonderful.  Thank you, Chair.  It was 
my error. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And Mr Ndzeku understands the 
tabs, hey? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay page 14, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Do you have that Mr Ndzeku? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, offer to purchase? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Offer to purchase. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Correct. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   This is the offer to purchase that was 
concluded between yourself and Ms Hlohlela. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And then if you go over to page... at 22 
in that same document? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   22? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  You do have that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 39 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Thank you, Chair.  That is the purpose 
I wanted to take him to the document for. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Mr Ndzeku has confirmed that is his 
signature.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Thank you.  Mr Ndzeku, can you put 
that to the side.  I will be clear when I need you to go to 
documents.  What I next would like to ask you is when did 
you become a shareholder of Swissport South Africa? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   I think when we started Swissport that was 
1989.  It was not 1999. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Sorry, so it is 1989, was it? 
MR NDZEKU:   ‘89 or ’99.  Between those two. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Or 1999? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  So somewhere in that ten year period 
...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  ...you became a shareholder? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And what... how many shares did you 
hold? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Ms Hofmeyr.  It is a ten year 
difference between ’89, 1989 and 1999. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 40 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay let us ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it after democracy?  It might help 
you.  Was it... did we have democracy when you became a 
shareholder or was it still ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   I think... No, no.  I think, Chair... sorry.  I 
think it was 1998 or ’98. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Oh. 
MR NDZEKU:   I am sorry.  Sorry, Counsel.  Thank you, 
Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  So either 1998 or 1999? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And how many shares did you hold at 
that time? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, when we started with my colleague, we 
had 49%. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And did that change over time?  Did 
you get more or less at any stage? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, it was just two shares with no value 
20 
because the company needed money.  And if you are a 
shareholder you will have to put money in the company.  So 
we had shares but it did not mean anything. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Mr Ndzeku, my question was.  Did you 
ever change your shareholding from 49%? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 41 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, they changed that. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  When was that? 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not remember. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  What was it changed to? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, they changed it because when we have 
got 49 and then we could not put money.  Chair, they 
decided that they will get people who can actually come 
onboard and bring investment.  Now the question:  It was 
changed to?  I do not remember.   
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
What 
counsel 
is 
asking 
is, 
what 
10 
percentage in terms of shares did you own after the change, 
after you no longer had 49%? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I think Chair it was roundabout 15% if I 
remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   About one five? 
MR NDZEKU:   15.  Ja, one five. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Sorry, Mr Ndzeku I missed that. 
MR NDZEKU:   One five. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  One five? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Thank you.  And by 2015, what was 
your shareholding percentage? 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not remember councillor but it might be, 
it was the same or maybe it was less.  Remember, we 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 42 of 388 
 
supposed to put money Chair.  You do not put money, your 
shares means nothing.  Now the question:  What was your 
percentage?  I do not remember counsel. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  In twenty ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you would say, it is either, it remained 
as 15% or it decreased? 
MR NDZEKU:   It is maybe... I think it went less to 
roundabout 9%. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Yes, okay. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Okay it is helpful.  Mr Ndzeku, I 
understand these are a few years ago.  So if you need an 
answer to say it is somewhere between 9 and 15, that is 
absolutely fine. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  You must give answers that you are 
comfortable with.   
MR NDZEKU:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  I am just trying to get a sense of by 
2015, what proportion ownership did you have of Swissport?  
20 
And I understand your answer to be somewhere between 9% 
and 15%. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   That is correct, yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 43 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Thank you.   And when did you become 
a director of Swissport South Africa? 
MR NDZEKU:   When? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  When, yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I think I became a director of South 
Africa from the beginning. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  1998/1999? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  So you were a director throughout? 
MR NDZEKU:   All the way. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And you were a director in 2015 and in 
2016? 
MR NDZEKU:   All the way.  Yes, councillor. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Thank you.  And when did you seize to 
be a director of Swissport?  When did you stop being a 
director of Swissport South Africa? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I stopped this year. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  This year? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Of which month? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   I think it was roundabout Jan. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Okay. 
MR NDZEKU:   Jan, if it is not Feb. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Jan or Feb? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 44 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Right.  Just around the sort of the time 
that you were going to be giving evidence originally at the 
Commission? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I did not know anything about evidence. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   To be honest. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Yes.  Can you just remember?  Did you 
seize to be a director before the February evidence at the 
Commission or after?  Can you recall that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Councillor, I do not remember. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Okay.  And you are also a director JM 
Aviation South Africa?  Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   A hundred percent.  Correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And when did you become a director of 
JM Aviation South Africa? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, again South Africa, I think if I am not 
wrong, it was 2015 if it was not earlier or later.  But if we 
stick on the JM.  JM International, I have been working with 
Ms Aires for the past 18-months before we formed JM South 
Africa. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Yes.  So let us just be clear there. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Because they are two entities. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Right? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 45 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  There is JM Aviation South Africa. 
MR NDZEKU:   And JM International, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And JM International. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Is that correct?  Two entities? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, two entities.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  You became a director of JM Aviation 
South Africa in 2015. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Were you ever a director of JM 
International? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, no.  I was not. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  But you had dealings with them? 
MR NDZEKU:   Hundred percent.  Working with them. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And that is Mr Aires? 
MR NDZEKU:   Mr Aires, yes.   
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Mr Aires is... is he a director of JM 
20 
International? 
MR NDZEKU:   He is a director, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Thank you.  You are also a shareholder 
of JM Aviation South Africa.  Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Correct, yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 46 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Now in January 2016, do you remember 
what your shareholding was? 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not remember.  I think maybe it was... it 
was roundabout 25 or 15.  I am not sure. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  I think it was 20 at the time. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  I can take you to the document later. 
MR NDZEKU:   Thank you, yes. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR 
SC: 
 
Has 
that 
changed 
at 
all 
your 
percentage shareholding in JM Aviation? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I do not remember.  It may be changed.  
Because the person who is in charge of the books, the 
person who is in charge is Mr Aires.  He is the found.  He is 
the guy actually or he is the man who is in charge of the 
books.  He knows exactly how things work. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Okay books are on matter, Mr Ndzeku.  
I am now asking about your shareholding in the company. 
MR NDZEKU:   Councillor, the shares it belongs to the 
books.  So if there are no books, there are no shares.  Why I 
am saying this is because... why I saying this Chair.  Mr 
20 
Aires, he is the one who is in charge.  Anything that has got 
to do with the books of the day, he is the man.  So I do not 
remember what shares did I have on that side. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Mr Ndzeku, knowing what shares you 
have or percentage of shares is quite important in a 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 47 of 388 
 
...[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I must say Chair, I do not remember.  
Maybe it was 20 or 10.  I do not remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And has it changed from what it was in 
January 2016? 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not know counsel. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But if it changes, you would know, is it 
not? 
 
Because 
nobody 
can 
change 
it 
without 
your 
10 
permission, is it not? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, they do these things Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who is that? 
MR NDZEKU:   The people, they do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   [laughs] 
MR NDZEKU:   There is... I must just admit I do not want to 
take your time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR NDZEKU:   In my journey, they changed my shares.  You 
know, while I am still alive. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, without your knowledge. 
MR NDZEKU:   Without my knowledge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   They even sell my shares without my 
knowledge. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 48 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   So if I say these things happen, they do 
happen. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But of course, you have to answer 
according to your own knowledge.  So if, as far as you know, 
it has not changed, that is the answer you give. 
MR NDZEKU:   I think, let us say, it is still 20. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR NDZEKU:   If I am not mistaken. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Ja, okay. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Is Mr Aires someone you have a good 
relationship with, Mr Ndzeku? 
MR NDZEKU:   Very good.  He is a very good man. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  He was also in the business, JM 
Aviation as a shareholder, was he not? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   He is the founder.  He is the founder of JM 
Aviation South Africa. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  He was a founder? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  He was a 15% shareholder in 
January 2016.  Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Correct, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And the other two shareholders in the 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 49 of 388 
 
company, they are your daughters.  Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   My daughters. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Ms Sokulu(?) and Natasha van Louw(?). 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Those are my daughters. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And Ms Sokulu in January 2016 held 
35% of the shares.  Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Correct, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And Ms Van Louw held 30% of the 
10 
shares.  Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Correct, yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  So this company comprising your long-
time friend.  Correct?  Mr Aires? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And your two daughters, Ms Sokulu and 
Ms Van Louw, are those the people that might have changed 
your shareholding without you knowing about it in the 
company? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, the person who actually who is in charge 
20 
are again of JM Aviation South Africa and JM International is 
Mr Aires.  Councillor, JM Aviation, you need somebody who 
has got expertise.   
 
We have got only one person who is in charge of this 
company is Mr Aires.  Now if he goes back, he says:  Did 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 50 of 388 
 
they change my shares or my daughters or what?   
 
Chair, Mr Aires asked:  Listen, for us to be on the right 
track, we will have to actually have women onboard.   
 
Now Natasha van Louw, she is my daughter.  She was 
working for a certain company.  Sokulu, she was also 
studying.   
 
And I asked them, I said to them:  Please, can you guys 
come onboard and then be part of this company?  The 
reason why I asked is because Swissport, Peter Kohl, they 
asked that because on the board of Swissport, we did not 
10 
have the women.   
 
So they wanted actually to take my daughter, Sokulu to 
be part of this.  And my daughter, Sokulu says:  No, but I do 
not understand aviation.  Now, they said:  Please, we want 
you to come because we do not have a woman.   
 
This is exactly how now we did bring my two daughters 
on this thing.  They know nothing about aviation.  They were 
never involved.  Myself and Jules Aires, we started this JM 
Aviation.   
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Thank you, Mr Ndzeku.  Did you 
20 
disclose to Swissport South Africa that you were a director of 
JM Aviation South Africa? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, Swissport and JM Aviation, Mr Aires, 
they were doing business. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Mr Ndzeku, my questions was not... 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 51 of 388 
 
that was one answer to my question.  My question was, did 
you disclose, you Mr Ndzeku, disclose to Swissport South 
Africa that you were a director of JM Aviation South Africa? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, councillor if you are asking me, to 
whom do I have it to disclose it?  To the board or the CEO?  
Because now ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Mr Ndzeku ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   ...the CEO of JM Aviation and Swissport, they 
have been doing deals for a long time.  You know, that is 
the... I do not know.  I did not because there was no need for 
10 
me to tell everybody that I am the GM, I am... you know, I am 
the 
director 
of 
JM 
because 
we 
are 
doing 
business 
...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Thank you. 
MR NDZEKU:   ...with the company. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Your answer is that you did not? 
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Your answer is, you did not/ 
MR NDZEKU:   I did not. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Thank you.  Now in February 2015 
20 
when JM Aviation was started as a business, that is JM 
Aviation South Africa, who were the directors at that point 
when it was first started? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Who were they? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 52 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Who were the directors? 
MR NDZEKU:   When we started, I think it was... ja, it was 
myself and Jules, Mr Aires.  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And is it correct that in October 2015, 
you added your two daughters, Ms Sokulu and Mr Van Louw? 
MR NDZEKU:   I think so. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Thank you. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And let us just talk a bit about the 
10 
business.  How many employees does JM Aviation South 
Africa have? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I think the person again councillor who 
is in charge of JM Aviation is Mr Aires.  As far as I 
remember, I think they have roundabout five or six.  And then 
the JM, they decided to send these people abroad for 
training.  I was not involved on that side. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  So you are a director of JM Aviation.  
Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Do you know how many employees JM 
Aviation employs? 
MR NDZEKU:   I said, I think they were five or six. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Right. 
MR NDZEKU:   I am not sure. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 53 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  But then you said they as though JM 
Aviation was something different from you, decided to send 
people overseas.  Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   What are you saying, councillor?  Again?  
Can you repeat it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   She says you said a minute ago, they sent 
employees overseas. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who are you talking about, the they? 
MR NDZEKU:   Mr Aires.  Mr Aires decided. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Aires? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR NDZEKU:   He decided that.  He is going to send the 
people abroad Chair for training. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And when was that? 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not remember councillor. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  A year ago, four years ago?  No 
recollection? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   I maybe... it might be last year or two years 
ago.  Something like that. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Something like that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Thank you.  And who is Ms Hendricks? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 54 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Who? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Who is Ms Hendricks? 
MR NDZEKU:   Ms Hendricks is my wife. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Your wife. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And was she also an employee of JM 
Aviation? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, she was. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  And in what role? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, Mr Aires... as I said again, he was the 
10 
CEO of the company.  He was the one who was employing 
people.  And I made it clear to him that I want my family to 
be part of this.  I want my family to learn and then to work 
because they cannot sit at home without getting paid.  That 
is the bottom line.  I told him.  So we agreed.  He is the one 
actually that can tell you what exactly Ms Hendricks was 
doing. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Okay let me just get clear.  Was Ms 
Hendricks your wife before she started at JM Aviation? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  She was? 
MR NDZEKU:   She was, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  When were you married? 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not remember. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  You do not remember when you were 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 55 of 388 
 
married? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Right.  Do... so you do not celebrate an 
anniversary every year? 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not what? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  You do not celebrate an anniversary 
every year? 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay I am an African councillor.  I do not do 
these things of anniversary and then... or for... you know, 
or... I do not know.  I do not do it. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Do you think you were married five 
years ago, ten years ago, one year ago? 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja, maybe it is roundabout three years. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  About three years? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  If not two years? 
MR NDZEKU:   If it is not two years, three years.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  But not more than three years? 
MR NDZEKU:   Not more, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:  Then she was not your wife when she 
20 
was employed at JM Aviation, was she? 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not remember at all.  I do not remember.  
Mr Aires... I say it again, anything has got to do with JM 
Aviation, Jules has been there for 25-years.  He has been 
working with SAT for 25-years.  He is the man who knows 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 56 of 388 
 
exactly what was happening.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Ndzeku.  You do not mean, do 
you ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   I do not...? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not mean that you do not know 
what job your wife does at Swissport, what position? 
MR NDZEKU:   Not at Swissport Chair.  At JM Aviation. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At JM.  I am sorry. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   At JM.  You do not mean that you do not 
10 
know what position she holds, do you? 
MR NDZEKU:   I mean it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...what job she does? 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not know because they were roundabout 
five, six people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   The person, they used to go to the office.  
Jules was there.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Jules sits with them and then they talk, they 
do what they do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   I am honest, Chair.  I do not know. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 57 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did you never ask her what she does 
at JM? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I did not.  As long she was busy.  She 
was busy and studying and working.  For me it was good.  
Good enough.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  That is the truth there, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And she never told you either. 
MR NDZEKU:   I never asked her, Asanda Mabuza, I did 
not ask. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   As long there – because she was working 
and same time study. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Because she used to study.  I forgot what 
is the case but at Northcliff but she was studying and 
working. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   In 2016, where were the offices of JM 
Aviation?  
20 
MR NDZEKU:   I think they were here in Sandton. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   In Sandton? 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Where are they now? 
MR NDZEKU:   They are still in Sandton. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 58 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, are they not at your premises? 
MR NDZEKU:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No.  So the registered address for JM 
Aviation, it does not operate from your residential property. 
MR NDZEKU:   No, no, it does not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No. 
MR NDZEKU:   They were here, that is their offices 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see “their” offices, do you frequent 
the offices, Mr Ndzeku? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I do not. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do not.  Have you ever? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, let us just go back.  I am shareholder 
of Swissport.  I only attend the board meetings at 
Swissport.  Again, I am a shareholder of JM Aviation, Jules 
is there as the CEO and the MD of the company, he will 
see to that everything is happening.  The question, yes I 
did, here in Sandton at Webber Wentzel, I was in the 
office.  I did, I was there. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   When was that? 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not remember but I think I went twice 
20 
there. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You went twice to the offices of JM 
Aviation. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Is that twice since it was started in 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 59 of 388 
 
2015?   
MR NDZEKU:   Well, maybe – yes, I think so. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You are not just a shareholder in JM 
Aviation, you are a director of JM Aviation, is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, counsellor, let me repeat again.  I can 
be a director or a shareholder, there is somebody who is in 
charge of this company who will see to that everything 
operate accordingly. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Where did Mr Aires live, Mr Ndzeku? 
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Where did Mr Aires live? 
MR NDZEKU:   When? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Where. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where does he stay. 
MR NDZEKU:   He is in the US, California.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So how was he running the day-to-day 
operations of JM Aviation South Africa in California? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, it is very simple, he had people 
working.  We had – he had people who are working for him.  
Let me make an example of Swissport because I have been 
20 
in Swissport for a long time.  Swissport,  shareholders 
Chair, of Swissport 51% and they are overseas.  They are 
not here.  They have people who are working.  When we 
have got a board meeting the Chairman from Swissport is 
going to come and attend the board meeting and get 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 60 of 388 
 
reports to the MD and to the manager.  Mr Jules had 
people who are running the company.  Those people, they 
use to go straight to SAT.  I do not have an experience, I 
do not know what is SAAT, by the way, but Jules make a 
point that these things operate. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   A moment ago in your evidence you said 
the employees would go to the offices and meet with Mr 
Aires. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Because he was running the employees, 
10 
not you, is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But he was in California, so how did they 
meet with him? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, no, no, no, no.  Sorry, counsellor, I 
repeat, Jules is an ex-South African was born and bred in 
South Africa.  I said, if maybe look at his status, born and 
bred in South Africa, is all the time here.  Even he is not 
here, the company can still operate because he has got 
people on the ground who are working.  
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Since when has he been living in 
California? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I do not know, but he has been there 
for a long time. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   H’m, he has, has he not? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 61 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  He was not available to come and 
give evidence in the Commission because he is located in 
California, correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I can say that last time we were not in 
this office, people of – Baker McKenzie, they were there, 
people of AAR, they were there.  I remember he came to 
me, he says Mr Ndzeku, I am sorry, we were supposed 
actually be finishing with you but we cannot.  All those 
people, they were there, even Jules Aires was also here.   
10 
I do not understand why Mr Kaplan did not actually 
make a point that at least they must see to that Jules is 
here.  Even Peter Kohl himself, they were here.  Now we 
are talking about something two, three years ago, these 
people they left, they were here.  I had a meeting with 
Andrew and I explained to him, I say Andrew, these people 
are here, can you please explain to my why are you talking 
to me alone?  Why you do not go to those people?   
There he is sitting there, he could not say a word.  
Now I am sitting here now, Chair, I am talking for these 
20 
people.  Peter Kohl was in South Africa, Jules was in 
South Africa but this gentleman, Andrew, decided that he 
must interview, he must talk to me and he told me that he 
wants to see me. 
I did not have a problem, I met him at Rosebank 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 62 of 388 
 
Hotel.  I wanted to know exactly, what is your position, 
what exactly are you doing?  He is sitting there.  Ask him 
that question.  He told me that he is the investigator and I 
said can I tell you something?  You do not understand.  He 
says, I am an aviation specialist.  I say you are not.  If you 
were, there are people like Dudu Myeni, which is today, 
everybody is making a fool about them.  These people, 
they fooled SAA dead.   
There is a gentleman called Andrew Coleman, he 
took a lot of money off SAA.  Nobody is saying anything 
10 
about it and I asked them, I said do you know about it?  
Why all the time it seems that it is Africans who are doing 
something wrong?  Now you are busy to me but he is 
asking – go ask Peter Kohl, go and ask what is his name 
now, Jules.  He did not do it. 
Now counsellor is asking me now that it suits them 
better now they are not here.  It is the truth.  I talked to 
him, I spoke to him.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   I can say counsellor – now I can say, Chair, 
20 
everything that counsellor has got, is getting from Mr 
Kapperman.  I walked this road.  That is why I do not have 
to look at this document.  She can ask me anything, this is 
the road I walk. 
 
Now if maybe I have done something wrong, Chair, 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 63 of 388 
 
somebody stole today, please, by the law that person must 
be arrested.  I am sitting here, I am very, very comfortable.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But I just wanted …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   These partners of mine, Chair, they did add 
value.  There is no way that they can work for free.  There 
is no way that – but, let me just give the counsellor a 
chance. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What I just want to say to you that 
people do talk about Coleman Andrews from time to time, 
certainly in phone-in programmes when they talk about the 
10 
state of affairs at SAA, so – and …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   Chair, when SAA …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And I know that …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   Chair, let me tell you, when Swissair 
bought a stake of 20% of SAA, I was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   I helped [indistinct] 07.17. [indistinct] -
07.18 was there.  I have been in that airport for a long 
time, I was never, never accused of one cent or two cents 
because I work for my money.  So I do not know exactly 
20 
where are we going now with these questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay.  No, no, that is fine.  Ms 
Hofmeyr, continue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Ndzeku, you will just answer the 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 64 of 388 
 
questions. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you do not understand them you ask 
them to be repeated. 
MR NDZEKU:   Thank you, Chair.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV ALLI:  Chair, forgive me, before you continue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is alright. 
ADV ALLI:  Just a preliminary aspect, we have been 
handed two bundles of documents this morning.   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV ALLI:   We did not really receive advance notice of 
them nor have we had an opportunity for Mr Ndzeku to 
consider them also.  So in that regard, perhaps could we 
ask for an adjournment of about half an hour just to go 
through those documents and consider them?  There are 
several things which we say even the summons informing 
Mr Ndzeku of his appearance to bear the issues that would 
be traversed, do not in fact indicate the nature of these 
documents we have received today, so we would like that 
20 
opportunity to just consider those documents.  Sorry, sorry, 
I raise it at this point because I thought it was perhaps a 
convenient juncture in the manner in which the evidence 
was going. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, one would have thought that you 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 65 of 388 
 
would have raised that earlier before the questioning 
started.  
ADV ALLI:  Yes, Chair …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now we are in the middle of the 
questioning.  
ADV ALLI:  Fair enough, Chair, these documents, these 
bundles 
were 
given 
to 
us 
after 
these 
proceedings 
commenced this morning.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh. 
ADV ALLI:  We did not get it in advance of its starting this 
10 
morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, thank you, Chair.  Chair, I had 
requested 
that 
there 
be 
a 
copy 
for 
the 
legal 
representatives of Mr Ndzeku this morning.  The first lot 
came up, I understand there was delay on their copy and 
so that I immediately asked to be brought over.   
 
Chair, the documents are the documents comprising 
Mr Ndzeku’s affidavit, Mr Aires’ affidavit and a series of 
other documents that we have compiled in the course of 
20 
the investigations and as I have done previously, I propose 
to take Mr Ndzeku to pertinent documents in the course of 
his evidence.  If he does not recall one, as we have done 
previously, he can take time and consider it, I have got 
absolutely no difficulty with that.   
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 66 of 388 
 
There was no request from the legal representatives 
of Mr Ndzeku to be provided with anything prior to today.  
They attended all of the hearings in February, were given 
files when that evidence was being led, as has been the 
approach today.  I do apologise that it was not available as 
we commenced this morning, that was simply an error.  
Four copies were brought over but when the interpreter 
required a copy we had to provide him with a copy and so I 
requested the fifth copy to come and be given to the legal 
representatives.  Chair, I do not have an objection 
10 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   How many documents are we talking 
about? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is the two files, Chair, that are before 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The two files. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed.  I do not have a difficulty with a 
30 minute adjournment if they would like to take that.  I do 
not regard it as necessary, most of these documents are 
documents that Mr Ndzeku saw in his previous bundle, 
20 
which was provided to him on the last occasion when he 
was going to be testifying.  There have been some 
additional documents added, which appear in the second 
file, and if they would like to take 30 minutes, I have no 
difficulty with that. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 67 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry, Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry, I understand that my counsel other 
side also want to – it is the first time actually I also see 
these bundles but I am prepared to answer any question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Because we cannot keep on postponing it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   And then tomorrow they say I am not 
available. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   And then tomorrow I find myself I am in the 
news that I did this and this and this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   I remember very well after I spoke to 
Andrew Kapperman(?) in Rosebank, two minutes later when 
I look, I was already on the news that I did this and this 
and this.  I want us to finish this thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   If there is something wrong about it, let us 
20 
see exactly where do we go about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   If maybe I am guilty, let me found guilty, 
that is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 68 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Because I do not want this thing, Chair, 
this thing has been going on for a long time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you want it to be finalised. 
MR NDZEKU:   Let us finalise it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, I think maybe as Ms Hofmeyr 
says, let us go through, if there are certain documents 
where Mr Ndzeku is uncomfortable, wants to have more 
time, we will give him that opportunity so that he can look 
at them.  You understand that.  So, in other words, as and 
when we come across a document on which he has got 
10 
some difficulty and needs time, we will then deal with that 
at that time. 
ADV ALLI:  Chair, I understand, and I appreciate Mr 
Ndzeku’s enthusiasm also but we are here as his legal 
representatives and in our assessment – we must make an 
assessment of what is in his interests and he will be given 
the opportunity throughout the course of today or as long 
as is necessary to answer whatever questions he has to 
but in the interim we would ask for – we are indebted to my 
learned friend for agreeing to a 30 minutes stand down.  
20 
We would still make that request and Mr Ndzeku can 
thereafter continue answering the questions, whichever 
questions we have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, are you going to – before tea 
break, are you going to reach any of the documents that 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 69 of 388 
 
they might not have seen? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, I will not.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, because then maybe when we take 
the tea adjournment then we can make it 30 minutes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Indeed, indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair and I will try and stop myself if 
there is one and come back to it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Just so that we can use the time 
10 
profitably and, Mr Ndzeku, I am indebted to you to wanting 
to proceed swiftly with the matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay, what we will do, Ms Hofmeyr 
says before the tea break she will not reach any of the 
documents that you are unaware of.  So what I have in 
mind is that when we take the tea adjournment, instead of 
taking 15 minutes we can take 30 minutes and then you 
would get that chance. 
ADV ALLI:  Chair, thank you, that would be in order. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  Okay, alright. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  So, Mr Ndzeku, if I 
may just summarise where we are.  As I understand it, you 
are not involved in the operations of JM Aviation, South 
Africa at all.  Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   JM Aviation and also Swissport as well. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 70 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So the answer is yes, is it? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I am not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Mr Ndzeku, it is just helpful, 
if you give yes or no answers first.  Then the record 
reflects and then feel free to add any explanation or 
description you want to. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you earn a salary from JM Aviations 
South Africa? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I do. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You do? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   A monthly salary? 
MR NDZEKU:   It was a monthly, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So if you have nothing to do with its 
operations why do you draw a salary? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, this is exactly – that is actually why I 
joined JM because I wanted to earn salary.  It is exactly – 
we started the company.  Counsellor, I cannot work for 
nothing. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, but I understood you to say you 
have nothing to do with its operations. 
MR NDZEKU:   No, no.  No, no, I am shareholder, I am a 
director of the company, same as at Swissport.  Same 
question you can ask me, do you earn a salary at 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 71 of 388 
 
Swissport?   Same question you can ask me, do you earn a 
salary at Swissport?  Yes.  How much money do you earn?  
I can tell you.  How much money did I earn at JM Aviation, 
I can still tell you, yes, I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But do you – do you know whatever you 
earned per month is a salary as we all understand it or is 
there some arrangement in terms of which you get every 
month a portion of your annual dividend. 
MR NDZEKU:   Chair, thank you very much.  You know, it 
was an arrangement at the time where JM Aviation, Jules, 
10 
Mr Aires, was telling me that, SAAT they did not even get 
paid for the bus there, six months or seven months and 
then the money, he has got – the money that he got on the 
kitty is the money for other business which is how money I 
was getting, around about R35 000.  How much money I 
was getting at Swissport, it was R35 000.  Sometimes I can 
stay around about three, four months without getting 
money, sometimes – and then JM Aviation, you know 
actually AAR has been paid by SAAT and then AAR would 
also sit on top of the money, they do not want to pay.  As I 
20 
am talking to you now, we are in arbitration where AAR did 
not even pay JM Aviation for the past six – around about 
eleven months.  So it has been going like this, Chair, so on 
the issue of payment, it is yes and no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 72 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you earn a salary of about R35 000 a 
month. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   From JM Aviation South Africa, is that 
correct?  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you receive other payments from JM 
Aviation South Africa? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, counsellor, I am talking to you now, 
we are on the arbitration, we did not get - JM Aviation did 
10 
not get paid by AAR.  AAR, whenever we request money 
from them, they said they did not get money from SAAT .  
So now I do now I do not know now, sometimes yes, 
sometimes no.  So, for me, it was not an issue that is why I 
decided let me just do my own business on the side where 
I know that if I have got R5, I have got R5, R10, I have got 
R10 because this money come today, this money does not 
come today. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you get paid other amounts over and 
above your R35 000 salary a month from JM Aviation South 
20 
Africa? 
MR NDZEKU:   Do I what? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you get paid other amounts other 
than your R35 000 salary from JM Aviation South Africa? 
MR NDZEKU:   As I said, six months, nine months, AAR 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 73 of 388 
 
does not pay.  I am talking to you now, we are in the 
arbitration, they did not pay JM Aviation for eleven months.  
So sometime you find yourself, there is no money. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, Mr Ndzeku, that is not an answer to 
my question.  Please answer just the question, do you 
receive payment …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   Sometimes yes, sometimes no. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Sometimes yes, sometimes not. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Let us focus on the sometimes. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What other payments have you received 
from JM Aviation over and above your salary of R35 000 a 
month? 
MR NDZEKU:   Right, we – Jules Aires, he bought actually 
the equipment from Swissport and then those are the 
dollies and the steps, he sold it to Mozambique, he sold it 
to one of these other African states.  Whenever we make 
some money and he tell myself, I said listen, we did one, 
two, three, but we need to have some money.  So out of 
20 
that money sometimes he would give me the money around 
about 50 up to 100 000. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Between 50 and 100 000? 
MR NDZEKU:   Some – ja, if the deal is good. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right and when was that sale to 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 74 of 388 
 
Mozambique? 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not remember but it is not only 
Mozambique, we do it with African states and sometimes 
he does also the – we also – JM – when we decided that 
JM Aviation and JM South Africa that must be together and 
I said Jules, you can see that things are not good in South 
Africa.  Please, whenever you stay on other side, please 
try to look after us her and he said I do not have a problem 
because he was doing it, he was making money on the 
side.    
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you ever receive more than a 
100 000 out of these transactions? 
MR NDZEKU:   Maybe, I do not remember, yes or no, I do 
not remember. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You cannot remember whether you 
received more than a 100 000? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I cannot remember. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Could you have received as much as a 
million? 
MR NDZEKU:   From JM? 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And did you receive any payments, Mr 
Ndzeku, from JM Aviation related to any of its dealings 
with Swissport South Africa? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 75 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Did I receive what? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Any payments from JM Aviation South 
Africa related to its dealings with Swissport South Africa? 
MR NDZEKU:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You indicated previously that you did not 
disclose to Swissport South Africa that you were a director 
of JM Aviation.  Did you not worry that that would create a 
conflict of interest for you being a director of JM Aviation 
at the same time that you were a director of Swissport 
South Africa? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:    No, I was not worried. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You were not worried? 
MR NDZEKU:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So the fact that you are sitting as a 
director of one entity that might be concluding a contract 
with other entities in which you have a financial interests, 
you did not worry about that? 
MR NDZEKU:   I did not worry, because my board members 
and the CEO, they did not even worry about that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You did not recuse yourself from any of 
20 
those meetings? 
MR NDZEKU:   I did not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You did not. 
MR NDZEKU:   I did what? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You did not – I just did not hear your 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 76 of 388 
 
…[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:    What, can you repeat again?    
ADV HOFMEYR:   I said you not recuse yourself from any 
of those meetings. 
MR NDZEKU:   Which meetings are those exactly? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The meetings at Swissport South Africa 
when it was deciding whether to engage with JM Aviation 
South Africa. 
MR NDZEKU:   Counsellor, I must say it again, please, 
Chair.  CEO of Swissport, Peter Kohl, is in charge of all 
10 
the affairs of Swissport.  Again, JM Aviation, Jules Aires, 
he is in charge of all the affairs of this company.  I repeat 
again, Jules Aires has been working with SAAT for the past 
25 years.  Why I choose him as my partner, because he 
has got experience.  If he is my partner and he is my 
partner and he see that there is nothing wrong here, I go 
with him, that is it, that is exactly why I decided, I decided 
that I am going to work with Jules. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you did not recuse yourself from any 
of those meetings. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   There was no meeting, I never actually 
attend any meeting between Jules and Peter. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, I am saying the general meetings at 
which Swissport South Africa decided to contract with JM 
Aviation, South Africa, you did not recuse yourself from 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 77 of 388 
 
those meetings.  No, could you just say no? 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not remember, I do not remember any 
discussion [indistinct – dropping voice] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Sorry, Mr Ndzeku, if you 
could just speak into the mic.  Thank you so much. 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja, I do not remember, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you do not remember attending any 
meetings at Swissport where a decision was taken to 
contract with JM Aviation South Africa. 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I do not remember, Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not remember. 
MR NDZEKU:   No. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Were you aware of the GPU sale at the 
time it was taking place, the one involving the GPUs from 
SAA Technical? 
MR NDZEKU:   Counsellor, I will say it again, Peter Kohl, 
he is the CEO of Swissport.  He is the CEO.  Swissport, 
you have got MDs, you have got marketing.  All those 
people are in charge on the ground.  Jules Aires, he is the 
20 
CEO 
and 
he 
has 
also 
got 
people, 
MDs, 
on 
the 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, Mr Ndzeku …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Repeat the question. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 78 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The question was, were you, Mr Ndzeku, 
aware? 
MR NDZEKU:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You were not? 
MR NDZEKU:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You were not aware. 
MR NDZEKU:   Not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you and were you aware 
…[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, we will make better progress, Mr 
Ndzeku, if you just answer the question. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   If, having answered the question, you 
feel there is need to explain something. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is fine, ja. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Were you aware of the dealings between 
20 
Swissport South Africa and SAA in late 2015 and early 
2016 about the ground handling contract. 
MR NDZEKU:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you took no part – I think you said 
this in your affidavit – in the negotiations around that 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 79 of 388 
 
contract, is that right? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  No, was not part of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is this when no means yes? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is, yes.  So I think I had two 
negatives.  Mr Ndzeku, is it correct that you played no role 
in the negotiations between Swissport and SAA? 
MR NDZEKU:   No role at all. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No role at all.  Thank you, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now, Mr Ndzeku, I would like to move to 
10 
a part in your evidence today where I am just going to get 
clarify on your extent of involvement with various people, 
okay?  So I am going to go through a number of people.  
Again, not going to documents yet but just to get some 
background because it will help the rest of today’s 
proceedings.  Mr Ndzeku, do you know Ms Mbanjwa of L 
Mbanjwa Incorporated Attorneys? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I know here, she was right here. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, did you know her before the 
February …[intervenes] 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   I remember her, she was here.  She was 
here.  I remember her, yes, I remember her. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   did you know her before the February 
evidence. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I did, she is a lawyer yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 80 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   How do you know her? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I know a lot of attorneys, she is an 
African, there are a lot of attorneys I know. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   She was referred to in the sale 
agreement that you concluded with Ms Hlohlela, do you 
remember that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Was she involved in drafting that 
agreement? 
MR NDZEKU:   Who? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ms Mbanjwa. 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not remember, I can say yes or no, but 
I was told that please go to Ms Mbanjwa’s office and then 
if you want the land go and pay.  It is exactly what I did. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Who drafted that agreement, that sale 
agreement between you and Ms Hlohlela?  Did you put it 
together or did Ms Hlohlela put it together? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I did not put it together, no.  I think Ms 
Hlohlela and Ms Mbanjwa, they put it together.  I am not 
sure.  Please, counsellor, I do not want to say yes or no, I 
20 
am not sure. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You do not know. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I do not know. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So was it just presented to you? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 81 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Could Ms Memela have been involved in 
putting the agreement together?  Remember, Ms Memela is 
Ms Hlohlela’s daughter.  
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I cannot say that because Ms 
Mbanjwa, she is an attorney, she does her job.  I do not 
think why Ms – this other lady to be involved, you know? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  So to the best of your knowledge 
it would have been between Ms Mbanjwa and Ms Hlohlela 
and that the agreement that put together, is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Correct, yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Did JM Aviation ever use Ms 
Mbanjwa for legal services? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, not [indistinct – dropping voice] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Have you ever used yourself Ms 
Mbanjwa for legal services? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I only use Mbanjwa for payment for 
the …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:  On that sale agreement?  
MR NDZEKU:   On that, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Is that the sum total of your interactions 
20 
with her? 
MR NDZEKU:   [indistinct – dropping voice] yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Now I would like to turn to 
Ms Memela. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 82 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Whose evidence you attended in 
February. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Whose evidence you attended in 
February. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   When was the first time that you met Ms 
Memela? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I think it must 2015, there was a – 
they actually decided to invite all the stakeholders, people 
10 
of the airport, that was a time where I met her.  I do not 
remember which date but I met her there. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you are right, she also said it was in 
2015 and she said around mid-2015, maybe May or June.  
Does that accord with your memory? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I think so. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  And you indicated in your 
affidavit that those supplier development workshops were 
an opportunity for people interested to get into aviation to 
meet with SAA representatives, is that correct?  
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, not SAA alone because there were a 
lot of people there. It was not only SAA. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Was it other possible suppliers? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 83 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Other suppliers. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, for ACCSA, for Jet Fuel, you know, 
everybody that was – it was not SAA alone. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you engaged with the procurement 
team of SAA when you were at those meetings, is that 
correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   When you say team, can you please 
explain? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well Ms Memela was the Head of 
10 
Procurement, were you aware of that? 
MR NDZEKU:   I was not aware. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You were not aware? 
MR NDZEKU:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So how was she introduced at those 
meetings? 
MR NDZEKU:   How was she? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   How as she introduced? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well she told me that she was from Ciskei 
and then she is from Transkei we started to started to give 
20 
our language [speaking in vernacular] and then we started 
to laugh and I told her exactly what I am doing and then 
where I am going with my business.   
          And then she said it is a good thing that because 
the mother is got a land and then we can do – she can 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 84 of 388 
 
introduce you to her mother, the mother is coming for the 
eyes and I said if maybe that I am come please you must 
let me know.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you – what role was she then playing 
at those workshops? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well counsellor I was there like anybody; I 
do not know exactly what role she was playing because I 
did not actually talk to her alone, I talked to a lot of 
people.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right so did you – you did not know she 
10 
was related to SAA Technical at all? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I did not ask her.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   You did not ask? 
MR NDZEKU:   No I did not ask that question.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you ever come to learn that she was 
the Head of Procurement at SAA Technical? 
MR NDZEKU:   No.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Never? 
MR NDZEKU:   You know counsellor maybe if I can ask 
Chair.  Why is it so important for me to know that she was 
20 
Head of Procurement? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Ndzeku it is not important at all I am 
trying to understand how much you know.  
MR NDZEKU:   Okay.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what the level of your interactions 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 85 of 388 
 
were.  
MR NDZEKU:   I understand.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  So all you need to just 
clarify for me is...[intervene]  
MR NDZEKU:   No I did not know that sorry counsellor.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   …how well did you know various people; 
what dealings you have had with them that is all I am 
interested in at the moment.   
MR NDZEKU:   Thank you.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now you had that meeting at the 
10 
workshop in mid-2015.  Have you had other dealings with 
Ms Memela beyond that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry your answer was too soft.   
MR NDZEKU:   No Chair, no dealings.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, okay.  
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   So there was that one meeting in mid-
2015 did you not have other meetings with her related to 
the purchase of her mother ’s property?  
MR NDZEKU:   Well she did actually tell me that the 
20 
mother is coming and she would like to introduce me.  You 
know counsellor it was not a meeting that day it was 
somewhere a hello and how are you and then this exactly 
is happening and then let us meet again and then we meet.  
For me it was not a meeting it was just introduction.     
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 86 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  
MR NDZEKU:   And then the meeting now we had when the 
mother came for the eyes and then the mother start to 
explain to me and then that was the second meeting I had 
Chair.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Super so can I just be clear.  There is 
the one meeting at the workshop, right?   
MR NDZEKU:   It was introduction to say hello and how are 
you.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   That’s was an introduction but you spoke 
10 
to her about your business interest.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh shall we call it an encounter?  
ADV HOFMEYR:   An encounter yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   The one encounter you had with Ms 
Memela at the workshop.  
MR NDZEKU:   Okay, an encounter yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Encounter, okay.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And in that encounter you discussed 
your business interest.  Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I did no when she told me that she is 
20 
from Ciskei…[intervene] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  
MR NDZEKU:   …and I told her that I am in Lesotho and in 
Swaziland, this is exactly what I am doing and she said

MR NDZEKU:   Yes, it is there.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   So when you met with her in mid-2015 
did you explain to her that you were growing cannabis in 
Lesotho and Swaziland?  
20 
MR NDZEKU:   100% I did.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you indicated to her that you had an 
interest in doing that in South Africa, is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Not in South Africa in – where she stays in 
her country, ja in that homeland yes.   
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255

This lady Memela she was introducing me to this lady 
Hlohlela.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Her mother? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And at no point in all of this do you 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 90 of 388 
 
become aware that Ms Memela is the Head of Procurement 
at SAA Technical? 
MR NDZEKU:   No I did not, I am focusing on what I am 
doing at the moment.  I did not know what exactly she was 
doing on the other side.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay so there was once a meeting with 
Ms Hlohlela and Ms Memela in Johannesburg.  Correct?

where Ms Hlohlela’s home is located.  Where about in the 
country is it?

CHAIRPERSON:   Mbizana?  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. Mbizana.  
CHAIRPERSON:   It is in Mbizana? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 91 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   In this Eastern Cape? 
MR NDZEKU:   They call it where she stays in that small 
place they call it Mbizana.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, Chair it is like you have got 
Morningside and you have Sandton?

because we have got some events that will help us.   
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.

2015.  We think May or June 2015  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay you signed the sale agreement in 
November of 2015.   
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So was it somewhere between mid-2015 
and late 2015? 
MR NDZEKU:   I think it was sorry Chair I think it was 
during that time if I remember correctly it was during that 
time.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Somewhere between the workshop at 
SAA 
and 
the 
date 
of 
the 
signing 
of 
the 
purchase 
agreement, somewhere in between?  
MR NDZEKU:   Well I do not know the purchase of, when

this?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   For the land that you bought from Ms 
Hlohlela.

26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 93 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   In between? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, during that time.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Was it before or was it after you signed 
the agreement Mr Ndzeku? 
MR NDZEKU:   Counsellor I do not remember it was after 
or before I do not remember, I do not recall it.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Will my understanding based on your 
10 
answer to my question was that it happened before 
because unless I misunderstood something.  The workshop 
at SAA…[intervene]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   No sorry Chair we had the meeting at 
the workshop.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR NDZEKU:   Then after that.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR NDZEKU:   And then we had a…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   A meeting in Mbizana.  
20 
MR NDZEKU:   A meeting yes.  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes a further meeting and then after the 
meeting.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Before the signing?  
MR NDZEKU:   Before the signing, yes.  
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 94 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  
MR NDZEKU:   Before the signing.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay so and the meeting in Mbizana 
would it have been about like a month after the workshop, 
two months or are you not able to say?  
MR NDZEKU:   Well I do not remember Chair but for 
me…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Not too far from.  
MR NDZEKU:   During that time, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright.  
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right so we were at the point where you 
were – if you will just give me a moment.  We were at the 
point where your drove down to the Eastern Cape to meet 
with Ms Hlohlela.   
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what happened in that interaction 
with Ms Hlohlela, what did you discuss?  
MR NDZEKU:   Well…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe let us start with did you meet with 
her only or was it just the two of you?  
20 
MR NDZEKU:   No it was not the two of us there were also 
other people because he has also got a chief. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR NDZEKU:   Yes he call the chief and then we started to 
sit down and then she introduced me. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 95 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR NDZEKU:   And then she started explain to them and 
she told me that anything they do here they will have to do 
through the chief.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR NDZEKU:   Because what I wanted to know now and 
then I wanted to know about the title deeds. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR NDZEKU:   And wanted to know to have the papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
10 
MR NDZEKU:   And then the chief says listen this is 
exactly what we are doing here and then if [speaking in 
vernacular] we did cut this thing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
MR NDZEKU:  [speaking in vernacular]. You can explain. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Switch on your mic Mr Interpreter and 
move your mask because we will not hear.  
MR NDZEKU:   If a chief cuts you piece of land and 
allocates you a plot of land the chief...[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Allocates you a plot of land.  
20 
MR NDZEKU:   A plot of land, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR NDZEKU:   The chief becomes responsible for that plot 
of land.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And that is chief Sigcau is that right? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 96 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Chief? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chief Sigcau?  
MR NDZEKU:   Sigcau yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Sigcau sorry.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that is S.I.G.C.A.U.  
MR NDZEKU:   I think so.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair I asked Mr Dunjwa’s help his 
morning with the pronunciation but I seem not to have 
perfected it.   
MR NDZEKU:   No, no it is fine. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   But is it S.I.G.C.A.U? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is exactly.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Sigcau.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Sigcau.  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sigcau, yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Sigcau, so that was chief Sigcau 
because he is the Nkhosi in the area.  Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes Nkhosi yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right so you met with her and you met 
20 
with chief Sigcau and others.  Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Others, yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you yourself bring anybody from with 
your side with you to the meeting or it was just only 
yourself? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 97 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   No, no I had my uncle.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You had your uncle.  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, and then his from Cape Town. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR NDZEKU:   Ja, now at the moment his sick his in 
hospital in the hospital 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR NDZEKU:   His got kidneys.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, now I think let us go together because 
10 
he was helping me.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
MR NDZEKU:   On this journey, yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And was Ms Memela there? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Chair sorry.  
ADV ALLI:   I think my learned friend is now moving onto 
the terrain that covers documents that we have not seen 
before.  So I think perhaps maybe this should be an 
opportune time to take this…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well she has not referred to documents 
20 
as yet.  
ADV ALLI:   Not quite but an area that is covered by 
evidence in documents relating to the area of questioning. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair I have not referred to document. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 98 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.    
ADV HOFMEYR:   I am simply seeking to understand from 
Mr Ndzeku about his meeting, who was there.  I think Mr 
Ndzeku is fully capable of telling us about his interactions.  
I suggest we proceed I will not refer to a document until 
the break.  
CHAIRPERSON:   She will not and we will get to the tea 
break just now.  
ADV ALLI:   Chair if I may it is, I think it is perhaps 
oversimplifying by my learned friend to say if she is not 
10 
referred to a document.  It is correct that she has not 
referred to a document but the purpose of the documents is 
of course it has the ability to impact upon the rights of Mr 
Ndzeku.   
          So while she may not refer to a document the 
documents that have been deduced directly bring to bear 
on the testimony that he gives now.  So we would then ask 
Chair is that… 
CHAIRPERSON:   We will accept that at this stage she has 
been dealing with who was at the meeting and what was 
20 
discussed at the meeting.  
ADV ALLI:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And from what I hear Mr Ndzeku does 
not feel that he does not have the answers for who was at 
the meeting that is very factual.  
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 99 of 388 
 
ADV ALLI:   Well Chair but for this is that I understand 
then remember Chair we had to sit with one ear and listen 
to this evidence and with the other ear page through this 
bundle of documents because it was only given to us after 
the evidence began this morning.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV ALLI:   So in that bundle of documents there is an 
affidavit which I think is by the Nkhosi who has been 
referred to now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
10 
ADV ALLI:   Now you have been asked Mr Ndzeku has 
been asked questions on this interaction with the Nkhosi 
whilst we have not had an opportunity to consider that 
affidavit properly.   
          So I think there must be also a level of respect, a 
respect for us and for the rights of Mr Ndzeku.  It is 
discourteous to have given us these documents after the 
proceedings commenced.  We could have read it ahead of 
time and been prepared even if it was ten minutes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
20 
ADV ALLI:   Even if it was ten minutes before the 
proceedings started this morning that would have been 
sufficient but to hand to us after the evidence starts, we 
say is disrespectful.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but in so far as he is giving 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 100 of 388 
 
evidence about the meeting his able to give the evidence 
as he recalls the position.  If later on it transpires that at 
certain document refreshes his memory differently he will 
be able to say so.  You understand?    
ADV ALLI:   I do understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes so and you will get a chance to re-
examine and if he gave an answer based on his memory 
but a certain document refreshes his memory, he will be 
able to deal with that yes.  
ADV ALLI:   Yes so really the Chair the request is this 
10 
Chair we are eight minutes away from the adjournment that 
is all, we are eight minutes away.  
CHAIRPERSON:   We are twenty minutes away.  
ADV ALLI:   Sorry…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Quarter past, yes.  
ADV ALLI:   But I presume because we had the early start 
at nine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV ALLI:   We will take it at 11 o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
20 
ADV ALLI:   It is fair enough Chair I will monitor the way 
that it goes and if we feel we need to raise a further 
objection then we will do so, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes of course we can take a tea break at 
11:00 and then resume at half past.  So maybe let us use 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 101 of 388 
 
the next seven minutes and then we will take an early tea 
break at 11:00 and then take 30 minutes.  
ADV ALLI:   Thank you.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay alright.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair we will see how far we 
can get by then.  So you were telling us more about this 
meeting Mr Ndzeku.  You were there, you there with your 
brother.  I think I asked was Ms Memela there and sorry I 
did not catch your answer.  Was Ms Memela at the 
10 
meeting? 
MR NDZEKU:   No she was not.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   No she was not. 
MR NDZEKU:   No she was not.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chief Sigcau was there and were there 
other representatives of the traditional council with him?  
MR NDZEKU:   Well I do not know but I saw these people 
the Nkhosi and other people Mapagati[?] the chief and then 
– I do not know what was actually…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   The chief brought certain people with 
20 
him?  
MR NDZEKU:   Ja, he did bring roundabout two or three, 
four men. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What positions they hold you do not 
know.  
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 102 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   I did not ask. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what was discussed? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well counsellor it was the issue of the land; 
this land I am buying from this lady.  This lady she 
introduced me to the chief and said this is the chief, the 
chief his in charge of everything on this side. So I was 
happy to meet the chief.  Then after that they decide that 
they wanted to take me straight to the land and next to the 
river and then where I saw and then I was very happy.   
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So they took you to the land next to the 
river, is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And that is the Umzimvubu River, is that 
correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Umzimvubu, yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Which side of the river is the land on the 
west or the east? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well I do not know I am sorry.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well it must be difficult to explain.  
20 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not know east or west as I am sitting 
here but I was there and I was very happy and then that is 
what I can say.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Is it on the Ntabankulu side of the river? 
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 103 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Is the land on the Ntabankulu side of the 
river? 
MR NDZEKU:   Side of what? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ntabankulu.  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is on the Ntabankulu side.  
MR NDZEKU:   Well it was the first time I also went there 
and I did not know if it is Ntabankulu, [speaking in 
vernacular] I do not know.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Can I have the translation please Mr 
10 
Interpreter.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR NDZEKU:   I said it was the first time for me to go 
there and then I do not know maybe it was the small table 
or maybe the bigger one, you know the way they are calling 
it.  
CHAIRPERSON:   He said Ms Hofmeyr he did not know 
whether 
it 
was 
Ntabankulu 
or 
Ntaban’ning’ning 
now 
Ntaban’ning’ning is the opposite of Ntabankulu.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ntabankulu yes I understand.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, it may be small.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   But you know the town of Ntabankulu, do 
you? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 104 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Well it was the first time I was there.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   But you confident that the land was on 
the Ntabankulu side of the Mzimvubu River? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you and what was the extent of 
the land? 
MR NDZEKU:   What was what? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What was the extent, how much land? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   What was the size of the land? 
MR NDZEKU:   I think it was roundabout 100 or 200 I do 
not remember to be honest, you know.   
CHAIRPERSON:   200 what, square meters or? 
MR NDZEKU:   [speaking in vernacular] or maybe 200 
square meters. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR NDZEKU:   Or a thousand by some but it was -  I did 
not write it down.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
20 
MR NDZEKU:   But I did actually write it down at my notes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR NDZEKU:   Ja, I do not have it now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   You do not have those notes now? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 105 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I do not have it.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then there was an affidavit that Ms 
Hlohlela prepared.  Do you remember that affidavit? 
MR NDZEKU:   Can you please try to expand.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Of course, I could take you to it if you 
would like.  
MR NDZEKU:   Please, thank you.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is in Tab 6 where we were earlier and

20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Sorry 24. It is after the last page of the 
sale agreement.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you able to find it Mr Ndzeku?  Are 
you able to find it, page 24? 
MR NDZEKU:   I am at page 21 now, did you say page what 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 106 of 388 
 
– 24?  
ADV HOFMEYR:   24. 
CHAIRPERSON:   24, yes.  
MR NDZEKU:   The last page or what is it then?  Ja page 
24 yes I can see it here.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair I did go to a document but it is a 
document that Mr Ndzeku provided to the Commission.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   So that is the affidavit from Ms Hlohlela, 
do you recall that? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   What are you saying now counsellor, what 
about this? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you remember that document? 
MR NDZEKU:   This document? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I think so.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Mr Ndzeku, Ms Kwinana, Ms 
Yakhe Kwinana…[intervene]  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Your affidavit before the Commission 
20 
indicates that you only got to know her in the last three 
years or so.  Is that correct?  
MR NDZEKU:   Last three years? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  
MR NDZEKU:   Did I say that? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 107 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You did, yes.  I can take you to it if you 
would like but feel free to clarify if that is incorrect.  When 
did you first get you know Ms Yakhe Kwinana?  
MR NDZEKU:   Well I was advised when I am doing the 
payment that I must use actually Ms Kwinana’s name there 
you know.  They said please because I think Kwinana and 
Ms Memela they bought the land which is the land have got 
nothing to do with me but they said if you pay it you Ms 
Mbanjwa please use Ms Kwinana as a reference.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay that is using her as a reference but 
10 
I understood your affidavit to say you have got to know her 
in the last three years Ms Kwinana.  Is that correct?  
MR NDZEKU:   Well not to say – it also depends counsellor 
when you say know her.  What is – what do you mean by 
saying know her?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   I am not sure that is the word you used 
in your affidavit.  
MR NDZEKU:   I am what? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Those were the words that you used in 
your affidavit.  
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Well I think maybe my – my friend did that 
the other one actually they were helping me.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  
MR NDZEKU:   He will have to explain to me what was the 
meaning of that.  
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 108 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay maybe you can explain now.  What 
is your relationship with Ms Kwinana?  
MR NDZEKU:   No relationship at all.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   When did you first meet her? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well there was no need for me to meet her.  
CHAIRPERSON:   When did you…[intervened] 
MR NDZEKU:   I never met her.  
CHAIRPERSON:   When did you have your first encounter 
with her? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well Chair I never, I do not remember 
10 
meeting you know her there.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Would it be about three years ago, two 
years ago, five years ago, what is your estimate? 
MR NDZEKU:   I think it must be roundabout seven, eight 
years ago.  
CHAIRPERSON:   About seven or eight years ago.  
MR NDZEKU:   Nine years ago, because Mr Goniwe he 
introduced me, the late Mr Goniwe – rest in peace - he 
introduced me to Ms…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Kwinana.  
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, that long time ago.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And what is – you said you do not have 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 109 of 388 
 
a relationship with her.   
MR NDZEKU:   No.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Have you never met her face to face? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well as I said the late gentleman he 
introduced me that was eight, nine years ago.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And was that in a social setting? 
MR NDZEKU:   No I think they were just; it was an ANC 
meeting where everybody was there.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay.  
MR NDZEKU:   You know the main guy here it was Mr 
10 
Goniwe himself, Ms Kwinana she was there you know.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And other than that have you met with 
her personally? 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not remember.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you remember in 2016 while that 
Swissport ground handling contract was being negotiated 
having any dealings with her?  
MR NDZEKU:   Well I remember very well at that time 
20 
myself and Peter Cole and other gentleman we went to 
SAP, SAA, I was called by that time.  I do not remember 
who was there but I saw there were people they were 
sitting.     
ADV HOFMEYR:   Is that when you signed the agreement? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 110 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   No we did not sign an agreement.  There 
was no agreement signed.  
CHAIRPERSON:   I promised that we would take the tea 
break at 11:00.  I think let us take the tea break it is 11:03 
and then we will resume let me make it 11:35. So we will 
take the adjournment and we will come back at 11:35.  We 
adjourn.    
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay let us continue. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  Chair just before the 
break Mr Ndzeku we were dealing with Ms Yake Kwinana and 
the extent of your interactions with her and I would just like 
to get clear on a few aspects there.  You said you 
remembered a particular meeting in 2016 that you attended 
at SAA where she was present, is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And you said you… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Please switch on your microphone Mr 
Ndzeku.  Switch on your microphone.  Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And I understood you to say she was 
present at that meeting, is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  No I did not say she was present.  I said we 
went in that meeting there were three – four people and two 
ladies.  I did not even know Yake by that time. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 111 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You did not know her by that time? 
MR NDZEKU:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay.  So it could have been her but it 
might not have been her, is that your evidence? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  And you said you attended with 
another gentleman who were the people at that meeting? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well from – you mean from Swissport? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well generally who was at the meeting?  I 
think you mentioned Mr Kohl is that correct? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:  Ja I think it was Bob Gurr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Bob Gurr right. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes.  And then Peter Kohl. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  Lester Peter 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MR NDZEKU:  And then also – there was also another 
gentleman which is – was introduced Peter Kohl introduced 
me to this gentleman as one of the empowerment of – a new 
guy in [00:01:29].  I just forgot his name.  His name was 
20 
Peter something like that? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Peter something. 
MR NDZEKU:  He was also there in the meeting. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Was that the first time you had met this 
person named Peter? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 112 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:  No it was not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay when had you met him before? 
MR NDZEKU:  I – Peter called and he introduced me to 
Peter and then again, I remember very well myself and Willie 
Holloway – Willie Holloway was a Swissport CEO and then 
he also introduced me to this young man.  They know each 
other – this Peter – other guy. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay sorry we are going to need to go a 
little bit slower there.  So you attend this meeting at SAA. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  You are there with Mr Kohl, 
correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And Mr Bob Kerr – Gurr? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  At that meeting you are introduced to 
another gentleman you recall with the name of Peter is that 
correct? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay.  What I then asked is did you know 
Mr Peter before that meeting? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes I think I did meet him. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You had met him? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 113 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes I did. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Where had you met him? 
MR NDZEKU:  I think I met him at Swissport office because 
Peter phoned me, he told me that there are two actually 
gentlemen he wants me to meet and then I – it was actually 
this Peter and also another one.  These are part of the 
empowerment they wanted to use for Swissport. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I see.  And did you know Mr Peter socially? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well I cannot say yes, no because the last 
time I met Peter it was myself and Peter – and Willie 
10 
Holloway we attended actually the soccer together – socially 
no. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So you attended a soccer game with him, 
is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  Correct yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Did you see the photo of that in the bundle 
in the break? 
MR NDZEKU:  No I have got the photo by the way myself 
and Peter Holloway. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:  I did not see it – is it here? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Which soccer game was it? 
MR NDZEKU:  It was the 2010. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 114 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  2010? 
MR NDZEKU:  Ja World Cup. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Soccer World Cup? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So you met with Mr Peter – well you had 
attended the 2010 Soccer World Cup with Mr Peter, is that 
correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  The person introduced me that time to Peter it 
was Willie Holloway the CEO of Swissport.  He – we find him 
there and then we got the tickets – we were together in the 
10 
game. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  Then jump to 2016 when you have 
your meeting at SAA and Mr Peter is introduced to you 
again. Did you have interactions with him between the 
Soccer World Cup in 2020 and the meeting at SAA in 
February 2016? 
CHAIRPERSON:  2010 you said 2020. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Apologies 2010. 
MR NDZEKU:  No, no after 2010 and then he came again to 
Swissport.  I think there was an issue where the SAA they 
20 
were introducing this thing of 30% of black empowerment 
and 
then 
they 
say 
Swissport 
must 
have 
another 
empowerment and then Peter came with another people also 
– they were around two, three empowerment who came to 
Swissport which is the CEO of Swissport did introduce me to 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 115 of 388 
 
these people not only to Peter. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And it was through Swissport that you 
then met him again, is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes correct yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And then is the next time you interact with 
him at the February 2016 meeting with SAA, is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes if I remember correctly yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right and at that meeting Ms Kwinana may 
have been there she may not have been there you did not 
know her at the time, is that correct? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:  Well there were two ladies there and then 
another gentlemen and the meeting did not take time. It was 
well a few minutes and then we left. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But you were not able to identify Ms 
Kwinana as one of those two ladies, correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well I could, I could say yes she was there – 
another lady as well – there were two people yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Because your evidence a moment ago was 
that you did not know if Ms Kwinana was at that meeting.  
What is your evidence now Mr Ndzeku? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:  Well I do not remember. I could identify – 
there were two ladies.  I do not – you know – there was 
nothing for me to say this is Kwinana or this is not Kwinana 
because I was invited by – by Peter Kohl they say let us 
attend the meeting.  There are issues of Swissport.  So we 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 116 of 388 
 
went there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  By that time, you knew Ms Kwinana or you 
did not know her as yet? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well as I say Chair I was introduced to Ms 
Kwinana by the late [00:06:07]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was eight years – nine years ago. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes.  And after that I started to know her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes.  We started – I started to know her 
because Willie Holloway the Swissport CEO of Swissport I 
10 
think I think I was dealing with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so if she was at this meeting there is 
no way you would not have recognised her, is that right? 
MR NDZEKU:  I think she was in the meeting Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You think she was in the meeting? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes I think it was – yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And your role at this meeting Mr Ndzeku?  
20 
What was your role? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well I was invited as part of Swissport. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I understand your affidavit to have said 
you paid no role in the negotiations of that contract, is that 
correct? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 117 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:  Correct yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And you just listened, is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  Only few – there was only a few minutes we 
were there with Peter Kohl.  We did not even time and then 
they told us to go. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Hm.  You would have been aware as a 
consequence that the Swissport agreement this one with 
SAA was a very important one for Swissport, was it not? 
MR NDZEKU:  Can you repeat again Counsellor? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Were you aware that this agreement 
10 
between Swissport and SAA was a very important agreement 
for Swissport? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well they did not have another ground 
handling Swissport was the only one. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Hm.  It – well no I am saying for Swissport 
the agreement with SAA was very important, correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  Correct yes. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 Yes. 
 
It 
comprised 
about 
70% 
of 
Swissport’s business in South Africa, is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well I am not – I do not know because I am 
20 
not sitting in the – on the papers – on their – on the 
company. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But are you able to say it … 
MR NDZEKU:  Well Chair SAA was not the only client of 
SAA. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 118 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  Before SAA Swissport had other clients. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
MR NDZEKU:  Before SAA there was a company called – 
was doing a ground handling called Apron Service then after 
that was also another.  Swissport was big business with 
other.  I cannot say it was 70% because why… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But are you able to say it constituted or it 
would constitute a substantial amount of business? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well I can say that it was part of the client 
10 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And just to return to Ms Kwinana as I 
understand it you see her at this meeting on the – I think it 
was the 10 February 2016 did you have other interactions 
with her over the course of 2016? 
MR NDZEKU:  I think so yes Ma’am.  Ja we did talk. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You did talk.  What about? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well we were busy talking I do not know what 
20 
it was about but we were busy talking.  I do not remember 
but we were talking. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  She was the Head of – she was the Chair 
of the board of SAA Technical at the time and she was also a 
non-executive member of SAA and you were a director of 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 119 of 388 
 
Swissport would it not have been improper for you to be 
engaging with her and talking to her while big agreements 
were being concluded? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well Counsellor another actually made by me 
may I just add earlier – or maybe ask you?  When it comes 
to the issues of – of engaging on the ground handling or the 
contract I am not part of that. 
MR NDZEKU:  No but… 
MR NDZEKU:  Peter – they are there.  There are people at 
Swissport who are doing that not me. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I understand that Mr Ndzeku. 
MR NDZEKU:  I can talk actually – I can talk to Kwinana I 
can talk to Dudu I can talk to anybody.  I am not part of the 
team who are doing the job. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Ndzeku… 
MR NDZEKU:  And I can also not influence that at least they 
must say yes or no because I am far away from those things. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Ndzeku were you a director of 
Swissport in 2016? 
MR NDZEKU:  From – for a long time. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Were you a director of JM Aviation South 
Africa in 2016? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Was JM Aviation South Africa and 
Swissport both trying to get contracts from SAA over the 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 120 of 388 
 
period of 2016? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Sorry yes I think your voice just dropped 
there. 
MR NDZEKU:  What are you saying again Counsellor? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I said was JM Aviation and Swissport 
South Africa trying to get contracts with SAA in 2016? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well you say Swissport was trying but 
Swissport was handling SAA.  I am confused now you say 
they were trying.  They were then with SAA. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  They did not have a contract. 
MR NDZEKU:  I do not know that – I did not know that.  
Sorry. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  They did not have a contract with SAA. 
MR NDZEKU:  I did not know that – they did not have a 
contract. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That was not discussed at the meeting on 
the 10 February 2016 that you attended? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well as I said that meeting did not only take 
ten minutes then we left.  They did not say nothing.  Peter 
20 
Kohl was there with the papers and after that we left.  I think 
this other gentleman was there he was supposed actually to 
be helping Peter Kohl because him and Peter Kohl they 
attended a meeting in Durban of the empowerment.  I was 
not part of that. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 121 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Ndzeku is it your evidence before this 
commission that on the 10 February 2016 meeting between 
Swissport and SAA the contract for ground handling services 
by Swissport was not discussed? 
MR NDZEKU:  I do not remember. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Hm.  And… 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was the purpose of that meeting? 
MR NDZEKU:  Peter Kohl. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As you understood it. 
MR NDZEKU:  As I understand Peter Kohl told me that there 
10 
was a meeting which is – it must be attended and please he 
want me to come.  And Bob is part of marketing of Swissport.  
We left we went straight there.  We found another two 
gentlemen I think another one was there Lester Peter 
something like that a very big gentleman who was sitting 
there.  And a person was talking it was Peter Kohl. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  If I remember very clearly, I think Swissport 
they were trying to talk to them but I was not – I was not 
invited that at least I must be part of that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but did you ask before you went to the 
meeting what the meeting was about? 
MR NDZEKU:  Chair as a person who is working when they 
see you say come – you go to a meeting – he has got an 
agenda – you just come.  That is exactly what I did. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 122 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you did see an agenda? 
MR NDZEKU:  I did not see an agenda no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did or you did not? 
MR NDZEKU:  I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when the meeting started somebody 
must have said what the meeting was about? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well a person was busy trying to talk.  It was 
Peter Kohl. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NDZEKU:  Myself and Bob Gurr we standing there.  I 
10 
repeat again Chair it only takes two, three minutes and then 
we were out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why did it take such a short time? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well I think maybe Peter Kohl did not have 
document they wanted.  It is exactly my understanding 
because they wanted some few document from him which is 
he did not have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you therefore saying there was nothing 
of substance that was discussed at that meeting? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well the way I look at it they wanted some 
20 
document from Peter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NDZEKU:  He did not have.  That is why we left very 
quick.  I do not know maybe after that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 123 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:  Did they have another meeting but the time I 
was there I did not see any. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did they ask him for documents as you 
recall or you are not sure about that? 
MR NDZEKU:  They did yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They did? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he did not have them at hand? 
MR NDZEKU:  They were – he did not have them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There were some documents but there 
10 
were some that he did not have? 
MR NDZEKU:  Chair I do not remember but he did not have 
that document they wanted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes oh okay. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes.  I think the mere fact that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that was the reason for the meeting. 
MR NDZEKU:  The mere fact Chair we did not sit in the 
meeting to discuss it is because he was not – he did not 
have document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And the absence of those documents 
20 
that they were looking for was the reason why the meeting 
took such a short time? 
MR NDZEKU:  I think that was the reason. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 124 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Ndzeku the document that Ms Kwinana 
demanded from Mr Kohl at that meeting was a signed 
contract that would have given 30% of the revenues for the 
ground handling contract that was going to earn Swissport 
R1.5 billion and Mr Kohl said he did not have the signed 
contract because Swissport could not conclude that deal.  
Does that refresh your memory? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well they did not tell me anything about that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You were in the meeting Mr Ndzeku. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:  No, no, no I did not – they did not tell me 
anything about that.  They never actually talk about that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No Mr Ndzeku let me be clear about the 
evidence. 
MR NDZEKU:  No, no Counsellor let me explain to you.  
Peter Kohl is in charge.  Peter Kohl and Bob Gurr, they are 
the people actually who are doing the marketing on the 
issues of SAA. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Ndzeku yes, no, no you have told 
us that quite a number of times. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:  Times yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  What Counsel is asking for is nothing 
more than your own knowledge.  If you do not know you say 
you do not know. 
MR NDZEKU:  I do not know. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 125 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you do know you say you do know. 
MR NDZEKU:  No I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if you say you do not know and 
Counsel does not accept that she might probe further okay. 
MR NDZEKU:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr just… 
MR NDZEKU:  Counsellor I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You do not know? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So again I just need to clarify.  You were 
present at a meeting at which Ms Kwinana asked for the 
signed contract from Swissport and Mr Kohl said he does not 
have it because they cannot agree to the terms.  Do you 
remember that? 
MR NDZEKU:  I do not remember that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You do not remember that.  Do you 
remember Ms Kwinana at that meeting saying that they were 
going to terminate the existing relationship with Swissport 
because it would not sign the agreement? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:  Well you know what Counsellor as I said 
before the meeting did not even take five minutes and then 
we were gone. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you remember… 
MR NDZEKU:  Peter – no, no Peter Kohl was the man 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 126 of 388 
 
actually who was talking.  The reason for the meeting we 
went there I did not even know because I was not involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Mr Ndzeku.  You did say you want 
us to finish. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  The one way to make sure we finish 
is to just answer the question that is being put to you. 
MR NDZEKU:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So Ms Hofmeyr just put that question 
again. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed.  Do you remember... 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you answer it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That Ms Kwinana said to Swissport at that 
meeting that SAA was terminating its existing contract with 
Swissport because it would not sign the contract? 
MR NDZEKU:  He was talking to Peter Kohl. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You remember her saying that? 
MR NDZEKU:  I do not remember that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right. And then you had a series – you tell 
me that you did interact with Ms Kwinana outside of that 
20 
meeting at the time, is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  At that time? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR NDZEKU:  No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No not at that time? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 127 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:  No I did long time ago not that time. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Not that time?  So in 2016 you were not 
communicating with her other than at that meeting? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well we did talk.  You know we – we talk we 
phone each other. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NDZEKU:  And then the reason why actually I wanted to 
understand from her it was about this young man Peter – 
Peter I forgot what his surname from [00:17:06] Park I do not 
know the company which is they were telling me that they 
10 
have to attend the meetings with 30%.  I said can you please 
explain to me who is this guy?  I did talk to her in order to 
find out about this young gentleman. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Is the young gentleman Daluxolo Peter? 
MR NDZEKU:  Exactly Xolo yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MR NDZEKU:  Mr Xolo yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right because there are two Peters we are 
going to be talking about today Chair.   
MR NDZEKU:  Thank you very much. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So I want us to be clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  There is Daluxolo Peter and there is Lester 
Peter. 
MR NDZEKU:  Xolo Peter, Xolo Peter. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 128 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  So the person who was present at 
the meeting the gentleman who you were introduced to who 
you attended the 2010 World Cup with is Daluxolo. 
MR NDZEKU:  It is Daluxolo. 
ADV HOFMEYR:    Peter correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  Now you have this meeting on the 
10 February 2016 at which you do not recall Ms Kwinana 
saying we are severing ties with Swissport because you will 
not sign an agreement that gives 30% of your revenues to 
10 
our nominated company.  And then you chat to her on the 
phone around that time.  Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well the reason why I was talking to Ms 
Kwinana it was about Xolo. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MR NDZEKU:  Xolo he was a new BEE he was introduced.  
He introduced himself that he was in the meeting between 
Ms Kwinana and Dudu on that issue of 30%.  So I said talk to 
Peter – to Peter Kohl.  Peter Kohl is the CEO.  So everything 
was happening on that 30%.  Even Peter Kohl he flew 
20 
actually to Durban with Xolo this gentleman.  I was not even 
there. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So you were talking to Ms Kwinana then 
about the deal, were you not?  Because if Mr Daluxolo Peter 
was going to be the empowerment partner then you were 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 129 of 388 
 
talking about the very deal that was the subject matter of the 
discussion. 
MR NDZEKU:  No we were talking – we were talking about 
the empowerment because they wanted Swissport must have 
30% shares.  It must have 30% empowerment not about the 
deal. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No. 
MR NDZEKU:  The deal actually belongs to Peter Kohl.  
Peter Kohl is the CEO. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No Mr Ndzeku let us go through this 
10 
slowly. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  SAA was engaging with Swissport towards 
the end of 2015 about the new ground handling contract for 
five years. Correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  Can you just stop there.  Before that who was 
handling actually SAA?  
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Ndzeku it will be helpful if you just 
answer the questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja hang on – hang on Mr Ndzeku.  Mr 
20 
Ndzeku.  Please just answer the question.  The question is 
whether you confirm that towards the end of 2015 SAA was 
engaging with Swissport about a new ground handling 
contract.  Do you confirm that that was the position or are 
you not able to confirm? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 130 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:  I cannot confirm because Peter Kohl was 
doing his own thing in his corner with Bob Gurr.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NDZEKU:  Whenever they have got meetings Chair they 
are on their way they talk.  And then when they need a black 
face they say come let us go.  Which is I was that person.  
Whenever they go to the meeting and then I must be part of 
the meeting.  Do I have the agenda Chair?  No I do not have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It was a component of that new contract 
10 
that SAA was seeking to conclude with Swissport that 
Swissport gives 30% of its revenues under that contract to a 
nominated empowerment company.  Were you aware of that? 
MR NDZEKU:  Can you say it again Counsellor? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  It was a part of that ground handling 
contract the new one that was going to be concluded 
between 
SAA 
and Swissport that Swissport 
would 
be 
required to give 30% of its revenues to a nominated 
empowerment company.  Were you aware of that? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well they did discuss that. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  Now on the board yes they did. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  Which is they were not happy about that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Hm.   
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 131 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they is Swissport? 
MR NDZEKU:  Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who was not happy about that? 
MR NDZEKU:  Swissport – Swissport board they were not 
happy about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  They said no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR NDZEKU:  They are not going to do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And Mr Daluxolo Peter was there as the 
possible empowerment partner, is that correct 
MR NDZEKU:  Of – yes of the new – of yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  Of that 30% yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  So then after that meeting you have 
told us in your evidence today you phoned Ms Kwinana to 
talk to her about the empowerment partner, correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  So you were talking to her. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  About the very contract that was on the 
table to be concluded between Swissport and SAA, correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well I do not know because that was Peter’s 
job Counsellor of the contract.  I mean empowerment.  
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 132 of 388 
 
Whenever Peter Kohl is bringing empowerment, he always 
call me that if we can we discuss this – this is exactly.  The 
issue of the contract by the way it is because – the CEO is 
the one who is in charge of it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But why were you then talking to Ms 
Kwinana about the empowerment partner? 
MR NDZEKU:  Very good because they – this young 
gentleman he told Peter Kohl that Peter Kohl for them to do 
business Chair they will have to have 30% shares of 
Swissport. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  And then Peter Kohl said no we cannot 
because we have got empowerment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  Then he started to introduce this young man 
to me he says listen this is the person we must work with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  And Peter Kohl flew from Johannesburg and 
this young man straight to Durban to another meeting of 
empowerment which is what was happening there.  I think Ms 
20 
Kwinana was here and Dudu was there.  It was also road 
show of empowerment.  I was not part of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No.  But my question is quite a few 
times you have emphasised that Peter Kohl was the one who 
was dealing with… 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 133 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes empowerment yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think operations and so on and you were 
not involved. And my question is why were you then phoning 
Ms Kwinana about this empowerment partner?  Why were 
you not leaving that Peter Kohl to do? 
MR NDZEKU:  No, no because Peter Kohl he asked me to do 
that because this young man told Peter Kohl that he will be 
going actually to Durban.  He wants me and him to go to 
Durban and Peter Kohl because he was told by Ms Myeni 
and Ms Kwinana.  So that is why now I was talking to Ms 
10 
Kwinana about this young man about this 30% because one 
of the company the budget – budgeted ACSA they also had 
this problem.  So I just wanted to find out Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you did get involved in operational 
matters when – sometimes? 
MR NDZEKU:  Sometimes yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  How many times did you speak to her 
about it? 
MR NDZEKU:  About what Chair? 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  The empowerment partner? 
MR NDZEKU:  I think many times. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Many? 
MR NDZEKU:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Why would there be a need for many 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 134 of 388 
 
conversations about the empowerment partner Mr Ndzeku? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well I did not see anything wrong because 
this young man is here, he wants to – he wants to get a job.  
So Peter Kohl is asking me do I really give him a job?  I 
said, why are you asking me?  Because he wanted to be 
employed.  So the person who – he is always mentioning Ms 
Kwinana so I said okay let me ask Kwinana what is her 
story?  I do not see anything wrong if I was talking to her. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No indeed Mr Ndzeku but that is a one 
topic, one conversation type of engagement I put it to you.  
10 
Why 
did 
you 
need 
many 
engagements 
about 
the 
empowerment partner? 
MR NDZEKU:  I do not know.  I decided to call her because 
this gentleman was here.  He wanted to get the job.  He 
wanted to be part of this and Peter was asking me, do we 
give him a job or what do we do?  You know. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So tell me… 
CHAIRPERSON:  When you phoned Ms Kwinana for the first 
time about the BEE partner what did you want to find out 
from her about the BEE partner empowerment partner? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:  Well first time I called Ms Kwinana this young 
man was there.  Daluxolo can you please explain me exactly 
what is happening?  He says but Husisi and Dudu they are 
saying I must be part of this.  So I said how can you be part 
of this when Swissport has got empowerment?  You know 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 135 of 388 
 
Chair it was – it was just a long story with Daluxolo which is 
– it was not only him alone.  So that is why I was asking Ms 
Kwinana if she must explain to us exactly what is happening.  
And I said I think Peter he must actually be the one who is 
talking to Ms Kwinana not me.  Because Daluxolo is all the 
time with – with Peter Kohl. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did the empowerment partner say to you… 
MR NDZEKU:  They are not happy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Kwinana had said he should be part of 
this.  Is that what he said to you? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:  Daluxolo yes he did say that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what he said to you.  And did he 
refer to Ms Kwinana as Usisi? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes he did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  Actually, it was not Ms Kwinana alone it was 
also Ms Myeni both of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh did he refer to each one of them as 
Usisi? 
MR NDZEKU:  Usisi yes both of them yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Sisi is sister. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Indeed, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So what he was saying to you was 
Usisi whether that was Ms Myeni or Ms Kwinana said I must 
be part of this. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 136 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:  Of this yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is why you then decided you 
should speak to Ms Kwinana. 
MR NDZEKU:  And find out exactly how do we involve the 
young man.  Because at the moment Swissport they are 
saying Chair they have got an empowerment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And your question basically was Swissport 
has got an empowerment component how does Swissport 
bring in this new person?  That was your question? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what did Ms Kwinana say to you when 
you asked her this question? 
MR NDZEKU:  Then she says – Ms Kwinana says Peter Kohl 
they must decide because I think there was also issue of the 
equipment because ACSA they were supposed to buy brand 
new equipment. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NDZEKU:  Not actually Swissport.  Because Swissport 
they can only have five years.  After five years they will have 
actually renewed the equipment.  So now this – this BEE 
20 
partner of 30% I think Peter wanted to put them there.  You 
know.  It was a long story Chair so I did not even know 
exactly how to start it.  You know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So you were chiefly involved in the 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 137 of 388 
 
negotiations about the empowerment aspect of the contract, 
were you not Mr Ndzeku? 
MR NDZEKU:  Sorry? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You were involved? 
MR NDZEKU: Well … 
ADV HOFMEYR:  In the empowerment aspects of the 
contract. 
MR NDZEKU:  By – well Peter Kohl… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  For Swissport and SAA, correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  When Peter Kohl asked me to be involved and 
10 
he asked me to help yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  How many times did he ask you to be 
involved? 
MR NDZEKU:  I think many times. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Many times? 
MR 
NDZEKU: 
 Because it was not only the – this 
empowerment 
they 
were 
dealing 
with 
also 
other 
empowerment. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Hm.  Mr Ndzeku before the break that we 
have just had today ...[intervenes]  
20 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Your version before this commission is that 
you had no involvement at all in the negotiations between 
Swissport and SAA for this contract.  Do you recall that? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well it also depend Chair when he says 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 138 of 388 
 
involvement.  You know I did not understand.  You know as I 
said that Chair Peter Kohl is the one actually who is involved 
– who is in charge of the contract.  When he says I did not – 
I was not involved myself I did not understand.  You know 
but Peter Kohl as I said he is the one who is in charge of the 
contract. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No Mr Ndzeku your evidence this morning 
and I was very clear to get it from you and in your affidavit is 
that you played no role in the negotiations for this contract.  
After the break you have confirmed that you played a key 
10 
role in the negotiations for this contract because of its 
empowerment aspect. 
MR NDZEKU:  Well… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Your version today has changed Mr 
Ndzeku. 
MR NDZEKU:  I do not know now when you say key role 
what is the meaning of that? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on Mr Ndzeku you must wait for 
Counsel to finish and then you can respond. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I put it to you that your version over the 
20 
course of the evidence today has changed Mr Ndzeku.  Do 
you accept that? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well maybe I did not understand you.  Even 
now I do not understand when you say key role what is the 
meaning of that? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 139 of 388 
 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
It 
means 
that 
you 
had 
repeated 
conversations on your phone with Ms Kwinana around the 
time that this deal was being concluded and you have told us 
in your evidence a moment ago that that was to discuss the 
empowerment aspect of the deal. 
MR NDZEKU:  Well I did not know that when I speak to Ms 
Kwinana it was a problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see in paragraph 13 of your affidavit – 
unsigned affidavit at page 4 you say: 
“I did not have any involvement in the 
10 
negotiations.” 
And then paragraph 14. 
“After conclusion of the negotiations and a 
written agreement having been prepared, I 
was asked by Peter Kohl to accompany him 
to the meeting to sign the agreement on 
Swissport’s behalf together with him which I 
duly did.” 
And then 15 
“This I gather was because I was a black 
20 
director 
of 
Swissport 
and 
because 
the 
centrality of black economic empowerment to 
the deal.” 
So one certainly gets the impression from what you say here 
that you were only – you were not involved in the 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 140 of 388 
 
negotiations and you were only called in for purposes of the 
signing of the agreement.  That is the impression I get from 
this. 
MR NDZEKU:  Well Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NDZEKU:  Let me say it again.  Peter Kohl is the man 
who is in charge of the company.  He was the one who was 
busy talking about the contract.  I did not know that the 
contract expired but whenever there is problems, he is going 
to talk to the directors of the company which is in part with 
10 
the directors and other guys.  Then he is going to ask help.  
For me I do not know what exactly went wrong for me talking 
to Ms Kwinana or maybe by talking to Ms Kwinana it makes 
me to – it makes us to get the contract for Peter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is from your affidavit.  You are saying in 
the affidavit you were not involved in the negotiations.  You 
accept that? 
MR NDZEKU:  I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And that you were called in at the 
time of the signing of the agreement.  That is what the 
20 
paragraph 14 says. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   H’m.  Let me try and be a little bit 
slower because I think in fairness to you, I jumped ahead 
with my questions.  JM Aviation played no role at all in the 
ground handling contract between Swissport and SAA, did it? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 141 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes, it did not play any role, correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Just say yes, please.  You nodded and 
the record will not reflect that. 
MR NDZEKU:   [laughs]   
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not understand?  I want you to 
confirm that... she wants you to confirm that your answer 
was yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   What are you saying again? [laughs]   
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The question was, you were asked 
whether to confirm whether JM played any role in the 
contract between Swissport and SAA. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I said no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
MR NDZEKU:   I said no. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Thank you.  Now, what I understand 
your evidence to be a few moments ago is that Swissport 
instructed you, JM Aviation to pay R 20 million to Jammicron 
20 
because Jammicron was going to be the empowerment 
partner in the ground handling contract.  Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes.  Why would Swissport need to put 
the money through JM Aviation first to get it to Jammicron if 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 142 of 388 
 
JM Aviation had nothing to do with the ground handling 
contract? 
MR NDZEKU:   That is a good question, councillor.  It must 
be asked to Peter Kohl, the one who actually paid the 
money.   
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   No, why did you not ask him at the 
time? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I did not ask him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, R 20 million is a lot of money, is it 
not? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   It is.  It is, Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   It is coming from Swissport, it is coming from 
the CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So did Swissport give JM Aviation the 
R 20 million and said:  Pass it on? 
MR NDZEKU:   Let me just say it again, Chairman.  
Swissport, they did deals with JM Aviation, not only with SAA 
but with other companies as well.  Now when this Jammicron 
came onboard, was supposed to be paid.   
20 
 
I am not also going to say about other companies 
because this was not the first company Swissport did.  
Remember Chair, this money come from Swissport.  It is 
their money.  As CEO, you must make a decision. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 143 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   If you feed the board about that it is okay.  
So now they asked me.  They said:  Can you...?  Actually, 
they spoke to Jules because Jules actually is their senior.   
 
They explained to him and Jules says:  I do not see any 
problem.  Because if maybe me as the... I will say Peter has 
put money, I would not know exactly how to pay back 
because I am not involved on signing the cheques and not.   
 
But if Jules agreed that it must be done and it was done.  
Why the Swissport do it... did it?  I do not know councillor.  
But Swissport and JM Aviation and Jules, they have got a 
10 
very, very good relationship in business. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Mr Ndzeku, do you want to know why 
Swissport paid that money into your account according to 
Swissport? 
MR NDZEKU:   Please explain to me.  I want to know. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   There was a contract concluded 
between Swissport and JM Aviation related to the GSC 
Workshops.  You are aware of that, are you not? 
MR NDZEKU:   The what? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   There was a contract between 
20 
Swissport and JM Aviation related to the Swissport’s GSC 
Workshops.  Correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I think Jules was involved on that.  I do 
not know if he knows anything about it.  Jules was involved 
and so Peter Kohl. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 144 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes, but you do know about it because 
you have dealt with it in your affidavit in response to the 
documents summons you received, did you not? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, when it comes to my attention, when I 
started to see these are the things I am supposed to 
respond, then I started asking him.  And I think, I said:  
Jules, you are the one who actually did this.  Can you please 
explain?  And I think he did also give his affidavit.  Because 
I was not involved at all there.   
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   So in 2016, you did not know that your 
10 
company, JM Aviation, had concluded a Service Level 
Agreement with Swissport to deal with the GSC Workshops.  
Is that your evidence? 
MR NDZEKU:   To deal with? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   The GSC Workshops. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, Jules, again, he was the one who was 
involved. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   No, my question is.  Did you have any 
knowledge of it in 2016? 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not remember, councillor.  Sorry, I do not 
20 
remember.   
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   So you may have had knowledge and 
you do not recall or you did not have knowledge? 
MR NDZEKU:   I did not have... I do not remember to be 
honest.  I cannot say yes or no.  I cannot remember. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 145 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, were there any contracts that... are 
there any contracts that JM Aviation concluded with, whether 
SAA or Swissport or any entity, that you remember? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, there were a few which is with Jules.  A 
few contracts, contract with Swissport. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR NDZEKU:   Which is he was the one which was involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Jules was a senior, also doing the marketing 
with Peter. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   You see, Mr Ndzeku.  Swissport said it 
paid that money that ended up with R 20 million going to 
Jammicron because of the Service Level Agreement it had 
entered into between JM Aviation and itself for consulting 
services on the GSC Workshops that was going to be 
performed over a year, from the 1s t of April 2016 to the 
31s t of March 2017.  Are you telling me, you have no 
knowledge of that contract at all? 
MR NDZEKU:   That is exactly what he says.  It is exactly 
20 
what it says in this affidavit? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, maybe if he said, he is paid.  Maybe it 
is true.  I do not have knowledge of that.   
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   No knowledge of this consultancy 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 146 of 388 
 
contract? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   For which JM Aviation received 
R 28.5 million from Swissport.  You were not aware of that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, if they are talking about the money, that 
is why I said Jules was involved in that. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Mr Ndzeku, let us go a little bit slower.  
So you have no knowledge of the contract that was signed 
by JM Aviation with Swissport for R 28.5 million to do 
consulting services on the GSC Workshops? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Councillor... I am sorry, Chair.  I am not 
involved in day-to-day operation.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Mr Ndzeku but ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   So Swissport and the company, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Swissport, it has got a CEO, it has got an... it 
has got a marketing.  I am not part of that.  The same as JM 
Aviation.  Now if the councillor says to me, I was not aware.  
If I was not aware, the people then doing their job and 
maybe they did not tell me.  Maybe they did tell me.  I forgot. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Mr Ndzeku, my impression is that 
these were not small amounts.  This was not business for 
small amounts. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Certainly not for the size of the company, 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 147 of 388 
 
the company of the size of JM Aviation as I understand it 
which might not be correct.   
 
And I would have expected that even if you were not 
involved in the actual conclusion of the negotiation of the 
contract, you would know that your company has a contract 
worth R 28.5 million with another company.   
 
At least that you would have known and what it is for.  I 
would expect you to know at least that part. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, Chair.  When... if people are working, 
they are doing what they doing, then sometimes they tell you 
10 
something.  They do tell you... well, they did tell me.  Maybe 
they did tell me.  
CHAIRPERSON:   But there ought to be reports from the 
management as well about what is happening in the company 
so that you have an idea what is happening in the company 
even if you are not involved in the daily operations.   
 
You get to know if the company seems to be doing well 
or what the future of the company is because it has just got 
business, a contract for R 28 million.   
 
It means for the next two, three years maybe the 
20 
situation of the company will not be bad.  One would expect 
you to know those things. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, Chair.  JM Aviation, that money did not 
belong to JM Aviation.  It went to Swissport.  Swissport paid 
JM Aviation.  Please pay that company. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 148 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   We did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The R 28 million, not the R 20 million, the 
contract that Ms Hofmeyr refers to, that JM Aviation got a 
contract for R 28 million as I understand the position.   
 
So I am saying, how could you not at least know about 
such a development because I do not understand JM 
Aviation to have been such a big company that R 28 million 
would be like small change, you know?   
 
So I expect that it would be important news that even if 
10 
you are not involve in the day-to-day operations of the 
company, you would get to know that my company got a 
contract from so and so which is worth about R 28 million.  
This is what my company would be doing. 
MR NDZEKU:   It is fair, Chair.  It is right by saying that.  But 
you can councillor explain to me now?  When you say JM 
Aviation, they signed a contract.  Which contract are we 
talking about? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   We are talking about the contract for 
the R 28.5 million that Swissport paid JM Aviation. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   That is the one I am talking about. 
MR NDZEKU:   Swissport paid JM Aviation? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, and then that other... for the 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 149 of 388 
 
consultants.  That is exactly what Peter Kohl says.  Please, 
Chair.  I do not want to say no.  This was Peter Kohl’s call.  I 
am sorry.  I cannot help you there. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   H’m. 
MR NDZEKU:   I am sorry.  I cannot. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   I would like to return to the Chair’s 
concern about such a substantial amount of money coming 
into the business and you having now knowledge about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Mr Ndzeku, do you know what the 
10 
bank balance of JM Aviation was before it received the 
R 28.5 million from Swissport? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I do not know. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   NO.  I will tell you, it was R 1 000,00. 
MR NDZEKU:   It was a R 1 000,00? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Ja.  So the bank balance went from 
R 1 000,00 to R 28.5 million... R28 501 000,00 after the 
Swissport injection of R 28.5 million.  Is that not something 
that came to your attention at all? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, the persons involved in the money, it is 
20 
Jules. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   No, the person involved in the money 
is your daughter is Ms Sokulu.  She is the only person with 
signing powers at the bank.   
MR NDZEKU:   She report actually through to Jules. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 150 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Jules? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   So she never told you:  Father, we 
have now got R 28.5 million in our bank account? 
MR NDZEKU:   Councillor, that money it was not for JM.   
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   H’m.   
MR NDZEKU:   You are... Councillor, say yourself the 
account had exactly R 1 000,00.  And from nowhere it went 
to exactly to 28. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Let me tell you what JM Aviation 
10 
contractually agreed to do for that R 28.5 million, okay? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Because that was set out in the 
detailed service agreement that JM Aviation concluded with 
Swissport South Africa.  It was your daughter, Mr Sokulu who 
signed this agreement, Mr Ndzeku.  Let us talk about what 
JM Aviation committed to do for that R 28.5 million.  Would 
you like me to take you to the docket? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I will be happy.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   The document sets out the services.  
20 
You will find it in Bundle DD26 as we have called it. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And you will find it... sorry, let me just 
find my index Chair if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:   [No audible reply]  
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 151 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Right, it is Item 14 Chair and it 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Under what tab? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   It should be tab 14. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tab 14? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR NDZEKU:   What is the number?  What is...? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tab 14. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   One four. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Number 14? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Tab 14.  Let us first go to tab 14.   
MR NDZEKU:   Ja.  Okay, take me through that.  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And it starts at page 235.  Chair, do 
you have that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I have got it. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Thank you.  And if you go to the 
services, you will find them commencing ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe we... maybe just for the record, we 
confirm that the document at page 235 under tab 14 is a 
20 
service agreement between Swissport South Africa (Pty) 
Limited and JM Aviation South Africa (Pty) Limited.  Am I on 
the right page? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 152 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Thank you so much.  So just to go 
over just to confirm the signatories.  If you go to page 265. 
MR NDZEKU:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Mr Ndzeku, do you have that? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, but I am listening. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   You are listening? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   You are happy to just listen? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you say 265? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes, that is the first of the signature 
pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  That is now under tab 15, né? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   H’m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that right? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Sorry, we were in tab 14 Chair.  So it 
is the last two pages under tab 14. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on one second.  My 265 is under tab 
20 
15. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Oh, sorry.  Yes ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, the last page under two ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   There is an amendment to the 
agreement.  I have given you the wrong page.  Please go to 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 153 of 388 
 
page 263. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay alright.  263. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Mr Ndzeku, I would like you to have it 
in front of you, if you would?  Because you need to confirm a 
signature there. 
MR NDZEKU:   It is page what, 16? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   263. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay number 16? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Under tab 14, one four. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay.  Page what? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   263. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay, this is... it says agreement, okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Under tab 14, page 263. 
MR NDZEKU:   2-6, here.  Yes, I got. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   So there is two signatures on that 
page.  The company is Swissport and I can just read there, 
Peter Kohl appears to be the signatory. 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja, I think 263, hey? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes.  And then you will see under 
service provider, there is a signature and that person signs 
20 
as being duly authorised for and behalf of JM Aviation South 
Africa (Pty) Limited. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Do you recognise that signature? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I do. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 154 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And that is the signature of your 
daughter, Ms Sokulu? 
MR NDZEKU:   Hundred percent, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, it is. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes, it is.  Now let us look at what 
services JM Aviation undertook to give and provide to 
Swissport for the R 28.5 million they earn from this contract. 
MR NDZEKU:   What page?  Page what? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   245, please.   
10 
MR NDZEKU:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   You have it, Mr Ndzeku? 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja, I do. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   You will see Clause 7 there towards 
the bottom, it says undertaking? 
MR NDZEKU:   Undertaking? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes.  And it says the service provider.  
Just for your convenience, that is JM Aviation under this 
agreement.   
“The service provider undertakes to provide the 
20 
following services to the company...” 
 
And the company is Swissport. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   I am going to read quite swiftly.  It 
does not need to be read into the record but just to get a 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 155 of 388 
 
flavour of the services. 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja, ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Right.  JM Aviation is going to...  
“7.1: 
 
restructure 
the 
company’s 
workshops 
throughout South Africa with the aim to improve 
maintenance processes and procedures so as to 
optimise the company’s GSCs support services and 
achieve cost advantages.”   
 
Over the page, it says: 
“This consist of but is not limited to setting up 
10 
professional 
inventory 
control 
systems 
and 
processes, interface inventory control and finance 
department, spare part management with the aim to 
limit GSC downtime and service failures resulting in 
penalties from the company’s customers, valuation of 
all existing inventory and assistance with the sale of 
obsolete and surplus equipment and parts...” 
 
I am going to be briefer now: 
“Complete the valuation of all existing GSC in 
connection with the company’s project to refinance, 
20 
concept materially improve the service ability of the 
existing equipment, establishment of KPI’s based 
maintenance processes, review of existing equipment 
and spare parts procurement processes, providing an

...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry.  Sorry, councillor. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes? 
MR NDZEKU:   This one Chair, I understand but Mr Aires, he 
did actually send... he did send actually... how do you call it?  
He did send his affidavit on this one.  He did explain that.  
He was in charge of this one. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   No, he did not speak to this agreement 
in his affidavit. 
MR NDZEKU:   Do you guys do not have it there? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes.  No, Mr Ndzeku just wait for the 
question. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr is just alerting you to what 
...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   The service provider ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   ...the services that JM Aviation undertook 
to provide to Swissport. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, Swissport. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For the amount of R 28.5 million. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   They were going to do a fleet 
management plan.  They were going to do an introduction of 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 157 of 388 
 
quality insurance and a control concept. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   They were going to enhance 
integration and coordinate between ramp and workshop 
functions.  There was going to be, over the page at 247, 
assistance with the sale of retired equipment to African 
countries or overseas.   
 
Assessment of viable local financing options for new and 
replacement 
GSC 
and 
other 
related 
advisory 
services 
requested by the company. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   What are page are you now, councillor? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   I was at 274.  That is the end of the 
undertakings of the ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   Page 247, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   ...service provider which is JM 
Aviation.  So Swissport says that it concluded this deal with 
JM Aviation because it was to procure all of those detailed 
services and that is why it paid R 28.5 million for.   
 
And your daughter signed as authorised to conclude this 
agreement on behalf of JM Aviation.   
20 
 
Is it still your evidence that you had absolutely no 
knowledge of this agreement at the time? 
MR NDZEKU:   I am saying again.  Jules Aires, he was the 
one who was talking to the CEO of Swissport.  Jules as the 
CEO of JM Aviation and Peter Kohl.   
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 158 of 388 
 
 
They were the ones actually who did this agreement 
because Jules is the one who actually got experience of all 
this, you know.   
 
He did actually say in his affidavit that he and Peter 
Kohl they had a meeting, they busy talking about this.  You 
ask me if I have any knowledge about this?   
 
Maybe Jules did tell me about it and then maybe he did 
not tell me but I remember very well that Jules had a lot of 
meetings with Peter Kohl.   
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Mr Ndzeku, please try and recall.  Did 
10 
Mr Aires tell you about this agreement or not? 
MR NDZEKU:   I cannot hear you? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Did Mr Aires tell you about this 
agreement or not in 2016? 
MR NDZEKU:   What about 2016 there Chair? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Did mister ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   The question is whether Mr Aires did you 
tell about this agreement in 2016? 
MR NDZEKU:   I think he did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   I think so, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And then when Mr Kohl told you to 
take R 20 million of the revenue that was due to JM Aviation 
for this contract and give it to Jammicron, why did you not 
say but the R 28.5 million is for all the services that JM 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 159 of 388 
 
Aviation is going to be providing to your company? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I could not say that because he was 
talking to Jules.  It was the CEO of JM Aviation and 
Swissport.  This is exactly the agreement they had.  I cannot 
reply on that one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did you get to know at that time that 
Swissport 
was 
saying, 
you 
JM 
Aviation 
must 
take 
R 20 million out of the R 28.5 million that it was getting or 
was going to get from Swissport and pay it to somebody 
else?  Did you get to know that at that stage? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Chair, it is very simple.  I was told by Peter 
Kohl. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR NDZEKU:   They are going to pay exactly R 28.5 million 
or R 20 million.  And I said:  Wag ‘n bietjie.  You pay 
Swissport South Africa (Pty) Limited and JM Aviation South 
Africa (Pty) Limited in this account, tax must be paid.   
 
And then the tax arrangement was made.  Now what 
Jules and Peter Kohl talk about, I do not know.  But I think 
what is the councillor is saying here about this agreement 
20 
arrangement.  I think I remember, Jules did tell him about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, he did mention it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   But now the question:  Why did you take the 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 160 of 388 
 
money and you give it to the next...?  That was the 
instruction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was...? 
MR NDZEKU:   The instruction from Peter Kohl. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But it is JM’s money. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   No, it was ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   For services that JM has undertaken to 
provide. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, when they told me, they told me that:  
10 
Please, we want to put this money into your account.  Please 
pay that.  It is exactly what happened Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But are you saying that when the money 
came into JM Aviation, you did not know that money related 
for ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   For the services. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...related to this services? 
MR NDZEKU:   Now, the person now who was dealing, again 
Chair, with the CEO of Swissport, it was Jules.  I did not 
know anything.  But I remember when Peter Kohl says there 
20 
is money to be paid.  That money must be paid.  So as far as 
I know, I did not ask anything because Jules and Peter Kohl 
were busy talking.  Maybe I am saw the wrong things Chair.  
I do not know.   
CHAIRPERSON:    
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 161 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:    
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   But as far as I know, Jules and Peter Kohl 
were the people who actually were doing...busy doing this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Mr Ndzeku, what was Ms van Louw’s 
involvement in the JM Aviation business at this time, March 
of 2016? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, she was also the BEE lady because 
they needed. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   They needed a woman to be a 
director? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  Ja, they needed.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Because she was actually overseas at 
the time.  Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   No, no.  She was not.  She was working here. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   She was working here? 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja, she was not overseas.  She was here. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Who went overseas, which of your 
daughters? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, the people who went overseas, these 
are the people actually was sent by ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   No, no.  I understood that at a point, 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 162 of 388 
 
either Ms Sokulu or Ms Van Louw was overseas. 
MR NDZEKU:   No, no, no. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Am I wrong on that? 
MR NDZEKU:   One of my daughters, she works overseas. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Works overseas? 
MR NDZEKU:   She works there.  She has got nothing to do 
with the... she was never involved in this. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Oh, I see. 
MR NDZEKU:   I am sorry, Chair.  She was never involved on 
this. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   So Ms Van Louw was working in 
another job at the time.  Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Okay.  Was she involved in the day-to-
day running of JM Aviation? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, the same as... no, no, no.  She was 
not.  She was part of the empowerment. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Right.   
MR NDZEKU:   You know. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   So she was there to comprise 65% 
20 
shareholding in the hands of women.  Is that right? 
MR NDZEKU:   At the same when Jules, he is here, they 
always, when she has got time, they call her that she must 
participate because Jules wanted actually to train her that 
she must leave the job and then she must join us.   
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 163 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   So when your daughter, Ms Sokulu 
was 
authorised 
to 
conclude 
to 
this 
agreement, 
the 
R 28.5 million agreement. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Who did she obtain that authorisation 
from? 
MR NDZEKU:   Where did she obtain? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   The authorisation from to conclude 
this agreement?   
MR NDZEKU:   Well, from Mr Aires, Jules.  
10 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And are you aware that the 
requirement under the memorandum of corporation of your 
company is that there must be a majority of directors who 
make decisions in relation to the company? 
MR NDZEKU:   It is very true, councillor.  But if you are the 
majority of the company, you do not have funding, your 
majority means nothing.  It means zero. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   No, it is a different point.  They before 
directors at the time that this agreement was concluded.  It 
was yourself your two daughters and Mr Aires. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Right .  You need a majority in the 
decision-making of the board of directors of your company in 
order to take material decisions on this one.  
MR NDZEKU:   I entirely understand counsellor.  
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 164 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Right.  
MR NDZEKU:   I understand.  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   So I'm asking who authorised Ms 
Sokulu to conclude this agreement?  If you to this point have 
said it was a dealing between Mr Aires and Ms Sokulu, you 
needed another director to authorise this agreement . Who 
was that?  
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry, Chair.  I think it...  Mr Jules is the 
founder and he put money in the company.  the Buck stops 
with him.  He was the one who actually said this must be 
10 
done.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   I understand that by the law you must have 
but it didn't happen. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   It didn't happen?  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Alright.  And you said he put money in 
the company? But money that he put in the company of JM 
Aviation?  
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Who?  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Mr Aires. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I think when he started... they actually 
they put to the board on Swissport Straight to Mozambique 
at the airport.  under the equipment, they were going again 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 165 of 388 
 
to Angola.  He was funding it.  It was SAA.  Swissport, they 
couldn't actually give us without anything which they used to 
pay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And when was that?  
MR NDZEKU:   Must have been about two to three years 
ago.  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Ja. 
MR NDZEKU:   Before actually ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Not...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   Ja. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   It was not at this stage of March of 
2016? 
MR NDZEKU:   Not at... ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Because in March of 2016, there was 
only R 1 000,00 in the bank account. 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja, look it is ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   So I was going to ask you if he 
contributed ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   Actually, the funding... that funding did not 
come to JM Aviation.  It came straight to JM International. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Thank you, Chair.  I know we are at 
the lunch adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
we 
need 
to 
take 
the 
lunch 
adjournment.  We will resume at two o’clock.  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS:   
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 166 of 388 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Ndzeku, we were 
actually still in the part of my questions where I wanted to 
establishes your knowledge and interactions with certain 
people and there is one person I had not got to yet and 
that is Mr Mbuleli Kolisi.  You know Mr Kolisi?  No, you do 
not know him. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Are 
you 
moving 
away 
from 
that 
agreement or you are coming back to it? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, I will return to it momentarily, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So keep it available if I can suggest 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay, alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I just remembered I had forgotten to ask 
about Mr Kolisi. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So I was checking with Mr Ndzeku 
whether he knows Mr Mbuleli Kolisi. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I do not know him. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you know his firm of attorneys, B M 
Kolisi Attorneys? 
MR NDZEKU:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No.  And are you aware whether JM 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 167 of 388 
 
Aviation was ever doing dealings with Mr Kolisi’s attorneys’ 
firm? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I do not know, about my partner 
chose but as far as I know, I do not know him, no.  Eric 
Josi(?) did. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay. 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So what was going on in JM Aviation in 
March of 2016 just before it got this R28.5 million contract 
with Swissport, was it doing other work? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Can you repeat again, counsellor? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   In March 2016. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Was when JM Aviation secured the 
contract with Swissport for 28.5 million. You will recall 
that, right?  And I asked you what other work the business 
was doing at that time. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I do not know, Jules was the one 
actually who was – was talking to the CEO. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Ndzeku, is it – apologies, Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Ndzeku, you do not know what JM 
Aviation was busy with before it got such a big contract? 
MR NDZEKU:   Which contract?  Which contract, Chair, are 
we talking about? 
CHAIRPERSON:   The Swissport contract for 28.5 million.  
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 168 of 388 
 
The question was, before JM Aviation got this contract 
from Swissport for 28.5 million. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What other work was it busy with? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, as I said to counsellor, that JM did 
buy some equipment from Swissport where we sold it to 
Mozambique.  JM also buys some equipment to Swissport, 
we sell it there to Angola.  Those are the dealings that 
Jules was doing with the CEO of Swissport. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But was there any other work not 
10 
involving Swissport that JM Aviation was busy with before 
it got this contract from Swissport? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   How was it earning any income or how – 
what business was it busy with? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, as I said, Chair, JM Aviation – JM 
International Aviation has been 25 years experience with 
aviation.  So now the CEO of JM Aviation is a founder of 
JM South Africa.  Any deal he used to do is to look after 
this small baby of JM Aviation.  Now if you are asking me 
20 
did we do any deal without the one of Angola, without the 
ones, I do not remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is the position that all you know is 
that prior to JM Aviation getting this big contract from 
Swissport, the only work that you know that it was involved 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 169 of 388 
 
in was – did you say selling some equipment to Angola? 
MR NDZEKU:   These African states, yes, where Swissport 
is involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Swissport is in Tanzania, it is in Nairobi, 
we used to do exchange of dollies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   And then that is exactly what Jules was 
doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but all of that was connected with 
10 
Swissport. 
MR NDZEKU:   Swissport and JM International, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   JM International. 
MR NDZEKU:   International, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would the position be that you do not 
know of any other work that JM Aviation South Africa was 
doing, that did not involve Swissport and did not involve 
JM Aviation International. 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not remember, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not know of any? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not know, I do not remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair, I would just like to get 
the timing right here because I had asked previously when 
you 
mentioned 
that 
equipment 
that 
was 
sold 
in 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 170 of 388 
 
Mozambique and Angola, I said can you remember when 
and I understand your evidence, Mr Ndzeku, to be you 
could not remember quite when. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Correct, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I can tell you that it is unlikely to be 
before March 2016 when the Swissport agreement was 
concluded with JM Aviation South Africa because there is 
absolutely nothing happening in the bank accounts of JM 
10 
Aviation 
South 
Africa 
until 
there 
is 
the 
Swissport 
arrangement, do you accept that? 
MR NDZEKU:   I accept, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Mr Kolisi …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, you accept that to have been 
the position for how long prior to the Swissport contract? 
MR NDZEKU:    Well, the counsellor, he talk about 1 000. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   The money was in the account of JM. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Correct. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   And all of a sudden there was 28 million, is 
it not, hey? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is exactly right, Mr Ndzeku.   
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, it is correct, yes.  So …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But the – sorry. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 171 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but what I am asking, she put it to 
you that she understands you to be saying that prior to JM 
Aviation South Africa getting this contract from Swissport 
there was nothing, now work that you know of that JM 
Aviation was doing other than selling some equipment to 
Angola and Mozambique. 
MR NDZEKU:   I think …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   So my question was, how far back do we 
go when you know that to have been the position?  Is that 
as long as you can remember or is that the previous two 
10 
years, the previous one year.  In other words, is the 
position that since it came into contact with Swissport and 
with JM Aviation International, JM Aviation South Africa 
has only done work that is connected with these two 
companies and nothing else, as far as you know? 
MR NDZEKU:   I can say, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is how you understand the position. 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja, I think so, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, I am sorry to belabour the point 
20 
but I do just need to get one point of clarify.  I do not 
understand 
the 
equipment 
sales 
to 
Mozambique 
and 
Angola. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   To have preceded March 2016. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 172 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   They did not happen before March 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Because we would have seen some 
movement in the bank accounts of JM Aviation South 
Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Related to those equipment sales. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And I asked Mr Ndzeku to confirm that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   To clarify. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And I understood him to say he did 
confirm that, is that correct, Mr Ndzeku? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, the equipment was sold to these 
African states, I think it was before 2016. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   If it was before 2016 then it would have 
been JM International during this time, is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, JM International. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, now we are clear, there are 
two entities, right? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  The selling of equipment to what 
you 
referred 
to 
as 
the 
African 
states 
was 
by 
JM 
…[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   JM International. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Aviation International, not South Africa. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 173 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, no, that does clarify things. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You said you did not know Mr Kolisi, Mr 
Ndzeku.  Have you followed in the media that Mr Kolisi was 
found dead in his office at the end of July – well, this year, 
a month ago? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I must just tell you that, counsellor, I 
know, I do not know these things.  You know, there was no 
10 
need for me to know because, you know, I did not have an 
interest on his business, I am not a person actually who 
read about media, you know, I am only looking to things 
concerning me, you know?  If maybe this gentleman who 
died, maybe I had issues with him, I will say yes, yes, yes, 
I know but I did not know anything about it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, I understand and my only question 
was, did you pick that up in the media and I understand 
your evidence to be that you were not aware of it, is that 
right?  If you will say yes? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   The answer is yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, then I would like to more just to 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 174 of 388 
 
an issue of timing.  You see, Mr Ndzeku, you will remember 
there was that meeting on the 10 February 2016 that you 
attended at SAA where the ground handling contract 
between SAA and Swissport was discussed.  You recall 
that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I remember, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  And then what happened – 
and I understand evidence earlier to be you played a 
listening role in that meeting, correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Correct. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You were not part of the negotiations, is 
that correct?  
MR NDZEKU:   Correct, yes. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
But 
you 
did 
have 
conversations 
telephonically with Ms Kwinana on either side of that 
meeting about the empowerment partner for this deal, is 
that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now, Mr Bob Gurr, who mentioned was 
in attendance at that meeting did a minute of the meeting, 
20 
do you remember that? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I do not remember, I did not even see.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Because he …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   And I remember he was standing there, I 
did not even see that, was talking minutes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 175 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   He recorded you in the minutes as 
having played a role in the meeting.  Do you dispute that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I do. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You do. 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   He went so far as to quote what you 
said.  Can I take you to what he quoted you as having 
said? 
MR NDZEKU:   Please, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, we need to go to the bundle of Ms 
10 
Memela’s evidence which I have asked to have available to 
you today and it is in DD25A.  So, Mr Ndzeku, if you look 
behind you, you will see three more files and one of those 
is labelled DD25A.  Would you take that out?  
MR NDZEKU:   Ja, DD25A, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And in that bundle if you will go to page 
309. 
MR NDZEKU:   309. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   309, have you got it? 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is in DD25A, that looks too small to be 
25A.  It is Ms Memela’s evidence and it is page 309.  
Chair, there seems to be a problem with your bundle A 
having reached the hearing.  Could I maybe request that 
we ask use the interpreter’s copy maybe so that you can 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 176 of 388 
 
have it in front of you? 
CHAIRPERSON:   There were about four files that were 
ready to be taken here, what happened, are they – are you 
sure they are not here?  How did that happen?  How could 
that happen?  I do not want – let us have a look. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Just to orientate us and for your benefit, 
Mr Ndzeku, these were the bundles that were admitted into 
evidence when Ms Memela was testifying. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you criticised our investigator Mr 
Kurtland(?) earlier in your evidence for not having followed 
up after his first meeting with you with Mr Kohl and 
…[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   I did not criticise him, it was - I did not 
criticise him, it was not him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on, Mr Ndzeku, let 
counsel finish first. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You criticised him for not having 
followed up with Mr Kohl or Mr Aires. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   About the dealings.  Well, we in fact 
obtained an entire affidavit from Mr Kohl as part of our 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 177 of 388 
 
investigations, it was already presented in Ms Memela’s 
evidence and the document you are looking at is an 
attachment to Mr Kohl’s affidavit and it is a meeting note 
that Mr Bob Gurr put together of that meeting on the 10 
February and the part that I want to draw your attention to 
is over the page at page 310. 
MR NDZEKU:   310, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   This was the meeting at which you were 
– you have now confirmed in your evidence you were in 
attendance.  If you look at the third bullet …[intervenes] 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I just want to – you wanted 
to make the point that you did not criticise him.  Or you – 
no, I just wanted to make sure if you wanted to make that 
point.  You made that point but if you are fine, that is fine.  
MR NDZEKU:   No, I am fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   At page 310, the third bullet from the 
bottom is a bullet that reads: 
“At this stage VN urged PK...” 
I understand that to be Peter Kohl and VN to be yourself 
20 
and he quote you, according to this note. 
“...to get the deal finalised.” 
Do you recall saying that at the meeting? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I do not remember. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Could you have said it? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 178 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Could you have said it? 
MR NDZEKU:   Right? 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, is it possible that you 
said it but you cannot remember? 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not think I did say that, I did not say 
that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So he just made up a quote about what 
your words were at the meeting. 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not know. 
10 
“At this stage VN urged PK to get the deal 
finalised.” 
I did not say that.  I do not remember. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Right, so that happened on 
the 10 February and as I explained to you earlier, what 
meeting concluded with Ms Kwinana telling everyone 
assembled 
that 
SAA 
was 
going 
to 
terminate 
its 
relationship, its existing relationship with Swissport. And 
then things went quiet between Swissport and SAA.  We 
have learnt that from Mr Kohl’s affidavit, right?  But then 
20 
an agreement was struck and an agreement was struck on 
the 15 March 2016, that is the day on which you went and 
witness the ground handling agreement concluded between 
SAA and Swissport. Do you remember that? 
MR NDZEKU:   This is the day me and Peter Kohl and Bob 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 179 of 388 
 
Gurr and Daluxolo, we were – this is the day the deal was 
struck? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, so let me be clear, just to make it 
entirely clarified in everyone’s mind.  There is a meeting 
on the 10 February, that is where we looked at Mr Bob 
Gurr’s meeting notes, right? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:    That is 10 February and as we have the 
evidence 
of 
Mr 
Kohl 
previously 
admitted 
in 
this 
Commission, that ends with Ms Kwinana saying you are not 
10 
willing to sign the agreement you were given to give away 
30% to a nominated BEE company, we are terminating our 
relationship with Swissport.  That is what happened on the 
10 February. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  Then a month later, the 15 
March, just more than a month later, SAA and Swissport 
find each other and they sign the ground handling contract, 
the one that is for five years for more than R1.5 billion and 
that agreement you were a witness to.  Do you recall that? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, maybe I was called?  You know, if 
maybe can – you know, I was called by Peter Kohl as a 
CEO.  Maybe I did went, maybe I did witness, maybe. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You did witness it, you confirmed that in 
your own affidavit before the Commission, so unless you 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 180 of 388 
 
want 
me 
to 
take 
you 
there 
to 
see 
your 
signature 
…[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   No, no, it is fine, counsellor, let us see.    
ADV HOFMEYR:   I do not think it is disputed, right.  So 
what I am trying to get at is the timing. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Because 10 February the deal is off, the 
relationship is terminated.  I said to you earlier did you 
know how important the agreement between Swissport and 
SAA was to Swissport South Africa’s operations and I 
10 
understand your evidence to be yes, it was an important 
contract.  Did I have you correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, first of all I said it was not the only 
client we had and that the Chair explained to me and I said 
yes, it is – it was important. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you know that Swissport South 
Africa faced liquidation if it did not secure an agreement 
with SAA? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I did not know that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You did not know that.  You were a 
20 
director and shareholder of the company and you did not 
know that. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I was not the only director. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, but I am asking about your 
knowledge.  You did not know that they were facing 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 181 of 388 
 
liquidation? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, they did not.  No, no, they did not tell 
me. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then 15 March they find each other.  
So it is that timeframe that I am interested in and what 
happened in the middle …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry, counsellor. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   You know at the meeting between Peter 
Kohl and Bob Gurr there is a commercial lady there, Mary 
10 
Mamabula(?), station manager, and myself as the board of 
director. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Whenever Peter Kohl, he does everything, 
he used to take Bob Gurr and this lady.  He – they never 
been worried, these are the people.  I remember very well 
Mary, She was all the time there because she is station 
manager, she knows exactly what is happening on the 
ground.  Whenever board meeting, Mary Mamabula, she 
must give the – you know, the report to the board. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Between those two dates, 
the 10 February and the 15 March, it is on the 2 March that 
Swissport concludes that service level agreement with JM 
Aviation. 
MR NDZEKU:   Can I put this one now? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 182 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You can, thank you, Mr Ndzeku. 
MR NDZEKU:   Thank you very much.  Yes, I am listening. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  So it is between 10 February and 
15 March that Swissport and JM Aviation conclude that 
service level agreement that we looked at earlier to 
basically rework their entire GSC workshop.  Do you recall 
that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, Jules was involved.  Jules – I do not 
recall because Jules and Peter Kohl… 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   They were people actually were talking 
about the GSC. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But you do remember one very specific 
aspect of it which was Mr Kohl’s instruction to you that R20 
million of the money that JM Aviation had received must be 
paid to Jamicron, is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Hundred percent, I did.  The reason why it 
was about the issue of SARS, I did not want to find 
ourselves we have got a problem with SARS where money 
does not belong to us. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, SARS is a separate matter, I just 
want to talk about the JM Aviation payment to Jamicron.  
When Mr Kohl contacted you and said you must pay the 20 
million to Jamicron, what explanation did he give you for 
making that payment? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 183 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   When Daluxolo came to Swissport as an 
empowerment of 30% they wanted actually to do a 
business with Swissport and it was not Daluxolo alone, 
there were a few people that were there, so now after 
Peter Kohl introduced me to Daluxolo, it is actually – I 
think Daluxolo, the company is Jamicron, this is exactly 
where they decided that my daughter must be part of it.   
Now the question, did he explain to me what is this money 
for? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, I am asking what he told you when 
10 
he gave you the instruction. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, what – why did you say 
you needed to pay that money to …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Jamicron. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR NDZEKU:   Swissport, the way he was explaining to 
me, Swissport, they were supposed to buy the buses. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was supposed to? 
MR NDZEKU:   The bus in the terminal there, the bus 
taking people around. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
MR NDZEKU:   They will have to do that deal with 
empowerment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m. 
MR NDZEKU:   So now if they are not doing that deal with 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 184 of 388 
 
empowerment, they are not going to get a good price.  So 
Daluxolo was there as an empowerment who can actually 
assist Peter Kohl.  It is exactly what I was told, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see, what troubles me about that is 
Jamicron did not end up being part of the ground handling 
contract that was concluded. 
MR NDZEKU:   What are you saying now, counsellor? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You told me that – you told the Chair a 
moment ago that the reason that Mr Kohl gave you for 
paying R20 million to Jamicron is that Jamicron was going 
10 
to help with the buses that they needed to purchase for the 
ground handling contract that had been concluded, is that 
correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  Counsellor, first of all, when Jamicron came 
on board it was the issue of 30%.  They were talking that 
they want to be part of Swissport and for 30% and then 
same time they are prepared to help Swissport with any, 
any actually inventory which is they want to buy as an 
empowerment.  So Peter Kohl says this is exactly the right 
group which is we can work with and there was also 
20 
another group. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but counsel’s question to you is if 
this group, this company …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   Jamicron? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, was going to be an empowerment 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 185 of 388 
 
partner for Swissport how come they never became an 
empowerment partner or even for Swissport even after this 
amount of money that you were instructed to pay to them? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, Chair, as I said before, the BO(?) 
Swissport they refused, they said they cannot have them 
on board. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, it can be. 
MR NDZEKU:   They can be part of the bus, they can bring 
another business but they cannot be part of Swissport, that 
is why they decided to have their own company.  Not 
10 
Swissport because they wanted to be part of Swissport and 
then Swissport guys they said no, thank you, we cannot.  
Bring your company. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that what the position was before the 
instruction to pay money to them?   
MR NDZEKU:   That was the position because before the 
money was paid to them they wanted 30% of Swissport, it 
is exactly what I was told. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And Swissport said no. 
MR NDZEKU:   They said no, they cannot.  They must have 
20 
their own company which is this exactly, was Jamicron. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So when Swissport said JM Aviation 
must pay them the 20 million was it, at least on your 
understanding, on the basis that they would have their own 
separate company? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 186 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   On my understanding, yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   .Yes, but in response to the 30% set 
aside arrangement that had been refused by Swissport, is 
that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, the problem with that, Mr Ndzeku, 
is 
that 
Jamicron 
plays 
no 
role 
at 
all, 
it 
is 
not 
a 
subcontractor, it is not a contracting party under the 
ground handling agreement that the whole debate about 
10 
the 30% set aside was focused on. 
MR NDZEKU:   Is that your view, counsellor, or maybe – I 
do not know, because why did Peter Kohl, as a CEO of 
company had a meeting with this guy and then pay them 
that money if …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is exactly the question. 
MR NDZEKU:   If they did not actually give him the 
service? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is exactly the question. 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And it is a question that we put to Mr 
Daluxolo Peter.   
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Who has provided an affidavit to this 
Commission.   
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 187 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And his explanation is that Mr Kohl had 
– Mr Kohl did not instruct the 20 million to be paid to 
Jamicron.  Mr Peter’s version before this Commission – 
and Chair, I will take you there in a moment but if I could 
just 
summarise, 
is 
that 
you, 
Mr 
Ndzeku, 
were 
the 
mastermind behind this entire arrangement, that you put 
Jamicron together, that you put your daughter in there with 
Mr Peter and that you facilitated the R20 million payment.  
Is Mr Peter lying? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I will be happy if maybe I was part of 
that because when Daluxolo was getting the money I told 
him, I said please do not forget me, you must also give me 
something. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Which is a – he just disappear. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   So now how can I be a mastermind of 
something which I am not getting anything. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ja, you did get something, you got R2.5 
20 
million, Mr Ndzeku. 
MR NDZEKU:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Would you like me to take you to the 
bank statements that show you got R2.5 million? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes please. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 188 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Out of the R28.5 million that Swissport 
paid you. 
MR NDZEKU:   Paid me for this deal? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  Right. 
MR NDZEKU:   Did they pay me on this – the issue of 
Daluxolo or it was separate? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Ndzeku, I will take you there in a 
moment, but I understand your evidence to be, you did 
have a conversation with Mr Peter in which you said you 
would like to get a cut of the deal, correct? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   No, no, when I paid him, I said please, do 
not forget me.  I told him, it was the truth.  He as paid and 
I give him the money, I said please, Mshegasi(?), please 
remember me.  And he disappeared. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Which meant that you wanted a part of 
that money? 
MR NDZEKU:   That is the truth because I did not 
understand why I must give him the money and then 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you get nothing. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Me, I am just a carrier, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR NDZEKU:   I said, my friend, it does not work like that 
because I am not getting anything from Swissport, you are 
telling me that I must pay you and Daluxolo said I will see 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 189 of 388 
 
you.  He was gone. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I did not understand the – I did not hear 
the word that you used there, I understood you to be 
saying you are just somebody through who money is 
passed, a carrier. 
CHAIRPERSON:   A carrier, he said he is a carrier. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You are just a carrier, right? 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you said to him how can I just be a 
10 
carrier, I must get something out of this deal, correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   That is what I told him. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, so why were you …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   After was paid, he got the money, 
Swissport said pay and I pay and after that I say is 
everything okay?  He says thank you very much.  I say 
listen, please, do not forget me.  And he started to tell me 
about – I do not know, there was a cop, I do not what cop 
saying, I forgot, I just decided to leave him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But he forgot you? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   He decided to tell me about another police, 
there was a chief of police was involved and then he was 
gone. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And if you were just a carrier, Mr 
Ndzeku, why were you worried about VAT liability to 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 190 of 388 
 
SARS? 
MR NDZEKU:   Why what? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Why were you worried about VAT liability 
to SARS? 
MR NDZEKU:   But it is normal, if you are doing business, 
at the end of the day and then this is exactly what Jules 
says, you must pay VAT, you must pay SARS. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did Jules say it or did you say that you 
must pay SARS? 
MR NDZEKU:   Jules is a South African, counsellor, he 
10 
knows the laws and the rules of South Africa.  So he is the 
man who is in charge of JM.  He always said please, 
everybody does things, let us do things by the book.  I 
believe him, I think that he is a good man. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You do not pay VAT when you are just a 
carrier for money.  Are you aware of that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, what I said – no, no, no, no, 
counsellor, please.  When this money was paid in my 
account I told them, the CEO.  I say CEO, please, let us 
make a point that the SARS is paid.  That is it.  So other 
20 
issues, I do not know, I do not remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why did Swissport not pay them 
directly?  Why did they have to pay money to you, to your 
account? 
MR NDZEKU:   It is a good question, that is exactly what I 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 191 of 388 
 
asked Peter.  Peter says we do not know them, they know 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He said? 
MR NDZEKU:   He says we do not know these people we 
know you, that is why we want your daughter to part of 
Jamicron..  My daughter never even knew anything about 
Peter or maybe about Jamicron.  Peter suggested that she 
must be part of that because …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you were not going to be – you were 
going to have nothing to do with their partnership with 
10 
Swissport, is it not, as JM Aviation, it was a matter 
between the two of them, was it not?  
MR NDZEKU:   Peter suggested that she must be part of 
that because ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But you were not going to be – you were 
going to have nothing to do with their partnership with 
Swissport isn’t it, as JM Aviation?  It was a matter between 
the two of them was it not? 
MR NDZEKU:   Chair, they put up a good picture, when 
Swissport was in the corner, buying busses, they said we 
20 
can do this and this and this, JM can do this and this and 
this so when Peter Cole, as the CEO of the company was 
convinced, I didn’t say anything, I just wanted to see that 
at least the job is done. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Ndzeku, I put it to you that this is a 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 192 of 388 
 
completely improbable story that you are now telling this 
Commission.  You are saying to this Commission that Mr 
Cole said to you that you must pay Jamicron R20million 
because they don’t know Jamicron, is that your evidence?  
MR NDZEKU:   Well I don’t know counsellor, what do you 
want me to say because…[intervenes]. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   If that is your evidence…[intervenes]. 
MR NDZEKU:   Counsellor, first of all, that R20milllion was 
not my money it was Swissport’s money…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why are you accepting it, why is 
10 
Swissport not paying the people they want to pay?  Do you 
know these people yourself? 
MR NDZEKU:   Chair, I know Peter Cole, I know company 
they asked me, they said, we must do this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you didn’t know Mr Peter, well did 
you? 
MR NDZEKU:   No but Peter Cole told me that there’s this 
thing we’ll be doing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No…[African language]  You didn’t know 
him very well, did you? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I didn’t know him very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So why didn’t you say to Swissport, but I 
also don’t know them, pay them directly? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well they asked me to do, which is, I did it 
Chair maybe it was my mistake, it was done. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 193 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see Mr Peter ’s version – Mr 
Daluxolo Peter ’s version, Mr Ndzeku is that, as I said, you 
were the master mind behind all of this and once he 
received the R20million into his Jamicron bank account you 
told him what to do with the R20million, do you deny that? 
MR NDZEKU:  I do deny it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   He says, you told him, over three days 
to withdraw R500 000 in cash so that he could meet with 
Mr Kolisi, the Mr Kolisi whom you’ve said previously in 
your evidence, you did not know, and hand over tranches 
10 
of R500 000 totalling R5million, is he lying when he gives 
that evidence in an affidavit before the Commission? 
MR 
NDZEKU: 
 
 
Well, 
counsellor 
in 
front 
of 
the 
Commissioner I’ll be happy if he says, I asked him to draw 
R500 000 to give it to me, not to Kolisi because I don’t 
even know that other gentleman. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right. 
MR NDZEKU:   Why should I control R20million is in his 
account, I don’t have the power? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, and…[intervenes].  
20 
MR NDZEKU:   But when he got that money, I told him, I 
said please don’t forget me.  Now, people he paid on the 
way, I know nothing about it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you wanted to get something out of 
it…[intervenes]. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 194 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Of course, Chair, I told him, I said, my 
friend, don’t forget me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Because I was a carrier, Chair, this is the 
truth, this is exactly what happened, I don’t want to change 
the words [African language] please I’m a carrier, don’t 
forget me, and he was gone.  So how can I be a 
mastermind of money that doesn’t belong to me? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And your version is, you didn’t get 
anything out of this deal, is that correct? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   That’s exactly what I’m saying. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And he also, in fairness, I must put it to 
you, he says, he took R5million for himself of the 
R20million, does that…[intervenes]. 
MR NDZEKU:   He took R5million for himself. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
Does 
that 
accord 
with 
your 
understanding? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I don’t know it’s the first time I’m 
20 
hearing it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then R10million, he was instructed 
by you to pay to BM Kolisi Attorneys, do you deny that? 
MR NDZEKU:   I deny that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Deny that, and you deny the remaining 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 195 of 388 
 
R5million that was withdrawn in cash and handed over to 
Mr Kolisi’s representatives over three days…[intervenes]. 
MR NDZEKU:   I deny it 100% counsellor. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you got no money out of that money 
from Swissport, correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Nothing. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, let’s go to the bank statements, if 
we may and you will find them in your bundle which we’ve 
numbered DD26. 
MR NDZEKU:   DD26? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I’m here DD26 yes, is it 219 or what? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you will find it, let me tell you, Chair 
we may have to enter another Exhibit, if I haven’t got there 
yet.  Yes, you’ll find it under tab 9 and its page 45 we 
might actually start at page 44, do you have that Mr 
Ndzeku? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I’ve got 44 yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  That is the bank records of 
20 
JM Aviation South Africa at First National Bank, do you see 
that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I do. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And if you go over the page to page 45, 
you’ll see where I got my point, earlier, from.  You’ll see 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 196 of 388 
 
that this starts, this bank record starts on the 22 n d of 
March, right? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And that’s 2016, Chair, just for your 
benefit and you’ll see the opening account had R1000 in it, 
that’s the point I made earlier about there being R1000 in 
the account before you got the payment.  You’ll see the 
third line down, there, is a payment on the 23 r d of March if 
you go across to description, you’ll see Swissport, do you 
see that, fourth line down? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   All the way down? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, so there’s three entries on the 22 n d 
of March and then there’s the first entry on the 23 r d of 
March, that’s the fourth line, do you have that? 
MR NDZEKU:   The fourth line is R28 500 000. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, exactly now if you go to the left of 
that you’ll see under the description it says Swissport, do 
you see that? 
MR NDZEKU:   I can see Jamicron…[intervenes]. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No just above Jamicron…[intervenes]. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I see it twenty eight, Swissport yes I 
can see it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes okay, sorry, so now we’re on the 
same page, Chair have you found the fourth line? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 197 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Super, so you’ll see, 22 n d of March 
there’s R1000 – sorry there do seem to be two other 
credits I missed of R200 and R200 – sorry those were 
debits, so R1000 then they took R200 out and R200 out on 
the 22 n d so the balance was R600 and then on the 23 r d of 
March, Swissport pays the R28.5million into JM Aviation’s 
account, do you see that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Swissport, yes Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes and then the next line is the 
R20million that gets paid out to Jamicron, do you see that? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes I can see that Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, and then the next line says BM 
Kolisi, do you see that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I can see that, B Kolisi yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That’s the BM Kolisi whom you don’t 
know and whom JM Aviation had no dealings with, correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then there’s a line after that, that 
says agreement 2316…[intervenes]. 
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry counsellor, this thing of B Kolisi 
20 
where does it come from, does it come from JM or does it 
come from Swissport? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, so what happens, let me just 
explain.  The Swissport money comes in on the 23 r d of 
March, 
that’s 
where 
you 
see 
R28.5million 
– 
that’s 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 198 of 388 
 
R28million…[intervenes]. 
MR NDZEKU:   No, no I can see that, sorry Chair, I can 
see that yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, I just want to make clear that’s a 
credit, okay…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, it’s money coming in. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now, what you see after that is the 
money that goes out of the account.  So, the first bit of 
money that goes out of the account is the R20million that 
went to Jamicron, do you see that? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   I do see that yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay that’s the one that you and Mr 
Peter have a dispute about, why it was paid to Jamicron. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The next one is R2.5million, of the 
R28.5million received from Swissport is on the same day 
paid to BM Kolisi, do you see that? 
MR NDZEKU:   I can see that, now my question, where it 
was coming from, Swissport or from JM? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No it’s the Swissport – so Swissport 
20 
comes in, it’s the JM Aviation bank account and JM 
Aviation pays it out to BM Kolisi, okay, the BM Kolisi with 
whom you have no dealings at all and then there’s another 
payment out, do you see that, it’s called agreement 2316? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, of 2.5, yes I see that? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 199 of 388 
 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
Yes, 
and 
that’s 
an 
amount 
of 
R2.5million, correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   A hundred percent yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you know who that was paid to? 
MR NDZEKU:   This agreement? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, who was it paid to? 
MR NDZEKU:   I don’t know. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It was paid to you Mr Ndzeku. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   This 2.5? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ja. 
MR NDZEKU:   What was paid for, it was not paid to JM, it 
was paid to me? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay that’s good, I’m happy, it’s good if I 
did get some money, Swissport gave me some money. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, your evidence earlier was that you 
got nothing. 
MR NDZEKU:   No, no but it’s fine, if then you’re saying 
20 
they paid me that 2.5, I don’t understand, what was that 
money for? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I don’t either, could you enlighten us? 
CHAIRPERSON:   This is money from your company to you 
ADV HOFMEYR:   After they received the Swissport 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 200 of 388 
 
R28.5million. 
MR NDZEKU:   No, Chair, this company never gave me 
R2.5million, JM never gave me that money, maybe this 
money stayed with JM. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, no it went into your bank account, 
Mr Ndzeku. 
MR NDZEKU:   Do we have it here. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, we do, would you like me to take 
you to it? 
MR NDZEKU:   Please, yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you actually have no recollection, Mr 
Ndzeku, of receiving R2.5million on the 23 r d of March 
2016, as you sit here today? 
MR NDZEKU:   I must tell you that I was thinking that this 
money for the company. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   What was the money for the company? 
MR NDZEKU:   Maybe this R2.5million was for JM, I didn’t 
know that it was mine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And – no, but Mr Ndzeku, if the money – 
if an amount of R2.5million was transferred or deposited 
20 
into your account, is there any chance you would not know 
about that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, Chair, I’ll have to know about it, it’s a 
long time, in my mind I was also thinking that this money 
was for the company. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 201 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, is…[intervenes]. 
MR NDZEKU:   Now the counsellor says, no this money 
came to my account. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, is R2.5million small change for 
you? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, Chair, it’s a lot of money. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So – it’s a lot of money, so how could 
you forget if that amount came in to your account? 
MR NDZEKU:   But okay, let’s agree now that it did 
because when was it, what year was this again counsellor? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   2016, March but counsel was going to 
take you to, I think, your bank statement, ja to show this 
R2.5million went into your account. 
MR NDZEKU:   If you can take me to my bank statement. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, it’s just about the credibility of your 
evidence, Mr Ndzeku and in fairness, I must put it to you, 
because for the entire period prior to this point in your 
evidence, you have clearly said you did not receive any 
payment associated with this…[intervenes]. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well I did say that, it’s true. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You did. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I did. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And the facts are, as they’re presented 
to you now, you received as much as R2.5million.  So, your 
evidence earlier was false, do you accept that? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 202 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   It was not false, I think maybe, I didn’t 
remember. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, that is not your evidence, Mr Ndzeku 
you were clear, you did not say, I don’t remember. 
MR 
NDZEKU: 
 
 
Don’t 
force 
me 
that 
I 
must 
say…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let’s go to it. 
MR NDZEKU:   I’m saying to you, I don’t remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let’s go to his bank account, or his 
statement. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, what number was it? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is item 10, Chair, so you’ll find it 
under tab 10, it’s the bank statement of Mr Ndzeku for 
March 2016. 
MR NDZEKU:   What is it…[intervenes]. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Under tab 10, and you’ll find it 
commences at page 198. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay let’s go back, I don’t see 10 here, I 
can see, only 9 – oh here’s 10, right at the back, okay we 
are here. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is money on call account of yours, 
Mr Ndzeku and it’s a bank statement for the period 31 
December 2015 to 31 March 2016, do you see that. 
MR NDZEKU:   Let’s see now, is it the first page? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, you’ll find the payment – I’m just 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 203 of 388 
 
explaining to you the period that the statement covers, it 
covers from the end of 2015 till the end of March 2016 and 
if you go over the page to page 199…[intervenes]. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I’m at page 199 yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You’ll see – and I do just want to spend 
a moment at page 198 because it relates to a point that the 
Chair made earlier.  The money in this account is always 
sitting somewhere below R500 000 it drops down, at a 
point, right down to R31 000 and then just before you get 
the R2.5million payment, it’s at about R150 000 and then 
10 
you get – midway down, if you go to the date of the 23 r d of 
March, if you look on the left-hand side there’s a column 
with the dates, on page 199. 
MR NDZEKU:   I can see that – I can see that R2.5million 
here. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It has the same reference that we looked 
at in the JM Aviation bank account, agreement 2316 and 
you’ll see your account was credited with R2.5million. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I can see that yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Is your evidence that you didn’t know 
20 
about that at the time, is that right? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, maybe let’s start with this, do you 
now accept that there was an amount of R2.5million that 
was paid by JM Aviation into your account, do you now 
accept that? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 204 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR NDZEKU:   I do but Chair, I was thinking this money is 
going to the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
MR NDZEKU:   I was thinking this money was going to the 
company. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It’s going to the company? 
MR NDZEKU:   To JM Aviation company.  Now JM Aviation 
is paying me. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Now JM Aviation is paying me this money to 
my account. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   So, that’s exactly what happened, I don’t 
know how. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Why were you paid R2.5million? 
MR NDZEKU:   Why I was paid? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why did JM pay you that amount? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, maybe it was an agreement between 
20 
myself and JM because this R2.5million, by the way, if it 
was paid to me as I remember, it was myself – between 
myself and Jules. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What do you remember? 
MR NDZEKU:   I said, Chair, if this R2.5million was paid as 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 205 of 388 
 
it’s here, I did actually declare it to my partner, Jules, 
because where does this money come from its coming from 
Swissport, it’s coming also from JM Aviation which is – we 
are both partners.  So, now, what was this money for, I can 
see that it says it was agreement, agreement for what, I 
don’t remember.  It is a lot of money, as you said Chair, I 
can’t say it was small money it is but it was 2016, it was 
long time. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Ndzeku, your evidence a moment ago 
was that you were not aware of the payment until we 
10 
showed it to you, do you remember that? 
MR NDZEKU:   What did I say? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You said you were not aware of the 
payment until we showed it…[intervenes]. 
MR NDZEKU:   I said I don’t remember yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Then you said, a moment ago, that at 
the time you would have declared it to Mr Aires, how can 
you declare a payment that you weren’t aware of? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I said, if maybe, I was paid this 
money by JM, which is Aires supposed to know about it, 
20 
you know, there’s nothing – my daughter Khosi can do 
things without JM, let’s agree that this money was paid into 
my account, the R2.5million which it – it’s a long time, I 
know that it’s a lot of money, I don’t know what was 
…[indistinct 
47.08] 
I 
don’t 
know 
exactly 
…[indistinct 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 206 of 388 
 
47.09]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Ndzeku, you have accepted 
now that JM paid an amount of R2.5million into your 
account…[intervenes]. 
MR NDZEKU:   It is there in the account, Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And as I understand the position, you 
also accept that, that money came from the money that 
Swissport had paid into JM, is that correct. 
MR NDZEKU:   That’s exactly what’s happening, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you have accepted, also that for 
10 
you this was not small change, this was a lot of money. 
MR NDZEKU:   It was a lot of money, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you became aware – did you 
become aware of this amount around the time that it was 
paid into your account? 
MR NDZEKU:   You know Chair, to be honest, I didn’t even 
– I was a little bit busy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmm? 
MR NDZEKU:   I was just – I was too busy Chair, I didn’t 
…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you saying you did not become 
aware roundabout the time when this amount came into 
your account, that such a lot of money…[intervenes]. 
MR NDZEKU:  I don’t remember Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t remember whether you 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 207 of 388 
 
became aware? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I don’t. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you know, whether, at any stage after 
it had come into your account, between then and today, are 
you able to say whether you have ever become aware of 
that amount having come in to your account? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I must say that from today as the 
counsellor is reminding me, is telling me what exactly 
happened, you know, I start to understand this money 
came to my account. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So are you saying that, from that time, 
March 2016 when this money came into your account up to 
today, until counsel talked about it, you were not aware 
that your company had paid you – had paid R2.5million into 
your account? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, you know Chair, to be honest and I 
said I did not I was not aware which is – it is true, what 
exactly have I done from that R2.5million where did it go?  
So, let me agree and say, counsellor it was in my account 
as you are showing me, it’s there. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but are you saying between that 
date in March when this amount was paid into your account 
and today, you were not aware that your company paid 
R2.5million into your account?  
MR NDZEKU:   I can say that Chair. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 208 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were not aware? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You only became aware now, is that 
right? 
MR NDZEKU:   I think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And your partner never told you that the 
company had paid R2.5million into your account, Mr Aires? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, he didn’t tell me but the only he told 
me, it was the money we were supposed to pay for the 
other equipment from another company…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, the short answer is that Mr Aires did 
not tell you that the company paid you? 
MR NDZEKU:   Chair, I’m sorry, I don’t remember, I don’t 
want to put myself in a corner where I find …[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, you don’t remember whether he told 
you or not?  
MR NDZEKU:   I don’t remember yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did your daughter never tell you that the 
company had paid R2.5million into your account? 
MR NDZEKU:   I can’t remember Chair.  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t remember, is it possible that 
they told you but you have forgotten? 
MR NDZEKU:   Maybe Chair, maybe they told me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and throughout this period you 
checked your balances in your account, have you been 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 209 of 388 
 
checking your balance? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And still you didn’t see that there was 
such a lot of money that came into your account? 
MR NDZEKU:   But, Chair, it was 2016 or when was it? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   March 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was 2016, yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   2016, well I do, but it keeps on going down 
because…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja but…[intervenes]. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Swissport, the also pay me sometimes, the 
dividend you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But after it came in, the balance in your 
account that you had for quite some time, after that, was 
very different from the balance that you had, had before 
this money came in, isn’t it? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Therefore, if you didn’t know about this 
money having come in you would have said, but why do I 
have such a big balance and you would have wanted to 
20 
find out, isn’t it? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, didn’t you do that?  
MR NDZEKU:    No, I didn’t do it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you saw that the balance was big? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 210 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   The only time I remember the balance was 
big, it was the R20million the money I paid to that 
gentleman and when I say…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the R20million was not in your 
account, was it? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, it was in the JM account. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I’m talking about your account. 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, you saw there was a big balance in 
your statement but you didn’t ask anybody about it? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   I must tell you that I don’t remember very 
well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but what is it that you don’t 
remember, is it that you didn’t see – you don’t remember 
you saw that there was a big balance in your account or 
what you don’t remember is, whether you asked anybody 
after you saw the big balance? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well I did not remember asking anybody 
about the amount of money. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   And then I think the money was in my 
account and then that’s it, I think I spoke to my partner 
about it, if I remember very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You spoke to him? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I think so, I don’t remember Chair 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 211 of 388 
 
because it was long time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you would agree with me, would you 
not, that if, in your, if you look at your bank statement and 
you see a very big amount, compared to what you expect. 
MR NDZEKU:   Expect yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You’d want to find out where does this 
money come from. 
MR NDZEKU:   Hundred percent Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You wouldn’t just keep quiet about it. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you must have asked Mr Aires about 
it and he must have told you something? 
MR NDZEKU:   If I remember, Chair, I don’t remember 
discussing with him, to be honest, I don’t…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But that would be strange, wouldn’t you 
agree with me, that somebody sees…[intervenes]. 
MR NDZEKU:   It is very strange, it is very strange, it’s 
exactly what happened, yes.  Maybe we did discuss it but I 
don’t remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That you would look at your bank 
20 
statement and see that suddenly you have a large amount 
of money, you don’t even – you don’t want to find out 
where it came from but you do use it because you used it, 
did you not? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, Chair, I must tell you that I trust Mr 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 212 of 388 
 
Aires very much, he’s a good man and I think maybe we did 
discuss it? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Huh? 
MR NDZEKU:   Maybe we did discuss about…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you don’t know. 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja I don’t know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Ms Hofmeyr? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Ndzeku, I’d like you to go back to 
that page of the JM Aviation bank statement, where we saw 
the R28.5million come in, you’ll find that in Bundle DD26 
10 
and you’ll find it at page 45. 
MR NDZEKU:   What was it – it was 10 hey? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, it was under tab 9, under tab 9 and 
if you go to page 45. 
MR NDZEKU:   Page 45 hey? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, you’ll recall that we looked at those 
varied payments out of the JM Aviation account after the 
money was receive from Swissport.  There was the 
Jamicron one first, the R20million and then there was 
another R2.5million paid to BM Kolisi, do you have that in 
20 
front of you? 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja I can see that. 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, that’s the BM Kolisi that you said 
JM Aviation had no dealings with at the time, correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 213 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, so despite no dealings at all, JM 
Aviation paid R2.5million to BM Kolisi, and it has a 
reference there, Pete 0000.1/16, do you see that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Is it…[intervenes]. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It’s under…[intervenes]. 
MR NDZEKU:   It’s under 2.5? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No next to 2.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Under the heading, opening account. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Can you see opening account in the top 
line? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then you go down. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I can see that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you see, written there – let me just 
explain to you what that column is.  That’s the column 
where a description is given to an account by the person 
who’s doing the payment. 
MR NDZEKU:   Payment ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay, so you’ll see when Jamicron was 
paid the description was JM Aviation South Africa, do you 
see that, that’s the description.  If you take Jamicron and 
20 
you go to the right of Jamicron. 
MR NDZEKU:   It says Jamicron it was 20 an then it was 
…[intervenes]. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, but between those two there’s a 
description Mr Ndzeku, I’m looking at the description. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 214 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja I can see that…[intervenes]. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay, you got that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja Peter. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes good, okay, you said Peter, right, 
what’s actually written here is Pete 0000.1/16. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Peter, do you think it was supposed to 
refer to Peter? 
MR NDZEKU:   It was what? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Was it supposed to refer to Peter, 
10 
because it just says Pete there? 
MR NDZEKU:   I can see it’s Pete ja, I don’t know whether 
it’s Peter. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, it might be Peter. 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja but there it’s written – no it’s written 
Pete. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Correct. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you know what that payment was for? 
MR NDZEKU:   Where it’s coming from, it’s coming from 
20 
BM Kolisi. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, it’s a separate payment that JM 
Aviation made to Pete – sorry, sorry the payment that – I 
do apologise, I myself got confused to BM Kolisi but the 
reference on it, the way its described is Pete.  It’s coming 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 215 of 388 
 
from JM Aviation pays BM Kolisi R2.5million, you see that? 
MR NDZEKU:   This Pete, does it come from Peter Cole or 
what? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well that’s what I’m interested in your 
help with, do you know what that refers to? 
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry counsellor, I really don’t know how to 
tell you on this one. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Can you help me with the representative 
from SAA who was at the meeting on the 10 t h of February 
2016, the Head of Procurement at the time at SAA, do you 
10 
remember his name? 
MR NDZEKU:   The gentleman who was there? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Hmm. 
MR NDZEKU:   I think it was another big guy, Peter 
Lester…[intervenes]. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Lester Peter yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Could that have been referring to him? 
MR NDZEKU:   I don’t know counsellor, I don’t know, why 
should JM Aviation pay him? 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That’s my question for you, Mr Ndzeku, 
why would JM Aviation be paying Lester Peter? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can tell us because you – JM 
Aviation is your company. 
MR NDZEKU:   Chair it’s – this is music to me, I must tell 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 216 of 388 
 
you that when it comes to the finance people who work at 
SAAT, the person had long relationship with these people, 
it was Mr Aires, and if maybe they decided to pay out of JM 
Aviation, that gentleman, you know, I don’t know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, people in your company pay a lot of 
people millions of rands and you don’t know anything about 
it? 
MR NDZEKU:  No, no Chair, in the company the person 
who’s in charge of the finance, and like I said, this 
company it was a small company as the counsel had said, 
10 
this account had exactly R1000 when we opened it.  From 
nowhere it exactly ran about at 2.8, roundabout 28million.   
Mr Aires he was in charge. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But the fact that it is a small company and 
not a big company supports the proposition that you ought to 
know.  If you are dealing with a big company and there are 
many 
directors, 
shareholders, 
there 
are 
thousands 
of 
employees as an individual you might not find it easy to 
know a lot of things because the company is big. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it is small. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is much more easier to know what is 
going on. 
MR NDZEKU:  Well it is much more easier to know when – 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 217 of 388 
 
when you are involved on the finance also in the marketing.  
I was not involved. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But can people in a company – in your 
company be paying monies out and you do not – millions and 
you do not anything. 
MR NDZEKU:  Chair – Chair I am sorry to disappoint you.  
Jules Aires is the founder of this company.  He was in charge 
while doing the marketing.  He is the one actually who did 
everything.  That is the bottom line.  That is all I can say. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But – but I am afraid Mr Ndzeku if what 
10 
you seem to convey to me about what you knew about your 
company. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  JM Aviation is true namely you knew very 
little.  Because that is what you are telling me. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes very true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then I am afraid if that is true the position 
must be that Mr Aires and whoever could just so to speak 
steal this company away from you.  Or you could wake up 
one morning and find that there is no money.  All the money 
20 
has been taken out and you do not know about it. 
MR NDZEKU:  Well I cannot say that he can steal the 
company away from me because he invested in the company 
and then he was actually the one who was bring business in 
the company. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 218 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you could easily find that you have 
nothing left out of the company because you – you were not 
paying attention. 
MR NDZEKU:  Chair it is the truth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were not paying attention if your 
version is correct that you knew so little.  You are not paying 
attention to anything.  You are leaving everything to him.  He 
could pay people millions of Rands and you left everything to 
him.  You do not even seem to have been interested to say, 
why is this money – why is so and so being paid this money?  
10 
You are just leaving things to him. 
MR NDZEKU:  Chair it is the truth.  First of all the founder – 
the founder of JM Aviation their purpose of JM Aviation 
South Africa it was to deal with airlines.  He has got – he has 
got 25 years’ experience on that side.  I do not have.  So 
now he invested money and he says can you please give me 
a chance let me run with that.  So I did.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Ndzeku you will remember it is only Ms 
Sokhulu your daughter who can authorise these payments. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  So this is not all Mr Aires.  Your 
daughter Ms Sokhulu authorised the payment of R2.5 million 
to BM Kolisi with the reference Pete. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 219 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  00001/16. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Did she ever speak to you about why she 
was making that payment? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well she – I do not remember.  I do not recall 
talking about that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Hm.  And she was not involved in the 
business at all was she?  She did not want to be involved.  
She was busy studying as I understood your evidence, 
correct? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:  Well she did not but Jules was involved. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I understand Jules was involved but she 
had to press the button on the bank account when she was 
on internet banking to say take R2.5 million out of my father, 
my sister and my company and give it to BM Kolisi.  Do you 
not think at some point she asked about why she was being 
told to do that? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well I believe in my partner Jules.  If Jules 
says Khosi must pay the – press the button and he is the one 
actually who is bringing the business and he is also 
20 
investing.  I did not ask anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry come on Mr Ndzeku. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And if that… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Come on, come on. 
MR NDZEKU:  Chair it is the truth. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 220 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Come on, come on.  This is your daughter. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are – you were there when JM was 
started? 
MR NDZEKU:  Started yes.  I am the one actually who 
invited my daughter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are the – and you tell me that Mr Aires 
would not tell you about this money.  Your daughter would 
not tell you about this money.  They would all be paying 
these monies out without you knowing? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:  No – you know Chair this has come – maybe 
my daughter told me, maybe Jules told me.  I do not 
remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it cannot be Mr Ndzeku it cannot be 
that all the time you are going to say maybe this, maybe 
that.  You know something, tell me what you know. 
MR NDZEKU:  Chair what I know I do not remember.  That is 
the bottom line. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not remember whether Mr Aires told 
you about this – the money that was paid to you R2.5 million.  
20 
You do not remember whether he told you about the money 
that was paid to Mr Kolisi. 
MR NDZEKU:  To Kolisi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not remember whether your 
daughter told you about any of these monies. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 221 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:  No nothing.  Chair I regret I am sorry to 
disappoint you. Very, very sorry.  Jules he has been involved 
for 25 years he knows everybody there.  When we formed JM 
Aviation I was happy with him.  If maybe he wanted to run 
the company down because he was the one actually who was 
doing the marketing.  He was the one who was bringing the 
money.  If he gave my daughter instruction that he must pay 
and my daughter did… 
CHAIRPERSON:  And your daughter would never tell you? 
MR NDZEKU:  Sorry. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your daughter would not say, dad maybe 
Mr Aires is up to something here.  I am – he has instructed 
me to pay some money and I do not know anything about it. 
MR NDZEKU:  If the father never put anything – if the father 
does not bring business, I really do not think it is important 
that I must know.  I do not add any value – JM Aviation. 
Jules. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
MR NDZEKU:  Because he is the one actually who knows 
everything.  He is an expert on that side. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  If you had been told at the time that this 
R2.5 million was going to benefit Mr Lester Peter the head of 
procurement at SAA at the time would you have been worried 
about that? 
MR NDZEKU:  Of course, I would – I want to know exactly 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 222 of 388 
 
why are we paying because… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Exactly. 
MR NDZEKU:  In my thinking you do not pay something.  
Why should they pay?  Why ask me – we must pay? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.   
MR NDZEKU:  Why I say that – Swissport was not paying – 
why we? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well it is worse than that Mr Ndzeku. 
MR NDZEKU:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I would like your comment on this.  Mr 
10 
Lester Peter. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Is sitting in SAA as the procurement 
officer. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  He has just concluded an agreement that 
is going to benefit Swissport and JM Aviation for R1.5 billion. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  If you pay Mr Lester Peter R2.5 million or 
some portion of that then you have engaged in corruption Mr 
20 
Ndzeku because you have paid the decision maker who 
decided to give your company a lucrative deal. 
MR NDZEKU:  Well you know. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you accept that? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well you know the Chair he said something.  
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 223 of 388 
 
He said to me why would you not tell Peter Kohl that to pay 
direct to those people?  That is exactly what the Chair says.  
You know and the Chair was right, why?  You did not say 
Peter pay.  I am not paying you must pay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Is your evidence it was to hide corruption? 
MR NDZEKU:  Sorry. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Is it your evidence that they were using JM 
Aviation to hide corruption? 
MR NDZEKU:  No I do not say – I do not know.  It is not 
corruption.  I do not say that because I do not know.  During 
10 
that time when these people they were working I did not say 
– you know there was no money exchanged from – who paid 
actually JM is it – who paid that R2.5 to Lester?  Is it JM? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  I do not know about it I am sorry Chair to 
disappoint you.  I am very sorry to say that.  I do not know 
that.  Maybe my partner can explain better. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Or your daughter who facilitated the 
payment. 
MR NDZEKU:  You know what my daughter get instructions 
20 
from Jules and then Jules is the owner of the company.  He 
is the one actually put the money and he is the one actually 
who is doing the marketing. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  He did not put any money in Mr Ndzeku.  
We confirm that.  He did not put any money into this 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 224 of 388 
 
company. 
MR NDZEKU:  Let us go back again.  When we started about 
JM International where we used to do things outside. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes JM – I am talking about JM Aviation 
South Africa Mr Ndzeku. 
MR NDZEKU:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Aires made no financial contribution to 
it at this stage.  Let us move to what happened with this 
R2.5 million that there is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just before that.  Just before that.  Mr 
10 
Ndzeku how does it come about that if Mr Aires wields the 
power that you want me to believe wields – or he wield – 
sorry wielded in the company because from what you have 
said he instructed you – he would instruct you.  And if he 
instructed you you do what he said you must do.  He would 
instruct your daughter too.  And if on your evidence if he 
instructed your daughter your daughter would do whatever 
he instructed her to do.  Why is it then that he allowed a 
situation where it was your daughter who had the sole 
signing powers if I understand Ms Hofmeyr correctly – if he – 
20 
if he does not have the signing powers the signing powers 
are with your daughter why does he not keep the signing 
powers to himself? 
MR NDZEKU:  Mr Aires? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 225 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:  Right.  Between – between JM and JM 
Aviation and JM International when they started Mr Aires told 
me that they have got an account in Standard Bank.  Exactly 
what he told – I do not know maybe it is Standard Bank or 
maybe it is FNB the account they have got.  Which account 
is … 
ADV HOFMEYR:  This one is the FNB account. 
MR NDZEKU:  FNB okay.  He told me that they have got an 
account in Standard Bank.  They opened an account in 
Standard Bank.  There are two signatures.  It is himself and 
10 
my daughter.  The reason why they are bringing my daughter 
on board it is because the company must have women. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because the company was? 
MR NDZEKU:  Must have women on board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  And then again if she is alone it is not going 
work. We must actually bring another woman.  Then I say 
you know what Jules I do not know who can we bring but I 
think I have got another daughter.  Now the bottom line how 
come did she sign?  For me when anything Jules said we 
20 
must do we did it because he was the one actually who was 
in charge.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So Mr Aires is one person. 
MR NDZEKU:  One person yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the Ndzeku family are three is it not?  
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 226 of 388 
 
Yourself, your daughter and your wife is it not? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  But I can say… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he… 
MR NDZEKU:  Ja one.  Jules is one, I am one.  Because 
these people they could not come if it was not me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If? 
MR NDZEKU:  We are two. It is myself and Aires. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:  Because these people you are talking about 
Chair they could not come if I did not invite.  If Jules he did 
not say that I must invite them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but he said and they are there now. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So the Ndzeku family they are three 
people.  
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Aires is just one person.  But he rules. 
MR NDZEKU:  Hundred percent.  Hundred percent. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And… 
MR NDZEKU:  He has got experience. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when... 
MR NDZEKU:  He has got experience for 25 years in 
aviation. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 227 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when the Ndzeku family is alone 
without him they do not even discuss monies that come in 
and go out. 
MR NDZEKU:  But you know Chair you must discuss money 
coming in and out when you understand the business.  Jules 
is a man actually who has been in this business for a long 
time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NDZEKU:  I have been with Swissport for a long time on 
their aviation.  On the ground handling.  I know nothing 
10 
about most of the things then.  I was a worker.  I can still say 
that maybe I was also worker to Jules.  He saw me as a 
worker. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NDZEKU:  I am sitting here today and then Counsellor is 
asking me those questions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NDZEKU:  Which is I cannot even respond. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR NDZEKU:  How can you have so lot of money in your 
20 
account and you do not know about it.  That means to you it 
was small money.  No it was.  It was a big money.  But did I 
know anything about it?  Did he tell me?  Maybe yes, maybe 
no.  I do not remember Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 228 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I just want to conclude on where that R2.5 
million that was paid with the reference P it went to.  
Because all that we have seen so far is that it was paid to a 
firm of attorneys with whom JM Aviation had no dealings at 
the time.  That has been your evidence Mr Ndzeku. 
MR NDZEKU:  In my thinking yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes your knowledge I understand that. 
MR NDZEKU:  Not the Chair’s. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Okay so let us go back to the 
chronology.  It was on the 15 March that SAA and Swissport 
10 
finally signed the ground handling contract.  You were a 
witness on that agreement as was Mr Lester Peter.  Okay I 
am just reminding you of these facts.  15 March.  Well what 
we are interested in following that… 
MR NDZEKU:  Sorry – sorry Counsellor. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  What is happening now Peter is the CEO of 
the company.  He has got – he has got papers. He has got 
agreement where he ask me can you please come and I 
come. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  He says, I need you to put your signature 
here.  You know. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No Mr Ndzeku there is no question.  Do not 
worry I was just orientating you. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 229 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
MR NDZEKU:  In time.  That that had happened on the 15 
March 2016. 
MR NDZEKU:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay.  The next day the 16 March 2016 Mr 
Lester Peter went to buy two cars.  Were you aware of that? 
MR NDZEKU:  No I was not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You were not.  Well I can tell you and I will 
take you to the documents.  He engaged with an outfit called 
Cars for Africa.  That was the next day the 16 March. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:  The next day yes yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  And he wanted to buy two sports 
cars. 
MR NDZEKU:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  He was interested in an Aston Martin 
Coupe and a BMW 4M Coupe.  Again, do you have no 
knowledge of these facts? 
MR NDZEKU:  Nothing.  Nothing. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Nothing.  Nothing.  And he asked for a 
quote and it came in at about R1.7 million and then he asked 
20 
for a few frills including personalised number plates for the 
two cars and that took the invoice a little bit above R1.7 
million.  That was around the 16 March.  Right.  Then on the 
23 March Swissport South Africa paid R28.5 million into JM 
Aviation’s account.  You saw that, correct? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 230 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes I did.  Yes I did see that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  The same day R20 million goes to 
[00:15:24] R2.5 million goes to you and R2.5 million goes to 
BM Kolisi Attorneys.  Right. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It only cleared in BM Kolisi Attorney’s 
account on the 30 March.  We went back and looked at the 
calendar Chair it was because of a public holiday and a 
weekend. So it comes into BM Kolisi’s account on the 30 
March and guess who paid for Mr Lester Peter’s cars on the 
10 
31 March?  BM Kolisi Attorneys.  Those are the facts that our 
investigation has unearthed.  Is your evidence today that you 
have no knowledge at all of those facts? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well I am sorry to disappoint Counsel I do not 
know anything about that.  But did the monies there in the 
account – the money was paid but where it went, who paid it 
I do not know.  I am sorry.  I am sorry Chair but it is the fact. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It would be very concerning would it not if 
JM Aviation from money from Swissport paid for two cars for 
Mr Lester Peter would it not be concerning Mr Ndzeku? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:  Well if – if I knew that it is going to be paid 
for cars and things I do not know definitely I would be 
concerned. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You see I will go back to Mr Daluxolo 
Peter’s evidence. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 231 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  He not only describes you as the 
Mastermind behind all of these payments but he says that 
his role – his role at that meeting on the 10 February 2016 
where he was present with you was to facilitate the 
Swissport SAA ground handling contract, do you dispute 
that? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well he – he was talking to Peter Kohl. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Not to you? 
MR NDZEKU:  No. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  He did not talk to at all? 
MR NDZEKU:  No, no.  Let me … 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But you were talking about… 
MR NDZEKU:  No, no let me – let me just put it here 
Counsel. As I said before I met him Daluxolo at 2010 and 
after that Peter Kohl called me then he introduced to him and 
after that he told me that they want to do the business of the 
busses and then they think that this is a good empowerment 
and please he want us to work with this gentleman.  And 
after that he called me again for another – another 
20 
empowerment.  So now I do not know where do I have power 
when Peter called me.  Paid R20 million and I must tell Mr 
Daluxolo pay 5 or 10 and 15.  I did say that when he was 
paid that money please do not forget me.  That is exactly 
what I said because he was – he was gone and he was 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 232 of 388 
 
happy.  I cannot control him.  I was not supposed actually to 
do anything about it because it was a deal between himself 
and Peter Kohl the CEO. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But you were talking to Ms Kwinana about 
him were you not? 
MR NDZEKU:  About the 30% of the empowerment which is 
SAA and SAT and then the actual ACSA they opposed to all 
the people of airport.  It was not only Swissport. It was only 
the budget – budget they had also the same problem. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No I un… 
10 
MR NDZEKU:  Which is Peter Kohl also decided – Peter Kohl 
decided also to go to Durban with the very same gentleman 
the one who says I was the Mastermind.  If I was a 
mastermind why I did not go to Durban with him and Peter 
Kohl?  I was supposed to be there. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No Mr Ndzeku.  Mr Peter’s evidence is that 
he was brought in to facilitate that deal. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  He did so and so he got a cut.  He got to 
keep R5 million of the R20 million that was paid to his 
20 
company.  Do you dispute that? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well I do not know that.  I am sorry.  I cannot 
… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I would like Chair then to move to the 
purchase of the property that Mr Ndzeku made that was Ms 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 233 of 388 
 
Hlohela’s property. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And Ms Hlohela just to orientate ourselves 
is the mother of Ms Memela. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Who was the head of procurement at SAA 
Technical at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Must we keep this bundle in front of us or 
are we moving to another one? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair no you can keep that bundle thank 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So just a few more details about that sale 
Mr Ndzeku.  We saw the agreement the sale agreement 
earlier this morning.  You confirmed your signature on it.  Do 
you recall that? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  Did you read the sale agreement 
before you signed it? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:  I think so I think I did yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It would be prudent to do so would it not?  
You would want to have read what you were signing. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Your commitment to it, is that correct? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 234 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And can you help me with… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  That is a yes hey? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay.  I did not think it was loud enough 
to be captured ja. 
MR NDZEKU:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And who signed first Ms Hlohela or 
yourself? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:  Who what? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Who signed the agreement first Ms Hlohela 
or you? 
MR NDZEKU:  I think it was Ms Hlohela. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Ms Hlohela. 
MR NDZEKU:  Ja I think so ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  And then how did you get the agreement 
from her?  I am just trying to understand the logistics. 
MR NDZEKU:  Well when I – when I first met her this lady 
here because I met her Nonsasa at that time. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is Ms Memela. 
MR NDZEKU:  Ms Memela and after that she told me that the 
mother is [01:20:53] with the eyes and then I was introduced 
to the mother.  And after that I went to see the mother and 
we started to talk about what we were talking and I said to 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 235 of 388 
 
her, it – I would like actually to go – to go and see exactly 
what is happening.  Because we got this venture of the other 
business in Maseru which is we wanted actually to do in 
Swaziland also in Transkei which I show the brochure of the 
company. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That is – you showed her the brochure? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes I did. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right. 
MR NDZEKU:  So now I said this is exactly what we want to 
do.  And after that they said okay we have got actually the 
10 
land it is next to the river.  And I said I would like to see it.  
And then I took my uncle and then the one who is in hospital.  
I said come let us drive.  And then we went there.  When we 
arrived there and then I found this lady.  I do not remember 
the date and when but the lady – the same lady I saw her 
she was there.  They were around about two, three, four 
gentlemen who introduced themselves. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember you are telling me that story Mr 
Ndzeku.  
MR NDZEKU:  Sorry. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Remember I am the one who is…. 
MR NDZEKU:  Sorry Chair I am sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NDZEKU:  So now when we went… 
CHAIRPERSON:  So when you looking that way I cannot get 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 236 of 388 
 
to hear everything 
MR NDZEKU:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NDZEKU:  So now when we arrived there and then we 
find this lady was there and she introduced me to these 
people – to these Chief.  Another one it was a Chief Sigcau.  
I do not know maybe it was Chief Sigcau or what and then 
we decided to sit.  I did not say – I did not say to her listen 
please man please give me your number or maybe tell me 
exactly what.  No, no I just listened to them.  Because by 
10 
that time I did not pay anything.  There is no money 
exchanging hands.  And then when I was told that the person 
who is charge is the Chief.  This gentleman he say is the 
Chief.  Another one he says I am – we are not in charge of 
that land so I was a little bit confused.  Why this one say this 
and this one.  I say to her listen what exactly is happening 
here?  Are we doing it or maybe we are not doing it?  If you 
are not owning the land it is not yours, we do not have to do 
this.  I know let the boy take you there to the river he must 
show you.  So they show me a land where it is the same size 
20 
as the soccer stadium.  You know it could be maybe 
somebody’s land or maybe it could that land.  And I said 
okay if this is the land and then the Chief also he agree on 
this and then I will trust you Ms Hlohela and then that at 
least when the time comes we can actually do the deal.  And 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 237 of 388 
 
after that I left.  I came here.  Now the question now who 
signed first?  After that I actually wanted the paper for the 
land.  I did not get the land. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So do you remember who signed first or do 
you not remember? 
MR NDZEKU:  I do not remember but I do not remember it is 
me or her but I do not remember but I … 
ADV HOFMEYR:  She – she signed on the 1 November 2015.  
Did you sign around that time? 
MR NDZEKU:  Oh the lady? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes Ms Hlohela. 
MR NDZEKU:  So now… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No Mr Ndzeku my question is did you sign 
around that time November 2015? 
MR NDZEKU:  I think so.  I do not remember. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But it would have to have been around that 
time because you paid for the property in 2016 about May 
2016.  Do you recall that? 
MR NDZEKU:  Ja somewhere there yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay so was your meeting with her at the 
20 
land before November 2015? 
MR NDZEKU:  I think it was before. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well it would have to be before would it 
not?  Because as I understand your evidence you went to 
see the land before you concluded the deal.  Is that correct? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 238 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:  I think so yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Well is it? 
MR NDZEKU:  I do not remember but I think so. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Would you have seen the land only after 
you concluded the deal? 
MR NDZEKU:  No but when they told me about the land I 
wanted to see the land.  I said let me see it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes so you went to see it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I am sorry I do not hear that. 
MR NDZEKU:  Sorry, sorry Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  When they told you about the land what, 
what, what? 
MR NDZEKU:  I wanted actually to go and see it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You wanted to go and see it? 
MR NDZEKU:  Ja see the land and then I took my good 
uncle.  The one actually [01:25:09]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you made sure you saw the land before 
you could conclude the deal? 
MR NDZEKU:  I think so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:  I think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR NDZEKU:  But we actually myself and my uncle we have 
got this company from Lesotho which is they are doing what 
they are doing and then we also went to talk to them and 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 239 of 388 
 
then they said they need property in Swaziland, they need 
property there.  Then we said listen we would like actually to 
– because… 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes, no, no that is fine.  The question was 
simply whether you saw the land first before you concluded 
the deal? 
MR NDZEKU:  I think so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And one would expect that because what 
would be the point of seeing it after you had concluded the 
deal. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:  I think that is – I think I went down there 
before we concluded it Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Can you be clear.  Did you see the land 
before you paid the money? 
MR NDZEKU:  Sorry? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Did you see the land before you paid the 
money? 
MR NDZEKU:  I think I did see the land before I paid the 
money if I remember very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you would agree that it would not help 
20 
to pay the money and see the land after? 
MR NDZEKU:  Sorry what are you saying Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would you agree that it would not serve 
any purpose  
MR NDZEKU:  To pay the money 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 240 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To pay first and see the land after? 
MR NDZEKU:  Hundred percent Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Hm.  And one of the points you made 
earlier is when you met with Ms Hlohela on that day that you 
went and saw the land you did actually show her the – the 
memorandum about the cannabis growing, is that correct that 
you have provided to the commission? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  How did you show her a document 
10 
that was only generated in November 2018? 
MR NDZEKU:  What did I what? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  In 2015.  How did you show her a 
document that was only generated, made, put together in 
November 2018 when you met with her in 2015? 
MR NDZEKU:  The question did I show her this document? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No you already told us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The question is this.  That document that 
you say you showed her did not exist at the time that you 
say you showed her because it was only generated or put 
20 
together in 2018.  What do you say to that? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well I do not remember Chair maybe I did 
show her maybe I did not show it because this was my 
project.  I was actually rushing with this project.  Maybe I did 
not show but maybe I did not show her but this is the project 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 241 of 388 
 
actually I wanted to do. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Ndzeku just to be clear your evidence 
twice today. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Because I have made a note of it was that 
when you met with her in 2015 you showed her this 
memorandum.  You have just been told that the memorandum 
was only created in November 2018 and now you are 
changing your version. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:  Sorry, sorry Chair.  Maybe I do not remember.  
Sorry.  Maybe I do not remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I mean what is it that you do not remember 
now? 
MR NDZEKU:  No what I am saying now if maybe did I show 
her – did I sign or before or maybe did I show the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  Mr Ndzeku you said earlier on that 
you showed Ms Hlohela that document the memorandum.  
Now we know that the meeting that were talking about when 
you said you showed her was in 2015. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:  I do not remember.  I do not know Chair did I 
show her or I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on, hang on. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just listen.  You said that when you met 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 242 of 388 
 
her Ms Hlohela you showed her that – this – that document 
memorandum.  And we know that the meeting with her that 
you are talking about. 
MR NDZEKU:  Sorry Chair when you talk about memorandum 
I am talking about the memorandum of agreement of the land 
or… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No the memorandum for your cannabis 
growing. 
MR NDZEKU:  No, No I was thinking that we were talking 
about memorandum of understanding on this… 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No Mr Ndzeku you did not because you did 
not have the memorandum of agreement either when you met 
with Ms Hlohela. 
MR NDZEKU:  I am sorry Ma’am I did not understand.  I am 
sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us take it step by step.  The 
document relating to cannabis. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you show it to her that is Ms Hlohela 
when you met with her in 2015? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:  No I did not.  I did not have it by that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not have it by then? 
MR NDZEKU:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you did not show it to her. 
MR NDZEKU:  No.  No I did not. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 243 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you not earlier say you did show it to 
her? 
MR NDZEKU:  I think I made a mistake. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You think you made a mistake? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you are sure that you did not show it 
to her? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   It is a brochure from Medigro.  
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Your evidence earlier was that you 
were engaging with them about the Cannabis growing.  Is 
that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Hundred percent. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And you were engaging with them at 
the time you that you were thinking about buying this 
property.  Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Correct, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And that was in 2015, correct? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Who is the CEO of Medigro? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I did not meet the CEO.  I met the 
marketing guy.  He is name is Thabo. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   His name is? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 244 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Thabo. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Thabo. 
MR NDZEKU:   Thabo Mokwena, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Thabo.  When did you meet him? 
MR NDZEKU:   I think during... around that time.   
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   H’m. 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja, I do not remember but ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   When you got the memorandum? 
MR NDZEKU:   When I have got... when we started to talk.  
Ja, Thabo Mokwena, he is the one who actually who came in. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   He is the one who gave you it, right? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   [Dip in audio recording] ...Mokwena 
about this possible Cannabis growing. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR 
SC: 
 
 And 
then 
he 
gave 
you 
this 
memorandum, correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   He gave me this, the brochure. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   The brochure? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Let us call it the brochure. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   So that we do not get confused with 
the memorandum of agreement. 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja, I am with you, yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 245 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   I agree.  Let us call it the brochure.  
So he is the person you dealt with?  You did not deal with 
the CEO? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I did not. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And do you remember where you met 
him when he gave you the memorandum... the brochure?  
Apologies. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I met him in Sandton. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   H’m.  H’m.  Because we have 
contacted Medigro since we have received your document, 
10 
the brochure. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Chair, just to inform you how it plays 
out.  We have asked Mr Ndzeku through a summons to 
provide us any and all documents related to his intended 
plans for the land that he purchased.  And he provided us 
with this brochure. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And he has confirmed with us, he had 
engagements with Medigro.  He is now corrected his 
20 
previous evidence when he said he gave it to Ms Hlohlela.  
He is now saying he did not give it to Ms Hlohlela.  But you 
did have a meeting where you got this, right, from Mr 
Mokwena, correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I did. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 246 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Right.  You see, the problem I have 
with that is that the meeting with Mr Mokwena also happened 
in 2018 because this document that he gave you, only 
existed in 2018.  So how could you have had dealings with 
Medigro back in 2015 when the document and Mr Mokwena’s 
interactions only happened in 2018?  
MR NDZEKU:   Well, Chair I did not even look at the date.  I 
did not know whether it was 2018 or in 2016.  When we 
started to speak about this project with Mr Mokwena, we did 
not talk about date. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   So Mr Ndzeku, is your evidence before 
this Commission that you get confused between something 
happening in 2016 and something happening in 2018? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I am just talking about the meeting 
because you are saying, you contacted...  Did I meet the 
CEO?  I said no.  You met the marketing?  I said no.  You 
said, who did you meet?  I said, I met Thabo.  Thabo 
Mokwena. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes.  H’m. 
MR NDZEKU:   Thabo Mokwena, he told me that, he starts 
20 
with the company.  Now when and where and what time and 
what date, I do not remember. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   I understand but it has to be later than 
November 2018 because the brochure is... its front page 
says that it was created in November 2018.  So your 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 247 of 388 
 
interactions with Mr Mokwena when he handed you this 
brochure, happened probably at the end of 2018. 
MR NDZEKU:   Something, yes.  Something like that. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes.  My problem with your evidence 
Mr Ndzeku, is you tell us and the Commission that when you 
were dealing with Ms Hlohlela in 2015, you were embarked 
with Medigro on a project but you were not Mr Ndzeku. 
MR NDZEKU:   No, no, no.  But... please, councillor.  I did 
actually ask the Commissioner that it was a mistake because 
I was thinking that maybe... because I did not.  Now I am 
10 
telling you that I did not.  I am telling you exactly what 
happened.  Did I meet the CEO?  Did I meet...?  No, I did 
not.  So I do not remember the date.  But I did not actually 
show the lady the brochure.  I did not. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And in 2015, you had no engagements 
with Medigro at all, did you? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I did not. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   No?  So you did not have any plans 
with them for Cannabis growing, did you? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, in Swaziland, yes.  Not with the 
20 
company.  In Swaziland, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   No, I am asking you about Medigro. 
MR NDZEKU:   In Swaziland in Manzini.  There is a place 
where they are doing it.  And also, in Lesotho on a very 
small scale which is, they actually want to work with.  Not 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 248 of 388 
 
only with this company but another company which is this, 
exactly the business I was doing for many years. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   But Mr Ndzeku, you got a summons 
from this Commission. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   That said:  Please provide us with any 
documents related to the agricultural product that you 
wanted to farm when you concluded the deal in 2015.  And 
you provided us with this brochure.   
MR NDZEKU:   Well ...[intervenes]  
10 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Not the brochure of another company 
with whom you were looking at Cannabis dealing.  This 
brochure. 
MR NDZEKU:   But councillor, I can throw that to my advisor 
because these are the people... Chair, they were actually 
receiving all the information.  When I got something, I took 
to them.  And I said:  Gentlemen, how do we go about this?  
And then if anything, it is here.   
 
They are supposed to actually explain how did they 
come to that.  But they only advising me on the man actually 
20 
in the ground who does these things, you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, your attorneys could advise you on 
the law. 
MR NDZEKU:   On the law, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But they would not tell you what happened 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 249 of 388 
 
because they were not there.  They would hear from you 
what happened and how you came to purchase the land. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So in terms of facts ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...you are the one who knows what the 
facts were, what happened.  Now, counsel is saying to you 
there is something wrong with your version. 
MR NDZEKU:   With my version?  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As to why you were interested in the 
property, in the land, that you wanted to buy from Ms 
Hlohlela. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because your version is that it was 
connected with your interest in Cannabis based on your 
interaction with the company that gave you... that gave that 
document. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   But she is saying, but at that time this 
document did not exist. 
MR NDZEKU:   It did not exist, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And if I understand correctly.  You had not 
interacted with Mr Mokwena at that time.  So it cannot be 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 250 of 388 
 
that that was the reason why you were interested in the land.  
Ms Hofmeyr must tell me if I misunderstand. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   No, indeed Chair. 
MR NDZEKU:   No, no.  I understand clearly but I did not 
meet Mr Mokwena by that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   But the business of Cannabis has been there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Not only in Lesotho, in Swaziland.  And then 
I had also a group of people, like my friends, who wanted 
10 
actually a space in Lesotho.  As I have said, in Swaziland 
and also where there is a river.  For me Chair, I do not see 
anything wrong with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Mr Ndzeku, in your affidavit before the 
Commission, you said that prior to the evidence of Ms 
Mamela of February of this year, you did not know that the 
money that you paid for this land of her mother’s was going 
to be used to buy her a property.  Do you remember saying 
that in your affidavit? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I said that.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   So you had no knowledge until 
February this year that Ms Mamela was going to use the 
money to purchase a property.  Is that right? 
MR NDZEKU:   Right. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 251 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   You are sure about that? 
MR NDZEKU:   I am very sure about that. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Let us go to the agreement if we can.  
The offer to purchase.  You will find that under tab 6 at page 
14.  One four.  
MR NDZEKU:   Page 6? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Tab 6 and then it is page 14.  It is 
where it starts. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I am here. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   You remember that sale agreement? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   That is the sale agreement that you 
confirm in your evidence earlier you read, correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   [No audible reply] 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Oh, you will find your signature, just to 
help you, at page 22. 
MR NDZEKU:   Page 23? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   23 is Ms Hlohlela’s signature and at 
page 22 is yours. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I can see it. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Do you have it? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes.  This agreement told you that the 
money was going to be used by Ms Mamela to purchase the 
property, Mr Ndzeku. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 252 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   This agreement says that? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry. Just repeat the question, Ms 
Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   I said that the agreement tells Mr 
Ndzeku that Ms Mamela was going to use the money to 
purchase her property.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR NDZEKU:   Now let me just read it again.   
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   H’m. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Where does he say that?  Can you just 
...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   At page 15, Clause 3.1. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay, offer to purchase...  Is exactly what is 
he saying, yes.  I can see it here. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes.  Your evidence a moment ago, 
was that until you heard Ms Mamela in February of 2020, say 
that the money was going to be used to purchase a property, 
you had no knowledge of that. 
MR NDZEKU:   I did not have...? 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Any knowledge of that. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I just said that I did not know that.  But 
he is going to purchase a property.  I did not know that.  But 
I can see it, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   But is in the agreement that you 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 253 of 388 
 
signed and that you told us you read. 
MR NDZEKU:   I can see here.  I can see. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   So you did conclude an agreement to 
buy land from Ms Mamela’s mother knowing that the money 
would go to help Ms Mamela buy a property, correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I did not know that, councillor. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   But it is in the agreement. 
MR NDZEKU:   But I can see that now.  I can see the 
agreement says that here but I did not know it. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   So did you read the agreement and 
10 
not understand what it meant? 
MR NDZEKU:   I think so.  I must be honest with you.  I did 
not actually... I can see here now the agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Mr Ndzeku, an agreement to buy land 
is a very serious and a very important agreement. 
MR NDZEKU:   To buy...? 
CHAIRPERSON:   To buy land. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Is 
a 
very 
serious 
and 
important 
agreement. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   It is. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you are going to pay a lot of money 
for the land. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, to purchase.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And this was not a very long agreement as 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 254 of 388 
 
I see it.  It is about four pages. 
MR NDZEKU:   But Chair, I did not get any papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am saying, it seems to me that this is not 
a very long agreement. 
MR NDZEKU:   yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It seems to be about four pages or 
thereabout or maybe it is eight or six.  You mean you did not 
read the agreement? 
MR NDZEKU:   So you say councillor after we paid that 
money, I did not know that Ms Mamela is going to buy the 
10 
house.  Is that what you are saying? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  I am asking you the question 
at the moment.  Are you saying you did not read this 
agreement before you signed it? 
MR NDZEKU:   I think so.  I do not... I do not think I really 
read it properly.  Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not read it properly? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you did read it? 
MR NDZEKU:   [No audible reply]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or can you not remember? 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not remember Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not remember whether you read it 
or not? 
MR NDZEKU:   Let me just take a look again.  Did you say it 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 255 of 388 
 
is at what page again? 
CHAIRPERSON:   It is on page one five.  That is 15. 
MR NDZEKU:   145? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no.  15, under tab 6.  It starts at page 
14. 
MR NDZEKU:   Page 14, hey? 
CHAIRPERSON:   It starts at page 14. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Mr Ndzeku, why are you not in tab 6?  
If you go to tab 6 ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   Tab 6.  Yes, okay thank you very much. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes, then you will find page 14. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay then...   
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got it, offer to purchase? 
MR NDZEKU:   Tell me, this ends at page 12 councillor? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Proceed to page 14, hey? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Go to page 14, one four. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Registrar, I am just going to assist Mr 
Ndzeku. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I think I am okay.  Thank you, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you found it? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I have found it.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Under tab 6, page 14.  That is 
where it starts.  And then page 15 is where you... the 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 256 of 388 
 
introduction. 
MR NDZEKU:   Two what?  I am at 12... 26-12 now. 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR NDZEKU:   Is it 26-12? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  You must be at 15, page 15.  
The top page on Clause 1 is introduction.  Have you got 
that? 
MR NDZEKU:   On page 14 here. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And then if you turn over the page 
...[intervenes]  
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Offer to purchase, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Offer to purchase, you have got that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja, I have got that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay the next page is page 15.   
MR NDZEKU:   Page 15... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Can you see page 15? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I can see that here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now... so what is your final 
evidence?  Is it that you signed this agreement without 
reading it or is that you read it but you did not read it 
20 
properly? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I did initially but I did not actually read 
it properly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did what? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, in my mind I was really thinking that... 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 257 of 388 
 
but I can see there is a one point five, there is 90-days, you 
know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Two point 5? 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja, at 2.5. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay Ms Hofmeyr, take it from there. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Ndzeku, you 
gave an account of your meeting with Ms Hlohlela just now in 
your evidence that was different to the account that you gave 
of that meeting earlier this morning in your evidence. 
MR NDZEKU:   Can you repeat again, councillor? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes.  When you told us just now about 
the meeting with Ms Hlohlela that you had when you asked 
to go and see the property ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   ...your description of that meeting was 
quite different to the description that you gave of that 
meeting when you were being questioned before the tea-
break this morning.  Do you realise that? 
MR NDZEKU:   What was...?  I do not remember that it was 
very different. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Because when you gave evidence first 
this morning before the tea-break ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   ...you appear that you met with Chief 
Sigcau that you spoke to him about the traditional processes 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 258 of 388 
 
that you spoke about the fact that you wanted to purchase 
the land, that there was confirmation that Ms Hlohlela had 
land to sell.  Do you remember that evidence? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, councillor.  Ms Hlohlela she was there.  
She was actually the one who introduced me to these 
people.  Sorry, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes, I did ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Ms Hlohlela she was there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  No, no, no. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   She introduced me to those people. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no.  Listen carefully to the 
question. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Counsel is talking about what you told me 
...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...before tea-break about that meeting. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is the meeting involving yourself, Ms 
20 
Hlohlela, Chief Sigcau and other people that he brought to 
the meeting. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She is now going to tell you what you said 
in the morning about that meeting and what you have just 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 259 of 388 
 
said now and point out to you what is different. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Because your version most recently is 
that you are not sure whether it was Chief Sigcau or not.  Is 
that right? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, he was introduced to me as Chief 
Sigcau by this lady. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And whereas this morning, you said 
you discussed the traditional processes for you acquiring the 
land.  You now say, as I understand it, you did not have that 
10 
discussion.  Is that right? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I... sorry, councillor.  The person... 
again, let me repeat.  Who introduced me to these people it 
was that lady. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   No, I understand. 
MR NDZEKU:   She is the one actually who was leading, who 
was talking.  I could not really talk to these people.  I do not 
know maybe they are chief or maybe they are not chief but 
she was the one who was introducing me to them. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Mr Ndzeku, who introduced you is not 
20 
where I am focussing at the moment. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   I am focussing on your version this 
morning to the Chairperson about what happened in that 
meeting. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 260 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Then we had a tea-break. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And now you have a different version.  
Your version.  You said this morning you met, you discussed 
the traditional processes, you confirmed that she was the 
owner of the land, Chief Sigcau was there. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And presided over that meeting.  Now I 
understand your evidence to be, there was some uncertainty 
10 
about whether it was Chief Sigcau but I understand you to 
say that that is how he was introduced to you.  But now you 
say, you did not discuss the traditional processes.  Is that 
right? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   You did not discuss them? 
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry, what were you saying?  I did not or did 
I...? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   You did not discuss the traditional 
processes, correct? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, the gentlemen who were there, they 
did. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Who did? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Right.  And did you confirm that Ms 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 261 of 388 
 
Hlohlela was the owner of the land because you said this 
morning that you did. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   I understood you just now to say, you 
were not sure whether she was the owner. 
MR NDZEKU:   No, that is exactly what she said.  She says 
own the land.  I am still sticking to the same thing I said this 
morning.  I do not change anything.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I seem to remember that you said in 
the morning, she said the chief owns the land, is the owner 
10 
of the land.  Did I misunderstand you? 
MR NDZEKU:   No...  Sorry, Chair.  You know, to be honest, 
when she started to tell me about what is happening and 
then there were those four gentlemen that were there, and 
then you would listen to them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat. 
MR NDZEKU:   She introduced them ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Just repeat that last sentence.  I did not 
hear. 
MR NDZEKU:   I said there were four gentlemen that were 
20 
there.  There were the two of us and then she introduced me 
to these gentlemen.  And as we were listening to this 
gentlemen and then my interest, it was about the land.   
 
And then she says to me this is the chief.  Anything we 
do, we do it through the chief.   
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 262 of 388 
 
 
These are the four gentlemen.  I think they were in 
charge of the whole place, you know.  I wanted actually to 
the paperwork, to get the title deeds. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did I misunderstand your evidence this 
morning when I thought you said Ms Hlohlela said to you the 
chief is the owner of the land?  Did I misunderstand your 
evidence 
MR NDZEKU:   You know but when we started Chair, the way 
to drive to the... and then if you do not own the land, you 
know, why should I talk to the chief?  If I may?  I remember 
10 
very well.  She said she owns the land, she is the owner.  
But the person in charge of the land is the chief. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but that is what I want to find out.  If 
I misunderstood your evidence, I want you to correct me.  
But if I understood it correctly, I want you to confirm. 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So is my... was my understanding 
incorrect that you said she said the chief was the owner of 
the land?  Did I misunderstand your evidence? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I do not recall but it seems that she 
20 
told me that Ms Hlohlela, she owns the land. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   And the chief is in charge of everything 
around it but she owns the land. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So I must have misunderstood your 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 263 of 388 
 
evidence? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I do not know, maybe.  I can say that 
Chair ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, I am not trying to trick you in 
anything. 
MR NDZEKU:   No, no, no.  There is no trick. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I just want to make sure ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   It is the truth there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   About exactly what happened. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Thank you.  So when you were 
introduced to Chief Sigcau on the basis that he administers 
the area of where the land that you were purchasing falls? 
MR NDZEKU:   What are you saying? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Were you introduced to Chief Sigcau 
...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   On the understanding that he 
administers the land over which you were purchasing the 
20 
property? 
MR NDZEKU:   I think so. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes.  And did you discuss with him the 
process that you needed to go through in order to purchase 
that land? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 264 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   The chief? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, he explained to me that anything that 
has got to do here, it must via the chief.  But I said to the 
chief, I remember very well:  I am here because of this lady, 
Ms Hlohlela.   
 
And then if maybe I as an investor, as the person who is 
in charge of the land, wants to be p 
 
art of the land and then we can get to the paperwork.  
That is all that I was interested in.  At least let me get to 
10 
business and get the paperwork.  And then after that, they 
can actually... we can discuss other issues.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay I am sorry.  I was going to ask you 
but maybe you are coming to it now.  I understood you in the 
morning to have also expressed an interest to say getting 
the title deed. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, they said there are no title deeds. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You asked? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, because they might think, I thinking that 
you will have to have the title deed. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja, absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But they said there are no title deeds? 
MR NDZEKU:   No title deeds but there are papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 265 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   There are papers.  There are papers that 
they can arrange that I can have. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what was your understanding of what 
those papers would proof? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, my understanding... because when this 
other gentleman was telling me he was with other people.  
They have got farms here.  And then those people were 
given a certain agreement which is other agreement, it 
binds.   
 
So I said to myself:  Okay, if this is an agreement, we 
10 
can have... I will have to discuss it again with Ms Hlohlela.  
But I did not know that when I go there.   
 
I have been meeting the chief.  I was thinking that she 
was going to say:  Okay, I introduce you to these people and 
then this is the paperwork.  Let us take it from here.  And 
then we go forward.  But it was not like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Once they told you that there was no title 
deed that you would get, then you must have known that she 
could not be the owner of the land in the sense in which you 
know ownership of land to be? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Chair, they said there are no title deeds but 
they will give me the paperwork 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   So that erf because they are calling it the Erf 
T and F1 and F what, what.  That is what they told me. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 266 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But in terms of what your knowledge, 
proof of ownership of land is through a title deed, is it not? 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja, it is important yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what I am putting to you is.  Once you 
were told that you will not get a title deed, you must have 
known that she could not be the owner ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   The owner. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...in a way in which you know it. 
MR NDZEKU:   In the way... yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And you mentioned ago that they were 
talking about erven.  Is that right? 
MR NDZEKU:   The what? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   They were talking about erfs.  
Different erfs or erven of land.  Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And is that how ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   Which is they are not using that.  Ja, they 
are using a certain word, you know.  But I am the one who 
was actually thinking about the... it is the way it is supposed 
20 
to be done. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   H’m.  H’m.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And that paper... Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  So when you talk about erfs, it is 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 267 of 388 
 
your language ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   My language Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   ...that you were reflecting onto what they 
were saying? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And could you give us the way that 
they described it?  How did they identify the land that you 
are interested in if it is not by an erf?   
MR NDZEKU:   Ja. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   You see, we know because that is 
something that is...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   A demarcation. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   ...there is an extent identified for and 
demarcation.  How was the land identified? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Even if it is in isiXhosa, you can just say 
what words they used to refer to the plot or the piece of 
land. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, you know in the place called 
...[indistinct] next to the river, they took me there. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR NDZEKU:   And then they started to show me that this 
land belongs to and this land belongs to another gentleman, 
this land it belongs to this lady, Ms Hlohlela. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They were showing you plots of land? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 268 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, the plots of land.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR NDZEKU:   Which I was interested next to the river.  I 
said, if it is next to the river I will be very happy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Because we need water. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And you were meeting Ms Hlohlela, as 
I understood your evidence earlier, in Mbenzane.  Is that 
right? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   You met with Ms Hlohlela in 
Mbenzane.  That was your evidence. 
MR NDZEKU:   It is Imbeni(?) but that is not the place called 
Mbenzane(?).  That is exactly what he says.  But the city is 
Imbeni or something like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was that in... did you go to her house? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, yes.  Yes, I was in her house. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You met her at her house? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  Somewhere in the rural area. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the rural area? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, in rural areas.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And when you had the meeting with 
her and the local chief and the other people, was it in the 
chief’s house or in her house? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 269 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   In her house. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the chief came to her house? 
MR NDZEKU:   This gentleman... these four gentlemen, they 
came to her house. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   With the chief? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, four gentlemen, they came to her 
house.  Yes, I can say.  Because I am not from there.  I do 
10 
not know maybe it is Chief Sigcau or who, you know but 
...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But one of them was said to be the local 
chief? 
MR NDZEKU:   The chief.  Chief, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And he was referred to as Chief Sigcau as 
you understood it? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And how did you then identify how 
20 
much land you were getting for this deal, Mr Ndzeku?  Was it 
one square metre, a hectare?  How did you know how much 
land you were getting? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I can say it is the same size of the 
rugby stadium.  Maybe times two.  It is exactly the way I 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 270 of 388 
 
looked at it.  I do not know maybe how many hectares but 
that is how I looked at it. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   So why did you not agreement set out 
how much land you were buying? 
MR NDZEKU:   Why the agreement...? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Not identify how much land you were 
buying? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, remember when I was there, I did not 
get any paperwork.  I was expecting to get title deeds.  I did 
not get anything.  So now they said to me you will be getting 
10 
paper.  We will tell exactly how it goes.   
 
At the same time, Ms Hlohlela told me that he would 
like to go and meet my daughter because she is a lawyer.  
She will arrange everything.  So I was happy.  I saw the 
land.  And then I did not get any paperwork.  And then when 
I came back and then to see the lady and she told me that 
the papers – they are busy preparing for the papers, but 
we need to do the payment which is – I said to myself, 
okay, we will have to – that is the mother actually, she did 
not say I must do it, the mother said please, you go and 
20 
see Ms Mbanjwa, attorney, go and talk to her and then she 
will be the one who is going to prepare the papers, please 
do the payment.  It is exactly what I did, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So let me just get that right because it 
quite important, Mr Ndzeku.  So Ms Hlohlela told you to go 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 271 of 388 
 
and see Ms Mbanjwa, is that right? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So did Ms Mbanjwa put the agreement 
together?   
MR NDZEKU:   I think so, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   I am not sure …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you collect it from Ms Mbanjwa? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, when I came from there, I went straight 
to Ms Mbanjwa, and I told her that this is the situation and 
10 
Ms Mbanjwa said she also spoke to Ms Hlohlela and then 
there is payment supposed to be made and at the same 
time I will be getting the document from Ms Hlohlela. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right. 
MR NDZEKU:   Which is – what was also a very real 
rushing, that at least I must do the payment if I am 
interested which is, I did a payment to Ms Mbanjwa. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   My thinking, if maybe you are doing the 
payment in the attorney, the attorney keeps that money in 
20 
trust until such time the deal is done, that was my thinking, 
Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But the deal was done back in 2015, 
remember, and you only did the payment in May 2016, so 
the deal was done, you had signed it and then, as I 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 272 of 388 
 
understand it, you paid in May 2016, is that right? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, if you say the deal was done 2015 
maybe it was just negotiation. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, it was signed by Ms Hlohlela. 
MR NDZEKU:   Oh, signed.  I do not remember, sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You accept that. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay, yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So somewhere between mid-2015 when 
you met Ms Memela at the workshop and 1 November 2015 
when the agreement was signed you went to the land and 
10 
you also interacted with Ms Mbanjwa, is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   After I came back. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, after you came back. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   She put the agreement together, she 
drafted it and that is the agreement that you signed, 
correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Correct, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now you said at that meeting that the 
Chief was present and Ms Hlohlela was there, it was 
20 
confirmed for you there were not title deeds but you were 
told there would be other paperwork that you had received, 
correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   What are you saying now again, that…? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You were told at that meeting there was 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 273 of 388 
 
not a title deed for the property. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, yes, hundred percent, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But you would be given other paperwork 
I think you said. 
MR NDZEKU:   I will be getting other papers from Ms 
Mbanjwa, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  Did you ever get any other 
papers? 
MR NDZEKU:   I am sorry to say, I did not get any paper 
but I did do the payment. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who were you told would give you the 
other papers? 
MR NDZEKU:   Ms Hlohlela told me that please, I must go 
to Ms Mbanjwa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And she would give you the papers? 
MR NDZEKU:   And then she would give me the papers.  
What was it that I did not understand that she says to me 
please use Ms Kwinana as a reference.   I did not 
understand because this deal got nothing to do with Ms 
Kwinana, I am here with Ms Mbanjwa but you are telling me 
20 
that please use Ms Kwinana reference and then when I 
come to Ms Mbanjwa and say Ms Mbanjwa, Ms Hlohlela 
said this money must be paid in your account, I hope that it 
will be keeping trust, she says of course but you will have 
to use this reference of Ms Kwinana.   
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 274 of 388 
 
So I wanted to know why because for me it did not 
make sense.  They said there was a – I think there was an 
arrangement, a deal between Ms Memela and Ms Kwinana 
but I did not want to know because I am here to do this 
deal and I know that the money I am paying it is safe, it is 
in the hands of the attorney. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now there was one document that you 
did receive in addition to the sale agreement.  It was an 
affidavit from Ms Hlohlela.  Do you remember that?  It is 
the one I showed you earlier and, Mr Ndzeku, let me help 
10 
you remember, it is in the file in front of you, that is DD26 
at tab 6. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then you must just go to page 24. 
MR NDZEKU:   You said the tab what, tab 6? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Tab 6.  And then you must find page 24. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, 26A.  This says 26, 26, I do not see. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then page 24, Mr Ndzeku. 
MR NDZEKU:   Page 24? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  Do you have that?   
20 
MR NDZEKU:   I have got DD26. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes and then it says VAN and then it 
should 024, I am looking for 24 under tab 6. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay, 23, yes.  Ms Hlohlela…? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, this is an affidavit that you 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 275 of 388 
 
provided to the Commission which you said accompanied 
the sale agreement.  Do you recall that? 
MR NDZEKU:   You mean the page 24? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You have seen this document before? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I think I did see it, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.   It has Ms Hlohlela’s name at the 
top: 
“I, Nonsapo Georgina Hlohlela…” 
10 
It goes on to give some details about her and then if you 
go down to what is written in handwritten there, she says 
there: 
“I hereby sell immovable property to Mr Vuyisile 
Ndzeku.  The land is fully owned by me and I 
inherited from my parents Mr and Mrs Sholani.” 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR: 
“The land is situated at Mpindweni next  
to the Umzimvubu River in Tabankulu.” 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   
“The price of the land will be fully stated  
in the offer to purchase upon signing of the offer to 
purchase between myself and Mr Vuyo Ndzeku.  All 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 276 of 388 
 
the 
rights 
and 
risks 
to 
this 
property 
will 
be 
transferred to Mr Ndzeku.” 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then there is a signature. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you read this affidavit when you got 
it at the time? 
MR NDZEKU:   This one?   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   That is a good question.  I do not 
10 
remember, I do not remember. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But, Mr Ndzeku, your evidence a 
moment ago was you understood why you wanted title 
deeds and you were told you did not have title deeds so 
then you wanted to get some other papers to confirm what 
you were buying.  This is the only other paper you were 
given, was it not?  So why would you not have read it? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, this one actually does not have my 
signature. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No but it is the only evidence that Ms 
20 
Hlohlela can sell you anything that you were given  
MR NDZEKU:   Ms Hlohlela here at number 23, EXHIBIT 
23, and she is Hlohlela Nomsapo and then I was also given 
actually a page 22 by Ms Mbanjwa where I did the initial. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Mr Ndzeku, the document at page 24. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 277 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja, let us focus on that one, page 24. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is Ms Hlohlela’s declaration.  The 
question was, when you received this document did you 
read it? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, you know what, Chair, I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not? 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you read it …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   Because I was supposed to get this 
document from Ms Mbanjwa, as an attorney, but I am 
10 
reading it here now from the files. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say you were supposed to get it 
from her.  
MR NDZEKU:   From her. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Why do you say you were supposed to 
get it from her? 
MR NDZEKU:   Because I was told that she is the one who 
would be dealing with this paper of Ms Hlohlela. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but you did get it from you, did you 
not? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   This one? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Uh huh. 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I did not get it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I think you did, Mr Ndzeku, because you 
provided it to the Commission. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 278 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Where did I – can you please explain?  Can 
I just ask my representative because – please Chair, there 
are things I do not understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, he cannot assist you.  Have you not 
seen this document before? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, when the counsellor says I did 
actually provide this document to the Commission, that is 
why I am asking my team that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but did you – are you saying you 
have never seen it before today? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I am sorry to say this, Chair, it seems 
that it is the first time I have seen this document, if I 
remember very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you sure about that? 
MR NDZEKU:   I am not sure but I am thinking because I 
do not remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you – to your knowledge, did you 
ever receive from whoever a document signed by Ms 
Hlohlela in which she said she was selling immovable 
property to you and that the land is fully owned by her and 
20 
that she inherited the land from her parents? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, that document, Chair, sorry, I was 
supposed to get it from Ms Mbanjwa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say you have never received 
such a document? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 279 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   I did not receive it yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Making that description? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And saying that the land that she was 
selling to you is situated at Mpindweni. 
MR NDZEKU:   Mpindweni, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Next to the Umzimvubu River in 
Tabankulu. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have never received such a 
10 
document from anybody? 
MR NDZEKU:   Not now, no, nothing yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   Maybe my – I am sorry, Chair, I am thinking 
to get – because I paid that money on the trust of Ms 
Mbanjwa, I was expecting actually to get something like 
title deeds, which they told me that I am not going to get 
any title deeds.  Maybe I am confused there, I do not know, 
you know, I did not receive anything. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr? 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Your affidavit before this Commission 
says that you were given that affidavit by Ms Memela. 
MR NDZEKU:   Which one, this one? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   That is my affidavit. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 280 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That is your affidavit, the affidavit that 
you confirmed this morning, Mr Ndzeku.  In your affidavit 
before this Commission you say Ms Memela gave you that 
affidavit and the Commission received that affidavit when 
your legal representatives gave it to the Commission. 
MR NDZEKU:   I think my legal representative is supposed 
to explain to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Let us go to his affidavit. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just one second.  Yes? 
10 
ADV ALLI:  Chair, exactly that, I just wanted to suggest 
that Mr Ndzeku be taken through his affidavit in response 
to …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   To it, ja.  Ja, let us go to his affidavit 
where he deals with it. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So he actually deals with this in his main 
affidavit which is the one that appears right at the front of 
that file, DD26. 
MR NDZEKU:   DD26? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  And if you go there to page 
20 
000.12.  Point 12.  It is right at the beginning of the file, Mr 
Ndzeku, it is under tab 1. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Yes, 
your 
affidavit 
is 
the 
first 
…[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Document. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 281 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Document. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay, 001, what is it? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is where it starts. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, affidavit. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And if you go to page 12. 
Mpindweni next to the Umzimvubu River in Tabankulu. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is page 12, paragraph 55 that deals 
with …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   Is that DD26? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes and you are at page 12? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you will see at paragraph 55, just 
for the record and your benefit, Mr Ndzeku, I will read it 
into the record.  It is your affidavit, so you say: 
“I then entered into an agreement to purchase the 
property.” 
That is the property from Ms Hlohlela. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   
20 
“I have already submitted the documents to the 
Commissioned 
person 
and 
to 
the 
sale 
which 
included the offer to purchase.  Adv Memela 
subsequently gave me an affidavit from her mother 
which I also made over to the Commission.” 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 282 of 388 
 
And then you continue: 
The land is situated on tribal land and there is no 
title deed issued for it.  I am the true and lawful 
owner of the land.” 
MR NDZEKU:   Just a little bit slower please? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Sorry. 
ADV ALLI:  Sorry, Chair, if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Sorry? 
ADV ALLI:  Yes, my apologies, that is my recollection, 
there was a prior summons issued to Mr Ndzeku which 
10 
was, I think, earlier this year and he filed an affidavit in 
answer to that and that is the one I was suggesting 
perhaps that my learned friend take him to. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, would that clarify this more than 
this, this paragraph 55? 
ADV ALLI:  Well, let hear from… 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, let us hear about this first and if 
there is still an issue after we can take it from there.  Do 
you see – have you had a chance to read paragraph 55 of 
your affidavit at page 12? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   At page 12, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, have you had a change to read that 
paragraph? 
MR NDZEKU:   He says paragraph…? 
CHAIRPERSON:   55, the second paragraph on the page. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 283 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I can see that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you had a chance to look at it?  Ms 
Hofmeyr did read the whole …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   I am just reading. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, just read it quietly. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, it is here but what is written there, I 
do not know, I am sorry about that.  It is written and then 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is your memory refreshed now? 
MR NDZEKU:   On this one I do not remember but it is 
10 
here.  As Ms Hofmeyr, it was my affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is it that you do not remember?  Is 
that …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not remember, submitting, Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on, no, no, no, hang on?  
What you do not remember, is it your receiving Ms 
Hlohlela’s affidavit from Ms Memela or is it this paragraph 
that you do not remember – you do not remember saying 
this to your lawyers who drafted the affidavit? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, first of all, I do not remember.  I am 
20 
sorry saying this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not remember? 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not remember this paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not remember saying what is 
written in this paragraph? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 284 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   No, no, because I did not get any 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You never got that document? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I did not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Ndzeku, then how did your lawyers 
get the document? 
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You did not get the document, how did 
you lawyers get the document to give the document to the 
Commission? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I think maybe they can just explain 
because they are here.  I do not remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, but you …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   Maybe they can help me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are their client. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They get instructions from you, they are 
here – you remember earlier on I said they cannot tell you 
the facts, you know the facts, you know what happened, 
they can advise on the law.  Now how …[intervenes] 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   You know, Chair – Chair, it says here I 
enter into agreement, purchase the property.  I have 
already submitted the document of the Commissioner on 
the sale which included the offer to purchase.  I did not get 
offer to purchase, as that letter(?) says.  So I did not get 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 285 of 388 
 
it, so I do not know …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yu did not get even the offer to 
purchase? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, Mr Ndzeku, you confirmed you 
signed the offer to purchase.  You confirmed that you read 
it.  You confirmed not …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja, did I confirm that I did? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay, can you …[intervenes] 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, I do note when - time flies when 
you are having fun, so to speak, it is now twenty past four. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I know that you did say that you would 
be available to sit a bit later and we did notify all of the 
attendees today that that would be the case. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I am very eager to conclude, if we could. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But I wonder if a break now would be 
appropriate. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, let me check with the legal team for 
Mr Ndzeku.  Is it fine if we proceed and see – how much 
time do you think you need to finish? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair, I imagine I will finish in an hour.  
What I am going to propose to do is be swifter now.   
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 286 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   We have got through a lot of the 
background. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I am simply going to put certain aspects 
to Mr Ndzeku for his comment. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So I think an hour. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Would you be able to – shall we 
continue for an hour subject to a short adjournment now? 
10 
ADV ALLI:  Yes, Chair, I think Mr Ndzeku needs the 
adjournment also. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV ALLI:  Ten minute adjournment then we can – we 
would like to go quickly as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright.  We will take – I am 
sure Mr Ndzeku is happy to hear we will try and finish.  He 
wants to finish. 
MR NDZEKU:   I want to finish, thank you very much, 
Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, we are going to take a short 
adjournment.  It is twenty one minutes past.  We will take 
and adjournment and resume at twenty five to five and then 
we will go on until we finish.  We adjourn. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.

INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us continue. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, Chair.  Mr Ndzeku, I am 
going to endeavour speed things up a little bit because I 
know we have reached the end of the day and I know that 
you are eager to have this evidence behind you. 
 
What I would like to indicate to you at this point is 
that the Commission has obtained from Chief Sigcau and 
the Chief says he has never ever met you.  He has not met 
10 
with you, he has not discussed the sale of this land by Ms 
Hlohlela with you, it is a very detailed affidavit and I can 
take you to it, if we need to.   
So he says, that meeting that you have told us 
about today did not happen.  What is your response to 
that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, …[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Switch on your mic.  Switch on your mic, 
ja. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, the same Chief who is saying he 
20 
never met me, there is one of investigating officer who 
went to see them, an African one, I do not know what is his 
name.  He started to ask them a lot of questions.  After 
that they told me that they do not want anything to do with 
the Commission.   
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 288 of 388 
 
Somebody left here and he went there.  They gave 
me the gentleman’s name, I do not what his name and they 
went, he asked questions about the signature, about the 
sign, they said gentlemen, anything that has got to do with 
Zondo Commission, we do not want to know.  We do not 
know those people.  We do not want to know them.  It is 
exactly what they told me.   
Who told me, by the way, is Themba.  Themba told 
me that we had visitors.  We do not have money to go to 
Zondo Commission, we do not want to be on the news.  
10 
That is all I can say that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Sorry, I need to understand who these 
people 
are. 
 
Sorry, 
Chair, 
unless 
– 
who 
from 
the 
Commission spoke to who and who spoke to you, can you 
please help us there? 
MR NDZEKU:   I repeat, one of the guys from Mpindweni, 
his name is Themba, Themba Njoka told me that one of the 
Commission investigator officers, an African chap, was 
there.  He started to ask them all the questions and he 
says, Mr Ndzeku, we want to tell you, we do not want to be 
20 
famous.  Anything that has got to do with Commission, we 
do not want to know.  So please, we do not know you.  We 
do not want to talk to you and I say I understand. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What do you say about the fact that the 
local Chief there has deposed to an affidavit and said it is 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 289 of 388 
 
not true that he was ever in a meeting with you? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, what I am saying now, Chair, when 
Themba Njoka told me this and I knew that maybe the 
Chief does not – I met – I do not even know, maybe the 
gentlemen he was a Chief or what but I was there, I met 
the people, that is why Themba told me that this is the 
situation, there is investigation and the people from the 
Commission they were there, so please, Mr Ndzeku, we do 
not want to be famous, that is all.  Now you are asking me 
what do I say about that?   I do not know, Chair.  Maybe 
10 
they do not want to know anything about this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So is your evidence that Chief Sigcau 
has lied in his affidavit that he has placed before this 
Commission?   
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I cannot say he lied but when I got – 
first of all, Chair, the gentlemen I met – I do not know 
maybe it is Chief Sigcau or maybe it is another man 
because I am not from that place but I was introduced to 
the man and this man is the Chief.  So when they are 
20 
saying this guy is the Chief, I must believe, you see?  That 
is the bottom line.  I can say if maybe he was not or maybe 
he was or maybe I am saying he is lying or maybe he is not 
lying, I do not know, Chair. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   He goes on and he says the traditional 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 290 of 388 
 
structures have had no dealings at all with you or Ms 
Hlohlela.  He also say that Ms Hlohlela has no land in 
Mpindweni area which she could ever have sold to you.  
Are you aware of all of that, that that is version, Mr 
Ndzeku? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well when, again, Themba told me that this 
is the situation, nobody wants to know anything about me 
and then not about Ms Hlohlela but they told me that 
anything is coming with the Commission, they want to be 
far away. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Now I do not know what to say, counsellor 
on that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I must say, Mr Ndzeku, one of the 
features that I found strange with regard to what you said 
about that meeting is that you said the meeting involving 
the local chief was at Ms Hlohlela’s house. 
MR NDZEKU:   House, yes.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now I have grown up in rural areas, I 
know the – our people in rural areas under Chiefs live 
20 
…[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   The protocol, I understand as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   If you need to talk to the Chief you are 
the one who must go to the Chief’s place, it is not the 
Chief who must come to you. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 291 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So if I need to – I need the Chief to be 
involved in a matter that I am discussing with you, I will 
take you to the Chief in his house, I will not call the Chief 
to come to my house so that we can meet him in my house.  
That is not unusual – that is unusual. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, it is true but today you find that even 
the politicians, they go knock and knock to people’s house 
when they are looking for a vote.  What relationship did he 
had with Ms Hlohlela, I do not know, but I was told. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
MR NDZEKU:   But, as an African, I know that.  They were 
supposed to take me to the Chief. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To the Chief, ja. 
MR NDZEKU:   Not the Chief comes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   And then, again, they ask you did you bring 
anything 
for 
the 
Chief, 
[indistinct] 
06.40 
or 
maybe 
anything, is exactly the proper call.  But it was not like 
that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   I understand, Chair, where you come from, 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Ndzeku, I want to put one last point 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 292 of 388 
 
to you on this – and Chair, just for the record, I do not 
suggest we go there but Chief Sigcau’s affidavit is at page 
238 under tab 19 and if we could just enter that into the 
record, it is the affidavit deposed to by Chief Sigcau and it 
is number 19. 
MR NDZEKU:   What is it, tab …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right at the end of that file, Mr Ndzeku. 
MR NDZEKU:   What tab? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Tab 19, one nine. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But what I do want to just put to you in 
fairness, Mr Ndzeku, is that …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   Just wait, you said number…? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Tab 19 right at the end and it starts at 
page 283. 
MR NDZEKU:   282? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   283. 
MR NDZEKU:   283, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You have that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I am learning today, I never knew that 
20 
I could sit here and – 283, hey? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I have got it here. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Ndzeku, it is an affidavit comprising 
eight pages and what I want to put to you is, this is a very 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 293 of 388 
 
detailed affidavit.  The Chief went to extensive lengths in 
assisting the Commission in putting this together.  He 
describes Ms Hlohlela, he describes the Sholani family 
from which she comes.  He describes who she married and 
where that family is located. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   He goes through the records of the 
traditional council.   
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   He talks about how land is dealt with in 
10 
the area.  He goes into detail about the processes that 
have to be followed and then he concludes and says he 
has never met with you, the traditional council has never 
been approached about the sale of this land.  Ms Hlohlela 
in fact had no land in the Mpindweni area in which she 
could have concluded any agreement at all and he 
concludes by saying the most that he has ever authorised 
for use of land in his area is the matter of hundreds of 
rands. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   He has never known of R2.5 million 
acquisition of land in his area and I want to put it to you 
that your explanation of the Chief’s affidavit is that you 
were contacted by Mr Themba Njoka. 
MR NDZEKU:   Themba Njoka, yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 294 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Who said to you we do not want to have 
anything to do with the Commission.   
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well, I will put it to you that Chief 
Sigcau’s affidavit is not the affidavit of a man who wants to 
have nothing to do with this Commission, he has gone to 
extensive lengths and in great detail to explain what 
happens in his area of administration. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you have a comment on that? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, the affidavit that he has 
provided to the Commission seems to reflect a person who 
wants to be as helpful to the Commission as possible. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Rather than somebody who wants to 
disassociate himself from the Commission. 
MR NDZEKU:   I can see here, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, what do you say? 
MR NDZEKU:   I can see it is well written.  Well, 
counsellor, as I said, I was there, I was introduced and 
20 
then as I was introduced to this gentleman and then after 
that they told me that there is a person from Zondo 
Commission went there, they want to – this gentleman, he 
cannot say that, the way I look at it, he wants to help, this 
is the truth and again, Chair, as you are saying, you do not 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 295 of 388 
 
call the Chief, you go to the Chief.  It is a fact.   
So I am a little bit confused exactly what happened 
that day.  Maybe I am wrong or maybe it was not the Chief, 
I do not know what to say. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Ndzeku, I am going to put it to you 
that nothing happened on that day, that there was no 
meeting at all and I am going to take you through further 
evidence which I am going to submit to you in due course 
for your comment, shows that there was no meeting that 
you had and I would like to start that with the affidavit of 
10 
Ms Buckley. 
MR NDZEKU:   Ms? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Buckley. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe before that, Ms Hofmeyr, with 
regard to this land, what did you say again was the reason 
why you were interested in it? 
MR NDZEKU:   Chair, we actually wanted to do the same 
thing there grow, in Lesotho is doing, the company grow 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You wanted to grow cannabis? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, the cannabis yes, is exactly what we 
wanted to do on that land. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
MR NDZEKU:   Which it actually suits us because it is not 
far from the river. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 296 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   But when you talk about the price as the 
counsellor said really in the land you don’t get more than 
R100 or maybe R200 you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   You know, why should we pay the money 
you know, we want to do exactly what, that was the project. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have already said that when you 
were told that there would be no title deed you accepted 
that.  What that meant was that, there would be no 
10 
ownership as you know, do you remember that, the kind of 
ownership of land that you know is one that is represented 
by a title deed. 
MR NDZEKU:   Title deeds, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now were you ever told what right 
you would have in the land if you were not going to be the 
owner of the land as you know ownership of land? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, as a person who’s not from that 
place, the gentleman told that I will have to involve people 
who are from that area, I cannot be alone, I’ll have to work 
20 
with them.  I go back again, when I left there, as the 
counsellor says, I want to tell you that, there was no 
meeting, never meeting take place I was told that I must go 
straight to Ms Mbanjwa, I’ll be getting the papers there but 
when I arrived there to Ms Mbanjwa, again I was told that I 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 297 of 388 
 
must do the payment.  Now something I forgot again, when 
we left here we went to the tea break, the counsellor was 
asking me about – I forgot what she was asking me, and I 
said, I don’t remember but when I was outside and I could 
remember this document that Ms Memela Nontsasa, gave 
me this document…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The affidavit? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, affidavit because I said to counsellor, 
no I don’t remember but now…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now you remember it? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   It comes back that she gave me the 
document 
in 
front 
of 
that 
lady 
but 
to 
the 
question…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In front of which lady? 
MR NDZEKU:   In front of Ms Mbanjwa, you know, because 
I was actually to get…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who gave it to you? 
MR NDZEKU:   It’s Ms Memela. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Memela? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Gave it to you in front of Ms Mbanjwa? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  t was not Ms Mbanjwa who gave it to 
you?  
MR NDZEKU:  I think that was the affidavit – no, no it was 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 298 of 388 
 
Ms Memela, if I remember very well.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright. 
MR NDZEKU:   But you know it was in February, you know 
I don’t remember very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, what were you told, the papers that 
you would get from Ms Mbanjwa, would be saying, they 
would be proof of what? 
MR NDZEKU:   It would be proof of owning that piece of 
land which it’s got, actually, the numbers, they said it must 
be J or maybe F, that’s exactly what they told me but I 
10 
cannot be involved I’ll have to involve the local people but 
in the title deeds, it’s going to be the company. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Were you told that those papers would 
be proof of your ownership of the land, is that what you 
were told? 
MR NDZEKU:   That’s exactly what I was told. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And who told you that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Ms Hlohlela. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hlohlela? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did she tell you what those papers are 
called that would give you ownership or she just referred to 
papers? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, no, she says these papers they’ll be 
proof of the ownership but the person who can actually 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 299 of 388 
 
prepare the document it is Ms Mbanjwa, as an attorney. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, so you were made to believe 
that Ms Mbanjwa would give you documents that would 
make you owner of the land? 
MR NDZEKU:   Of the land yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and now, is the only document that 
you’ve got the one that you say that you got from Ms 
Memela, that affidavit? 
MR NDZEKU:   Affidavit yes but I didn’t have a problem 
Chair, because the money is in the trust of the lawyer, the 
10 
money…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, no we’ll come to that. 
MR NDZEKU:   This is exactly what I was thinking. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We’ll come to that.  So, that’s the only 
document you’ve got and you didn’t get it from Ms 
Mbanjwa, you got it from Ms Memela? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I think so, if I remember very well yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You never got any document from Ms 
Mbanjwa? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I don’t remember. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I don’t remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You don’t remember? 
MR NDZEKU:   I don’t remember yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, now obviously the document that 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 300 of 388 
 
you got, namely, the affidavit from – by Ms Hlohlela 
[16.57], have I got the surname wrong there. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Hlohlela yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Obviously when you got that document 
you would have wanted to scrutinise it to see whether it 
gave you the ownership of the land that you were told it 
would give you, isn’t it? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Did you scrutinise it? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, what I did, I think I did actually 
10 
discuss it with my lawyers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes soon after getting it? 
MR NDZEKU:   After they gave – I did discuss it with them 
and then they look at it and then their advice is for me to 
go again to Ms Mbanjwa, the one actually who’s got the 
money, you know, because I’m expecting to get the 
papers…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, before you went to your 
lawyers, when you scrutinised it, did you believe that it 
gave you ownership of the land or not? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, Chair to be honest, it was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was not? 
MR NDZEKU:   It was not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   In my thinking I needed something like a 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 301 of 388 
 
title deed but it was not something like that it did say J – 
they did, actually tell me the name of the size, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and after you had scrutinised it, 
and you’re not satisfied with it, you went to your lawyers? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I cannot say I’m not satisfied because 
what we did, I was still expecting more papers from Ms 
Mbanjwa. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You were still expecting more? 
MR NDZEKU:   More papers yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, because the madam says to me, listen, 
she’s there to fix everything, she’s talking to us. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, you had no problem with this 
affidavit? 
MR NDZEKU:   I did not have because I believed that I was 
getting more papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, you were still expecting more 
papers. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you did not get any papers, did you 
20 
ask for papers from Ms Mbanjwa? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I asked Ms Memela, that I’m still 
waiting for the papers…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you had not been told to – that you’d 
get the papers from Memela, isn’t it?  You had been told 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 302 of 388 
 
you will get them from… [indistinct 19.14]. 
MR NDZEKU:   Why I’m asking her because, she’s the one, 
actually, who gave me that other one. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you never asked Ms Mbanjwa, 
is that right? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not? 
MR NDZEKU:   If I remember, I did not, I was waiting that, 
at 
least 
she 
must 
call 
me 
because 
she 
said 
she…[intervenes]. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you asked Ms Memela, did you 
specifically say to her, the document you have given me 
doesn’t give me ownership of the land, where are the 
papers that give me ownership of the land, did you say 
that? 
MR 
NDZEKU: 
 
 
Well, 
I 
did 
say 
that 
Chair, 
and…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what did she say? 
MR NDZEKU:   And she says to me, Ms Mbanjwa, is the 
one, actually, who’s going to…[intervenes]. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And this would have been 2016, when 
would that have been? 
MR NDZEKU:   I don’t recall Chair. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 303 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But…[intervenes]. 
MR NDZEKU:   During that time yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Probably 2016 because you were in the 
meeting in the Eastern Cape – it was the end of 2015. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I think so, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Right, so it would have been, either 
2015 or 2016. 
MR NDZEKU:   Somewhere there Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, and how long did you wait for these 
other papers or are you still waiting? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   I’m still waiting, as I’m sitting here Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It’s 2020 now, Mr Ndzeku. 
MR NDZEKU:   I’m still waiting Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are still waiting for papers? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   From Ms Mbanjwa? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I’m still waiting. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And yet you have never gone to her? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I didn’t get anything yet. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you’ve never gone to her. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   No, no, Chair, she told me she is going to 
give me a call. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Huh? 
MR NDZEKU:   She phoned me, she told me she was going 
to phone me, she said, please I’ll give you a call or maybe 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 304 of 388 
 
I’ll liaise with your attorneys. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And she was telling you in 2016? 
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:   She was telling you this in 2016? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, not 2016 again, I met her again, same 
time she was here again with Ms Memela…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Here at the Commission? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, at the Commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR NDZEKU:   And I asked her, listen we are talking now, I 
10 
don’t have any papers, she says, listen we are still waiting 
I’ll give you a call. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And where did you meet her on this 
occasion when she was giving evidence, did you come to 
the Commission yourself or? 
MR NDZEKU:   I was here the whole week with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, you were here. 
MR NDZEKU:   The whole week and then…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, so you asked her, where are my 
papers? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, and then the counsellor came to me 
and said, listen Mr Ndzeku I’m sorry…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what did she say? 
MR NDZEKU:   I was here the whole week. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And what did she say? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 305 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   She said to me, she’s still working on the 
papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Mbanjwa? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, you have been waiting for about four 
years for…[intervenes]. 
MR NDZEKU:   For the papers yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For the papers? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And have you ever gone back to the land 
10 
and see whether nobody is using it? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, Chair, let me repeat again about this 
gentleman who phoned me, Mr Joko and then there’s 
nobody that wants to use the land because people they 
don’t have any funding, they’re looking for jobs.  So, my 
question to him now, if you guys, you are saying, you don’t 
want anything to do, what is happening now, he says, 
listen we are looking for the job, he’s talking about the 
land.  Chair, in the homeland if the land is there, the land 
is there, nobody’s going to buy the land because people 
20 
they don’t have funding. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And now, did you – did you ask Ms 
Mbanjwa when she was giving evidence here, whether she 
was still keeping the money you paid into – in her trust 
account? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 306 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I did not ask her that, I’m still waiting 
for the papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But did you ask her whether your money 
is still safe? 
MR NDZEKU:   No Chair, I did not ask.  
CHAIRPERSON:   You didn’t ask? 
MR NDZEKU:   I’m asking Ms Mbanjwa…[indistinct 22.50] 
our agreement, please I am here now that at least, can we 
finalise because I’m still waiting and she says, no, no, no 
I’ll call your lawyers and then she did actually introduced 
10 
herself to the lawyers and then I’m still waiting Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ms Hofmeyr? 
MR NDZEKU:   As far as I’m thinking my money it’s safe 
because it’s in the trust…[intervenes]. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, Mr Ndzeku it can’t be in the trust 
account because the agreement tells you it’s going to be 
paid out to Ms Memela for her property. 
MR NDZEKU:   I can’t – what are you saying? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I said to you, you can’t have formed the 
view that it was in the trust account because your own sale 
20 
agreement says that the money is going to be paid out to 
purchase a property for Ms Memela. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I saw that, this is exactly what the 
Chair was asking me, did you read it and I said, I don’t 
know this to be honest…[intervenes]. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 307 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So, your version, first, was that you read 
it and then your version, is now, that you did not read it or 
you did not read it properly? 
MR NDZEKU:   I did not read it properly. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, so you signed an agreement in 
November of 2015 that you didn’t read properly, is that 
correct? [intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Involving R2.5million. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Could you say yes, just for the record. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then you paid R2.5million in May of 
2016. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Without having received the papers that 
would confirm that you had any title to that land, correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Correct. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, Chair, if I may move to Ms 
Buckley.  Ms Buckley is a handwriting expert, she has been 
consulted by the Commission, she was shown a series of 
signatures from Ms Hlohlela. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Numerous signatures of Ms Hlohlela’s 
over time when she’d applied for SASSA grants when she 
had opened bank accounts and then she was provided with 
the two documents related to this sale, the agreement, that 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 308 of 388 
 
there is her signature and the affidavit that bears her 
signature and she was asked to do a handwriting analysis.  
That affidavit was provided to Mr Ndzeku in advance of 
today because it was expert evidence and we gave Mr 
Ndzeku an opportunity to dispute the evidence of Ms 
Buckley.  Mr Ndzeku your attorneys informed us you did 
not intend to dispute the evidence of Ms Buckley, you have 
accordingly produced no contrary expert evidence and so 
we informed your lawyers about a week or two ago that it 
would be presented to the Commission as uncontested 
10 
evidence.  So, Mr Ndzeku were you surprised to learn, Ms 
Buckley’s conclusion, Chair, I haven’t got there because 
it’s so clear in my own mind…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I was about to say, you must tell him 
what it says. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So, I’m going to tell you what her 
conclusion was.  Her method is to call the two signatures 
on the agreement and the affidavit that Mr Ndzeku provided 
to the Commission as the questioned signatures, she’s 
questioning their authenticity right and she compares it to 
20 
all of the other signatures that we’ve obtained from records 
of home affairs and SASSA etcetera and she says she 
concludes that they are not Ms Hlohlela’s signature, the 
genuine signatures have consistency over time, I think we 
went over a period of about 20 years of Ms Hlohlela’s 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 309 of 388 
 
signatures.  She says the signatures that appear on the 
sale agreement and the affidavit, related to this property 
purchase in the Eastern Cape are not the signatures of Ms 
Hlohlela.  Mr Ndzeku did you see that affidavit and 
consider it before today? 
MR NDZEKU:   Where’s that page again? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I can tell you where it is, now Chair, 
we’re going to move to a new item, Chair, and you’ll 
actually find it in the second file, now you need to go to 
DD26, the second file. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   DD26? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, and its tab…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The smaller file? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   The smaller file exactly, Mr Ndzeku it 
will be the smaller file. 
MR NDZEKU:   Oh, the smaller one, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, and the fist tab there is tab 20, 
you’ll see it’s an affidavit of Lourika Buckley, the forensic 
document examiner and it starts at page 292, do you have 
that? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja I’ve got 292 yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Now that’s the affidavit that was provided 
to your attorneys in which we understand from your 
attorneys you said you did not dispute.  Did you read this 
affidavit Mr Ndzeku?  
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 310 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   I did not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You did not? 
MR NDZEKU:   Did they send it to my attorneys? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja I did not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You did not? 
MR NDZEKU:   No. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But you don’t dispute…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you sure about that? 
MR NDZEKU:   I’m very sure Chair, it’s the first time, 
10 
actually, I’m seeing this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You have quite often said you are not – 
you can’t remember, today you have said that a number of 
times, is it possible that you can’t remember that you saw 
this affidavit? 
MR NDZEKU:   No Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not see it? 
MR NDZEKU:   I didn’t see it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did see it? 
MR NDZEKU:   I did not. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did not, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I’m quite concerned Mr Ndzeku, your 
attorneys – your legal representatives can only act on 
instructions from you right.  They communicated to the 
Commission that you did not intend to furnish any affidavit 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 311 of 388 
 
to dispute Ms Buckley’s affidavit, how could they possibly 
have given that information to the Commission unless they 
discussed Ms Buckley’s affidavit with you and got your 
attitude to it? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well I’m happy they are here, maybe you 
can ask them because…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe – let me ask this question, do you 
remember your attorneys or your counsel saying to you, 
there’s an affidavit by a handwriting expert who has 
deposed to an affidavit who says that, after comparing the 
10 
signature that is said to be that of Ms Hlohlela, in the offer 
to purchase and in the affidavit that you got from Ms 
Memela…[intervenes]. 
MR NDZEKU:   I don’t remember. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And other signatures of hers, the expert 
has come to the conclusion that the signature on the 
affidavit and the signature on the offer to purchase is not 
that of Ms Hlohlela, do you remember them saying anything 
like that to you? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, nothing, it’s the first time I’m seeing 
20 
this document. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but I’m asking a different question, 
I’m asking whether – let’s assume they did not give you the 
affidavit to read but maybe they did say to you, the 
Commission has given us an affidavit by a handwriting 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 312 of 388 
 
expert and they told you what the handwriting expert says 
and maybe they said to you, in our opinion there is no 
basis to dispute this, do you remember them saying 
anything along those lines maybe? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well I don’t remember very well. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you certainly say you are seeing this 
affidavit…[intervenes]. 
MR NDZEKU:   For the first time yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   For the first time? 
MR NDZEKU:   This is the first time I’m seeing this 
10 
affidavit of Ms Buckley, you know the first time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, Ms Hofmeyr?  
ADV HOFMEYR:   So, you, learn today then, Mr Ndzeku, 
that the signature on the sale agreement and the affidavit 
of Ms Hlohlela, is a forgery? 
MR NDZEKU:   I know today, as you are saying to me. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, you didn’t know that before today, 
is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  No, I didn’t know.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Despite the fact that your legal 
20 
representatives communicated your attitude to this affidavit 
to the Commission, is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Correct, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do they act without your instructions 
then, Mr Ndzeku? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 313 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did they act without your instructions? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe, without instructions, is too legal. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right, did they decide of their own 
accord. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In other words, to the extent that they 
told the Commission that you will not be disputing what is 
written in this affidavit, were they just acting on their own 
without having discussed that with you? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well I don’t remember, actually, discussing 
10 
with them, they are here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR NDZEKU:   I don’t remember discussing it with them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay, so you learn today that it’s a 
forgery and does that concern you Mr Ndzeku? 
MR NDZEKU:   It does, it does yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Because then it’s not a genuine 
agreement is it? 
MR NDZEKU:   It is not. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It’s not, let’s go to the affidavit that you 
did receive, according to your version, around 2015 or 
2016, remember that’s the affidavit of Ms Hlohlela that’s a 
forgery, we’ve now established…[intervenes]. 
MR NDZEKU:   In the same DD26? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 314 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, and you’ll find it in the other file, 
the big file DD26, again under tab 6. 
MR NDZEKU:   On the? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Under tab 6. 
MR NDZEKU:   6 ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   What is the…[intervenes]. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And its page 24 you’ll find the affidavit. 
MR NDZEKU:   You’ll find the 026 and then 26 hey? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   24. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   24? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, do you have it Mr Ndzeku. 
MR NDZEKU:   Did you say 22 or 24? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   24. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I can see. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you have it? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, page 24 yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now, you’ve given us various versions 
about this affidavit over the course of the day.  I 
understand your most recent version after the break of 10 
20 
minutes a little while ago that you now do remember that 
you were given this affidavit back in  2015 or 2016, 
correct, and you told the Chair, how that happened was, 
Ms Memela handed it over to you and Ms Mbanjwa was 
there, do you recall that? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 315 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   I think so yes, I recall yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, so you have a clear memory of that 
do you? 
MR NDZEKU:   I think so yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Thank you. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Now did you read this affidavit when you 
were given it? 
MR NDZEKU:   A good question, I did not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You did not? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So here you are, you’re going to buy 
land for…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you said you scrutinised it Mr 
Ndzeku, when I asked you. 
MR NDZEKU:   No, this one of 23, page 24? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I didn’t say I scrutinised it Chair, I 
didn’t say that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you saying you did not say that? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   No, what I said Chair, when counsellor was 
asking me, is it the first time you see this document 
because she asked me…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no Mr Ndzeku, I asked you the 
question, you remember you said – and it’s not so long 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 316 of 388 
 
ago, you said you received this from Ms Memela. 
MR 
NDZEKU: 
 
 
Yes, 
I 
did 
yes, 
this 
is 
the 
same…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on, hang on. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   After we had, had a break you said 
during the break you remembered. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That you did receive it from Ms Memela. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I even asked you whether you did not 
receive it from Ms Mbanjwa and you said, no you received 
it from Ms Memela. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes, I remember very well Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   In the presence of Ms Mbanjwa. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then I asked you – then you said 
you took it to your lawyers, I said before you took it to your 
lawyers, you must have scrutinised it, did you scrutinise it, 
you said to me yes. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I did read it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I even – I said to you, you were not 
satisfied with it, you corrected me, you said,  no it was not 
that you were not satisfied with it, you said you were 
satisfied with it because you were still expecting more 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 317 of 388 
 
papers. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, it’s very true, I remember yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, but now you have just said you did 
not read it but you also said you did…[intervenes]. 
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry Chair, my mind is – it’s been a long 
day. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay so what is the final position, 
did you read it or did you not read it? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I did read it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You did read it, okay, Ms Hofmeyr? 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You would have seen there in the second 
line, the handwritten second line where a description is 
given about the land, the person who wrote this, who’s not 
Ms Hlohlela, because we’ve established that through the 
handwriting expert…[intervenes]. 
MR NDZEKU:   The person who read this is not Ms 
Hlohlela? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, the handwriting experts already 
resolved that for us.  The person who wrote this, in the 
second line there where the handwriting appears said, 
20 
“The land is fully owned by me, that’s Ms Hlohlela, 
and I inherited it from my parents, Mr and Mrs 
Sholane”, 
 
Not let’s just stop there.  When you read that, didn’t 
you 
react 
because 
as 
I 
understand 
your 
evidence, 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 318 of 388 
 
previously, it had been made clear to you in your alleged 
meeting with Chief Sigcau that she did not own land, this 
was tribal land. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well when she says, she owns the land and 
then she inherited, it’s land from her family, I was thinking 
that it’s her land. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, but you’ve just been told, she didn’t 
own it, so why did you not react, you were about to pay 
R2.5million for a property, that at a meeting with the chief, 
you were told she didn’t own and now you’re being told she 
10 
does? 
CHAIRPERSON:   There may be a lot of confusion about 
what happened in that meeting, if that meeting did take 
place.  You will remember, Ms Hofmeyr, that at some stage 
you put something to him on your recollection of his 
evidence that suggested that he was told, I think, and I 
may be wrong now, that Ms Hlohlela owned the land and I 
said to him, my recollection is that he said Mr Hlohlela said 
to him, the chief owned the land and then he said, that is 
Mr Ndzeku, he was told that Ms Hlohlela owned the 
20 
land…[intervenes]. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Oh, I did not pick that up Chair, maybe 
we can just clarify that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  So, was your understanding 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 319 of 388 
 
that she did own the land? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I did ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, then why…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But there will be no title deeds. 
MR NDZEKU:   There will be no title deeds no. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Then why were you engaging with the 
traditional authorities? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, when I went there, to Ms Hlohlela, 
she’s the one actually who decided to bring those. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you notice anything else about this 
10 
affidavit when you got it, Mr Ndzeku, I know that, that’s 
something of a leading question but won’t you just tell us, 
what’s the date on which it was commissioned, you’ll find 
that at the bottom of the page? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well something was not – I don’t 
understand it seems that they were – I’m scratching 
somewhere there, you know…[intervenes]. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But right at the bottom of the page 
there’s a date under the Commissioner of Oaths signature, 
can you tell us what date that is? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   I can see the date here. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, 2015/09/22, do you see that? 
MR NDZEKU:   I can see that, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So that’s the 22 n d of September 2015. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 320 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   There’s another date on that page, it’s 
the date that is in the typed section of the document above 
the signature of the Commissioner of Oaths, can you tell us 
what that date is? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well this is…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The year. 
MR NDZEKU:   The year? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Hmm. 
MR NDZEKU:   It’s 2015/05/09/22 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, and above that, there’s another 
10 
date. 
MR NDZEKU:   It’s the same of the stamp. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, it is the same as the stamp but it’s 
different to the other date on the page and that’s the date 
that’s in the typed section of the affidavit above the 
signature of the Commissioner of Oaths, can you see that? 
CHAIRPERSON:   You see under Hlohlela, under the 
signature of Ms Hlohlela, then you have got a certificate of 
the Commissioner of Oaths which say…[intervenes]. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, thank you Chair, but I don’t see the 
20 
date, I can see only 2019. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you, that’s all I wanted. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, that’s what he wants ja. 
MR NDZEKU:   I didn’t see because…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s why I said the year, to help you. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 321 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did that catch your attention when you 
were looking at this affidavit in 2015, scrutinising it, 
according to your evidence? 
MR NDZEKU:   I did not? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You did not pick that up? 
MR NDZEKU:   I did not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, well it caught our attention as the 
Commission, so – my tireless investigators who sit here 
10 
and do this day in and day out engaged with the station 
Commissioner at Mount Frere Police Station because you’ll 
see it’s a stamp from the Mount Frere Police Station and 
asked how it could be possible that an affidavit deposed to 
in September of 2015…[intervenes]. 
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry counsellor, is this stamp from 
community service, you said it’s from Mount Frere? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, you will see just below the date it 
says Mount Frere.   
MR NDZEKU:  Oh yes I can see yes, yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay.  It is the South African Police 
Service in Mount Frere. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So the commission engaged with the 
Station Commissioner and tried to understand how there 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 322 of 388 
 
could be an affidavit generated in September of 2015. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That would bear a date in this – in the 
typed section of the affidavit of 2019.  Chair those affidavits 
from the various members of the station in Mount Frere have 
been provided.  Chair I would like to just give you those 
references.  They actually appear after the affidavit of Ms 
Buckley that we were just dealing with.  Chair I do not 
suggest we go there in the interest of time just for the 
record’s purposes there are two affidavits and they appear 
10 
as items 22 and item 23.  They are the affidavit of the 
Station Commissioner himself Ms Mhlamanzana and then – 
sorry Ms Mhlamanzana and then a second affidavit from a 
Captain in the same police service Mr Sandla.  Now in the 
interest of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just give the spelling of those surnames? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the benefit of the transcribers. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mhlamanzana is M-h-l-a-m-a-n-z-a-n-a and 
the affidavit of Mr Sandla is S-a-n-d-l-a. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Chair again in the interest of time I am 
going to summarise.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  The essence of their evidence is the 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 323 of 388 
 
following.  This affidavit that was provided to Mr Ndzeku is a 
standard form affidavit that the police station has put 
together. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  They even give us the template copy as an 
annexure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  They say that it is changed every year to 
bear the date for the year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It is accessible on a particular computer 
two computers in a particular area of the police station but 
then lots of copies of it are made – hard copies and they are 
put in the police station and they are put in the community 
service area for the use of the general public when they 
come in. 
MR NDZEKU:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  They say on occasion the year can be 
wrong that 2019 for example and that happens when at the 
beginning of a new year you have some old ones from the 
20 
last year and rather than printing the new ones you use the 
old ones and then they scratch out 2019 and they put in 
hand 2020. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But the evidence from the Station 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 324 of 388 
 
Commissioner is that in 2015 it is impossible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That there was a document that was used 
that bore the date of 2019 from the Mount Frere police 
stations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Ndzeku that suggested this affidavit 
was forged in 2019 does it not? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well Counsellor I also ask Ms Memela 
because I could see there are things they are scratched 
10 
here.  I did not understand why these things are scratched.  I 
also asked about the 2019 because I was also confused why 
there is 2015 – 2019 and I was told that this is an error.  It 
happened they did not have stamps you know.  That is 
exactly what happened. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Ndzeku your evidence a moment ago. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Was that you did not pick up this date 
discrepancy.  Now you are telling the commission… 
MR NDZEKU:  Well…. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  That you picked it up and that you spoke to 
Ms Memela about it. 
MR NDZEKU:  No, no but… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Ndzeku… 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no but… 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 325 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Your evidence before this commission is 
dishonest. 
MR NDZEKU:  But Counsellor.  Counsellor I do not know 
what you want me to say?  Do you want me to – you know 
what this is exactly the only time I am sitting and reading 
these things. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  I did not actually see the errors but now you 
are telling me about these things.  Did I see it, did I read it. 
Chair did you ask me did you scrutinise it?  I say I did.  But 
10 
those dates I did not even look at it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you just said you did get confused 
about it and you did ask and you were told it was an error. 
MR NDZEKU:  After.  After I see this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  When?  When? 
MR NDZEKU:  I think that was last time we were here.  I did 
not understand.  I said to myself there is something is not 
right here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So prior to today you were aware of this 
date of 2019? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:  Prior to? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Prior to today. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You had picked up that what is written here 
is 2019? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 326 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:  Well I can see here Chair.  It is really 
confusing.  Maybe when we started actually, she wanted to 
know my background of education and I said to Chair zero.  
Now there are things I read, there are things I actually keep, 
there are things I do not keep.  So I do not know what went 
wrong but I can see the stamp in Mount Frere. I can see the 
date as she told me.  So these other issues I do not know 
what to say Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  But my question is did you just say 
prior to today sometime back. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you go back whatever it was. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did notice that the year written here is 
2019? 
MR NDZEKU:  I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or are you noticing for the first time today? 
MR NDZEKU:  Not – I do not – Not for the first time but I 
actually I spoke to Mr Memela about that.  The only thing it 
was this funny things on the side on the paper I did not 
20 
understand what was happening. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on.  Hang on.  Let us talk about 2019 
only for now. 
MR NDZEKU:  2019 yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you did notice some time ago that the 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 327 of 388 
 
year written on this affidavit is 2019? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  How long ago was that?  Was it when Ms 
Memela was giving evidence here? 
MR NDZEKU:  I think during that time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  During that time? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  During the week that you were here? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes during that week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Was – is that something you picked 
10 
up on your own or is it because it was referred to during her 
questioning by Ms Hofmeyr? 
MR NDZEKU:  I think I picked up when Ms Hofmeyr was 
asking me the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You picked up? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you asked her? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what did she say? 
MR NDZEKU:  She says no it was just an error especially in 
20 
the homeland sometimes they do not have stamps.  Anything 
it’s here it is okay it is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well I do not have a recollection of 
this aspect being dealt with in… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  It was not Chair. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 328 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  In questioning. 
ADV HOFMEYR:    Not at all.   
CHAIRPERSON:  By – of Ms Memela by Ms Hofmeyr. 
MR NDZEKU:  You did not ask about it? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No. 
MR NDZEKU:  Okay.  So I think … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So did you pick it up at all then because if 
you say you picked it up because it was mentioned and I am 
saying I have no recollection of it being mentioned and Ms 
Hofmeyr who was questioning Ms Memela says no it was not 
10 
then you could not have heard it from us. 
MR NDZEKU:  Well Chair the time Ms Mbanjwa was here I 
did ask about the papers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Mbanjwa or Ms Memela who did you 
ask? 
MR NDZEKU:  No it was Ms Mbanjwa.  She was representing 
Ms Memela here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did you ask Ms Mbanjwa or did you ask 
20 
Ms Memela about this year?  About this 2019? 
MR NDZEKU:  No, no I do not – actually I spoke to Ms 
Memela about this and then she says it is an error.  When 
did I ask I do not remember but I did ask about this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Hofmeyr. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 329 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair.  The last point just to 
indicate that Ms – Mr Sandla in his affidavit makes it very 
clear in case there was any effort to still try and claw back to 
this affidavit being actually deposed to in 2015 that the 
Commissioner of Oaths indicated there Mr Nkumbuzi was off 
duty from 6am on the 22 September 2015 when this was 
allegedly deposed to in front of him.  And more than that he 
had been out on patrol for the shift preceding that.  So the 
chances Chair we will argue in due course that this affidavit 
was actually procured in 2015 are extremely slim. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well do you accept Mr Ndzeku that that 
certificate of the Commissioner of Oaths where 2019 is 
written? 
MR NDZEKU:  This one here? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NDZEKU:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you … 
MR NDZEKU:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I have not finished my question. 
MR NDZEKU:  Okay yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you accept that that what is written 
there is that the deponent to the affidavit in this case Ms 
Hlohela swore to this affidavit in that year.  So forget – if you 
forget about the stamp the police station stamp that writing 
there do you accept that it means that Ms Hlohela the 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 330 of 388 
 
deponent appeared before the Commissioner of Oaths in 
2019? 
MR NDZEKU:  Mr Hlohela – Ms Hlohela did Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja the deponent to the affidavit? 
MR NDZEKU:  Can you just repeat Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see the – the – what is written there 
says: 
“Certify that the deponent has acknowledged that he or she 
knows and understands the contents of this declaration 
which was sworn to before me and the declarant’s signature 
10 
armed print mark was placed before me thereon in my 
presence on [there is a space] 2019.” 
So I am just asking you whether you accept that that writing 
if you read it means that the deponent to the affidavit took 
the oath before the Commissioner of Oaths in 2019? 
MR NDZEKU:  No I do not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You do not accept that that is what it 
means? 
MR NDZEKU:  I do not – I do not.  I am still confused I do 
not. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are confused okay. 
MR NDZEKU:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I will just tell you.  That is what it 
means you know but what Ms Hofmeyr was saying to you in 
part is that that is strange that it should talk about 2019 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 331 of 388 
 
when the stamp of the police station says 22 September 
2015 and the purported Commissioner of Oaths put the date 
22 September 2015 and what he is saying to you is this has 
to be forgery. 
MR NDZEKU:  This – this document? 
CHAIRPERSON:  This document.  It has to be fraud because 
there is no way that a document such as this would bear the 
date of 2019 when it was done in 2015.  It is understandable 
if the document was signed in 2015 maybe early in January 
and it bears the date of 2014 when you have just moved from 
10 
one year to the next.  But it is impossible for it to bear 2019 
when it was – when the – it was done in 2015.  It cannot be.  
That is what she is saying.  Do you accept that? 
MR NDZEKU:  I will accept that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  Especially when she went through to Ms 
Buckley. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  Where they did try to locate her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:  I accept. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  Both of them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we – at least you accept and it seems 
to me quite clear that this was forged and you accept that?  
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 332 of 388 
 
Is that a yes? 
MR NDZEKU:  Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that a yes? 
MR NDZEKU:  What you say Chair can you repeat. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh that this affidavit was forged, you 
accept that? 
MR NDZEKU:  I accept it they were yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you accept that it was forged in 2019? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well I would not know the date but when I 
10 
looked at it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MR NDZEKU:  The way I look at it it was forged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
ADV ALLI:  Chair forgive me if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV ALLI:  I think Mr Ndzeku has made the concession he 
can there beyond that I am not sure. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry just raise your voice. 
20 
ADV ALLI:  My apologies.  Mr Ndzeku has made a 
concession about the affidavit that it is forged in his view.  
Now I am not sure how much more he can talk about when it 
was forged, the year in which it was forged or any of those 
things.  I do not think the suggestion has been that he was 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 333 of 388 
 
responsible for the forgery of this document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well I do not know how far Ms Hofmeyr will 
go but it is legitimate to look at.  If he accepts that it was 
forged when is that likely to have happened?  I think that is 
legitimate. 
ADV ALLI:  Yes but Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV ALLI:  That is precisely the problem is that we moving 
away from the Terms of Reference.  This is speculative.  If 
he says yes he thinks it was in 2019 how does that prove. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no it is important.  Go ahead Ms 
Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you Chair. 
ADV ALLI:  As the Chair pleases. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you accept that it was forged in 2019? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well I can accept. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Thank you. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Mr Ndzeku if that is so then I would like to 
take you back to the offer to purchase.  Remember the one 
20 
that you signed.  The one that precedes that in the file.  Just 
flick back a few pages to page 14 under Tab 6. 
MR NDZEKU:  The same – the same… 
ADV HOFMEYR:  The same file. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 334 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You are under Tab 6 and it is page 14. 
MR NDZEKU:  We say 6 hey? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 12. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Tab 6 page 14 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I am sorry page 14 under Tab 6? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Yes correct. 
MR NDZEKU:  Tab 6 and then page 14? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 14 Offer to Purchase. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Hm indeed.  That is the agreement that 
you signed, correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes I did Offer to Purchase obviously yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  The difficulty you see Mr Ndzeku is that if 
the affidavit was forged in 2019 it is not clear how you 
signed this agreement in 2015.  Did you not… 
MR NDZEKU:  Is this agreement 2015? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:  Wait, wait where is it now? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Did you sign this agreement in 2019 then? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:  Counsel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us start by… 
MR NDZEKU:  Where is the date? 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry, I am sorry.  I think Ms Hofmeyr 
we will start by placing on record that there is no date given 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 335 of 388 
 
on the document as to when it was signed. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  There is it is just not where Mr Ndzeku 
signs it is over the page where Ms Hlohela signs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh is that so. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  So I will take you there.  We did deal with 
this previously.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  But I am very happy to go there again at 
this point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  If you go to page 23. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no I did not see that. 
MR NDZEKU:  Page 23? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes 23 you will see Ms Hlohela signed it 
on the 1 November 2015.  Chair I must stop myself of course 
we have established that this is not Ms Hlohela’s signature 
so I am going to have to say purportedly signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Purportedly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR NDZEKU:  So we are on 23 yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  On the 1 November 2015 do you see that 
date there? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes.  I can see here. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Now the difficulty I have is that the 
affidavit 
that 
accompanies 
this 
agreement 
we 
have 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 336 of 388 
 
established was forged in 2019 so I am putting to you how 
could the – an agreement linked to that affidavit have been 
concluded in 2015 if the affidavit to which it refers and I will 
take you to that clause now was only produced in 2019? 
MR NDZEKU:  Well sorry Chair.  The offer to purchase as 
the Counsellor said I was given actually by Ms Memela and 
then I did not even look at the date. There is my signature 
there at pages 1 and then there is also other witnesses but I 
did not actually look at the date I just signed. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Did you sign it in 2015 or in 2019 Mr 
10 
Ndzeku? 
MR NDZEKU:  If I recollect it was not 2015 it must be 2019. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  Can I tell you why else it must have 
been 2019 Mr Ndzeku. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Remember Ms Mbanjwa prepared this 
agreement for you, do you recall that? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  She is a lawyer correct? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Do you know what an arbitration clause is 
in an agreement? 
MR NDZEKU:  The what? 
ADV HOFMEYR:  An arbitration clause? 
MR NDZEKU:  No. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 337 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  No.  Let me tell you what it is.  It is a 
clause in this agreement that if there is a dispute between 
the parties. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Then they refer their dispute to arbitration.  
Have you – have you come across those clauses before? 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Hm. 
MR NDZEKU:  We actually busy now with AR on that matter 
at the moment. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Right.  Right. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
So 
what 
is 
noteworthy 
about 
this 
arbitration clause and you will find it at page 19 Mr Ndzeku. 
MR NDZEKU:  Page 19 okay it is 18 here.  Yes, yes page 19. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  You will see at the bottom there there is 
clause 18 of the arbitration agreement. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Yes.  I will just take you through it.  There 
is no need to read.  You see what happens with arbitration 
20 
clauses is that when there is a dispute you go to arbitration 
and the parties appoint they choose who the arbitrator is but 
if they cannot agree then somebody else is given the role of 
appointing the arbitrator. 
MR NDZEKU:  Yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 338 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:  Okay.  And the one that caught my eye in 
particular when I was going through this agreement was what 
would happen at clause 18.3.3 of the agreement which is 
over the page at page 20. 
MR NDZEKU:   Where are we going?  To page 20 or 18? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Page 20.  And you need Clause 
18.3.3. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay, page... I am at page 20 now at Clause 
18.   
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Point 3 point 3. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I am here. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And I will explain to you why that 
caught my eye.  You see, what Clause 18.3.3. caters for is a 
dispute between the parties about any other matter. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   It is not an accounting matter, it is not 
a matter that can go to the estate agent’s board.  It is any 
other matter, right? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And then the arbitration proceedings 
20 
are going to be conducted by a practicing advocate or 
attorney with at least ten years’ experience. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   If agreed upon by the parties.   
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 339 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And then it says: 
“Failing agreement nominated by the chairperson for 
the time being of a legal practise counsel.?   
 
Do you see that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   You were not aware of that clause 
before today, were you? 
MR NDZEKU:   I was not. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Ms Mbawanzwa(?) was responsible for 
putting this agree together, correct? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Correct, yes.   
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Ms Mbawanzwa then would probably 
know that the Legal Practice Council was not established 
until October of 2018.  So Mr Ndzeku, I suggest to you that 
this is another reason that this agreement did not come to 
exist in 2015.   
MR NDZEKU:   Can you repeat again? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Not in 2105 ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   What are you saying? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes.  This agreement did not come 
20 
into existence, you did not sign it in 2015. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I did... I did tell you that, 2019. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes, not in 2016, not in 2017, not in 
2018.  But you have now confirmed under oath that you 
signed it in 2019.   
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 340 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Correct, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes.  That ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   But maybe just to complete the point 
because basically what Ms Hofmeyr is saying.  An agreement 
concluded in 2015 could not have referred to Legal Practise 
Council because at that time, there was no such body.  
Okay? 
MR NDZEKU:   Thank you, Chair. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Ja, okay.  So it has to be that the 
document was prepared after that body had come into 
existence. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Mr Ndzeku, in fairness to you.  We will 
argue in due course that this whole agreement is a fraud.  
Do you accept that? 
MR NDZEKU:   I accept, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   H’m.  Why did you perpetrate a fraud 
in 2019? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Why did I...? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Why did you take part in a fraud in 
2019? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I did not know that it was a fraud. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   No, you did because it was purporting 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 341 of 388 
 
to be an agreement you concluded in 2015 when you have 
now in fairness to you admitted to this Commission that you 
only signed it in 2019.  That means you were party to a 
fraud. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I must tell the truth.  I do not know how 
you are going to take it.  This is the truth.  I did not know 
that I was committing a crime.  That is the truth. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But Mr Ndzeku, if you signed this 
agreement in 2019 ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   I mean, you have made the payment for 
this land, when? 2016/2015? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   May 2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:   May 2016? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, Chair.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It would mean that you paid R 2,5 million 
at a time when there was no agreement because there was 
no agreement until both parties signed and you say  you only 
signed in 2019.   
MR NDZEKU:   Well, Chair ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   How could you have done that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Chair, I did feel actually comfortable when it 
was with the attorneys, Ms Mbawanzwa.  The one who was 
supposed to prepare the document.  The one actually, the 
money was paid to.  And then I also advised my lawyers 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 342 of 388 
 
about this issue.  As a businessman I did not see anything 
wrong.   
CHAIRPERSON:   No, you knew on your own version that to 
buy the land that you say you wanted to buy, there had be an 
agreement. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that that agreement was to be in 
writing, is it not? 
MR NDZEKU:   In writing, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now, on your own version an agreement in 
10 
writing only comes about in 2019 because you do not get to 
sign the agreement until 2019.  How do you justify paying 
somebody R 2,5 million even before there can be a written 
agreement that you are expecting should happen? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, Chair my thinking, I was not paying her, 
I was paying the lawyer and... 
CHAIRPERSON:   H’m? 
MR NDZEKU:   I was paying the lawyer.  The money was 
supposed to stay in a trust. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Mr Ndzeku ...[intervenes]  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   With interest. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but you are... there is supposed to be 
an agreement first. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 343 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then you pay.  Because you are supposed 
to pay in accordance with the agreement. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You accept that? 
MR NDZEKU:   I agree with you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So what you did is change that you 
paid not a small amount, a substantial amount even before 
you could see an agreement and have it signed.  You accept 
that that has changed? 
MR NDZEKU:   I accept that, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   You accept that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Thank you.  Chair, I would like to take 
it one step further.  Mr Ndzeku, I put it to you there was no 
agreement about nay land whatsoever in 2015 or 2016.   
 
What there was, was a payment of R 2,5 million to 
benefit Ms Mamela who was the Head of Procurement at SAA 
Technical and it was the last R 2,5 million out of the 
R 28.5 million that was paid by Swissport to JM Aviation.  Do 
you have a response to that? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I am still confused.  How can Ms 
Mamela help Swiss Port? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   No, she could help JM Aviation. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I was not part of JM Aviation.   
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   JM Aviation?  You were a director of 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 344 of 388 
 
JM Aviation in 2015 and 2016. 
MR NDZEKU:   Let us go back again.  When came here they 
did a deal with SAAT.  I was not even there. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Let me explain to you how she 
benefited JM Aviation. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   She agreed to sell to your daughter, 
Ms Sokulu, GPUs, 12 GPUs for R 3 million ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   Not to my daughter ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   ...on the same day ...[intervenes]  
10 
MR NDZEKU:   ...to JM Aviation. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   ON the same day ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   The JM Aviation... the person ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   To JM Aviation on ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Hang on Mr Ndzeku.  Let counsel finish, 
then you can respond. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   On the same day JM Aviation bought 
Swissport South Africa R 9 million for those same GPUs.  In 
a day, JM Aviation made the difference, R 6 million.  That is 
20 
how Ms Mamela benefited JM Aviation.   
MR NDZEKU:   Well ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Do you have a comment on that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I do not know that.  Maybe the person 
who did the deal with Swissport, it was Mr Aires.  I do not 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 345 of 388 
 
know how he did he benefit.  I do not know.  I am sorry.  I do 
not know how. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Do you want me to tell you what 
happened to with that R 6 million? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, please. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes.  It ended up with Yake Kwinana, 
the non-executive member of the Board of SAA.  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And the Chair of SAA Technical at the 
time. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  How did ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   R 4.3 million of that R 6 million ended 
up with Ms Kwinana. 
MR NDZEKU:   Who paid that R 6 million? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   JM Aviation.  Sorry, apologies.  Let me 
go there.  I am jumping ahead of myself.  Mr Ndzeku, you 
paid it.  So let me go explain to you how you paid it Ms 
Kwinana.  Right.  We need to look at your dealings with Zano 
Spark. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes.  What is Zano Spark? 
MR NDZEKU:   Please, can you explain to me again? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   What is Zano Spark? 
MR NDZEKU:   Who is the actual people of Zano Spark? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 346 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   It is Dan Xlolo(?) or who is this?  I do not 
remember. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   You do not remember? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I do not remember. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Well, your affidavit says that you do 
remember, that is Ms Koniwe(?). 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Is the daughter of Ms Kwinana.  Is that 
correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, that is exactly the forex.  Yes, yes.  I 
10 
know very well. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes.  So tell me about Zano Spark in 
your dealings with Zano Spark and Ms Koniwe? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, Chair...  Sorry, I look either side.  
Sorry, Chair.  Ms Koniwe, we... they were selling a Bitcoin 
Forex and I decided that maybe with my money I am getting 
from JM, let me invest it which is I invested in the forex.   
 
Now how does the forex work?  You know, you buy and 
sell, you buy and sell.  It is exactly what I did.  I did not 
know that money was going to Ms Kwinana. I am still actually 
20 
in charge of that money even to today.  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Let us go through it.  So I understand 
your affidavit to have indicated in your evidence now to be 
that Ms Koniwe who is Ms Yakhe Kwinana’s daughter 
approached you in 2016.  Is that correct? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 347 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, correct.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And she said to you, she was engaged 
in the business of forex trading. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not remember 2016, I think maybe during 
that time. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   H’m.  No, your affidavit says 2016 and 
you started to make the payments in 2016.  So can we take 
2016? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   [No audible reply]  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Please say yes just for the record. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, Chair I must say yes or no.  I do not 
remember but I know that I did deal with this lady, Koniwe. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Right.  And she told you that her 
company was involved in forex trading.  Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes.  And you wanted to hedge against 
the falling Rand, according to your affidavit.  Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I do not know.  Where did you get that 
20 
councillor?  Is that in my affidavit? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes.   
MR NDZEKU:   What page is that again? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Let us go there.  So if you will take the 
big file in front of you, DD26? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 348 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   What is it? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   DD26.  It is the first tab. 
MR NDZEKU:   The first tab? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And you will find it at page 13, one 
three. 
MR NDZEKU:   Number 28 or 20?  26? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Mr Ndzeku, so you are in... under the 
first tab.   
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Firs tab? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes, please.   
MR NDZEKU:   Okay.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Tab number 3. 
MR NDZEKU:   Tab number ...[intervenes]  
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Oh, sorry.  Tab 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tab number 1? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes, first tab. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
MR NDZEKU:   Tab 1? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 13? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Page 13, correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.   
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 349 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Right, I have got it here.  Thank you.  I see 
it. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Right.  So this is your affidavit Mr 
Ndzeku to the Commission.  And if you pick it up at 
paragraph 62, you say there: 
“Lumka (that is Ms Koniwe’s first name) got in 
touch with me during 2016 and advised me 
that she was engaged in the business of forex 
trade for which her entity had a trading 
account.” 
10 
 
At paragraph 63 you say ...[intervenes]  
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry counsel, the number... it is page 13? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Page 13. 
MR NDZEKU:   And then we go to paragraph? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Paragraph 62. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay we go to number 14 where I am 
supposed to sign? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, paragraph 62 at page 13. 
MR NDZEKU:   DD26? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes, yes.  No, you are at the right 
20 
page.  You wanted to go over the page to 14. 
MR NDZEKU:   At 14 and then I went over the page. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, and then... yes, I am looking at this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   62, paragraph 62 on page 13. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 350 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   No, it is page... 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 13 is the red number. 
MR NDZEKU:   And then DD26? 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no, no. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes, it is DD26.  It is the name of the 
bundle. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Right.  Then you are at page 13. 
MR NDZEKU:   Paragraph 13. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 13. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And we want you to go to paragraph 
62. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On page 13. 
MR NDZEKU:   Page 62? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   No, on the same page Mr Ndzeku. 
CHAIRPERSON:   13.  Have you got page 13? 
MR NDZEKU:   [No audible reply]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Have you got page 13? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I am at point... page 13. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay count the paragraphs, 1, 2, 3, 4.  
20 
Paragraph number 4 is paragraph 62. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And I will read to you what is reflected 
there, your affidavit.  You say: 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 351 of 388 
 
“Lumka got in touch with me during 2016 and 
advised me that she was engaged in the 
business of forex trade for which her entity 
had a trading account.” 
 
Paragraph 63: 
“The 
investment 
was 
appealing, 
giving 
that 
it 
provided a hedge against the falling Rand...” 
 
That is what I have just quoted to you, Mr Ndzeku in the 
evidence. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, yes. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And you seem to have a difficulty with 
that being the reason that you invested in Zano Spark. 
MR NDZEKU:   No, sorry counsel.  Now I can see now.  
Sorry.  No. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   No, that is fine. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   So you get approached by Ms 
Kwinana’s daughter in 2016.  She says to you her business 
is involved in forex trading and as I understand it you wanted 
to invest in forex trading. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Correct, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And you wanted to do that to hedge 
against the depreciating Rand.  Is that correct? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 352 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Correct, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   What do you know about forex trading 
Mr Ndzeku? 
MR NDZEKU:   What do I know? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   What do you know about it?  How does 
it take place? 
MR NDZEKU:   You know like any businessperson.  If you do 
not know something, trading is straight. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Trading ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry.  I did not hear. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What is the answer to that question? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, she asked me what do I know about forex 
trading? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   And I said, trading is trading.  And then 
trading... what exactly what they are doing, is buying and 
selling in the market, on the stock market.  It is exactly... 
any businessman, they know about the trading.   
 
She asked me what do I know about forex?  Then I said I 
20 
am a businessman.  And I wanted actually... she can still ask 
me the same question, what do I know about Bitcoin?  Then I 
have to learn because I am a businessman. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   What currency was the trading going 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 353 of 388 
 
to take place in? 
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry?  What? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   What currency was the trading going 
to take place in? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, that time I do not remember.  That was 
a long time ago.  But my investment is secured. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   It is secured? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Right.  What sort of updates do you 
get on your investment? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   What sort of...? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Updates? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, you know Commissioner... Chair, this is 
my business.  This is my private.  If I put money, then I am 
getting one rand or maybe two rands.  It is my business.  As 
far as I know this was my money.  I did not take it from 
nobody.  So I do not know why now the counsel she is asking 
me that question. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, her question is simple.  Do you 
get... or rather, what updates do you get on your investment?  
20 
Do you get any reports that tell you how your investment is 
doing? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, let me just make an example on the 
trade because you go as the stock market and then 
sometimes they tell you and sometimes they do not tell you. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 354 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, the question is.  Maybe let us start 
with this question. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you get any updates or reports on how 
your investment is performing? 
MR NDZEKU:   I can say Chair, after a year, they give you a 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So you do get reports every year? 
MR NDZEKU:   After a year, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or once a year? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Once a year, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  And the reports are in writing? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, not in writing because now today, they 
do not use... we use actually the email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Emails? 
MR NDZEKU:   Ja, same email.  Then you ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, you get the by email. 
MR NDZEKU:   If I have got an investment at ABSA, they tell 
me... they tell me on the email. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, so you get emails? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And would that include investment 
statements updating you on how your investment is doing?  
How it has grown?  How it has dropped? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 355 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes.  And you get those annually, do 
you? 
MR NDZEKU:   Annually, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Right.  And you receive via email, I 
understand it? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Do you also get updates, payment 
advises?  Do they ever pay the money back to you? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, let us just go back.  The investment, as 
10 
I recall it, it was for five years.  If you do an investment and 
you agree with to them.  You say, I have got one million rand 
here and then I want to... instead of you guys pay me every 
months, and then I want to get this money after five years.   
 
It is up to me.  So I am not getting anything at the 
moment.  The agreement is that I will be getting my 
investment, my profit after five years. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And in those investment statements 
that you received, was it showing that you were doing well or 
poorly? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, again, sometimes we do well, 
sometimes we do not well. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   And you saw all of that in the 
investment statements you receive yearly.  Is that right? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 356 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Yes,  Mr Ndzeku, you have deposed to 
an affidavit that has been submitted to the Commission when 
we asked you for the documents that we have just been 
talking about. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   Do you remember what you said in 
that affidavit? 
MR NDZEKU:   Please remind me? 
ADV HOFMEYR SC:   You said you have never received any 
investment statements. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, at the moment, as I said to the Chair, 
they always send me the email.  Not actually my email.  Now 
I really know.  I will have to... this is exactly what I was 
discussing with my lawyers.  I did not know that it was 
maybe needed here.  I was thinking that maybe the Chair 
wanted to know that ...[intervenes]  
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, Mr Ndzeku... 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The question is whether you remember 
that in your affidavit you said you do not receive any 
20 
statements relating to this investment. 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not remember, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do not remember? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 357 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You went further, you said you have no 
documents that you are able to provide to the Commission 
about this investment. 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, maybe my lawyers, they advise me to 
say that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, Mr Ndzeku, it cannot always be the 
lawyers, this is your version on an affidavit to this 
Commission. 
 
You 
said 
there 
were 
no 
investment 
statements.   
Today you have changed that version and you have 
10 
told us about annual statements that tell you that you are 
sometimes doing well and sometimes doing badly on the 
forex market. 
MR NDZEKU:   Counsellor, can I ask you, why are you 
shouting at me? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I am not, Mr Ndzeku. 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not like your tone. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Ndzeku …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   No, no, please I do not like your tone. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It has been a long day. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   I am not – no, really, Chair, I really do not 
like the way she is talking to me.  If you are forcing me to 
agree what you are saying, do not scream at me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not like that. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 358 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Mr Ndzeku.  Okay, let us take it 
step-by-step. 
 
Is 
the 
position 
that 
you 
do 
receive 
statements telling you how the investment is performing? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I can say, Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You do.  Okay.  Do you remember or do 
you not remember whether in your affidavit you said you do 
not receive such statements?  Do you remember or do not 
remember? 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not remember, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Ms Hofmeyr, do you want to refer 
10 
to …[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I think my learned friend wants to say 
something. 
ADV ALLI:  Chair, forgive me, I have got another 
engagement at 6.30 p.m. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay. 
ADV ALLI:  Yes, I do. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV ALLI:   We had agreed to sit late which we 
understood would be – end at 5.30.  We are have now got 
20 
at six o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  What is the latest you would like to 
get out of here? 
ADV ALLI:  Chair, if my learned friend – as she is, so are 
we anxious to go through this today.  If my learned friend 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 359 of 388 
 
could conclude within the next 15 minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, then you would be okay. 
ADV ALLI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   How is that…? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I will do my absolute best, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I wanted – I asked you earlier what you 
understand to happen with forex trading. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
Right, 
and 
you 
said 
you 
are 
businessman, you understand trading, is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you know that trading in forex is a 
regulated industry? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  So did you check with Zano Spark 
when Ms Goniwe approached whether it had the requisite 
licences to be trading in forex? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, they did actually send me the – they 
did tell me the company, they said there is the company. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   This is exactly where you will be paying. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 360 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Not to her name.  This is exactly what I did.  
Ja, they did say to me this is the company, if you are 
investing, you are investing in this company not to us, they 
did show me that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And did you check whether that company 
was licensed to engage in forex trading? 
MR NDZEKU:   I did check that company not to say it was 
licensed, I just wanted to check that if maybe this money 
disappear will I get it back which is the company was 
there.  About the licence, I did not check. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So how did you check about the 
company, what did you ask for? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, if they give me the – if she told me 
the account number and this is the people, this is the 
company you are dealing with and I just decided that okay, 
let me just phone these people and find out exactly before 
I do any payment, does it exist, which it was, it was there. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you discover in those inquiries that 
the company had been created in February 2016? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I did not know that. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And did you establish that the two 
directors were Ms Goniwe and Ms Kwinana? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I did not know that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you did not make any inquiries 
about whether it was licensed, is that correct? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 361 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   No, I did not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So do you learn today for the first time 
when I tell you that Zano Spark has no – it is neither an 
authorised dealer with the Reserve Bank to trade in forex 
not does it have any licence with the FSCA, that is the 
Financial Services Conduct Authority, to engage in the 
provision of financial services related to trading? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I did not know that but the only thing I 
can tell you, Chair, the money I paid, it is safe and if I 
want to get that money back, I will get it back same as my 
10 
thinking with Ms Mbanjwa, when I want to pay that money it 
was going on the trust.  If maybe that money is supposed 
to go back it must come back.  That is exactly my thinking. 
 
Now, as a businessman, maybe the counsel is going 
to ask me, if you put that money, you are not actually 
expecting to get interest.  Yes, I do.  But instead of losing, 
I would rather not get an interest, let me get my money 
back.  That is all I can say.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   So this was your investment. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you were going to put it with Zano 
Spark and nothing put you on guard that this would be 
anything other than a legitimate investment, is that right? 
MR NDZEKU:   Nothing what? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Nothing was – you did not pick up 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 362 of 388 
 
anything that suggested that there might be a problem with 
investing in this company. 
MR NDZEKU:   No, nothing, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And now you have learnt that Zano 
Spark does not have any licences to conduct trading.  So 
any trading that it was doing would be unlawful.  Does that 
cause you concern? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, it is the first time I am hearing this.  
The first time here is some concern, the first time I am 
10 
hearing this now. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I said to you, Mr Ndzeku, that I was 
going to show you how the R6 million that JM Aviation 
ended up benefiting Ms Kwinana, so I would like to take 
you to that and it is through your Zano Spark investments.   
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Let us go, if we can, to the file, the big 
file, DD26. 
MR NDZEKU:   DD26? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  And we need to go to page 49 
20 
which is under tab 9.  Please go to tab 9. 
MR NDZEKU:   Tab 9, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And then find page 49. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Tab 9, Ms Hofmeyr. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Tab 9, page 49, correct, Chair. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 363 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh.  Tab 9. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, tab 49.  D26. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, page 49. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Are you under tab 9, Mr Ndzeku, it 
should be a bank statement in front of you.  Tab 9, yes, I 
think that is right, from what I can see and it is a bank 
statement, is that right? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes a bank statement, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  So this is the bank statement of 
JM Aviation.  We have moved a little bit further on in 2016, 
10 
Chair and Mr Ndzeku, we are now in about the month of 
June, right? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you will see halfway down the 
entries on that page there is a big credit that JM Aviation 
receives form Swissport South Africa.  Do you see that, of 
R9.849 600.  So let me just get the – for the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On what date? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair is it on the 24 June. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, Swissport. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   I cannot see the [indistinct – dropping 
voice] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you have it, Chair, it is midway down. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   Where is it, page 49? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 364 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
You 
know 
the 
bank 
statement 
…[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   And is it page 2 or page 1?  Is it page 49? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Page 49. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, it is the first 49.  Thank you, Mr 
Ndzeku. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So if you go halfway down there to the 
10 
date of the 24 June, you will see that Swissport South 
Africa pays R9 849 600 to JM Aviation.  Do you see that? 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not see that here.  I can see on the 
7 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Move up a bit.  Move three lines up and 
then you see R9 849, can you see that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, on my right hand side, Chair, or…? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, in the amounts column. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, in the amount column. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Maybe it will speed things up if one of 
20 
my learned friends would not mind just directing Mr Ndzeku 
to it or if the registrar could. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Maybe let us try.  You are on the 
right page, it is 49 on the right number, is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   49 [inaudible – speaking simultaneously] 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 365 of 388 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV 
HOFMEYR: 
 
 
No, 
Mr 
Ndzeku, 
I 
have 
just 
…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, not 49.1, just 49. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   If you go back a page we will be fine.  
Thank you.  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, 49. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I you go back page, that is page 49.  Do 
you have that?   Mr Bhayat can assist you. 
MR NDZEKU:   This is 49, yes, I have got it here. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  Can you see somewhere in the 
middle of that, you will see Swissport SA and then you will 
see R9 849 …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   600, yes.  I can see it, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can see that, okay.  Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Just before we go there, can I just ask, 
did you have any discussions with your wife about your 
investing in the forex trade? 
MR NDZEKU:   Did I have discussion with her? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   I think I did. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You did. 
MR NDZEKU:   If I remember, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did she invest or did you just invest? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I think I also asked her that, if maybe 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 366 of 388 
 
she can also invest. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   She can also invest? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So her money? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, your voice is going down. 
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry, Chair, sorry.  Yes, Chair, I did ask 
her that she can invest. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Was she going to be investing her 
money? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   No, it was my money. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Your money? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So she was going to be investing your 
money in Zano Spark. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Why would she need to invest your 
money if you were also investing your money? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I do not see anything wrong, if maybe 
there was a good business sense or maybe there was good 
20 
returns.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   No but I understand that if she is 
investing her own money why would she be needed to 
invest your money? 
MR NDZEKU:   Why she did? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 367 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, why would you have her invest your 
money instead of you investing it yourself? 
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry, counsellor, I do not see anything 
wrong that if maybe I want my wife to invest her money 
where she – where we can get returns, I did not see 
anything wrong in that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Ndzeku …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   Maybe to you it was wrong but to me it was 
not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I am just trying to understand from you.  
10 
You were approached by Ms Goniwe. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You wanted to invest in forex trading. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Why get your wife to invest your money 
in the forex trading? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well, I am sorry, it happened and that is 
exactly the decision I took. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay.  So Swissport South Africa paid 
R9.8 million or thereabouts on the 24 June to JM Aviation, 
20 
correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Let me just see there.  9,4 yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  And that was for the GPUs that 
they bought from JM Aviation.  We have had evidence 
about that previously.  Those are the GPUs that JM 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 368 of 388 
 
Aviation paid just 3 million to SAA Technical for. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  So that money comes into the 
account.  What you will notice, Mr Ndzeku, is the account 
of JM Aviation is depleted before that.  You see before that 
amount came in it was only sitting at R89 834.  Do you see 
that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Let me go back again.  Where is that, after 
…[intervenes] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   It is in the line above. 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Out of the 9 804 there was a balance of 
what, of…? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Just before the 9 million came in the 
balance appears to have been 89 834. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I can see that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can see that, okay. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see because by the 24 June that 
28.5 million that you had received from Swissport South 
Africa had been reduced.  20 million had gone to Jamicron, 
20 
2.5 million had gone to you, 2.5 million had gone to Mr 
Kolisi and ended up buying the cars for Mr Lester Peter 
and 2.5 million had been paid the previous month to Ms 
Memela. 
MR NDZEKU:   No, no, no, no, counsellor.  This 20 million, 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 369 of 388 
 
it went to Jamicron, what is it, Jamicron? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes. 
MR NDZEKU:   It went, it did not come back to us. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, no, indeed, so I am …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   That money, wait, wag ŉ bietjie, that 
money, it was paid to JM and JM paid that money to 
Daluxolo and then it did not come back. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, indeed, that is what I am explaining, 
Mr Ndzeku, I am just showing how …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   You say it did. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I said all the money went out.  I might 
have said something incorrectly. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But I was trying to emphasis – just takes 
a little bit of time.  Okay, let us go back.  23 March JM 
Aviation gets 28.5 million from Swissport, right? 
MR NDZEKU:   For what, for GPUs. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, this might not be a profitable line, 
Chair, let me just proceed.  All that we need to look at for 
the moment is that 9.8 million came into the JM Aviation 
20 
account. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   On the 24 June from Swissport for the 
GPUs, right. 
MR NDZEKU:   Okay. 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 370 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   If you go a little bit further down that 
page, you will see on the 29 June there is a R2.5 million 
that goes out.  Do you see that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes I can see it, it goes to Hendricks, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, it goes to Hendricks.  That is your 
wife, is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   A hundred percent, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Ja.  Why was your wife being paid R2.5 
million by the company? 
MR NDZEKU:   No, that was my money.  As I said, that was 
10 
my money.  That is the money I got from the company and 
then I decided to do the investment and I decided that let 
me actually – my wife must do the investment on her name, 
but it is my money.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   So …[intervenes] 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not see anything wrong in that. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   So you - JM Aviation paid 2.5 million to 
your wife on the 29 June, is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Correct, yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  Why was she entitled to that 
20 
money? 
MR NDZEKU:   As I said again, Chair, that money, it was 
my money, I decided that my wife must do the investment 
on her name.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Did you discuss this payment of 2.5 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 371 of 388 
 
million to your wife with any of your other directors? 
MR NDZEKU:   I discussed it with Jules, he did not have a 
problem.  He is my partner.   
ADV HOFMEYR:    Do you know what Ms Hendricks then 
did with that 2.5 million? 
MR NDZEKU:   As I said, Ms Hendricks, that money we 
invested.  We invested that money. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   With Zano Spark? 
MR NDZEKU:   Not with Zano Spark, I do not see Zano 
Spark here. 
10 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, where was she going to invest that 
then? 
MR NDZEKU:   But when you say Zano Spark, I do not see 
Zano Spark but as far as I remember, Zano Spark, the 
money I invested in Zano Spark, it was around about 7 
million, 6 million. 
ADV HOFMEYR:  I am asking about this payment, you said 
you discussed with your co-directors that you pay your wife 
R2.5million of the R9.8million that had been received from 
Swissport. 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   And you said she was going to do it for 
an investment. 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   An investment where?  
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 372 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Well it was one of the company which we 
decided to do the investment of the Bitcoins, we decided to 
do that.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   So it was a Bitcoin investment not a 
Zano…[intervene] 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, if I remember very clearly because I 
do not know maybe it did, we put it to Zano Spark or maybe 
we put it to Bitcoin but we did that investment.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay so the bank statement showed you 
paid it to Zano Spark, right? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   We paid it to Zano Spark? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  
MR NDZEKU:   I paid R7million and then she paid exactly a 
R2million.  The money we paid to Zano Spark it was 
R9million.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   No Mr Ndzeku your 7.5 includes this 2.5 
as I understand that.  
MR NDZEKU:   Oh it includes this one maybe you are right, 
maybe you are right.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   So why did you have to pay it to Ms 
20 
Hendricks for her to pay it to Zano Spark, why do you not 
just pay it to Zano Spark? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well it happened counsellor this is exactly 
my decision that time I decided to do it and it was done.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   I am asking for an explanation Mr 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 373 of 388 
 
Ndzeku and in fairness to you I must explain why.  
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry I cannot explain this is my decision I 
do Chair it was done by that time.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   You see sometimes people route money 
throughout entities or other persons because they do not 
want it to be traced back to them.  Could that have been 
what was going on here? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well sorry Chair if the money is in the bank 
it has got a trace.  We are sitting here we are talking about 
2.5, this money was paid from Swissport and we decided 
10 
that my wife must – there is no other way that you can 
dodge it.  I decided that my wife and myself we must do 
the investment that is a decision I took that time.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Ndzeku a person who is just looking 
at this bank statement does not know that Ms Hendricks is 
your wife.  Do they? 
MR NDZEKU:   She does - they do not?  
ADV HOFMEYR:   They do not know that Ms Hendricks is 
your wife, do they?  
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry Chair well if a person look at that and 
20 
then he does not think that is not my wife well then it is 
that person’s problem but I am saying she is my wife.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   No but my…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay one second, we have gone past 
18:15.  
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 374 of 388 
 
ADV ALLI:   Chair I do not know how much longer my 
learned friend would be, we did make an early start and we 
did say we will sit late. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
ADV ALLI:   So we would appreciate some time as well so 
I just do not know how much longer my learned friend will 
be. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, Ms Hofmeyr did say she would try 
and I accept that she has been trying.  I guess she is 
trying to strike a balance between trying to finish and still 
10 
do justice to the issues.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair the one way to do it might be 
without going to the bank statements just to put to Mr 
Ndzeku what the flow of funds looks like.  To explain to him 
where they end up and then to put some final concluding 
aspects to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:   As long as you are satisfied that that 
would do justice to the issues.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   I think it will. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And of course this might be unusual but 
20 
I do not know whether if you to pressed for time whether it 
is an option or you intending to remain if Ms Hofmeyr is not 
going to be too long I do not know whether that is an 
option it is not usual I am just checking.   
ADV ALLI:   Chair I am happy with Ms Hofmeyr suggestion 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 375 of 388 
 
and I will second it, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you so much and I am really am 
indebted Mr Alli thank you very much.  I did abandon one 
whole line of questioning because I knew that the timing 
was not on our side.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   So Mr Ndzeku let me try and summarise 
if you want me to take you to a document at any point I 
will.  
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Please summarise thank you.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Right.  R9.8million comes in from 
Swissport it gets paid to your wife a few days later of 
R2.5million.  Your wife then pays it into Zano Spark I think 
it was two days later, right.  Then there are – we want to 
look at what happens with the Zano Spark use of that 
money, right and we go to the Zano Spark bank statements.  
Chair for the record those are in DD26 at page 392 but I do 
not suggest we go there because by agreement with 
everyone I am going to summarise it okay.  Now remember 
20 
Zano Spark was created as a company in February 2016 
you will recall that I told you that earlier and you said you 
were not aware that it has been created in 2016.  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Again, those records are within the 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 376 of 388 
 
bundle.  So it has an opening balance as an entity of 
R501,37 before it receives the payment from your wife on 
the 1 s t of July 2016 of R2.5million, okay.  And then your 
wife paid another amount on the 28 t h of July 2016 she paid 
R600 000,00 to Zano Spark.   
          Then I will give you the reference at page 397 of 
bundle DT26 there was then a direct payment from JM 
Aviation to Zano Spark on the 30 t h of August 2016 of R605 
000,00.  And then the final payment of which we are in 
relation to which we interested you will find at page 399 of 
10 
Exhibit DD26 that is another R600 000,00 from JM Aviation 
to Zano Spark on the 21 s t of September 2016.   
          Now during that whole time nothing else of any note 
is happening in the Zano Spark bank account.  It is just 
repeatedly between July and September of 2016 gets these 
payments from JM Aviation directly or from your wife.  On 
the 23 r d of September 2016 Zano Spark pays that total it is 
a total of about R4.3million from its one account to its 
other account.  The other account is a business account 
and that depletes the balance in the account that you and 
20 
your wife were paying into to about R834,00.  There is no 
trading that is happening in relation to that money.  It 
comes in and it goes out within two months.   
          There is a movement between the two accounts and 
then it goes out to be paid Ms Yakhe Kwinana.  Are these 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 377 of 388 
 
all facts that you have no knowledge of Mr Ndzeku? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well I must just say on that sorry Chair I do 
not have facts but if Swissport decided actually to pay 
money in JM Aviation I did not see anything wrong.  If 
Swissport paid that money and then myself and my partner 
and then we decided to use the money the way, we wanted 
to use it I do not see anything wrong.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And now that you know it ended up 
benefiting Ms Yakhe Kwinana is that a concern for you? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well I did not know that it benefited Ms 
10 
Kwinana this is the first time I am hearing this.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   No I am asking you today when you hear 
it for the first time does it concern you? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well I do not really think it can concern 
because I do not know what value can she really add in me 
or maybe in Swissport or maybe in JM Aviation, it does not 
concern me.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well she played a very critical role 
because she was on the board of SAA Technical when SAA 
Technical decided to give your joint venture with AAR the 
20 
components contract…[intervene] 
MR NDZEKU:   Thank you very much can you just stop 
their counsellor I want to make it a point that JM Aviation 
came late in this thing of AAR.  Lufthansa was there and 
then Air France was there, JM Aviation we just started 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 378 of 388 
 
yesterday and if you can really look Chair JM Aviation it is 
just a small company started yesterday if you look we did 
not even have actually any…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, but when it started is neither here 
nor there.  The question that counsel is putting to you is 
should it not be a concern to you that Ms Kwinana who 
played an important role in relation to the contracts ends 
up getting some money that comes from JM Aviation.  
MR NDZEKU:   Well Chair I did not even know that she was 
involved.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but if it is true that that is what has 
happened will that be a concern to you?  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes it would be? 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes it would be.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And she received the payment a month 
after she left SAA Technical, did you know that? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   She what? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   She received the payment a month after 
she left SAA Technical, did you know that? 
MR NDZEKU:   I did not know when she actually left the 
company sorry about that.   
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 379 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Okay, he left in August 2016 and she 
received the payment on the 23 r d of September 2016.     
MR NDZEKU:   From JM or from? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Well through Zano Spark, well JM 
through your wife, through Zano Spark to Ms Kwinana.  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Ndzeku were you present at the 
hearings of the Commission for Ms Sambo’s evidence?  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes, I did listen.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Do you remember Ms Sambo’s evidence 
10 
was that Ms Kwinana had a meeting with the AAR 
representatives including Ms Jackson and she said that Ms 
Kwinana had said that before she left SAA and SAA 
Technical she wanted to get her hands on some money.  Do 
you remember that being her evidence?  
MR NDZEKU:   No.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, and is it your evidence that this 
payment to Ms Kwinana has no bearing on that evidence?  
MR NDZEKU:   Well I said no.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you.  Mr Ndzeku you mentioned 
20 
your concern about tax compliance earlier.   
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Remember the R28.5million that you 
received from Swissport.  
MR NDZEKU:   Swissport, yes.

ADV HOFMEYR:   You were concerned to ensure that your 
tax affairs were in good order.  Is that correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   The company tax? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  
MR NDZEKU:   Because I was...[intervene]  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Apologies the company tax.  Did you 
follow up on whether tax was appropriately paid?   
MR NDZEKU:   No, I did not. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, because the facts are no tax has 
been paid to SARS in relation to that R28.5million that you 
10 
received from JM Aviation.  
MR NDZEKU:   How much money was 28 it was not paid.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   So of the R28.5 million the VAT portion 
of that is R3.5million.  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   You were concerned to make sure that 
SARS got everything that it was due.  Correct?  
MR NDZEKU:   Correct, yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes, there was never a payment to SARS 
for that amount.  Are you aware of that? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   No I am not aware of that.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   So that is an outstanding liability that 
JM Aviation has to SARS.  Correct? 
MR NDZEKU:   Correct, yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Will you be following up about that? 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 381 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Definitely, thank you for advising.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   And please let us know how that goes 
and please also if you could ask your attorneys to send 
through to us tomorrow the investment statements that you 
received from Zano Spark annually that you said you 
previously forgot about it but you have now confirmed that 
you have.  
MR NDZEKU:   I am sorry counsellor I cannot do it like 
yesterday they way you, you know I would have to look.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Would a week be sufficient? 
10 
MR NDZEKU:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Excellent.  
MR NDZEKU:   Sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no that is fine.  Within a week you 
think you be able to…[intervene]   
MR NDZEKU:   No, no not in a week Chair and then you 
know in this Covid and then you know everybody they are 
all over.  
CHAIRPERSON:   How much time do you think will be 
reasonable? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Well I will have to phone the office and talk 
to them.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And tell them this is exactly…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Shall we say you do your best to let the 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 382 of 388 
 
Commission have it within ten days and if that time is not 
enough you will ask your attorneys to let us know by when 
it can be sent.   
MR NDZEKU:   What exactly are you looking for? 
CHAIRPERSON: 
The 
statements 
that 
you 
said…[intervened] 
ADV HOFMEYR:   That were emailed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We are receiving in relation to the 
investment.   
MR NDZEKU:   Investment? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR NDZEKU:   I will have to try to get that.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes no just your evidence previously 
was you received them via email.  So it should not be too 
difficult it seems to Mr Ndzeku to ask for those emails to 
be printed.  
MR NDZEKU:   But counsellor can you please give me a 
chance.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Of course ten days.  
MR NDZEKU:   Do not pressurise me now.  
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, no.  
MR NDZEKU:   You want things now like yesterday you 
want it.  I will have to talk to my people please give me a 
break M'am.  
CHAIRPERSON:   No, no Mr Ndzeku you remember I 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 383 of 388 
 
said…[intervene]  
MR NDZEKU:   No, no but she – but I understand what I 
said…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   We said ten days if there is a 
problem…[intervene]  
MR NDZEKU:   Let me talk to my lawyers and then talk to 
my people and then they will definitely contact me. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No that is fine.  
MR NDZEKU:   Thank you.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair then just in conclusion it is fair 
10 
that I put certain propositions to Mr Ndzeku because they 
will form the basis of the submissions that we will make to 
the Commission in due course.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And it is to offer you an opportunity Mr 
Ndzeku to comment on what I say will be our submissions 
in due course.  Mr Ndzeku we will submit to the Chair in 
due course that you have been a dishonest witness.  That 
you have changed your version on numerous occasions 
today.  Do you have a response to that? 
20 
MR NDZEKU:   Well I said no I did not if I did not 
remember something, I did not remember.  It does not 
mean that if you do not remember you are dishonest. If you 
remember you remember if you do not, you do not.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   It will be our submission in due course 
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 384 of 388 
 
that you were involved in a corrupt scheme that enabled 
you and yourself and your company to benefit from deals 
with SAA and SAA Technical.  Do you have a response to 
that? 
MR NDZEKU:   I said no we are giving a service there was 
no corruption there was no nothing stolen the company did 
business with those people.  If there was something wrong 
there they were supposed to stop at something wrong, I 
said no there was no corruption.   
          If there was a corruption counsellor in four days’ 
10 
time, in five days’ time they are suppose – we are not 
supposed to sit and talk about it.  We are talking about 
something that happened three, four years ago, why now? 
Why this thing they did not stop it that time?     
ADV HOFMEYR:   And the corruption was facilitated 
through kickback payments first to Mr Lester Peter so that 
he could buy two cars.  Your comment on that? 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not know about that.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Secondly to Ms Memela so that she 
could purchase a property in Bedfordview.  Your comment 
20 
on that? 
MR NDZEKU:   I do not know about that.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   And thirdly to Ms Kwinana who got 
R4.3million the month after she left SAA Technical.  Your 
comment on that?  
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 385 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   I know nothing about it, I do not know.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Chair those are the questions that I have 
for Mr Ndzeku.  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
If 
of 
course 
Mr 
Ndzeku 
on 
the 
consideration of all the evidence I were to conclude that 
there was no meeting that took place in the Eastern 
Cape…[intervene]   
MR NDZEKU:   Mpindweni.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I was looking for the name of the 
place, yes then that he would also have been party to 
10 
saying something happened that did not happen.  You 
accept that?  
MR NDZEKU:   I understand that ja.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes but you stand on your version that 
the meeting did take place.  
MR NDZEKU:   Yes it did yes.  
CHAIRPERSON:   And in so far as the offer to purchase 
may have been a forgery you say you were not involved in 
that? 
MR NDZEKU:   Well the way counsellor they got that Ms 
20 
Barkley or something like that.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
MR NDZEKU:   For me I accept because it does 
not…[intervene] 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 386 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   I accept all the papers and all of that.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  No thank you very much I do not 
know whether you wish to re-examine or not really or 
whether you wish to come back some other time to re-
examine? 
ADV ALLI:   No, no Chair, we’ve that is fine. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You are fine? 
ADV ALLI:   No we have our position, we do not intend to 
re-examine.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
ADV ALLI:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay no that is fine.  Thank you very 
much Mr Ndzeku for coming to give evidence.  It has been 
a long day.  You are excused now and thank you to your 
legal team for all the cooperation as well.  We are done for 
now and should a need arise and it does not look like it will 
arise but should it arise or further questions to be put to 
you arrangements will be made.    
MR NDZEKU:   Thank you.  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay.  
ADV ALLI:   Thank you.  
MR NDZEKU:   Do I take my files or do they stay here? 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think you - if they are yours you can 
take them.  Ms Hofmeyr will tell you.  
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 387 of 388 
 
MR NDZEKU:   Ms Hofmeyr all these files are my name can 
I have them? 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I have got no difficulty with you taking 
the witness file.  You know can I say sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   I know that the document management 
team has a difficulty with the files being taken. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV HOFMEYR:   But electronically we would be able to 
provide you through your attorneys with a copy. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Could I ask that we do that rather I am 
just anxious about the hard copy being taken.  
MR NDZEKU:   But my attorney say he did not get the 
document and you just gave them the document when we 
came here.  That is why I said can I have them, do you 
understand?  
ADV HOFMEYR:   Mr Ndzeku all I am saying is the 
document management team…[intervene]  
MR NDZEKU:   So it is no.  
20 
ADV HOFMEYR:   No, no Mr Ndzeku I am saying we can 
email you an electronic copy of the full file.  
MR NDZEKU:   No I believe in reading I like to read.   
ADV HOFMEYR:   Yes.  
MR NDZEKU:   This was a good lesson of the school today.  
26 AUGUST 2020 – DAY 255 
 
Page 388 of 388 
 
ADV HOFMEYR:   I will take the blame with the document 
management team.  
MR NDZEKU:   So thank you very much.

you.
