PROCEEDINGS ON 28 MAY 2019  
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Sello, good morning everybody.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Good morning Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Are you ready?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes we are ready Chair except we will be 
referring to some documents that are in your files and I do not know if 
the Chair would like to reach out to a file when the time comes.  And if 
that is the case I think the files are rather far from the Chair.  I do not 
know if we can address the…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that is what I was talking to her about.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – well how – how much will we be using them 
before tea break? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It – If I may just – we just make it to tea break 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no I think she has managed.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  She has managed Chair?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay then we will sort them out properly 
during tea. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Chair before we proceed 
may I remind the Chair that two weeks ago we presented reports of 
investigations undertaken in respect of certain transactions within 
Transnet.  Today we are engaging  MNS as one of the investigators on 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 3 of 213 
 
specifically the investigations they conducted and their reports that 
they have filed which have now been – which now form part of the 
record before the Chair.  In addressing – in going through these issues 
Chair we do not want to present the witness and I use that term 
guardedly as a factual witness.  The witness is speaking to what their 
mandate is, what they did and what is the outcome of the process and 
he will cross-refer us to the various reports.  With that underst anding 
then an interesting question has arisen and we would seek the Chair’s 
guidance in this regard whether it is necessary to swear in the witness 
– particular witness. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it will be necessary. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We shall proceed to do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know he is still a witness.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We shall proceed to do so Chair if the witness 
may be sworn in? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja thank you. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is Tshiamo Michael Sedumedi. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objections to taking the prescribed 
oath? 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  No. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes it does. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you solemnly swear that all the evidence that you will 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 4 of 213 
 
give will be the truth; the whole truth and nothing but the truth; if so 
please raise your right hand and say, so help me God.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So help me God. 
REGISTRAR:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Let me just get the full names I did not 
get them properly. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  My name is Tshiamo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Tshiamo, Tsh. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Th. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  No, no.  S. 
CHAIRPERSON:  S yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  No Tsh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Amo.  Tshiamo, Tshiamo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh and you pronounce it Tshiamo? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Tshiamo correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And the surname is Sedumedi. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Se hey? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Se 
CHAIRPERSON:  Di 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 5 of 213 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Du 
CHAIRPERSON:  Du 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Me 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Di. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Chair before you you should 
have a set of slides in a folder with a back backing – a black backing.  I 
10 
shall not call the folder black Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  You will not call it black?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No Chair I will not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We have taken the liberty of marking that set 
of slides Exhibit BB8[a].   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And for the record Chair we will be presenting 
four witnesses in regard to the MNS investigations.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Sedumedi’s presentation is marked BB8[a] 
and the next witness will be marked BB8[b] but MNS will retain the title 
BB8.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes this file marked the procurement of 95,100 and 
1064 locomotives by Transnet will be marked as Exhibit BB 8[a].  I think 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 6 of 213 
 
when you have got 8 so close to the second B...  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It looks like a B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is like it is not double BB8[a] it looks like BBB so I 
think maybe you create more space between the last B.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We shall Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will uplift your copy and introduce a space 
between the last B and the 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To distinguish the 8 from the B. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You should as well Chair have another folder 
in red. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Called the Index Transnet Reference bundle.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The Chair will recall that when we submitted 
the reports we gave a general bundle.  We have upda ted that bundle 
insofar as MNS is concerned for ease of reference and page – the first 
six pages the Chair has already seen they are part of the original 
20 
bundles.  What we have done from page 7 is to unpack the index even 
further indicating the specific pages where specific exhibits appear.  
That detail was not – was not set out in the original index.  The index 
just told one where to find exhibits.  So they would run let us say over 
a thousand pages.  So we have tried to be more specific and broken it 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 7 of 213 
 
down further from page – after the first index for the next five pages.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well in this index you have got a report at the bottom 
on the left hand corner – excuse me and you have file volume.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the right hand corner of that index. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you have got 1,2,3,4,5,6…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  There are 19 items. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Up to 19.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does that – do those numbers 1 to 19 reflect the  
numbers you have given to 19 reports?  In other words the report 1, 
report 2, report 3 up to 19?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is - yes the numbering on the left indicates 
there are 19 in all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is just the numbering. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also when one goes to them will one find 1,2,3, - 
are they marked like that?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Not like that Chair.  What – we then used the 
20 
column on the right which is called File Volume and that tells you which 
report is listed is in which volume.  So in this instance the first 4 
reports are to be found in Volume 1.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  So the numbering on the left then is just for 
the various items on the index?  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 8 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Just for the various items yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not about the reports? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Where the reports are to be found.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so the items are the reports?  The items relate 
to the reports? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then on the column on the extreme right you 
indicate – you say File Volume? 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair.  If the Chair would just glance at 
the files they are all marked volume 1 of 17 or volume 7 of 17.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So – so those numbers under File Volume tell 
you in which volume you will find a particular report?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – okay.  The file part might just confuse hey?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So we – the Chair suggests we delete the 
word file? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And just have Volume. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just have Volume. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We could do that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then – then it is – then one knows exactly. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So when you go to the ac tual lever arch files you 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 9 of 213 
 
look for volume. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Volume 1, Volume 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Volume 1, Volume 2, Volume 3.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As the case may be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will do so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so let us delete file.  And – and the item, the 
report under item 6  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have got 2A, 4, 5, 6 and 7 2B 8, 9 and 10.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those are still volumes?  If you go physically to the 
report you will find written 2A?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  As regards transaction item 6.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It resulted in two separate reports.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The heading is the same except the one 
report is titled 2A the other is titled 2B.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So when we get to 6 we say insofar as 2A is 
concerned that shall be found at Volumes 4,5,6 and 7.  2B is at 8,9 and 
10. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2A and 2B referred to sections of the same report?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of the same report.  Except that they are – 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 10 of 213 
 
MNS filed them separately.  They address different issues but all the 
issues emanate from the same transaction.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So 2A is to be found in Volumes 4,5,6 and 7?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And 7 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those are the numbers you will find when you go 
physically to the…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To the volumes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the report – to the lever arch files. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To the lever arch files. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Then I think that 2A should not be there.  I 
think it should be on the item side and 2B because it confuses – it may 
cause confusion.  You see the principle is as you have confirmed to me 
what comes under that column, under volume tells the reader what the 
volume number is for that particular report.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the report that it relates to is the one mentioned 
in the middle column of the index?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I think the 2A and 2B parts should be on this side 
so that – because otherwise I think if it is like this I think when I go to 
the lever arch file I must look for 2A and I will not find 2A or 2B.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Am I right? 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 11 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No you are – you are correct.  You – the Chair 
will find on the spine 2A or 2B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is marked 2A? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is marked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If I may say? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Originally the index read as regards that 
report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Into 1064. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Volumes 4 to 10. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But there was no way of indicating which 
report specifically is in which volumes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that is when we came up with the idea 
that we should put 2A underlined to indicate that insofar as 2A is 
concerned that is to be found at 4, 5, 6, 7 and 2B of the 1067 
20 
transaction is to be found at 8, 9 and 10.  That was the purpose of 
marking it that way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if –  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But if there is a better way of doing it Chair 
we are happy to change it. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 12 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well if I will find 2A on the…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  On the spine. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the file – the lever arch file. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair you will. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair you will. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine so – so there will be 1 written 2A and 
then 4, 5, 6 and 7. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair if I may just. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Glance at my – yes Chair I have volume 4 
with a name and then it says Volume 2A then Volume 5 again says 2A 6 
and 7 and then when you get to volume 8 it says 2B whic h is 8, 9 10.  
They will – they will be 2B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – that is fine.  So I think if we are going to retain 
2A where it is in the index and they are under 2A four lever arch files.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Each one of – they should all reflect that 2A, 4 2A, 5 
2A, 6 2A, 7. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  They do currently. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because then if I look at the index I go and look for 
2A 5. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I must find 2A 5 written.  If I find 5 only.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 13 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I will think it is not the one.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No it will be…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It will give you the name of the report.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  2A Volume 5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is fine.  Same with 2B? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Same with 2B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  Okay.  No I think the – the rest 
appear to be – there is 12 – 12 3 – 12 and 13 what is the story there?  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is two volumes. It is the relocation  of two 
OEM’s to Durban.  It is in two volumes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh so it is volumes 12 and 13. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is volumes 12 and 13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is fine. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then if I may go overleaf the Chair will recall 
this index.  Chair will recall that when we submitted the reports we 
indicated that we had printed only the reports in hard copy.  The 
20 
annexures to the reports were in soft copies.  In order to assist w ith 
navigation we indicated in that index on which pages the actual report 
runs and which pages the annexures run.  That is the purpose of the 
second index.  Four pages forward  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I am sorry you are talking about page 3?  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 14 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I was page – talking about page 3. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so does that take care of each of the reports?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Each of the reports.  So for…  
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is page 3 and page 4?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Page 4, page 5 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And page 5. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So if we take…  
CHAIRPERSON:  What – okay so I think where the middle column 
10 
where it says File volume we delete file.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It will just be volume. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As – again. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For consistency.  So that tells me which volume deals 
with which report 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If I read – look at the first column and the second.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The second column – yes the first and the 
second. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As we did in the first index. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and then… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Except this index is broader. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 15 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It then introduces a column repor t pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it tells you the report is to be found …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Exhibit. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And lastly it indicates what – over what pages 
the exhibits run. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So we would have let us say on item 4 they 
run from page 174 to page 4222 that is just exhibits.  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is – those are the annexures?  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Those are the annexures to the report.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes to the report. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  And item 5 they run from 4307 to 5274?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But those are page numbers as opposed to the 
number of actual annexures, is that right?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No it is page numbering. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it is page numbers ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes, yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay and if you go to item 6 they start from…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  There is that 2A / 2B split. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and under A you have got 533326 825..  Ja I think 
this is a good – this a good way to make sure.  It is easy to locate any 
particular annexure. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 16 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now if I may add then to your exhibit file?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh well maybe – maybe 
ADV VERUSCHKA SEPTEMBER :  Your index file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does not – it does not help me with how to locate 
any particular annexure. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now that is…  
CHAIRPERSON:  It just tells me where…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are updating…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Where I will find all the annexures for that report.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are updating your index file. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Your Registrar is about to hand you a 
document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which should go at the back. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which seeks to address precisely that point.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So on what – on MNS reports. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh she has decided to take…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It has been – you have been dispossessed 
Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She has decided to take everything from me.  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 17 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now where we?   
CHAIRPERSON:  She promises me what she is giving me is better than 
what I had before. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will accept that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then after the landscaped index we have 
just introduced a few more pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am not sure from where she – oh she must have – 
the new document must be the one coming after page 5?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  After page 5 Chair yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will insert a proper description page for 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now that document she just inserted seeks to 
address the very point that the Chair has raised which is where do I go 
if I am looking for exhibit 22  of this particular report?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And we identify the exhibit number and we 
provide in the last column the exact pages where that exhibit is to be 
20 
found. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  In that report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So you have a column under the heading 
Reports. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 18 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you have got A, B, C, D, E, F and F.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Let me – if I may address myself first to the 
numbering 4,5,6 report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That 4,5,6 corresponds with item number in 
the main index.  Your index will show you item number 4 is that 
acquisition of 1064 locomotives. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but then – then you should not have the word 
“report” above for that should you?  You see in the previous… 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Well – Item. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the previous pages report is above the items as 
opposed to the numbers on the extreme left.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will change that to item. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes item yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELL O:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then we are dealing with item 4.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The next column tells us the description of the 
report? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The description of the repor t. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you have a column for file?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  File would be Volume. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 19 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  File will be volume. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So on that it tells us if you go to volume 1 we 
find the report itself from pages 57 to page 173.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Where we say volume we ineffectively mean the 
report volume, is that right?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair if I may? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  In other – another  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It means volume Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    It is a volume of anything it is  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No it is our volumes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is a report volume.  In other words it tells me what 
– what a report that is and what lever arch file will I be finding.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Lever arch file yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or maybe we should be saying lever arch files that of 
report I am not sure of what…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is because we marked the lever arch files 
volume 1, volume 2 up to 17. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So when we say volume we say go to our 
volume 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And at pages 57 to 173 that is where the 
report will be located. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 20 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is what we are trying to communicate we 
are not sure if it really is coming through. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no you remember I was the one that said 
this file report is confusing. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we agreed let us delete file.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We delete file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And say report.  It is – one report may have a number 
of files – lever arch files. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And when we say report 1 you – we actually mean the 
lever arch file? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No when we say report we say the report filed 
by MNS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no I mean when we – you see under – under let 
us go back to – let us go back to page 1. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see where it was saying File Volume not Report 
actually. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  File Volume. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Volume. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We deleted file. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And retained the word volume. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 21 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It says now volume 1, volume …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that – those numbers I earlier on said that refers 
to report.  I think I said that but when I think it through it seems to 
actually refer to a lever arch file.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  A lever arch file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is lever arch file 1. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELL O:  Indeed Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That – that is what we should be having. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The extreme right column.   Indeed Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  The extreme right column. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe not volume or do you think we should retain 
volume? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We would prefer to retain volume  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As long as we understand that the volumes 
referred to – the commission’s volumes – the commission has submitted 
to you as far as reports are concerned 17 volumes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And each is marked accordingly.  Volume 1, 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 22 of 213 
 
volume 2 up to 17. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we must understand volume to be …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The arch lever file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To mean the same thing as a lever arch file.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Absolutely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay hopefully it will not be confusing to somebody 
who might have to go through who is not here. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Should – we hope not because even when 
10 
they uploaded they will be uploaded under volumes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It will be Transnet – we call it a reference 
bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Volume 1.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Volume 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay let us stick to volume.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then going to the latest edition which is the 
last pages inserted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me see – one second.  Yes okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then as I indicated in response to the Chair ’s 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 23 of 213 
 
query about if the Chair wants to see Exhibit 20 of the report – the 
1064 report how do you go about it?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay on what page are we… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is the –  
CHAIRPERSON:  The first page of the new document?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The first page of the new document.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We then – we said the first column is the item 
number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which cross-references to the main index. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then the report itself is identified.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And volume 1 the report itself appears at 
pages 57 to 173. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you might wish you see you have got in that 
document report description. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You might wish to do exactly the same on the first 
20 
document you know? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will add that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because that – those items actually give a description 
of the report. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 24 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The Chair then enquired what is Part A, Part 
B, Part C. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us finish first.  So where we had file we  said we 
delete that and write volume. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Volume Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is fine.  And then after that column you have 
got report – report and then part – part – exhibit – bla, bla, bla. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you have got in the next column 57 to 173 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   what is that? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It says report 57 under the heading pages 57 
to – from page 57 to page 173.  The Chair will recall we are still in 
volume 1 and there are other reports that precede this particular one in 
volume 1.   
CHAIRPERSON:  There is a report 57?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No, no.  It is pages 57 to 173. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this is pages 57 to 173?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  173.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Pages of the – of the… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of the volume. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the report. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of the volume.  The page numbering at the 
extreme is our volume numbering. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 25 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you have got report there and before report you 
have got a volume 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That report refers to what?  You have got a report 
description on the second column so that report is which report?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Keeping our finger there Cha ir and we go 
back to the main index.  We look for item four.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Item four reads: 
“Acquisition of 1 064 …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  “…dated 7 December…” 
And it tells us it is in volume 1.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  When we go then to this index that is the 
report item four. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The next one is item five which is the next 
20 
one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  1 064 and it starts off with the report at 
volume 1 and the pages from 4223 to 4306.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us talk about four. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 26 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Let us – yes Chair and perhaps … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see – I see nothing about four there.  Four and five 
are different.  Is it not?  They are different items.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If – if I go Chair to – you just have the report 
at item four without the annexures.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So why do we have it there if the – I thought 
that this one is page – the pages that come after it are there to give us 
more details about where to locate (intervenes). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To avoid confusion we – we can remove that 
because it is a direct duplication of item four in the main index.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are happy then to delete four on this 
page. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then it will start will five. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And item five is the procurement of 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And is the position that item four - that is that report 
describing item four has no annexures?  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It has got no – does not have any annexures 
in your current volumes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, right.  So okay then – then we go to five. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 27 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We go to five. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then we use – we use the heading which you already 
have at the top. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then in terms of that we have got volume under that 
column there is one – one and one and two and two and three and 
three.  So – so those are the – those are the file – lever arch files 
relating to this particular report?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you then have “report” written on the next 
10 
column? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is that? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is the actual report from 4223 to 4306 
and there under we list there its various exhibits.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh but why – why do we need the word “report” 
there?  Is it not causing confusion because so far in terms of the first 
document that index? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As I see the principle it is – if you go to the index you 
20 
must know the description of the report you are looking for.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  There is an index that gives you the 
description of the report.  Once you know the description of the report 
you are looking for the index will – has a column which tells you in 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 28 of 213 
 
which lever arch file or lever arch files you will find that report.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We have called that volume so and so.  We 
have not called them lever arch file whatever.  So you - now you know 
where to find a particular report.  It may be in one lever arch file.  It 
may be in a number of lever arch files. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Then now you want to find annexures relating 
to the report.  So the next thing you should know is in which pages of 
the volumes that you have been told about you will find particular 
10 
annexures.  So it seems to me if when I am now looking I found the – I 
know which report I am looking for and I know which lever arch files 
relate to that report.  When I am looking for where to find the 
annexures you tell me about a report.  You are confusing me.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay Chair maybe if I …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I know the report already.  I know the lever arch files.  
All I want now is …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is the annexures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where are the annexures in the lever arch files?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We can do so.  I just need to – to bring to the 
20 
Chair’s attention the following:  this latest index we have just given you 
that indicates specifically where each annexure is to be found does not 
relate to all seven – not to all the 17 volumes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  This is MNS specific. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 29 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No that is fine. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It was intended to be able to exist separate 
from the main index. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Once you have this you can find your way 
through the entire MNS report system.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But what – what it can do if it is separate is just to 
say this is about the MNS report - you know and … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then we will take out …  
CHAIRPERSON:  And then you say MNS Reports are in volumes 1 to 
whatever and then you say annexures blah, blah, blah the page 
numbers. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will give it another shot Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will take out the report.  The last thing we 
want is to create confusion. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is confusion, ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which is intended to assist …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To avoid …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 30 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Confusion and – and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Facilitate reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So we will report …  
CHAIRPERSON:  But if … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will remove reference to report each time.  
Just identify the report and start with EXHIBIT 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  You have got part what – part what? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That – that … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  This was written in – in the files? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  We – we do so because MNS has 
grouped its exhibits in terms of Part A, Part B, Part C to F. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is how they have done it …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that is why the Chair will see in Part A it 
runs from 4307 to 4323. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So that – that is at a high level. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then at a granular level it is the next list …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which then gives you EXHIBIT 1 is at 5335 
and so forth. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 31 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes the – the Part A, Part B is the way the 
report itself is structured …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And we were trying to link the manner in 
which they have structured their report with our – with our index. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But once again if – if it does not assist it is 
not an important feature.  We can do away with it.  
CHAIRPERSON:  We – we have used exhibits so and so exhibit that 
10 
exhibit that.  That is how the transcript reads.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it not? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not think it has Part A, Part B and so on probably 
because we did not have need to talk about parts.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We did not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think that maybe you - maybe what one needs in 
regard to the parts are to indicate – okay.  So that indicates where 
those parts are to be found?  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  Parts as identified in the report itself …  
CHAIRPERSON:  And … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And each part has its own exhibits.  
CHAIRPERSON:  And under volume 1 you have got Part A up to C?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 32 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then D falls under both volumes 1 and two.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So maybe- maybe we can leave that as – as it 
is and then in – then in the – under or alongside four you have got 
“report” there was well. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja and we have said that we are going to 
delete that going forward. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You can delete that. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then after that you just have EXHIBIT 1, exhibit 
whatever … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which is what we – we have been dealing with.  So 
that is – that is easy. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But now you have got numbers on the right hand side 
of exhibits.  So those are exhibit numbers?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No.  On – on the right hand side?  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  On – ja before the pages - page numbers. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  It reads EXHIBIT 1, EXHIBIT 2 …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And they are all in volume 4 at least for that 
… 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 33 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  They are all in volume 4. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So it is EXHIBITS 1 to 22. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja you see – you see at the top I think if you go to 
where we deleted the word “report” (intervenes). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the dark - on the dark part just above that. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have got “volume 1” written there.  Can you see 
10 
it?  Before date – dated October. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I am at item six Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, I am at …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Item five? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 1 of the new document in the index.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the top. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see where we deleted “report”?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I see that Chair.  We substituted that 
20 
(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before Part A, Part B …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then there is the dark part locomotives, volume 
1. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 34 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can you see volume 1? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I see that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now it creates the impression in – at least to my eye 
that what falls under that is volume whatever which would be confusing 
because we have got volume on the other side but that is part of the 
description of the item.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  May – maybe what we should do I think what I will do 
on mine when you go to – you know – the second report that we 
10 
deleted? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That we deleted? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and then you have got EXHIBIT 1, EXHIBIT 2.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think I am going to write on top of EXHIBIT 1 – I am 
going to write exhibit number. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so … 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You can do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I do not link those numbers with volume 1 at the 
top because otherwise I think it is … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You get confused. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is volume 1, volume 2.  So it is exhibit number.  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 35 of 213 
 
Okay.  That – that seems to be clear for me now.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then it just follows the  (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Actually – actually if you go to page 2 …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the new document exactly on that column under 
which I have written exhibit number you have got number.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And we put exhibit number. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja – ja you have got number but we did not have 
number on this side.  You see there was no consistency.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I – I see.  I see Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So okay.  Okay I - I think I – I follow – I follow the 
rest.  I think it is just these references to “report” that would be 
confusing.  I am just deleting them if it is fine with you.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is – it is fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On page – on page 4. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And as we work through the documents if 
20 
there still a better way of improving the index we are happy to do that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  Yes, no.  I think I understand it much better 
now, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  So then we will be working 
off EXHIBIT BB8A and to the extent necessary then we shall make 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 36 of 213 
 
reference to the index, thanks. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Sedumedi are you ready?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well does – have his documents been – are they the 
same as ours?  Will we have the same understanding?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As Mr Sedumedi? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes or are we going to speak to different pages?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are – different pages is not an option 
Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Because we will be talking to the same pages.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Do – do you want a – a short adjournment to make 
sure that we have the same everything of …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  He just gave a slight nod.  I think for his 
comfort Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes I will be happy to do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Let us take a five minutes adjournment then.  
20 
We will resume at 10 to 11. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn.

Page 37 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Sello you may proceed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair, thank you for the 
opportunity and yes we will all be speaking off the same page.  If I may 
then turn to you Mr Sedumedi.  You have provided your name, c ould 
you give the Chair a sense of your professional background and what 
you currently do? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Thanks Chair, like I said earlier 
on my name is Tshiamo Sedumedi, I am the Managing Director at 
Mncedisi Ndlovu & Sedumedi Attorneys, i t is a law firm based in Illovo, 
17 years old this year.  Our primary focus at the firm is on procurement 
10 
law, construction law which speaks by and large to most of the issues 
that are covered in our reports, and as well as a fair amount of forensic 
investigations that we have been doing over the years.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you have prepared for us today a set of 
slides regarding your involvement in the matters that are relevant to 
what the Chair is enquiring in to.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    The Chair has a copy, I have a copy as well 
and you have your copy. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:    Correct Chair. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    Perhaps for the benefit of the public if we 
can project it onto the screen and if you co uld take us through your 
slides. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   It is projected Chair, it is on my 
slide and I can see on that – there you go. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 38 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Yes, now if we turn to your second slide you 
list the issues you’ll be dealing with which incl ude the mandate of MNS 
the methodology employed by MNS in the course of investigations and 
then you list a number of transactions that you say were investigated 
by MNS. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair yes, being the 95 
locomotives, hundred 1064  as well as the (indistinct) for 1064 and the 
infamous relocation of CNR and Bombardier to Durban.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Okay starting then with your mandate, could 
you summarise for us what your mandate was and from whom such 
10 
mandate was received. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   Correct Chair, I think before I do 
the exact mandate, I think I should at least deal with the background to 
our appointment.  We were appointed by the former Transnet Board 
sometime in late February 2018 but work actually commenced in 
earnest in March 2018.  Our appointment followed the submission by 
Werksmans of a report to the, then Board, which the Board was not 
quite comfortable with and that (indistinct) to the (indistinct) for 
investigation as well.  So, when the new Board came in , in June 2018, 
we then had to present our preliminary findings at a particular time, 
20 
mainly relating to 1064 and hundred locomotives.  The Board was quite 
satisfied with what was presented and (indistinct) we were not as yet 
finished the full scope of our  mandate so our instruction was then to 
proceed with the outstanding investigations but at the same time 
implement some of the findings that were coming out of our preliminary 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 39 of 213 
 
report.  So that’s what happened in June last year and that spoke now 
to the actual mandate which was first crafted by the previous Board in 
the (indistinct) summarisation of a five page document that was actually 
given to us as part of our mandate. In essence, was to establish 
whether the 1064 transaction in terms of the ETC, was the re any 
inflating of prices after hedging, whether in the procurement of 1064 
and hundred locomotives were there any governance process that were 
followed and were such processes effective.  Was there any (indistinct) 
between Tequesta and CSR, we’ll talk ab out that, I think towards – after 
lunch and  provide some recommendation as to – in view of your 
10 
findings what recommendations is MNS providing to the Board and what 
steps can Transnet take against anyone who was found to be wanting in 
(indistinct) themselves in the transaction and as well recommend to the 
Board if there are any remedial steps within Transnet itself that they 
can embark upon to prevent the re -occurrence of such activities, so 
that is what our mandate entailed in a nutshell Chair.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there a document on which it is reflected, the 
mandate? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Chair? 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is there a document here which reflects the 
mandate? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
There is not a document in the reports 
themselves or in the Exhibits that reflects the mandate, what Mr 
Sedumedi has given us is a summary of what appears from the mandate 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 40 of 213 
 
letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
And I’m sure same can be made available 
should the Chair require. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:    Correct that will be done. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Okay thank you, now you say that was the 
mandate that you were given, now could you briefly take us through the 
methodology that you employed in the course of investigations and 
what processes you followed? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:    Correct, obviously as a first 
10 
step one would have to collate a lot of documents (indistinct) 
transaction and by and large we relied on the…(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe you might just tell us about the t eam that 
was involved because I’m sure it wasn’t just you alone, the team that 
was involved, how was it made up, what were their qualifications for 
this kind of task and then proceed from there.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Thank you Chair. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   Certainly Chair (indistinct) we 
can’t assign such a task only to a law firm because there was – we had 
to set up a multi-disciplinary team of professionals I’ll first start within 
20 
the law firm itself obviously like I said, when I spoke about the vari ous 
disciplines we had to put up lawyers focusing on procurement, 
corporate and commercial law and construction law in the main.  Then 
to the extent that obviously, some of the issues that you are dealing 
with here, speak of financial issues.  We then got an actuary who 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 41 of 213 
 
assisted us to analyse some of the documents insofar as relating to 
financial issues, we also had a forensic team that obviously then 
(indistinct) how to collate date, how to image – you will see on 
methodology we speak about the imaging of computers and servers, 
that’s what we got and as well, because the nature of instruction 
involved technical issues of engineering as well.  We had Arcus Gibb 
who we roped in to look into the (indistinct) engineering aspects of the 
project.  So that was a multi-disciplinary team that we had composed to 
ensure that at least all the issues that fall within our mandate are able 
to be addressed effectively. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   So what is the – what was the number of the 
members of the team, is it five or six or it di ffered according to the 
different stages of the investigation?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: 
I must confess Chair, 95%, 
if not 99% of the entire MNS lawyers were involved.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I think only one or two people 
wouldn’t have been involved in (indistinct) MNS has 22 lawyers so the 
bulk of those lawyers were dedicated to this project.  
 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes. 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: 
Obviously 
as 
well 
the 
forensic (indistinct) had their own employees so we are talking abo ut, 
close to 40 personnel who were involved in various aspects obviously 
of the mandate that we executed. 
CHAIRPERSON: Okay, no that’s fine but the disciplines that you have 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 42 of 213 
 
mentioned were the disciplines that were represented in the team?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: 
Correct, which is why, in 
actual fact when we get our volumes, different chapters were written by 
different people focusing on those particular expertise which is why 
even in terms of our testimony will be assigning different experts to 
focus on various aspects of the report.  
CHAIRPERSON: Okay thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Thank you Chair.  Thank you for that 
background Mr Sedumedi, you were then going to explain to the Chair 
exactly the methodology that you employed and to inform him of the 
10 
various processes that you followed.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct, so like I said obviously 
the first port of call will be to get documents that (indistinct) before that 
time we did not have any knowledge about the project so we had to 
collate documents. By and large the documents were sourced from 
Transnet, we had to identify the persons that were involved that could 
be able to give us the things that we required.  Transnet at a stage 
assigned the lady called Ms Lindi (indistinct) she was our interf ace in 
terms of collating data, so quite – we had to troll through volumous 
reports and documents that were produced by Transnet over the years.  
20 
Like I said, earlier on as well, we had to ask access to their computers 
because some of the information might  not specifically have been 
printed in hard copy.  They also then provide us with a soft copy of 
their portions of the server relating to 1064, obviously again, you can’t 
rely purely on the documents because they can only take you up so far, 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 43 of 213 
 
we had to interview various people within Transnet in particular those 
whose names would have arisen as we were perusing documents.  
Close to (indistinct) list of interviewees that we gave to the Commission 
yesterday round about 20 or so members of Transnet who were als o 
involved in the transaction.  Not necessarily them being directly 
involved but at least even those that would have had knowledge of 
some of the doings on the transaction, so we did conduct those 
interviews and interviews were all recorded to the knowledg e of those 
that we were interviewing, the transcripts, should the Commission also 
require, copies of the transcripts of the interviews that will be gladly 
10 
provided to the Commission. In actual fact after my discussion with 
Advocate Muglape yesterday, we have already assigned a team to get 
us all the copies of the transcripts of each and every person that we 
interviewed over a period of 18 months.  
CHAIRPERSON: I think that will be very important, those transcripts of 
those interviews. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDU MEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
And we shall submit them but then just to 
confirm that the transcripts themselves do not form part of the Exhibits 
of the reports. 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
So they will have to be submitted s eparately 
and as soon as they are at hand Chair, that should be before Transnet 
– MNS rather completes it’s assistance to you, we would find a way of 
submitting them formally into the record.  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 44 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON: Ja they would form part of the record on which the 
report was made, was based. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: If they are transcripts, if they are statements of 
witnesses, transcripts of interviews, statements of witnesses that were 
obtained just like you have Exhibit documents that they obt ained, those 
are all part of the record on which the report is made which are quite 
important because to the findings made must be made tested against 
the record that was available. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Indeed Chair I just wanted – less there is 
10 
confusion that – to clarify that the transcripts themselves are not 
Exhibits to MNS reports but the transcripts will be submitted to this 
Commission and as Mr Sedumedi indicated they are currently being 
collated and we hope that exercise should be complete before the week 
is over. 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes okay thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Thank you Chair, now Mr Sedumedi you talk 
of engagements and interviews with Transnet officials, must the Chair 
understand by that, that you mean persons who were still within the 
employ of Transnet at the time you were conducting the investigation?  
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: 
Correct Chair yes, because 
the focus at that stage was saying, let’s focus on the internal 
employees in as much we were quite mindful of the fact that there are 
people who are also out of Transnet who might have been involved, I 
mean, former employees like Mr Brian Molefe as an example.  Those 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 45 of 213 
 
were part of the persons that we initially targeted to interview, we only 
focus on the internal ones so as to be able to enable the Board to form 
a view as to what action must it take against anyone who has been 
identified.  The plan being once the reports are produced then they are 
made available to (indistinct) as soon as the report was done it was 
made available to the employees  for them to respond to what the 
findings entailed.  Indeed, there were various correspondence 
exchanged between the Board, the new Board and some of the former 
employees who were implicated in the document.  As explained, 
obviously, they would contest wha t was contained in the reports but 
10 
then the Board then said, obviously, the only fair way of ensuring that 
we put their version is through normal disciplinary processes that the 
Board intended to take.  So that is where we close the subject of 
ensuring that the employees have a right of reply if I can use that word.  
We also then requested to say, these effect external parties like the 
OEM’s who were involved.  In the last four months we have engaged 
(indistinct) Transnet to engage the OEM’s to present to t hem our 
findings and as well what their take is on what we have found and that 
process commenced only, in December 2018 and is still ongoing.  The 
same applies to various (indistinct) advisors who were identified, we 
20 
are engaging with them, the (indistinct ) of where we are converging but 
obviously is expected there are points where (indistinct) from what we 
are saying so that is the approach.   
 
Now insofar as the former employees in our report we said – 
and it was even before this (indistinct) where it was  actually in place 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 46 of 213 
 
but we always knew at the time that it was going to be a judicial 
Commission of Enquiry on State Capture.  We made recommendations 
in chapter five of our volume one that people like those who are not 
part of Transnet currently, they must  be referred to the Commission for 
them to put their version of what is contained in our reports.  So that is 
put for each one of them who’s not within Transnet on chapter five of 
volume one that is being indicated.  
CHAIRPERSON: So just to make sure I understand, after you had been 
appointed, MNS had been appointed, you put together a team that was 
going to conduct the investigation.  In the course of that investigation 
10 
you interviewed a number of employees of Transnet.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: 
Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now are you saying that you didn’t interview anyone, 
at that stage, before preparing the report, anyone who was outside of 
Transnet? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   Correct, that’s correct indeed 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes okay so – so once you had interviewed a number 
of Transnet employees and obtained documents and so on you then 
prepared the report, is that right?  
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: 
That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, and you presented the report to the Board.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   Correct Chair. 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And there was an appreciation that there were some 
of the employees of Transnet who were implicated in the report and it 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 47 of 213 
 
was decided by the Board that those would be subjected to a 
disciplinary process where they would get a chance to put their side of 
the story. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but those who may have been implicated who 
were within Transnet had also been interviewed by your team, or not 
really? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Each and every person that is 
being implicated in our report was interviewed Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:   So in a way they had, had a chance to put their side 
10 
of the story. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But before any disciplinary action could be taken by 
the company they would get the normal disciplinary process as well?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But those that were outside of Transnet at the time 
you were conducting the investigation, you di d not interview? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   We did not interview those ones 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that includes those who may have been at 
20 
Transnet at some stage but were no longer at Transnet when you 
conducted the investigation?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   Except for Ms Mutani who was 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 48 of 213 
 
the former head of Treasury at the time, other than that we did – even 
by that time we did our investigations she was no longer part of 
Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   We did have an interview with 
persons like those. 
 
CHAIRPERSON: Yes, yes, now the decision not to interview those that 
were outside of Transnet, was that a decision that was taken simply 
because the investigation was seen as internal to Transnet or was it 
because they were not cooperating even though they were approached?  
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It was two-fold Chair the first part 
being obviously it was an internal process and as well we had to make 
a judgement call to say, given the extent of how some of them were 
implicated, how – what powers do we have as a team to really – I won’t 
use the subpoena lightly, not…(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON:  To get them…(intervention). 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct because with the 
employees it was quite easy which sent an email to the powers that be 
that we need to consult with Mrs so and so, then all in all those 
persons will then subject themselves to the interview.  So, we didn’t 
20 
have a mechanism of foreseeing  those that were outside of Transnet to 
cooperate with us.  A person like (indistinct) we knew because if you 
look at how she gets reflected it was more of basically, having the 
same position that we heard about the role within Transnet, that is why 
then when we made our recommendations to Transnet in chapter 5 to 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 49 of 213 
 
say persons like Mr Molefe, Gary Pita, Singh those one we recommend 
that Transnet refer them to the Commission to ensure, that at least with 
the powers that the Commission – because even at that time we weren’t 
even quite sure of the extent of the powers that the Commission might 
have but our own reading of the law was that, obviously you would be 
having the powers to subpoena them they can come and say 
(indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay and then you talked about a process that 
you’re still involved in now, what process is that?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  We are currently running a 
10 
(indistinct) process Chair, like I said when the Board, the new Board 
that is,  they said, obviously to the exten t that they (indistinct) 
investigations proceed that aspect that is why, as an example some of 
the volumes only came available this year but at the same time you 
must implement the findings to date that’s one part, that speaks to the 
institution (indistinct) proceedings where possible institute civil actions 
against various individuals who have been identified.  Part of the 
process – the OEM’s because currently Transnet still has contractual 
arrangements with these OEM’s, engage with OEM – because what we 
have found, obviously, impacts of the legality of these transactions to 
20 
an extent that there might be a need for Transnet to review these 
transactions.  The first port of call is to engage the OEM’s and see to 
what extent we can, commonly approach Court as an example with a 
view of conceding that there were irregularities that taints these 
transactions and jointly agree on a just and equitable remedy, that can 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 50 of 213 
 
be placed before the Court to see what will be the best way of dealing 
with the unlawfulness that w e have picked up.  So that process is 
underway, as I said Chair, it commenced in November/December 2018, 
so that is the power process that we are riding over and above 
continuing with the investigations that we are conducting to give effect 
to our mandate.  
CHAIRPERSON: So, 
this 
phase 
is 
aimed 
at 
giving 
effect 
or 
implementing some of the findings or the findings that you already 
made in the report? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   Correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: Okay, Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Thank you Chair and if you could just finish 
off on the OEM’s and the process that you’re currently undertaking, 
would we be understanding you correctly if we understood you to mean 
that your engagement with the OEM’s is a process parallel to this 
Commission 
which 
is 
investigating 
the conduct 
of 
the 
OEM’s 
themselves.  So, there will be no impact or there shouldn’t be any – you 
don’t expect your process to impact on this current Commission?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   Not quite but if I can answer it 
this way, if you accept, as an example that the outcomes of our volume 
20 
one, in particular puts to doubt the legality of the transactions that 
have (indistinct) with the OEM’s as an (indistinct) you can’t sit on our 
laurels and say let’s continue the (indistinct) we are duty bound to 
approach a Court of Law and say, we need to bring to the attention of 
the Court that these transactions are tainted with irregularity and what 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 51 of 213 
 
will be the just and (indistinct) remedy, under the circumstances to deal 
with the transaction. So that, in a way might, obviously impact on what 
the Commission is doing but that is only geared towards resolving the 
contractual relationship that is there between Transnet and the OEM’s.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Okay that’s clarified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe just to complete one of the points we 
discussed earlier on, so it would be fair to – would it be fair to say to 
the extent that MNS investigation didn’t involve persons who may have 
been implicated but who were not within Transnet to that extent, it 
might not – the report might not contain the complete story?  
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  If you accept that the story itself 
is not fully ventilated in the documents that way within Transnet 
because it’s why it was important for us to get access to the server.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  To get the complete picture of 
what might have happened actually but to the extent that somebody is 
outside might have documents which are not within Transnet, which he 
or she can use to rebut (indistinct) obviously that’s why we said that 
person then, there’s a forum called the Judicial State of Enquiry on the 
State Capture where a person can then come and rebut whatever that – 
20 
the documents (indistinct) are saying.  
CHAIRPERSON: Yes okay thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Then if I may just – just to make sure we are 
clear, you stand by your findings as are based on documentation you 
obtained from Transnet?  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 52 of 213 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Okay, then …(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON: So in effect somebody who may be implicated, 
obviously would have to deal with the findings you made without their 
input because of the constraints you had because you couldn’t force 
them to come and cooperate, they would have to deal with that and say, 
well this is my side of the story but you say, within those constraints 
and with the understanding that you couldn’t compel people from 
outside 
you 
are 
confident 
that 
the 
findings 
accord 
with 
the 
documentation that you got. 
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  We are Chair but to mitigate 
against a risk of those persons not being able to ventilate (indistinct) 
which is why the civil action that has been instituted at least because 
(indistinct) so at the right time and (indistinct) they will be able to 
respond to the pleadings that have been put before Court arising out of 
the very same investigations that we are speaking about.  
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Thank you Chair.  On your next slide deals 
with the results of the investigations and you simply list there th at you 
compiled certain reports on the basis of the investigations you 
20 
undertook. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair, yes all this work 
that come into the production of this six reports that we presented to 
Transnet and these are the ones that for m part of the record at the 
Commission. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 53 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
And as you indicate all these reports were 
presented to Transnet and the Board to act thereupon as it deems 
meet.  Now have any of these reports been provided to all the persons 
implicated in some or other wrongdoing in the report or in the reports?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Like I said earlier on with regards 
to the employees, indeed all employees that – whose names appear in 
the reports do have copies of the reports, all the four OEM’s to the 
extent that they were implicated in the transactions, it’s not all of them, 
we have all the volumes but as an example volume one covers all the 
OEM’s so all of them do have copies of the reports and the annexures 
10 
to the reports (indistinct) actually engagi ng with them to show them 
how we arrived at our conclusions and to demonstrate to them as well, 
look these are the data that they have submitted so that there’s any 
document that was altered by any of the investigators or Transnet so at 
least we are all operating on a common set of facts, if I can use that 
phrase. 
CHAIRPERSON: So when you said earlier on that those who were 
outside of Transnet were not interviewed that didn’t just relate to those 
who may have been inside Transnet at some stage but had left Transnet 
at the time of your investigation, it also meant anyone who were in the 
20 
OEM’s – anyone who was not an employee of Transnet you did not 
interview is that right?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: Those that were inter viewed were only those who 
were employees of Transnet. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 54 of 213 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON: And after the reports had been prepared then you are, 
since December 2018 you are approaching other people to say, this is 
the report, this is what it says about you let’s talk.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: 
Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   To see how we can, among other things, maybe 
recover money or how we can, jointly – how you can cooperate if an 
approach is made to a Court to set aside this cont ract or whatever. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
And if I may then, to just clarify on that, what 
the Chair has described, it relates to engagements with third parties 
and in this instance OEM’s that co ncluded contractual arrangements 
with Transnet. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
That statement does not concern former 
employees of Transnet who would be implicated or could be implicated 
by any of the reports. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes (indistinct) obviously that 
does speak to the former employees, quite correct Chair yes.  
 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Now then we understand the approach you 
have adopted in regard to the OEM’s what approach have you – by you, 
I mean Transnet, I should probably say that, are you aware of the 
approach that Transnet has adopted regarding each former employees 
who are implicated insofar as making the reports available to them is 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 55 of 213 
 
concerned? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  To our knowledge we are not 
quite familiar as to whether Transnet has decided to give the reports to 
former employees who’s – if I can use Mr Singh as an example, that 
part I’m not quite sure if Transnet did give that to those former 
employees but I’m quite certain that the employees were t hen given the 
reports. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Okay if I may then turn briefly to the former 
employees, as you indicate you are – you do not know whether 
Transnet has shared the reports with them, are you in engagement with 
10 
them in any manner or form?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Save for the engagement via the 
litigation process we are not in any way involved in formal discussions.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Now when I turn to OEM’s and I understand 
that you are currently in engagements to the extent that you explaine d 
to the Chair, does that engagement or do those engagements include 
the OEM’s providing their own version or are they limited purely to 
accepting a possible – possible irregularities in the transactions and 
jointly taking steps with Transnet to address th e irregularities, what 
exactly is the position of these engagements?  
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It varies Chair, lets take an 
example of Nedbank as an example, in our (indistinct) we do make 
reference to the question there, transactions are recorded by 
Regiments their involvement of Nedbank, we then ask Nedbank to give 
us documents – apparently we you met that (indistinct) documents 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 56 of 213 
 
which they think will rebut what we are saying and as well you are not 
even familiar with the documents that we had, so we had to exchange 
documents to see to what extent are we in alignment and if there are 
any points of disagreement where are we exactly. So that was – I’m 
using that as an example. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So it’s only once we have 
ringfenced the points of departures, we can then determine what course 
of action can be taken there.  We use the example of GE, GE – that’s 
General Electrics one of the OEM’s by and large in terms of the extent 
10 
of irregularities they were not that – except to say that (indistinct) like 
local content where GE complied those as well we had sessions with 
them, exchanged documents, we agreed that this is okay but if the NSA 
not out of their own doing is (indistinct) how then do we approach a 
Court.  Obvious then different tactic will be applied depending on the 
extent to which the irregularity is tainted with corruption as an 
example.  So we have a different approach that we apply to various 
OEM’s and that will then dictate the type of approach that must be 
taken going forward. 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
So then we must accept that insofar as 
20 
OEM’s are concerned and any other third parties that contracted with 
Transnet in respect of any – of these transactions it is up to the 
Commission to obtain their version as rega rds the allegations made in 
the respective reports about them and the findings.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   Correct Chair. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 57 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Thank you Chair.  Yes Chair it has been 
pointed out to me I’ve encroached onto your tea time…(intervention).  
CHAIRPERSON: Well maybe let’s go up to half past then we 
can…(intervention). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
I’m 
happy 
Chair. 
 
Then 
against 
that 
understanding and that background can you just, briefly help us 
understand the various reports that you issued and what each d eals 
with. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay, volume one which was 
produced in June 2018 deals, in the main, with the actual procurement 
10 
of the 1064 locomotives. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The RFP’s that were issued, what 
happened, what are the irregularities that arise out of the procurement 
process, that’s volume one. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Volume two (a) speaks to the 
irregularities relating to the acquisition of the transition advisors 
because for Transnet to engage in this transaction it required expertise 
of lawyers and commercial people, so again, we focus (indistinct) on 
20 
the procurement aspects of that transaction.  Two (b), now analyses the 
transactions that Transnet concluded on advice of t he (indistinct), you 
might have heard Chair in the other testimonies the swaps that the 
(indistinct) spoke about so that is what is contained in two (b).  Three 
(a) speaks to the procurement of the 95 locomotives, that (indistinct) 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 58 of 213 
 
happened prior to the 1064 acquisitions, 95 is dedicated to that as well 
it speaks to the procurement irregularities that occurred in that 
transaction followed by the procurement of the hundred locomotives 
which occurred at the same time when 1064 was acquired, you might 
have heard Mr Callard as an example and the (indistinct) speaking 
about the confinement of this hundred locomotives as well and lastly 
then the relocation of CNR and BT to Durban, so that is what is 
contained in those various reports.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Then, you have prepared, I think, a slide to 
help us understand the inter-relationship if any between the various 
10 
transactions, if you could…(intervention).  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes what I’ve said earlier on is 
schematically represented by the slides, so li ke I said it’s a 95 you’ll 
see that RFA was issued in December 2012 and it was awarded in 
September the following year and then there is a procurement of the 
hundred locomotives, for purpose of logic, specifically look at this 
slides 1064 would have happened first but we know that during the 
course of 1064 hundred cropped up but just to make things easy for the 
Commission lets focus on hundred first then we can focus on 1064.  
Now on 1064 you will note as well on the slides there that, that’s where 
20 
the issue of the transition advisors would have been involved so there’s 
a volume two (a) and (b) that focuses on the procurement of the TA’s 
that happened in June 2012 and as well the (indistinct). So all – the 
TA’s and relocation speak directly only to 1064.  Th ere were no TA’s on 
the 95 and the hundred locomotives, so that’s the purpose of this 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 59 of 213 
 
particular diagram. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
And you propose to follow the order of your 
bubbles there in helping us. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So you start with 95 followed by hundred, we 
then turn our attention to 1064 and the two side transactions that 
emanate from 1064. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair that will make it 
quite easier for one to follow the various transactions.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: 
Okay, thank you Chair, it’s drawn to my 
10 
attention it’s now half past before I run over again.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we will take the tea adjournment and we will 
resume at quarter to twelve. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you may proceed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  We are ready Chair.  You just 
presented a slide indicating the different transactions that you 
20 
investigated.  Can you briefly tell the Chair how it came ab out you 
investigated this?  Were you investigating Transnet and transactions 
within Transnet in general or were you investigating only specific 
transactions and if it is the latter on what basis you confined yourself 
to certain transactions?  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 60 of 213 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes Chair.  Like I said in my 
introductory slide the point of entry for us was 1064 because at the 
time like I said there were various media allegations about the 
irregularities arising out of 1064 in particular.  It is why when 
Werksmans as well when we appointed on that report we focus on that 
aspect.  So our point of entry was 1064 a specific transaction.  But now 
obviously as you are going through 1064 that is when our other 
transactions spill out of 1064.  100 as in example.  The TA’s a nd the 
relocation all those are related to 1064.  But now during our 
investigations then it also then came to our attention and close 
10 
attention that there was another transaction of a locomotive acquisition 
which also was problematic.  That is where 95 com es in.  So there were 
specific transactions that we were limited to investigating.  And as well 
like I said in [indistinct] because this was more of a – a due diligence 
on the legalities of the transaction.  You will see the common thread in 
our reports about irregularities. So it is more a legal analysis of what 
transpired.  What the [indistinct] saying about these issues.  So that 
also helped in terms of limiting a need to be interviewing people from 
outside of Transnet because the documents themselves as  they sit and 
confirmed as well by the internal employees as to what transpired there 
20 
it was able to give us and put us in a position to reach conclusions that 
we have – came up with in our report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would it be fair to describe your investigat ion as for 
all intents and purposes an internal Transnet investigation but 
conducted by people from outside Transnet?  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 61 of 213 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is a perfect summation of 
our 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  What we did Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ja. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They may as well have conducted it themselves 
internally but for certain reasons they preferred that it be done by 
outside people but it was otherwise an internal investigation.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And – thank you Chair.  And therefore we – 
that is why we understand that we have specific transactions you are 
limited to it is what you are requested to do  and you could not go 
beyond the scope of your mandate?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You then get to the next slide where you give 
us a background to the acquisition of locomotives and the Chair will 
have – will be familiar with some of the issues there because certain 
witnesses have testified thereto.   
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. You [indistinct]. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes.  The purpose of the slide in 
the main Chair is just to give context to why the number 1064 is that 
this number comes from a fleet plan that Transnet produced in 2011.  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 62 of 213 
 
And you will note at that – in that fleet plan it plans to acquire 1202 
locomotives within the general freight business.  Now the pro curement 
of that was then staggered.  In 2011 a business case was approved to 
first acquire the 138 being the 43 electric – diesel and the 95 that I 
spoke about earlier.  So there are two transactions that preceded the 
1064 which is why now if you look at you minus the 43 and then it in 
fact that is why you are then left with 1064.  So [indistinct] was the only 
transaction that was not acquired during 2011.  So that is the purpose 
of this particular slide just to give context to how we arrive at the figure 
of 1064. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now you indicate that of that 1202 approved 
locomotives 95 electric locomotives and 43 diesel locomotives business 
case was developed to acquire them separately that is leaving a 
balance of 1064? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now the 95 electric locomotives you refer to 
are those the same locomotives on which you intend to comment 
shortly? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now can you tell the Chair about the 43 d iesel 
20 
locomotives that process and any transactions undertaken in the course 
of that?  Have you investigated that if not why not?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  We did not investigate the 43 
because it was not part of our mandate.  Like I said earlier on wh ich 
confirms the whole issue of seeing it was only specific transactions that 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 63 of 213 
 
we were mandated to investigate.  43 was not part of our mandate and 
from – even from our own preliminary assessment in Transnet there 
seems to have been no issue with the acquis ition of the 43 but 
[indistinct] than that I cannot say because we have not actually done a 
thorough investigation of the 43 it was not part of our scope.  But 95 
and the rest yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  And then against that background you 
then deal with procurement of the 95 specifically?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair.  Now in dealing 
with 95 Chair we will just again at a high level speak about the 
10 
background to the acquisition of the 95.  What are our key findings 
where in that investigation?  We speak mainly and there are various 
issues that are – we touch upon and as we will disclose that Fundudzi 
as well did conduct an investigation on 95.  By and large we are in 
agreement but we thought it appropriate as well to highlight the two 
areas where we differed with Fundudzi on the findings that they have 
made.  But in the main we are in all force in terms of the findings that 
they have made but – ja – but that will be our last slide when we deal 
with that aspect. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.   
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You may continue. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Like I said earlier on the board of 
the – after the approval of the 1202 fleet plan a business case was 
developed to acquire 93 and 43  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 64 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  95. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [indistinct] it has got 95 electric and 43 diesel.  The 
estimated total cost on the 94 was R2.6 billion and the board as 
required by Section 64(2) of The PFMA which requires that if an 
[indistinct] Transnet wishes to procure or to disp ose or acquire a 
significant transaction – asset it needs to get the permission of the 
executive authority and as well notify treasury.  So that we know was 
done on the acquisition of 95 and that appears in volume 11 on page 
3864 of the bundle. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  May I correct you there.  I think it is page 
10 
8364 not 3864. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Transposition error. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  8364 yes.  And at 8364 is there approval by 
the Minister for Transnet to acquire the 95 electrical – electric 
locomotives for an estimated cost at – of R2.6 billion? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you express the view that that approval is 
appropriate and consistent with the provisions of the PFMA?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.   
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And as you can see the approval 
was obtained on the 21 December 20111.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And then that led to – because a 
week – weeks earlier the tender was then issued – advertised and we 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 65 of 213 
 
know now but we will talk about how CSR got in but it is common cause 
that CSR was the successful bidder in this 95 transaction.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And just to remind ourselves this – this was 
on an open tender basis not on a confinement? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  This was an open tender process.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: Okay.  You then proceed in your slides to 
highlight the key findings you make in your report regarding this 
transaction. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct.  When we reviewed 
various documents in [indistinct] transaction I think it was quite 
10 
apparent that from a very, very early stage CSR seems to have enjoyed 
some special relationship with Transnet and that happened both prior to 
the issuance of the RFP self and during the procurement process.  And 
we will take the Chair through various correspondence that we picked 
up that seems to demonstrate that at the very least there was an 
improper engagement and communication between the executives – 
some executives and CSR during the procurement process of this 95 
locomotives. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  If you can start on Volume 11 
20 
page 8527 we find an email from Mr Garry Pita.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Just if you – excuse me Mr Sedumedi. Chair 
at this juncture we will need you perhaps to get Volume 11 because we 
will not be projecting that particular document on the screen.  
CHAIRPERSON: Okay.  Well – it looks like the volumes are not put in 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 66 of 213 
 
accordance with their correct sequence.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It should never happen Chair I do not know 
how.  May we attend to that at lunch?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Well I may be wrong.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Much relieved to hear it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright what page?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  He had referred us to 8527 Mr Sedumedi?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes we are at 8527.   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  At the bottom of 8527 you will 
see on that page Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  One second let me get there?  Yes I have got it.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  At the bottom of that page 
because there are two emails in that page Chair.  Right at the bottom 
because the top one is a response to the one at the bottom.    
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  In that email from Mr Pita on the 
16 December 2011 it is addressed to Mr Wang Ping – Mr Wang Ping is 
20 
from CSR.  I am not quite sure…  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I am trying to get where – where you get 
oh yes  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  About two thirds away of the page Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes Mr Wang Ping okay no I was looking at the – I 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 67 of 213 
 
was looking at the email address and I was looking for the surname but 
I think the – his email address does not reflect his name . 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Chair you want me to go to read 
or to summarise as per the slides?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You may summarise and to the extent – only 
to the extent necessary may you read.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But you brought us to this document to make 
the – when you make the point that CSR seems to have enjoyed a 
special relationship with Transnet and pointed to som e irregular 
communication between CSR as a bidder and Transnet?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:    Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he – because it is a very short one he may as 
well just read. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Read? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if it is a long one he could summarise.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
“Dear Mr Wang Pan my CEO Mr Brian Molefe advised 
me that you met in early December.  He also stated 
that CSR Zhuzhou Electric locomotive that is CSR 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 68 of 213 
 
showed interest in participating in our next tender for 
95 electric locomotives.  I wish to advise you that 
this tender has been released and is available from 
Transnet Freight Rail.  I am sure whether CSR is 
aware of this and it has already bought the tender 
documents.  You will see overleaf the email regards 
Garry Pita being the Group Supply Chain Officer.”  
Right it is from this email we could pick up that Mr Pita was [indistinct] 
meeting that actually happened early in December where CSR 
expressed an interest in  an upcoming tender.  That is what now if you 
10 
are referring to an upcoming tender it means at that time surely the 
tender would not have been issued at that stage.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And if you look at the top of that 
page now it is a response from Mr Wang Pan.  
“Dear Mr Pita thank you for your email.  We were 
very pleased to have the chance to meet with your 
Group CEO Mr Brain Molefe at the beginning of 
December.  We expressed our interest in your tender 
for 95 electric locomotives and the South African 
20 
market as well.  Regarding the tender document we 
are conducting with Mr – that is supposed to Ms 
Khoza we know that Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe is a Ms – 
Ms Mdletshe and transferring money to your account 
for getting the documen t.  You to only the SA rand is 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 69 of 213 
 
acceptable.  The money transferring process is a 
little bit complicated but we believe that we could get 
a tender document within – in this week.  You are 
very kind to facilitate us your support on the tender 
document if we need and inform you.” 
So now two things come out of this letter.  One at least Mr Wang Pan 
confirms that indeed a meeting happened with Mr Molefe in early 
December.  And now there are also now a [indistinct] call as well by 
this time on the 19 December the tender was already issued now in 6 
December.  So that is what we pick up from this email.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now on the 19 t h of – we go to 
page 8530 of the same volume.  It is now an email from Mr Wang Pan in 
essence attaching well go to the letter as it appears on 8531 but for 
now this an attachment. 
“Dear Mr Molefe please be so kind to check the 
attached letter.” 
So it is just an attachment of a letter that already been faxed to you.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And this is 19 January? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  This is 19 January 2012.  You 
20 
note Chair if you look at attachment it says 2011.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  This seems to have been a typo 
on your side because I mean if the email was send  in 2012 we cannot 
attach – so we assumed that is a – because in 2011 there was no 95 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 70 of 213 
 
locomotive acquisition in any event so the letter is being attached is 
dated 19 January 2011 but the assumption, reasonable assumption to 
be reached was that this 2011 is  supposed to refer to 2012.  Especially 
as well if you look at the contents of the letter.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Now well early in January people when they put the 
date in correspondence they still use sometimes they still.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Use the old – the previous year so maybe that is what 
it was. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes.  So it is quite an excusable 
10 
error on their part. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But the email date as well appears to be 
incorrect because you indicated tha t the public tender notice was 
issued on the 6 December 2012 regarding 95.  And I see the email says 
it is dated Thursday 19 January 2012 which will like precede the tender 
by 12 months.  And yet when one has regard to the letter attached 
overleaf which is  the letter itself is dated 2011 to compound things 
even further there is reference to the 95 and the 34 locomotives and we 
know that decision was only taken in 2012.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Not – the tender was issued in 
20 
2011. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  2011? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  2011.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then please…  
CHAIRPERSON:  December or what was the month?  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 71 of 213 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Let me just check.  Correct.  
Maybe let us go to the actual tender advert.  It appears on Volume 8370 
let us just confirm? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  On this volume 8370? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  8370.  Correct, yes.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So it is 2011, December?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The tender was advertised on 6 
December 2011. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Which is why the email is dated 
19 – we are on… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are at 8531 now yes.  8530  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  85 – 85.  Now the essence of this 
letter. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry before we get into that then.  This is for 
record purposes you might want to consider your annex – your slide 12.  
The date you give there I think is erroneous because you call it the 6 
December 2012. 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The 6 December 2011 my 
apologies Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So it is 2011 it must read yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Right please proceed. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 72 of 213 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now in this letter CSR Mr Wang 
Pan addresses to Mr Brian Molefe.  You must recall at a stage Chair the 
tender advert itself it indicates who is the person that you need to 
contact in the event that you have got a query on this tender.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  If you go to the advert itself it 
indicates Ms Lindiwe Mdletshe is a person that you must liaise with in 
the event you have got queries.  You will also recall in the email that he 
sent to Mr Pita he did indicate that we are liaising with Ms Lindiwe 
Mdletshe to obtain the tender documents and all related issues.  Now in 
10 
this letter addressed to Mr Molefe three issues come out of that letter.  
He thanks Mr Molefe for giving CSR an opportunity to tender for the 95 
locomotives.  That appears on the first paragraph o f that letter.  That is 
the first paragraph.  In the second paragraph he then advises Mr 
Molefe that the CSR delegation that will attend the tender briefing 
session because it was in terms of the tender there was going to be a 
briefing session on the 31 Ja nuary 2012 so he advised him indeed CSR 
will be attending and takes the liberty of even outlining the nature of 
the delegation that will be attending that briefing session.  That is 
contained Chair in the third paragraph where he says:  
20 
“For ease of reference we would like to participate in the briefing 
session held on this date and this [indistinct] General Manager Mr Fu 
Chen Jung who led a delegation that consisted of those three persons.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  But he does indicate that they 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 73 of 213 
 
will be in South Africa from the period 30 January to 2 February.  Now 
the next paragraph that follows Mr Wang Pan seeks the support of Mr 
Molefe in four issues.  First.  He wants to have a meeting with Mr 
Molefe for a discussion of coope ration as they phrased it in their 
document.  Secondly CSR – Mr Molefe must assist in arranging a 
meeting with only says you I must – something that can only be 
Transnet’s technical group to discuss and optimise the technical 
specifications of this tender.  Fourth he also wants him to arrange a 
site visit that CSR may conduct at some of the locomotive depots or the 
engineering factories to study the existing electric locomotives.  And as 
10 
well for him to assist in discussions with potential preferred compani es 
that they can work with for localisation  he calls it localisation work so 
the assumption there that maybe to get the local partners [indistinct] so 
that is what Mr Molefe must assist in arranging.  Now we then find a 
response from Mr Molefe overleaf on  page 8533 the same volume. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  He responds first obviously 
thanking Mr Wang Pan for the letter and indicating to him that he has 
forwarded the letter from his request to Mr Siyabonga Gama who will 
then respond and process the request by CSR.  And indeed if you look 
20 
at that email Mr Gama is copied on that correspondence.  Now 
obviously we do not have any record of whether any of these meetings 
happened after this issue. But two issues come out of that issue.   Like I 
said earlier on Ms Mdletshe and I think Ms Assegai were the two 
persons that were supposed to be contacted in the event that you got 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 74 of 213 
 
any query about this tender.  Those are the two persons that you must 
liaise with.  CSR is able to do at that lett er to the GCE.  The GCE initial 
response he does not say sorry Mr Wang Pan we are now in a 
procurement space please refer all your queries to Ms Mdletshe as 
indicated in the RFP advert.  It simply says in actual fact I will send his 
request to Mr Gama who was at that stage the acting – he was the GE 
Group no, no the CE my apologies Chief Executive at TFR where these 
locomotives were going to be procured.  Now the conclusion that we 
reached on this [indistinct] in view of all these issues it confirms the 
view that CSR seemed to have enjoyed the special relationship and it 
10 
creates a reasonable apprehension that CSR might have been favoured 
over other bidders because within the procurement space fairness and 
transparency is key. You cannot as an organ of state be seeing to be 
favouring a particular entity especially during the procurement space.  
In a [indistinct] you might not necessarily have a direct evidence that 
confirms subsequent meetings but that is sufficient to create a 
reasonable apprehension and perception that indeed the relationship 
between Transnet at least some of its executives and CSR is not in line 
with the spirit and purpose of a fair and competitive tender process.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now on – we know this is around 19 January 
20 
2012 do you know where the evaluation process or the tendering 
process was at as of January 2012?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  In – because… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But maybe before – before that question the 
conclusion you had that you were talking about – about a possible 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 75 of 213 
 
relationship between CSR and either Mr Brian Molefe or Mr Gama you 
are not at this stage because of just this one letter or email saying that 
there was an improper relationship.  I take it that what you are saying 
is 
there 
may 
be 
something 
inappropriate 
about 
this 
direct 
communication to people other than the one who was being given in the 
document – tender documents as the person to be contacted about this 
tender.  So in other words if you are interested in the tender and you 
have been told that the person to be contacted about this tender at 
Transnet is Mr Mdletshe that is the person you write to not to other 
people.  But there may well be other things that you came across in 
10 
your investigation that on which you might base your – your conclusion. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Indistinct]. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair which is why even 
now we get what follows thereafter.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That seems to fortify  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   This view that this is not an 
innocent communication that can be said to be a once off.  So that must 
20 
be viewed in the context of subsequent events that occur in this 
particular transaction. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I interrupted while …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 76 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No I wanted to understand if – if – to find out 
from Mr Sedumedi whether he can recall off the top of his head where 
the evaluation or tender process was at as at January 2019 – was the 
evaluation completed? 
CHAIRPERSON:  2012? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:    2012 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  2012 – 19 January 2012 which is the date of 
the communication.  To your recollection was the evaluation underway, 
had it been completed, had a decision been taken on the tenders?  
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  No Chair you recall that on the 
same email it confirms that the briefing session will only take place on 
the end of January.  So at this stage there is no evaluation of the 
bidder as yet. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Because in actual fact even the 
briefing session has not occurred so that even tells us that even a 
tender date was not yet there.  So not was not there but the tender had 
not closed by this particular perio d. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  They are not closed.  Okay.  Alright thank you.  
20 
We have dealt with the communication that you call inappropriate of 
January 2012. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  What is next you would like to draw the 
Chair’s attention to? 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 77 of 213 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Right.  It is now the evaluation of this 
bit.  If you go to – that slide is a summary of the evaluation criteria that 
was prescribed in the RFP – if you go to page 8399 the same volume 
8399. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  In terms of the evaluation criteria 
contained in that Chair will be paragraph 29.  This document that 
appears on page 8399 is the actual copy of the RFP document starting 
on page … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  8371 perhaps? 
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It starts on page 8372.  That is the 
RFP document for the supply of 95 electric locomotives.  Just to close 
up that (indistinct) you made earlier on you will see that the closing 
date was 28 February 2012 as it appears on page 8372.  So the  
paragraphs that I have referred the Chair to on page 8399 speaks to 
the evaluation criteria that was stipulated in this particular date.  There 
were three stages that the RFP envisaged.  Stage 1 and it says here:  
“Transnet will utilise …”  
I am reading Chair under paragraph 29. 
“Transnet SOC …” 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Thank you, yes I am there.  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  “Transnet SOC will utilise 
the following criteria in selecting a preferred a 
supplier if so required.”  
We focus on stage 1.  So stage 1 just to summarise it Chair it required 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 78 of 213 
 
the bidders to have a B-BBEE Certificate.  They must complete forms 
that will indicate their commitment to Supply Development which are 
listed there under.  They go over to page 8400 but what is important 
Chair is the block that appears at the bottom of that stage 1.  So this is 
stage 1 requirements.  It says: 
“An overall minimum threshold of 60 percent for 
stage 1 evaluation must be met or exceeded for 
respondent’s proposal to progress to stage 2.”  
Stage 1 is your gatekeeper.  You cannot proceed to further stages until 
you at least acquire 60 percent for this stage 1 or exceed that.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  So – so what it means is that points would be 
added up that you get under the different criteria under stage 1?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if you fall under 60 percent in terms of your total 
then you do not proceed to – to stage 2 but if you achieve 60 percent 
and more then you go to  stage 2? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Then you can then – you go to stage 
2. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So that is what was put in the RFP 
that was advertised.  So all the bidders when they received the bids - 
when they respond – they know they must comply with this requirement.  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 79 of 213 
 
If things (indistinct) then it will not even bother to participate in this 
bid. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now what happens is that obviously 
now when the bids are received there is what we call a Cross Function 
Evaluation Team.  Usually it is a – a team that evaluates the bids in 
accordance with the requirements in the RFP.  The next slide Chair 
there is a document - I am not sure if I must be able to - this TS1? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No.  No I have not.  You refer at page - slide 
18 to TS1? 
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And I require you to introduce it to the Chair 
for me to …  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hand it in. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay.  Chair in our report when it 
was submitted to the Commission the CF – this document was going to 
be an annexure to a memorandum that appears on – I will be with you 
now.  If you can just bear with me for a second.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
20 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On page 8535 we will touch on – so 
what I am just – to put context into this document.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The memorandum on 8535 they 
attached a CFET Report. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 80 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  8535? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  8535. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Which appears on 8539. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  But when this was copied to the 
Commission we attached an incorrect CF - because there were different 
CFET Reports. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The one for technical and the one for 
10 
finance.  So we erroneously inserted a finance one.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So 8539 does not at all speak to 
8535.  So this document that we are introducing is a correct version of 
what was supposed to appear on 8539.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it – this one that I presently have will be replaced 
by another one? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It has to be replaced Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The issue is we are not – no that 8359 
currently forms part of the formal report by GNS.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  By MNS. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 81 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Which would mean if an error has crept into 
the compilation of the exhibits …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It might be appropriate for MNS to issue an 
(indistinct) …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To do a proper replacement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So that is why we did not take the liberty of 
just exchanging. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We shall await their formal (indistinct) …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And make the changes then but in the 
meantime …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Sedumedi has given us the correct one 
and as  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Page – slide 18 indicates we have marked it 
20 
TS1 for reference …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  It is okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And we shall be dealing with it shortly.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Yes Mr  Sedumedi we have 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 82 of 213 
 
handed in TS1 …  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As per your slide 18 to the Chair.  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct.  Now in applying this criteria 
… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The criteria we have just dealt with …  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Stage 1 yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Stage 1 you must acquire at least 60 percent, 
yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct.  The coming slide – if you go 
10 
to page – on that document it is marked page 5. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes, go ahead. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is page 5 of TS1? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct.  What you see on the slide – 
on the slide there is an exact replica of the table that appears  on page 
5. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: 
 
Which 
indicates 
that 
on 
an 
application of a stage 1 criteria three bidders qualified to proceed.  
That is Siemens – you will see at the bottom of the document Chair it 
20 
shows the scores.  Siemens – on the top is - are the names of the 
bidders.  That is Siemens the first one.  It got 63 percent.  Bombadier - 
70 percent and you go to the far right it is SSMM Consortium they also 
met and exceeded the 60 percent threshold.  So all three bidders …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 83 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Qualified to proceed – to progress to 
stage 2. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And then on the same table we see after 
Bombadier there are certain railways but  CRRC CNR Global is that 
China North Rail? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is China North Rail. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it scored 40 percent?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And CSR Zhuzhou scored 56 percent? 
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So this is after applying the criteria as 
stipulated in the RFP? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And as you can note you – you will 
see on the item one there it says B -BBEE score card.  The reason that 
they – they fell short amongst other is that they scored zero because 
that is what the RFP required.  That if you do not have the B -BBEE 
Certificate then you will be scored zero.  So they then fell below the 
20 
required 60 percent threshold. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  However what happens is that every 
CFET now which is this report …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  TS1? 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 84 of 213 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  TS1. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  They decided to create an alternative 
evaluation criteria. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, who is they now? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The CFET Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Cross Functional …  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The Cross Functional Evaluation 
Team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  We will in detail analyse their 
reasons for (indistinct) but I think draw the Chair’s attention to 
paragraph …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At page 2 of that …  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Page 2. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Paragraph 4 it starts with evaluation 
methodology … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And overleaf it introduces concepts of option 
1 and option 2? 
20 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is that what you …? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is what I …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Referred to.  So we in (indistinct) 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 85 of 213 
 
Chair analyse these reasons but what they do they create an 
alternative evaluation criteria where now they remove B -BBEE because 
they indicate in their report that the RFP required a B -BBEE Certificate 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, I think both of you have or I have lost both of you.  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We were dealing with stage 1 …  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we are looking at the criteria and we are looking 
at the points which various bid ders got and you said only three were 
10 
able to satisfy the requirement that you must at least get 60 percent in 
order to proceed to stage 2?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where are you now? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Alright.  Let me start.  During that 
evaluation this same team …  
CHAIRPERSON:  During the stage 1 evaluation?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  During stage 1 evaluation the 
20 
officials who are tasked to implement the provisions of the RFP …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On their own accord decides to 
amend the evaluation criteria …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 86 of 213 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  By removing the requirement of a B -
BBEE … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Scoring … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And create what they call option 2 
evaluation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now is that a body with a particular name that is 
doing that now? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is called the Cross Functi onal 
10 
Evaluation Team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Cross Functional Evaluation Team, ja okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is a team that has been set up 
internally to evaluate … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The technical aspects of …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and award points? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Alright. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they – they change or amend the – the criteria 
applicable to stage 1? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Alright.  Now (indistinct) we get the 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 87 of 213 
 
results of their – because all that they do they remove the requirement 
for B-BBEE.  They only evaluate supplier development.  If you go to the 
next slide … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  These are now the results of them 
having removed …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Now I think one of the reasons why you seem to – I 
seem to lose you is I think you may be jumping from …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Oh slide to document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The exhibit to another document …  
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Without telling me. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is noted Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So which document are you now looking at?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are now back in the slides Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are looking at page 20.  In fact it starts at 
page – slide 19 tells us that the CFET amended their evaluation 
criteria. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright.  As you …  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now he is …  
CHAIRPERSON:  As you change …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I will call that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let me know then …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Absolutely. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 88 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then I can follow, okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And please try and remember Mr  Sedumedi 
when you refer us at change over. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I will work with the Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct.  So slide 20 is a replica of 
an option 2 or alternative option that was created by the CFET …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And just to confirm the contents of 
this slide is derived – now Chair we go back to that CFET Report.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just one second.  I am trying to catch up with what 
you were dealing with before.  So where the Cross – do you say Cross 
Functional …?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Cross Functional Evaluation Team.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Where – the page where – which reflects the 
amendment where they were amending which page is that?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is the one Chair which is why I 
was taking Chair to – we now go – as I was saying slide 20 …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Is a replica of – now Chair you must 
20 
now go to the actual CFET Report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Page 6 of the CFET Report. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  For the record it is a document submitted in 
currently marked TS1. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 89 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now if – if I may assist.  If Chair we go a few 
slides back … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If I understand Mr Sedumedi – Mr Sedumedi 
please listen to me and if I am correct – I am wrong please correct me. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Alright. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At 18 – slide 18 Mr Sedumedi says in terms of 
TS1 which is the correct Cross Functional Evaluation Te am Report we 
10 
have a table indicating what the results are when you apply the 
evaluation criteria prescribed by …  
CHAIRPERSON:  As is. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or as they are. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja as they are. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Criteria ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So insofar as stage 1 is concerned …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  When CFET applies the – the criteria the 
20 
results are that there are only three companies reach or exceed the 
minimum threshold of 60 percent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they in that report (intervenes). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And that is at slide 18 - the blocks in green …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 90 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At the bottom. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is – it is SSMM Consortium and then Siemens  and 
Bombadier? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Now that is … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then that is …  
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the result of an application of the …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Proper application of the …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Authorised criteria … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Absolutely Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or advertised criteria? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As advertised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr – Mr Sedumedi then indicates that in the 
same Annexure TS1 …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The Cross Functional Evaluation Team notes 
that when applied strictly you get that result.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It then on its own accord …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Suggests what it calls option 2 …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it deals that in the report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh and – yes. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 91 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The next table … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Again extracted from TS1 …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Shows the results of evaluation on the basis 
of option 2. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the amended criteria?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of the amended which is …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Option 2 … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is the amended …  
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Is the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is the amended criteria?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed Chair. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but where it makes the decision is that reflect – 
is that on a particular page that is what I am looking for.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At TS1. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If you could take us to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  If you go Chair paragraph 4 of the 
actual Report TS1 …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Headed “Evaluation Methodology”. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 92 of 213 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It outlines the methodology that it 
used.  Maybe it is best to read it out.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: 
 
“As 
information 
was 
extracted from the RFP document as well as 
relevant annexures the tenderers were invalid on 
the 
above 
mentioned 
as 
the 
criteria 
w hich 
accounted for 80 percent.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  “B-BBEE and FRC …” 
10 
FRC is Further Recognition Criteria. 
“…accounting each 10 percent.”  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  “Hence the effective weight 
for SD is 48 percent.” 
Right.  Overleaf: 
“The intention of SD is to address the NGP.”  
The New Group of Objectives.  That is a policy by the DTI.  
“The RFP in stage 1 …”  
This what we are saying now. 
20 
“...RFP in stage 1 refers to B-BBEE and FRC which 
in some instance is in conflict with the initial SD 
spirit.  Therefore the team had two options.  Namely 
option 1 include B-BBEE and FRC in SD evaluation 
stage 1 which might mean that foreign tenderers 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 93 of 213 
 
who do not have local offices will be prejudiced.  
Such companies if is locally - a start-up enterprise 
will be able …” 
There is a typograph on their side but as it is.  
“…will be able deemed to have a B -BBEE status of 
level 4 contributed (intervenes).”  
CHAIRPERSON:  So that must be intended to – to (intervenes). 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Will be deemed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will be able to be deemed?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed. 
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  They wanted to enable them to be …  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To be deemed ja. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct.  So they make reference to 
the Codes of Good Practice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So it says: 
“If you are an enterprise you will deemed to a B -
BBEE level 4 in the first year of operation as per 
20 
the Codes of Good Practice.” 
Then they – option 2 which we were talking about earlier on Chair.  
“Option 2 is to evaluate the SD specifics only and 
evaluate B-BBEE and FRC in stage 3.  Transnet’s 
expression was that a minimum SD target of 60 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 94 of 213 
 
percent of the respondent’s bid value be offered as 
part of the SD bid document to be submitted 
excluding B-BBEE.  Indeed given the nature of the 
bid involving foreign companies.  This could not be 
fairly evaluated on the B-BBEE status and FRC.  In 
any case B-BBEE and FRC will be eva luated at 
stage 3.” 
Which is why then in the next paragraph they then outline the results of 
using different options which we were talking about earlier on.   Option 
1 it is those three entities and option 2 you will note now that we now 
10 
have five entities and if the Chair can have regard to page 6 of the 
same document.  For now let us part with the slides because as I was 
saying the slide appearing on page 20 is a replica of what is contained 
on page 6.  You will note that now on – on this option 2 Chair you will 
see that B-BBEE is not taken into account at all now.  It is only Supply 
Development (indistinct) items which are being evaluated.  Now 
Siemens is still in – 70 percent.  Bombadier – 75 – 77.  CSR which in 
option 1 their B-BBEE was not qualifying.  They now meet and exceed 
the 60 percent threshold and another company called Nelesco and as 
we know SSMM Consortium which in any event on option 1 they are 
20 
qualifying.  They were still in.  So where for option 1 which is an RFP 
criteria you had three bidders that made the threshold.  We now have 
five which five includes CSR after applying the amended evaluation 
criteria. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is it – it is CSR and which one which have …  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 95 of 213 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Nelesco. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Come through now? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Nelesco – 85.  There is a company 
that appears on the right – to the right of the – of CSR.  Nelesco – 85. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  They are now on 70 percent because 
you recall in their explanation …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That appears on …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Page – page 3 of the document first. 
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Let us go to page 2 …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Of that document Chair.  There is a 
paragraph 2 B-BBEE evaluations.  It says …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: 
 
“The 
Transnet 
Cross 
Functional Evaluation Team commenced with B -
BBEE evaluation of stage 1.”  
B-BBEE points were allocated based on 10 points B-BBEE stage level 
20 
because that base if you are level 1 you obviously get more points 
compared to those who are further down in the levels.  
“As part of the evaluation CFET further confirmed 
whether B-BBEE Certificates are submitted by the 
tenders where SANAS are created or (indistinct) are 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 96 of 213 
 
created.  Two entrants were scored based on the 
following:  Nelesco submitted a B -BBEE Certificate 
that was not SANAS accredited …”  
Because in the RFP it required people to submit a SANAS accredited 
certificate. 
“…which could get a – sorry – which could get a 
SANAS accredited certificate if it becomes a 
preferred bidder.” 
That is what it supplied.  Nelesco did not submit a valid certificate.  
Two – B – sorry. 
10 
“CSR is a foreign company that is committed to a 
JB with a local company if it becomes a preferred 
bidder.” 
So we now know at this stage CSR does not have a – the certificate.  It 
simply indicates that if you are successful we will then have a JB with a 
local company which is why it explains the two entrants when you apply 
the amended evaluation criteria.  That is why Nelesco and CSR now get 
into or qualify on (indistinct) evaluated to progress to stage 3.  Now in 
slide 21 it simply summarises what I have just read to say these are the 
justifications that were used by CFET in amend ing the evaluation 
20 
criteria.  What then happens is that on 6  June 2012 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well before that this amendment of the criteria at 
stage 1 it looks like the changing of the rules of the game when the 
game is on.  The game …  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The Chair is …  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 97 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  The game starts – everybody knows what the rules 
are if you are talking about soccer.  You know what – when do you have 
an offside.  You know when you get a penalty.  Everybody knows the 
rules.  Somewhere when the game is on the rules are changed and on 
this they are changed without the knowledge of – at least at this stage I 
do not know later – the knowledge of the participants.  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Participants being the bidders?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  At that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  At that stage. 
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  At the stage correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is why this recommendation has 
been made by CFET. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Which is why now CFET does not 
have powers to (indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Which is why now on 6 June … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Mr Jiyane - and let us continue Chair 
but just to close that point – indeed what appears here is the Chair has 
pre-empted our conclusion in our report that tenderers submit bids 
based on the rules of the game.  You make a choice before you bid 
whether to participate or not by looking at the criteria.  If you know that 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 98 of 213 
 
you will not met the said criteria always make sure that you are not 
going to participate.  Now it becomes unfair if during the game – if I 
use the Chair’s analogy – we are now told as soccer players that no 
there is no more offside.  So even those of us who are good soccer 
players and having known that offside is not a requirement then we are 
going to participate or take interest in a soccer – this sport of soccer.  
So what happens here - Mr … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry - before you move onto Mr  Jiyane. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Just so we understand we have our set of 
10 
criteria.  There is an evaluation.  At least CSR – let us concentrate on 
that for now. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Scores 56 percent.  It is below.  As the Chair 
says you change the rules mid – midstream.  You re-evaluate. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And when you re-evaluate now on your own 
new set of evaluation criteria as the CFET CSR now has scored 69 
percent. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And now it has met and exceeded the 
minimum threshold? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Which makes them to progress 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 99 of 213 
 
(indistinct) on that assumption – sorry – at that stage then CSR 
qualifies to progress to the next stage.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So what then happens is that on as 
per slide 22 it is Mr  Jiyane who at that stage was the Chief 
Procurement Officer at TFR and Mr  Siyabonga Gama who at that stage 
was the Chief Executive at Transnet prepared a memorandum that 
appears on …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I think you have an error there with your 
volume 11. 
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is volume 11. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Page 8535 of the Chair ’s volume 11.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I am sorry.  I am looking at your slide 22 at the 
top 6 June 2012.  You were saying what happened and then I hear there 
is an error. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay.  It is volume 1.  That – where it 
says volume 1 supposed to be volume 11.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You want me to have …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No, no Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not need to … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The error is in the slide.  That is correct.  
CHAIRPERSON:  So it should be volume 1? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Volume 11 not volume 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 100 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the same volume we have before us, yes 
Mr Sedumedi? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes in that memorandum 
...(intervention)  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At 8535? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  At 8535. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Would you like us to go there?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   Yes if we go to 8535. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  But before we go there are these the two p eople to 
which that team was making recommendations, you said earlier on they 
didn’t 
have 
the 
power 
to 
change, 
but 
they 
were 
making 
recommendations. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The team that was – so maybe I guess we shouldn’t 
say they were amending, but they were proposing, the were 
recommending an amendment of the criteria.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair and in actual fact 
that appears on page 3 of TS1, it fully sets out there under 
20 
recommendation that our recommendat ion ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  ...is based on option two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So let’s proceed on the basis of 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 101 of 213 
 
option two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  So they haven’t changed t he rules of the 
game but they are proposing that they be changed.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, so their recommendation goes to the 
two officials you have mentioned, is that right?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  As recorded on page 8535, this is 
a memorandum which ... 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  You will see it’s from Mr 
Siyabonga Gama on the top there, if you want to see  the name of Mr 
Giyani that appears on page 8537 under signature.  It is Mr Giyani and 
Mr Gama.  Making a further, they are requesting on page 8535 Chair 
they are requesting Mr Brian Molefe who was the GC at that stage, for 
him to approve the shortlisted bidders, based on scenario two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  As proposed by the CFET.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  In the body of this document they 
summarised what transpired at the CFET and what CFET is saying.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And then sort of assuming or 
adopting the recommendation of CFET and are proposing Mr Molefe to 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 102 of 213 
 
approve that recommendation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now in ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
I’m 
sorry, 
the 
recommendation 
of 
the 
CF 
...(intervention)  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  ET. 
CHAIRPERSON:  CFET did not contemplate re-advertising and starting 
the process afresh. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Not at all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It simply contemplated that if those above them 
10 
approved their views, their recommendation the short listing, if one can 
call it that at stage one be dealt with as if the rules had already been 
changed when the people put in their bids, so are they saying apply a 
rule that wasn’t there before. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In order for people to get to stage two.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So indeed as it appears on pag e 
8537 ...(intervention)  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so you say Mr Siyabonga Gama in this 
...(intervention)  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes, Mr Gama and Mr Giyani. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 103 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  In this memo starting at page 8535. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which they address to Mr Brian Molefe they show that 
they go along with the recommendation made by the ...(intervention)  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The CFET. 
CHAIRPERSON:  ... CFE team and they ask him to approve this 
recommendation that the short listing or the decision as to who goes to 
stage two be on the basis of the amended rules or rules that didn’t 
exist before. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct and that Chair is 
10 
confirmed in paragraph nine, if you go to paragraph nine of (indistinct) 
it is recommended that the GCE approves the short listing of the five 
tenderers that have met the minimum (indistinct) of 60%  as evaluating 
option two. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Approves the issue of letters to 
unsuccessful tenderers, due to their not meeting the minimum 
standards.   
CHAIRPERSON:  So if Mr Brian Molefe goes along with this 
recommendation from Mr Gama and Giyani he would in effect be saying 
20 
here are tenderers that will go to stage two, they have been selected 
on the basis of among others a rule that wasn’t there when they – you 
all put your bids, basically that’s what ja.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That’s the sum total of what 
happened Chair and that – his approval is evidenced by signature at 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 104 of 213 
 
the bottom on the 8 t h of June 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So he approves by signing that memorandum?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct it is approved by 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, on the 8 t h of June 2012. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay then what happens after their approval 
is granted ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before we deal with that, maybe we should 
10 
deal with the reasons on whic h this is – this changing the rules is 
justified. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   I believe so, for that you – perhaps its best 
we deal with it from Annexure TS1 itself because the reasons are 
advanced in that document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s fine, whatever, because we now have a 
situation where the rules have been changed, the change has been 
approved, let’s hear what the justification is.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Like I said earlier on Chair so 
two reasons are advanced, one is that the (indistinct) extents is unfair 
to foreign bidders and those that do not have the BBB certificate 
because they cannot then (indistinct).  Two, an impression has been 
created in the memorandum, but in any event if you ar e a start-up 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 105 of 213 
 
entity you will be deemed to as per code of practice to be legible at 
least for a Level 4 (indistinct) that is the reasons that we are advancing 
that memorandum and furthermore in any event in Stage three BBBEE 
will be assessed, but they forge t one point that this was, (indistinct) to 
use BEE as a gatekeeper in Stage one.   
 
Now like the Chair has already said earlier on it is unfair 
(indistinct) our analysis in terms of – on slide 23, to say it’s a matter of 
law, it is unfair to change the rules of procurement during the 
procurement process.  The spirit and purport of Section 217 that we 
must all be exposed to a competitive, fair and transparent tender 
10 
process.  The PPM itself ...(intervention)  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry, where the PPM is?  
MR 
TSHIAMO 
MICHAEL 
SEDUMEDI: 
 
The 
PPM 
is 
Transnet 
Procurement Procedure Manual. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes . 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It says if there should not be any  
changes especially material changes to an evolving criteria.  Should 
there be a material change to the criteria like the Chair said earlier on 
at least all the bidders must be informed of that particular change.  So 
on a first principle it is already unfair for anyone to change the criteria 
20 
at that stage.   
 
Secondly (indistinct) rely on the codes of good practice, that 
as well is legally flawed.  A definition of a start -up enterprise in the 
code says a recently formed is the company enterprise that is recently 
formed or incorporated for less than one year.  At that stage CSR was 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 106 of 213 
 
not even incorporated in South Africa, right.  So they won’t qualify as a 
start-up so you can’t even use the codes as a justification (indistinct) 
because at a stage in our (indistinct) they will get their (indistinct) once 
they are a preferred bidder.  So at that stag e they are not even falling 
within the four corners of the codes of good practice insofar as it 
prescribes that a newly incorporated entity (indistinct) enterprise which 
qualifies for (indistinct) so on those two points already the argument 
that is being advanced is flawed.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So if I ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  So you said there were two reasons they advanced.  
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Why BB ...(intervention)  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Must be waived. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Must be waived or mustn’t be a factor at stage one, 
they said it was unfair to use them against foreign companies.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was that on the basis that foreign companies 
might not have that requirement in their own countries so rigid.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but isn’t the position, wouldn’t the position be 
20 
that for example if you are a foreign company like that and you know 
that there is that requirement tha t you can comply by having a local 
partner, is that the position or not?  I’m asking wouldn’t you be able to 
meet that requirement by having a joint venture with a company that 
would bring about, bring you BEE status.  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 107 of 213 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Certainly Chair, correct.  
(Indistinct) Bombardier, Bombardier is not a South African based 
company but at that stage they already had a local presence.  So all 
that CSR said it said it will only do that, form JV, once it is a preferred 
bidder, meaning at this sta ge ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Of the evaluation process they 
are not as yet complying or having a BBB certificate.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, it is not going to help you to talk about stage 
three because you won’t get there,  but also what’s wrong if foreign 
10 
companies that don’t have BEE, don’t have the BEE elements are 
excluded, if there are enough local companies that have got BEE 
status, what’s wrong with not having foreign companies?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Chair that gives context to the 
earlier slides when we spoke of the special treatment.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That CSR seems to be enjoying 
because the major beneficiary of this waiver is CSR.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Because maybe if its only forei gn companies that can 
provide what you are talking about maybe what you are looking for then 
20 
maybe you – the right body within Transnet can look at whether their 
policies can make provision to say under the following circumstances 
the BEE requirement will be waived you know, then that’s the right body 
to look at that, but then the other question with regard to this team that 
recommended the amendment is who has the right to amend the 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 108 of 213 
 
criteria, were you able to establish that at the time of investigating to 
the extent that anybody may amend, who had the right to amend the 
criteria, would it be the Board or some other ...(intervention)  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Chair in this instance it could 
have still been GCE, the issue of who has the right to amend I don’t 
think that’s where the issue lies, the issue is if you are going to a 
material amendment which affects the level, the playing fields, then the 
right thing to do is to reissue the tender, issue an erratum to say now 
the rules of the game have now been  changed in this fashion, so we 
didn’t pick much of an issue with a right of a particular body or person 
10 
to change, the question is an assessment of the import of that change 
and at what stage of the procurement process, if indeed, because this 
looks noble, assuming this looks noble the right thing to have occurred 
is for this tender to be re-advertised so that those who chose not to 
respond on a basis of this gatekeeper of the (indistinct) then they 
would have been freely able to participate in the revised  bid 
documents. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well somebody would have the power to say the 
criteria that would be applicable are the following, now either you have 
a document that sets the criteria in general and that’s the criteria that 
20 
gets applied all the time or you may have a body or a person that has 
the power to determine the criteria in regard to a particular transaction, 
and I would imagine that where there is somebody who has the power 
to determine the criteria in relation to a particular tender that if you 
seek to change them you would need to go back to that person because 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 109 of 213 
 
they shouldn’t be changed by anybody who decides I don’t like this part 
of the criteria so I will change you know.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Got it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But so, so but in this c ase there was a 
recommendation that they be amended, that request was made to Mr 
Brian Molefe, he agreed, he approved.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And if I may, I know it’s lunchtime Chair, j ust 
to close on that point, Mr Molefe not only approves or he is requested 
10 
to approve that amendment, he is also requested to approve the results 
of the evaluation already undertaken in terms of the amended set of 
criteria. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I see it’s one o’clock Chair, might this be an 
opportune moment? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you, we will adjourn, take the lunch 
adjournment, we will resume at two.  We adjourn.  
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We are ready Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you proceed just going back to that 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 110 of 213 
 
memorandum prepared by Mr Siyabonga Gama and – or was it prepared 
by Mr Siyabonga Gama only?  The one that was also signed by Mr 
Giani and Mr Brian Molefe approving the change of the rules once 
approved by Mr Molefe.  So I just had a look at the memorandum 
again… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair with your permission I…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Sedumedi I think it is at 8535 yes okay.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I am sorry I am not telling you where I am.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And your microphone as well please.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe it is not so bad because the two of you 
were not telling me sometimes when yo u were changing documents.  
Okay ja A – and – ja it starts at 8535.  As I understand it really it seems 
to amount to this that when the team that was evaluating the bids at 
stage 1 conducted their evaluation which was supposed to be in terms 
of the rules as known by all the bidders and the commencement of the 
process.  They discovered that one of the local bidders had not 
complied with one of the criteria applicable to stage 1 in that the BEE 
certificate that they provided was not accredited by the right bo dy, is 
that right? 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then – then there was a foreign supplier or more 
that did not have local representation and therefore did not have any 
BE certificate? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair there is only one 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 111 of 213 
 
Chair not more. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Only one yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Only one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja CSR. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  CSR. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  And they then thought that for them to continue 
and apply the criteria that had been advertised would be unfair as they 
were would be unfair to these two.  Now it does not make sense.  You – 
you say to – you tell the market – you tell the public those who meet 
the following requirements may submit bids for this job.  So mebody who 
10 
does not meet one of those requirements decides to submit…  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The bid [indistinct]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The bid anyway.  When you look at them you realise 
that this person does not meet one of the requirements of the criteri a 
and therefore should not have submitted a bid.  But you then say it is 
going to be unfair to apply the rules that they decided not to comply 
with. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is… 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It makes a more [indistinct] of the 
20 
[indistinct] criteria that is why there is a criteria in the very first place 
to be able to sieve through those that we want to evaluate.  So it does 
not make sense to say that we should prescribe at this late stage at 
least it is unfair to those who are not going to meet the very 
requirement that we want to be put [indistinct] I do not think.  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 112 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is not even a situation because I am sure if it 
was we would be told.  It is not even a situation where these entities 
who submitted bids knowing that they did not comply with one of the 
criteria it is not even a situation where they supplied – they put in their 
bids but made representations to say but this particular criterion is not 
proper, it is not acceptable or it works – it is prejudicial to a certain 
category of possible bidders and myself because of the following 
reasons and they were persuaded by that argument.  It is not that 
situation. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is not but I will take it further 
10 
Chair.  Even if those bidders made that representation let us for a 
second assume that indeed there is some form of nobility in this 
concern reasonable [indistinct] the appropriate step to take at this late 
stage of the process would have been to re –[indistinct] so as to 
reincarnate that or reproduce that fairness and competitiveness into the 
procurement process.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja not I mean at least you would know where this 
comes from.  You would say a bidder who did not meet one of the 
criteria submitted a bid and sought to persuade the company. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That they should allow them in even if they do not 
meet because of these possible reasons.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe they would then after looking at those 
reasons say actually this bidder has a point but the way to do it is to 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 113 of 213 
 
re-advertise and take out this criterion on that does not – that is unfair. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So here you do not see where the initiativ e for this 
concern comes from bidders that should not have put in bids in the first 
place comes from.  And then you – you say – it is like you say you 
advertise a vacancy you want people to apply for a job.  You say only 
those who have got matric may apply.  Somebody who does not have 
matric applies, you say but it is going to be unfair not to insist on 
matric and then you change the rules.  Is that your understanding as 
well? 
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is our understanding 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On record there is nothing that 
indicates some form of representation.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That was made by either 
[indistinct] or CSR on this point.   
CHAIRPERSON:  And on this memorandum there is also nothing that 
suggests that this change of the rules was aimed particularly unless I 
20 
have missed something, was aimed particularly maybe of addressing a 
concern from Transnet to say you know if we were to re -advertise 
maybe the delays that would occur would prejudice Transnet seriously 
and this is urgent and so on where we will not be able to make it if we 
start afresh and re-advertise.  Or if we change the rules.  There is 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 114 of 213 
 
nothing that seems to say what would be wrong with sticking to the 
rules or if you want to change them starting afresh properly and making 
sure everybody is aware of what the new rules are.  Okay.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Thank you Chair.  And I – 
just to close up this point Mr Sedumedi before we broke for lunch we 
were looking at Annexure TS1 to your slides which is the actual 
evaluation done by the CFET.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you did indicate that in that document 
CFET indicated the reasons for why they were recommending a secon d 
10 
option. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now I would like you to have regard to 8535 
which is the memorandum we are talking…  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Sello. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am interrupting you while you are putting that 
question.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I will hold Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do not forget the question. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I will not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Going back to what we were discussing a minute ago.  
Do you say there is nothing unfair in excluding a bidder who does not 
qualify to put in a bid in the first place?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  There is nothing unfair Chair if  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 115 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On the early – ago you 
prescribed the criteria that you are going to use to evaluate.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  If that criteria is being publicly 
known all of us when we respond we know what is it that you are going 
to be judged against.  Then if I fail to meet that which was prescribed 
then there is no unfairness there.  It is something else Chair.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  If you put an irrational 
10 
requirement in a bid document and you pick up that this is unfair like I 
said earlier on even if that was – if for one second we assume that it 
was irrational for Transnet to put this prequalification in stage 1.  Like 
you said the appropriate mechanism of getting around that irrational 
criteria that you have put up initially is to re -advertise the tender.  Let 
those who are potential bidders to know that this is the criteria that 
they are going to use.  So that is a point that we make on this one.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But it – it seems to amount to saying at the beginning 
when you set the criteria you are excluding those who do not me et that 
criteria. 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Therefore there is nothing wrong.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In keeping them outside because the criteria keeps 
them outside they do not comply. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 116 of 213 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If for some reason you think that you made a mistake 
by setting a certain criteria that excludes certain people then – then 
you may have to consider changing but then you must start all over 
again when – so that everybody  knows what the rules are. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Before then I turn back to 
my question.  Just to follow up on the point that the Chair makes please 
have regard to page 08 – 0h 00 – 8400 same file. 
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Same file 8400? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It is part of the RFP that starts at page 8370.  
So I would like us to have regard to 8400.   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I am there Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it – it is so on my reading and I would like 
to test that with you that it starts at 8399 regarding the evaluation 
criteria. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The question of fairness.  You read I think 
into the record what is stated in the box below at 8400 specifically 
20 
saying – pointing out that an overall minimum threshold of 60 for stage 
1 evaluation criteria must be met or exceeded for a respondent’s 
proposal to progress to stage 2.   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So in light of – so it is light of the fact that 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 117 of 213 
 
there are criteria you must meet.  You are also told of the 
consequences of failing to meet those criteria.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And under those circumstances would a 
question of fairness even arise?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It should not arise at all because 
you knew what you are getting into.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:      Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  When you went to collect these 
RFP documents. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed.  Now then the question I was posing 
to you I had referred to the TS1 Annexure TS 1 to your…  
CHAIRPERSON:  It sounds like it is unfair to allow to kick out gate 
crashers. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja   So Chair sometimes equal trea tment of 
people is unfair so I can see how the unfairness creeps in in this case I 
do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I would have thought that if you gate -crash you must 
be kept out? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Well I guess the principle is once you are in 
20 
notwithstanding that you gate-crash it is only appropriate that you be 
allowed to – you permitted to continue to enjoy the party.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  TS1 is we know is a CFT – CFET report that 
recommended this option 2. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 118 of 213 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The result of which was bring CSR in.  Now 
my reading of the memorandum at 8535 from Mr Siyabonga Gama and 
Mr Giani to Mr Molefe does not seem to annex that report – that 
specific report?  At 8535.  There is no reference to this re port in that is 
there? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Chair insofar as it being attached 
I take your point that it does not seem as if it was attached but at least 
we can see from the document itself that they make reference.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  To the CFET process. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And when I – I read at 8536 from paragraph 5 
through to 8.2 overleaf my interpretation of that section is that it 
reflects precisely what is in the report itself?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So even without the actual report it is fair to 
conclude that Mr Molefe at the point that he approved CSR participation 
on the basis of option 2 was fully aware of the reasons advanced for 
changing the rules? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well he signed the same document containing those 
reasons. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And therefore he must be taken to have been 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 119 of 213 
 
adopting those reasons. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed and the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  As the reasons for his decision to approve.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the point I sought to make was that there 
is nothing in the actual report. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That has not been brought to his at tention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As justification for changing the rules.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So he was fully appraised of all the facts 
relevant at the time? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay so we see that these are approved on 
the same day they were presented to him.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And now if we go back to your slides this 
would take us up to your slide 23.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you go to th e slides let us go back to an 
earlier question that I asked and I think you said that may – your team 
20 
might not have focussed on that question.  That is the question of who 
had the power to change the criteria.  It – did I understand you 
correctly that that is not an issue you applied your mind to whether as 
to who if anybody had the power to change or amend the criteria?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Chair in our report on a specific 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 120 of 213 
 
transaction we did not flash out that point but we are quite aware in 
terms of [indistinct] other transactions that within Transnet there would 
the legal authorities that have been granted to various officials.  In the 
first – the PPM the Transnet Procurement Procedure Manual will outline 
the different rules of each structure b e it a CFET and various mandates 
and then there will be a [indistinct] of authority that indicates who must 
do what.  Typically on a transaction like this when the board approves 
the transaction it will even indicate that the GCE as an example is 
authorised to issue the RFP and such other activities necessary to see 
this process up to the finish.  So even if on our report we did not 
10 
specifically flash out the mandate on this one but we are quite aware 
that in other transactions as well we do have various de grees of 
authority that have been delegated to different structures within 
Transnet.  So it is not actually surprising to see the GCE himself was 
[indistinct] that is why Siyabonga Gama and Mr Giani recommends to 
him to change.  So it might have been that at that stage and for this 
specific transaction he might have had that delegated authority to 
change this specific [indistinct] that is we did not flash out that 
[indistinct] also look into. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  I think Ms Sello  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you do not – if you have not had a chance to look at 
it it is something that I will be interested in earlier because it might be 
one thing not to advertise when you are supposed to advertise a 
change of criteria.  It might also be another thing if you do not have the 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 121 of 213 
 
power to amend in the first place.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Somebody else should be approached for amendment.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair indeed it is a discussion we had 
with MNS and as Mr Sedumedi s aid their investigation did not go that 
far.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV 
MAHLAPE 
SELLO:  
Because 
we 
do 
not have a clear 
understanding whether – when Mr Gama and Mr Giani approached Mr 
Molefe it was in a – with an intention that he approve at that stage but 
10 
he in turn submit to a higher and authorised body.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  In order to effect the change. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That is one issue they have not investigated.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will apply our minds to the procurement 
manual accepting that the procurement manual might tell us one thing 
but not answer this question specifically which to my mind would mean 
we must perhaps locate a witness within Transnet regarding this 
20 
particular RFP to enquire firstly who had the authority to put together 
the RFP.  Presumably that would be the body with the authority to 
amend it terms.  And we take it from there.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  In order to answer the second question 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 122 of 213 
 
whether Mr Molefe had the authority to amend as he purported to do 
here. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  I think what you would look at in terms of 
Transnet policies and manual would be whether you have a general 
provision in some policy document.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That says these will be the criteria for example that 
must be used only or whether you will have a provision for a general 
criteria but another provision to say there may be specific transactions 
which require specific criteria and in that eve nt who decides what 
10 
criteria will be applicable. And then see whether in regard to this one  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was a general – it was general criteria or it was a 
specific one and who decides you know because it may be that once it 
has been decided that a project must be put out to tender somebody 
formulates the criteria or a body or a committee formulates the criteria 
for that specific project or job and then they are at large to put 
whatever criteria.  Probably that would be the sam e body that would 
have the right to amend. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Presumably Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will look at it Chair and we will revert to 
you on how best to present that evidence.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To you. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 123 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  As I indicated Mr Sedumedi 
this takes us to page 23 of your slides.  So our next slide would be 24.   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  You may take it from there. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Ja.  On the slide in essence all 
that we were trying to do Chair was to one like I said even to recognise 
the fact that this transaction was also investigated by Fundudzi who by 
and large were in sync on most of t he findings except for these two 
specific ones relating to the issuance of the bid documents.  Just some 
10 
factual background.  When like I said earlier on Ms Mdletshe’s name is 
the one that appears on a bid document as the person that you must 
raise any queries or even obtain documents.  So CSR after the advert 
they paid but they paid from China I will just refer you to – on your 
Volume 11 Chair page 8440. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And Volume 11 Chair is the volume that you 
currently have open before you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it is the same page that we were dealing with …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  No we were dealing with 8537.  We would like 
us to have regard to 8440. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I have 8400.  8440?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Chair this document on 8440 it 
was sent by CSR to Transnet.  The heading of [indistinct] says 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 124 of 213 
 
[indistinct] confirmation of [indistinct] remittance.  What it sought to 
indicate to Transnet was that CSR’s account as you can – this context.  
CSR is based in Hong Kong or wherever China.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  They need to pay R20 000,00 
deposit for them to obtain the bid documents.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So they instructed their bank in 
China  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  To say pay Transnet R20  000,00. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So what they then provide to 
Transnet is a document that comes from the Bank of China telling CSR 
we confirm the following funds h ave been debited from your account if 
you have any queries please contact us as soon as possible.  But what 
is important is the following.  On the top there – the remittance account 
number that is CSR’s bank account in the Bank of China.  That is 
601557366040.  It says remittance account number and the remittance 
name.  That is how you pick up that this is CSR’s bank account number.  
20 
Alright?  It then says they have debited 2  080 US dollars for the benefit 
of account number 20315859 the beneficiary is Trans net Freight Rail.  
These bank details are the same bank details that appear on the RFP 
advert telling the bidders where must they deposit their R20  000,00.  
This they sent to Ms Mdletshe.  On the strength of this document Ms 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 125 of 213 
 
Mdletshe releases the bid docum ents to Transnet. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  CSR. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Ag my apologies to CSR.  It was 
a view of Fundudzi that on the – by the time Ms Mdletshe released the 
documents the money was not yet cleared in Transnet’s account.  We 
had a different view to say no money when you [indistinct] documents.  
You go there with a deposit slip that proves that indeed I have paid.  
The official at Transnet does not necessarily log into the banking 
system to see if indeed money is in the account.  They rely o n the 
people’s slip that you produce for them to release bid documents.  So 
10 
therefore we held [indistinct] it was not necessarily untoward of Ms 
Mdletshe to release the documents because at least on the face of it 
this document seems to suggest that the CS R account has been debited 
with this amount in favour of Transnet. So that is where we just 
departed on the views of Fundudzi  
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it might not – it might not be unreasonable – it 
might not have been unreasonable maybe for Ms Mdletshe to acce pt 
this as meaning that the money was in Transnet’s account.  But there 
may have been an obligation on the part of Transnet to check whether 
when they are given a document that purports to prove that payment 
20 
has been made whether indeed the money had come in because one 
can think of all kinds of things that can happen where you accept the 
document and assume that the money is in only to find that it was not 
in yet and after you had made the assumption something happened and 
the money ended up not getting in .  And in the meantime you may have 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 126 of 213 
 
allowed a bidder in who has not actually complied.  So it just – it might 
just depend what it is that one – one is looking at.  It is – it is like if 
you are supposed to pay by today and you deliver a cheque today but 
the cheque – I - I accept the cheque but the cheque will only be cleared 
later.  So it becomes important to know whether the delivery of the 
cheque is taken to be compliant or it is assumed to be compliant until it 
is checked whether the money is in and if t he money is not in then you 
have not complied.  So – but in the end it depends whether it became a 
– a material issue or not. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay.  Just the PPM …  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Did envisage that type of eventuality 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Clause 3.7.3 …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Of the PPM …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Reads as follows: 
“At the tender opening the number of responses 
received must be checked against the number of 
payments received.” 
So at least that risk of a cheque bouncing or an EFT being reversed at 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 127 of 213 
 
least is material by the fact that at least when you receive the bid 
documents there is an obligation on those who are doing the first stage 
to check if the monies that in fact on the deposit slips are indeed within 
Transnet’s account because we would not have submit this one in 
particular two days later – if my memory services me – their account 
was created.  So as I was saying on that point at least the (indistinct) 
was sufficient to address that requirement.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And on that score if you have regard to the 
tender notice at page 8370 it seems to addr ess the issue of payment 
10 
and what I may call “Proof of Payment”?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct.  So what – what it … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At – at your – it is a number of notes there.  
Note 123 on my reading or one to two – one and two.  Will you confirm 
that?  Am I correct in my reading?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct.  That is payment is made to 
the following account. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The deposit slip must reflect the RFP 
number to be presented prior – prior to the collection of tenders.  So all 
20 
of them must present a deposit slip.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Like I said (indistinct) then will 
address that risk that the Chairperson made reference to.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And now on this scor e you point out that 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 128 of 213 
 
Fundudzi held that what was required was the proof of receipt of the – 
of the funds … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before Ms Mdletshe could release, okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You said there were two issues on which you 
agreed. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The second issue relates to CSR’s 
non-submission of a tax certificate as well held the view that CSR 
ought to have been disqualified for not issuing a valid tax certificate.  
10 
Now we need to look at the genesis …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  That – that requirement was for stage 1 
or for a later stage – a tax clearance certificate?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Generally the tax certificate it is one 
of the requirements before you even evaluate stage 1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, ja okay alright. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: 
 
You 
do 
an 
administrative 
responsiveness …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  To ensure that …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  All documents are signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if you do not meet it you probably should not even 
… 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 129 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Be considered for stage 1?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  However here is a twist Chair.  The – 
the source of requiring a TCC – Tax Clearance Certificate – comes from 
Regulation 16 in the PPPFA – the Preferential Procurement Policy 
Framework Act which states that: 
“No bidder that does not have a tax clearance 
certificate issued by the South African Revenue 
Services…” 
10 
Because now we know a TCC can only be issued for various purposes 
by the South African Revenue Services.  Now for that Chairperson you 
must 
check 
whether 
this 
particular 
person 
is 
a 
taxpayer 
as 
contemplated in the various tax laws in South Africa.  At that stage 
know CSR was not a South African company.  So there was no tax 
obligations that it had towards SARS to enable SARS to issue because 
the Tax Administration Act tells us that:  
“A tax certificate will be issued by a SARS Official 
upon checking if indeed this particular taxpayer – 
taxpayer for that matter his or her or its tax affairs 
20 
are in order.” 
Now to an extent that the CSR did not have tax obligations in South 
Africa.  There was no incoming source from  South Africa.  So therefore 
there would not have been any – it was legally impossible for SARS to 
issue … 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 130 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes) the requirement could not apply to them?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It could not apply … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And in actual fact Chair there is an 
SBD1 form that is – SBD1 is a Standard Bidding Document issued by 
National Treasury … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Which on the particular one it needs 
to attach the certificates.  There is a  question there that they ask at the 
bottom. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  If you are a foreign company you say 
yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Do you have any tax obligations in 
South Africa.  You say no.  Then - it then says then there is no need for 
you to submit a Tax Clearance Certificate.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So that confirms the view that it 
would have been legally impossible for CSR to submit because these 
20 
certificates are supposed to be issue d by SARS.  SARS cannot even 
issue a certificate to somebody who is not a – a taxpayer. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So are you saying there was a difference of opinion 
between your team and Fundudzi on that?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 131 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So we had a good look on this one 
CSR – it was not irregular …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  For CSR to evaluate despite the fact 
they did not have a …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  A tax certificate.  So that is the view 
that we had with them but as I said those are the only two issues …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: 
 
Where 
we 
departed 
from 
the 
Fundudzi findings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you for bringing that to the Chairs 
attention.  I guess at the end of the day it is for the Chair to determine 
legally speaking which of the two findings is – is correct. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  On my – on my copy I – it would seem that we 
have reached the end of 95? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  If you may proceed then with your 
presentation. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay.  The next part of the 
presentation Chair is now focusing on the procurement of the 100 
locomotives.  You recall there were other witnesses before you who 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 132 of 213 
 
testified about the confinement of the 100 locomotives to CSR.  We will 
not deal much with the principle of confinement and the rationale save 
to – you recall as well when Mr  Callard testified there was this issue 
about the memorandum of Mitsui – I think it was – yes it was Mitsui that 
was withdrawn but when questioned by the Chair he could not explain 
what was the rationale or the reasons that we advanced in the Board 
Meeting for the withdr awal of that memorandum.  So that is the part 
that I think we will focus on.  If the Chair can have regard to volume 11 
page 8618? 
CHAIRPERSON:  On what page of the slides document?  
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Currently Chair I am on – on the 
slides I am on slide 28. 
CHAIRPERSON:  20? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  28 – 2-8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  28.  Yes, okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Where we now inform the Chair about 
the reasons why that memorandum was withdrawn.  It is 8618.  This is 
an extract of a BADC Meeting  – the Board Acquisition and Disposals 
Committee – had on 21 October 2013.  The relevant paragraphs there 
is paragraph 5.1.5 and paragraph – until – 5.1.6.  In essence it was an 
20 
enquiry by Ms - Ms Tshepe was one of the Board Members who 
enquired – sought clarity behind the withdrawal of the 160 diesel 
submissions from the current agenda because you recall from 
Mr Callard’s evidence that there was a memorandum that was initially 
prepared in October recommending Mitsui signed by Mr  Molefe and 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 133 of 213 
 
everybody else who was enquired to sign had actually signed that 
memorandum for its presentation at the BADC but on that day it was 
withdrawn.  The – so upon an enquiry by Ms  Tshepe management – 
(indistinct) management does not specifically say who.  It is on – it 
says: 
“Management …” 
I will – I will take the Chair to one, two – the second sentence from 
5.1.5.  (Intervenes) whether must I just …?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ja. 
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And if you can read if … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you sir ja. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  “Ms Tshepe sought clarity 
behind the withdrawal of the 160 diesel submission 
from the current agenda as the Committee had 
requested that it be table due to urgency on t he 
transaction.  Management stated that the matter 
was put on the table to the Committee and still 
20 
concerns were raised.  The request was based on a 
tender that was awarded in 2006 and subsequently 
confined in 2010.  A further request for a 
confinement 
was 
being 
made. 
 
Management 
indicated that upon reflection it opted to withdraw 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 134 of 213 
 
the matter after concern that when the initiatory 
confinement was made in 2010 …”  
That is three years ago. 
“…the press reports alleging that the company had 
entered into a 1.4 billion locomotive procurement 
secret deal.  An article in relation to this matter was 
included in the meeting.  Ms  Tshepe was of the view 
that the press reports and a confinement ought to 
have been considered prior to the matter being 
tabled to the Committee .  She stated the (indistinct) 
10 
submission was still on the basis of urgency to 
alleviate the risks relating to MDS volumes.  
Management’s regard the withdrawal of the agenda 
item was due to potential governance risks relating 
to the transaction.”  
So in a sense the reason advanced was that some three years earlier 
there was an issue around confinement.  So during the negative 
publicity that happened three years ago around confinement it would be 
a governance risk to Transnet to pursue this route of confining  to 
Mitsui.  So that was the – at least the official reason that was advanced 
20 
and on that basis the Board accepted the withdrawal of that particular 
memorandum.  However three months later – January 2015 – we now 
know that there was a new confinement memor andum that was 
submitted to the BADC and indeed it was approved by the BADC and 
the Board on 21 January 2015 as it appears on volume 8621 and that is 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 135 of 213 
 
the memorandum that I think Mr  Callard and Mr Volmink even 
(indistinct) as well addressed the Chair on in terms of its compliance or 
incompliance with the PPM requirements.  So I will not belabour that 
point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it may be that Ms Sello will take you to the 
minutes of the – excuse me – of the Committee or Board when it 
approved that submission three – three months later but I want to find 
out whether you have seen the minutes of that meeting and – and 
whether have also seen both submissions.  Whether it is the same 
submission or there was a change.  Whether you have had a chance to 
10 
compare the submission that was withdrawn and the submission that 
was later put before the Committee and the Board and whether it was 
exactly the same and whether this issue – this reason which was 
advanced to justify withdrawing it - whether three months later it was 
addressed to say what is – what is – what has changed.  Did – is that 
something you - you have looked at and you are aware of?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair indeed.  One can 
confirm that indeed there was a change in the contents of the 
memorandum.  You will recall that the initial memorandum had indicated 
that Transnet will like to – to confine to Mitsui and on a Friday before 
20 
this particular meeting Mr  Callard was requested to change – no 
actually to update the memorandum but when the draft came back to 
him for editing or formatting – that is the word that he used – he 
realised and could see the changes in the two documents in terms of 
removing the name Mitsui and replaced with CSR but on almost the 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 136 of 213 
 
same basis that was initially advanced by Mr  Callard.  So that indeed 
our investigation revealed only compared the two documents.  We could 
then see the changes that Mr  Callard referred to and as well we 
analysed that memorandum in relation to the confinement requirements 
in the PPM and made a finding that from the look of things this is not in 
line with the requirements of the PPM from an urgency point of view 
and if you look at the time that it took CSR to actually produce this – 
because as I said the memorandum spoke of a 19E (indistinct) but this 
21E that was eventually produced it took time to be manufactured in 
due of the fact that the specifications that were initially advanced were 
10 
now becoming a problem.  So that we were able to confirm with …  
CHAIRPERSON:  You have not finished continue. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay.  So the third aspect that the 
Chair asked was whether the reasons that were previously used in 
October …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Just to justify the withdrawal. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  To justify the withdrawal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  How did the …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether they were addressed subsequently.  
20 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  How (indistinct)? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  If you go to – in the actual minute – 
in actual fact Chair it does speak to that aspect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No let us leave it that.  I think Ms  Sello was 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 137 of 213 
 
planning to take you there. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes.  Yes Chair. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Let me allow her to - to do so at – at the time 
that suits her. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I wanted to just know that but before she does so just 
to refresh my memory the submission that was withdrawn from the 
Board on the basis that they are proceeding with it on the basis of 
confinement would be a governance risk.  That one reflected Mitsui as 
10 
the preferred bidder.  Is that right?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But when three months later it came back it was a 
different bidder. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Entity. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Before then we – we 
addressed specifically the – the issue of minutes.  At your slide 28 I 
think you have another date error.  It is 21  January 2014? 
20 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The 24 t h that is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If one has regard to page 8618 that minute is 
of 21 October 2013 and the memorandum you refer to at 8621 is 
21 January 2014? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 138 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If you could just effect that correction.  So 
according to your documentation you have provided us with the 
memorandum that served before BADC submitted by Mr  Brian Molefe on 
21 January 2014 and as you have pointed out to the Chair we know that 
that is the memorandum arguing for confinement but this time to CSR?  
The change has occurred. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That document is then followed by a minute at 
8645. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I am there. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Except that this minute is of the Board of 
Transnet not of BADC? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And this particular confinement and in 
particular to CSR is dealt with by the Board extensively?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The Chair enquired whether you were aware 
of the reasons to justify three months later asking for confinement 
again albeit to CRS. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And – and whether these reasons were shared 
with BADC or with the Board. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes.  On the bundle we have the 
minutes of 21 January …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 139 of 213 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Appearing on page 8645. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  What we do not have in this bundle 
because we subsequently learnt that there was a BADC Meeting earlier 
in that day. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So the same day – 24 January.  So – 
but for now if you go to paragraph 412 appearing on page 8646.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And we are now into the minute of the Board?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The minute of the Board. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Are you there Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 86 …?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  8646 – that document starts on page 
8645.  That is where the Chair will see …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The – the forum - the Special Board 
of Directors on the 21 s t. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And before you – you get into the detail of 
that minute you – you point out - out to the Chair that the previous 
20 
minute we dealt with was that of BADC withdrawing 21  October 2013 
request for confinement.  What you have in your report is the minute of 
the Board subsequently in January  2014? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Although it has now come to – to your 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 140 of 213 
 
attention that BADC reconsidered that confinement that particular 
minute does not form part of your record?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  What you have instead is the minute of 
the Board dealing with the same issue?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And on that basis you then say we should 
have regard to 8645? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then you may lead us through that. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  The – the minutes that we looked at 
where Ms Tshepe … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Tshepe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was querying why that submission was withdrawn.  
Were those minutes of the Board or of BADC?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It was BADC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was BADC? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and the minutes that start at 8645 they relate to 
the Board? 
20 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja they – not to BADC. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay but you – you say that the same issue that the – 
the Board had to deal with here at 8645 had been dealt with by BADC?  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 141 of 213 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Dealt by BADC on the same day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the same day? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On the same day Chair because the 
Board … 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you just do not have the minutes?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Not on record but we have …  
CHAIRPERSON:  You have got them somewhere?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  We have got them – we have them 
somewhere Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, then you can provide them?  
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That shall be – it has been … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Or it has been provided.  We did not 
want to tamper with the (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes as it is, ja. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Ja, so … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  We have (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  (Intervenes) can provide it in a supplementary.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Then on my reading Mr  Sedumedi it 
starts at – at paragraph 4 at 8645 under the heading “Matters for 
Approval”. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 142 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  You can take it from there and take the  
Chair to the relevant passage. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes.  As you can see this the heading 
for – under 4.1 is “Acquisition of Additional 100 Class 19E Equivalent 
Dual 
Voltage 
Electric 
Locomotives 
and 
60 
Class 
43 
Diesel 
Locomotives.” 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Ys. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The parts that are relevant to the 100 
locomotives is paragraph 4.1.2. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Overleaf. 
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Overleaf on page 8646. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: “Mr Sharma …” 
Now I am reading. 
“Mr Sharma stated that the matter …” 
Meaning this submission of 100. 
“…was dealt with at the BADC – Board Acquisitions 
and Disposals Committee.  The request for a 
confinement had been on the Committee’s agenda 
for three months and the matter (i ntervenes) …” 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  You are reading from where?  I am at 
8645 and 8646. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes Chair.  Paragraph 4.1.2. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At 8646. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 143 of 213 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  At 8646. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay.  I will start again Chair. 
“Mr Sharma stated that the matter was dealt with at 
the Board Acquisitions and Disposals Committee.  
The request for a confinement had been on the 
Committee’s agenda for three months and the 
matter 
was 
(indistinct) 
deliberated 
by 
the 
Committee.” 
The Committee referring to BADC. 
10 
“The company …” 
That is Transnet. 
“…currently has a contract with General Electric 
South Africa Technologies in terms of the Class 43 
diesels.  The proposal was to conf ine the 100 
electrics to China South Rail.  There were adverse 
media reports on the previous Mitsui confinement 
process.  To manage reputational matters the 
company seeks to advance to a new supplier.  
Management 
indicated 
that 
TFR 
locomotive 
20 
(indistinct) was first approved by the Board in 
April 2011 
and 
updated 
with 
the 
1  064 
GFB 
locomotive submissions.”  
But we just stop there Chair.  So there is no way you see how at least 
on the reading of these minutes and as well – like I can confirm when 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 144 of 213 
 
you go through the BADC Minutes that was the issue to say to manage 
that risk of 2010 where you confine to Mitsui.  So let us substitute 
Mitsui now with CSR so as to avoid that negative publicity that we had 
three years ago around confinement to Mitsui.  So that is – that is the 
official version that appears on both minutes.  
CHAIRPERSON:  But now what is being said to the Board now by 
Mr Sharma … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Suggest that the adverse publicity that they – they 
are to be concerned about or should be concerned about that had 
10 
happened before was related to the identity of the entity Mitsui?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair.  That is from the 
reading of the document, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As opposed to this – the process that was followe d.  
In other words when we read the minutes where Ms  Tshepe raised this 
issue why that submission was being withdrawn …  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the reason advanced was that previously there 
was bad – bad publicity and to proceed w ould – it would be a 
governance risk. 
20 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I got the impression that what was being said was we 
cannot proceed with this submission on the basis of a confinement 
because previously Transnet’s minute had used con finement and it was 
criticised. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 145 of 213 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So one expected that if they were to bring the issue 
back they would bring it back on the basis of not any confinement but 
maybe open tender but at least they would not use confi nement 
because the previous criticism related to why use a secret process.  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was my understanding.  Was that your 
understanding? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That was mine as well Chair that the 
reason that was put forth was that confinement seems to be an issue 
10 
because of this negative …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Publicity that we …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Enjoyed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now three months later … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That process that you are saying was 
a bit of governance risk …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  You follow it but this time around 
using a different entity.  So …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is – you quite correct Chair 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 146 of 213 
 
when … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Because that is also the impression 
that – that we formed when we …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  For confidential reasons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because now the way it seems to come across - at 
least to me – is you know there is nothing wrong with the – with 
confinement.  It is just Mitsui that gave us problems last time.  Let us 
use another entity then we will be fine.  
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  We are still at 4.1.2 and 
you wanted to make that clarification for – for the Chair and I think …  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You have gone through the exercise of – of 
comparing and contrasting the various reasons put forward in BADC 
and relative to the Board minute.  Is there anything in particular you 
would like to draw Chair ’s attention to in that minute still?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Nothing save to state that indeed 
20 
then at this meeting the Board then approved this confinement 
memorandum.  If you go to – Chair must turn over page 8647. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Under paragraph 4.1.7: 
“Resolve…” 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 147 of 213 
 
(Indistinct) paragraph down the line: 
“Resolve that the Board approved the confinement 
and award of the procurement for 100 electrical 
locomotives to CSR.”  
So that reasons which we advanced then were then adopted by the 
Board – Board and approved the confinement to CSR . 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I note that Ms Tshepe … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Tshepe. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was not – did not attend this meeting.  She being the 
one who had raised this issue pertinently at the earlier BADC Meeting 
10 
when the submission was withdrawn.  I w onder whether you do recall 
even before we see the minutes whether you may have noted whether 
she attended the BADC Meeting earlier – probably not. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  When this happened.  You might not know.  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I – I cannot recall that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay but …  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I will be …  
CHAIRPERSON:  I just note that at this meeting where this issue is 
raised and the decision is taken she is not there.  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I – I just raise that in the sense that maybe if she 
was there maybe she – she would have raised the issue of but really 
that is not what you told us last time.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 148 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So why are you still using confinement now … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because she – she had particular reasons last time.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As – as Mr Sedumedi indicated the – that 
minute of BADC of the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Even date – 24 January 2014 – is available. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The Chair suggested that perhaps it may be 
submitted. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Sedumedi overnight will make a statement 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  To tender that particular minute … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And when we resume tomorrow first thing in 
the morning we will  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Answer that question for the Chair …  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, no thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  With reference to the document. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is in order. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And as part of the resolutions it is to confine 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 149 of 213 
 
to CSR for 100 electric locomotives at an estimated cost of 3.8 billion 
that is under “Resolved” at page 8647 th e second bullet point of the 
resolution. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes, yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So it – at – approved both …  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It was plus … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The ETC and confinement and the entity to 
which the acquisition would be confined. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct yes, both the amount and 
the entity. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Alright, then we proceed with your 
presentation. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay Chair now what happens 
thereafter is that now on slide (indistinct) on 26 February after all these 
approvals were made Mr Brian Molefe then issued a confinement RFP 
to CSR, the Chair will find a copy of the RFP on page 8663, we just 
want to take the Chair through some of the key issues raised in this 
RFP because it becomes relevant at a later stage when you look at the 
award and as well when during the course of the week we will be taking 
the Chair through the increase in the (indistinct) for this particular 
20 
transaction. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SED UMEDI:  On page 8663 on our slides 
there, so the Chair must look at page 8663 and my slide page 29.  
CHAIRPERSON:  8663? 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 150 of 213 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  8663m 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And for completeness of that reference 
Volume 11. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Same volume. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes, Mr Sedumedi? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So in that volume there is a letter 
by Mr Molefe that you can pick up from the next page on A64, it is 
10 
addressed to CSR: 
“I have pleasure in advising that a Trust Board Resolution has 
authorised the acquisition of an additional 100 locomotives to 
CSR with certain modifications and certain commercial terms 
and conditions to be agreed upon in negotiations.”  
Now what we now know in terms of at least Chair must go to 4A now we 
know it’s for the 100, the quantity is 100, B one of the issues that we 
put as our requirement in this RFP is expeditious delivery for 
acceptance testing is a priority commencing latest September 2014 wi th 
completion by March 2015.  Any (indistinct) on early delivery are 
20 
invited.  You will recall this is a confined RFP Agency, it is of 
importance which is why the timeframes are being outlined that we 
need to get this thing latest by March 2015.  
 
Furthermore in paragraph 4E we state as Transnet that the 
payment terms a 10% deposit based on the current value per 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 151 of 213 
 
locomotive shall be paid: 
1. on successful completion of the negotiations;  
2. the signing of the amendments to the agreement giving facts to 
the extension 
Because you will recall at this stage CSR had an agreement with 
Transnet for the provision of the 95 locomotives, so as well the 
amendment and compliance with all suspensive conditions.  So lastly 
overleaf paragraph H supply development:  
“This is a non-negotiable suspensive condition and shall meet 
or exceed 70% as measured in the SD value summary.”  
10 
So these are now the ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry whereabout on 8664 is that?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is H Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  H, the ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh supply development. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So those are some of the 
conditions that were stipulated in the RFP document that was issued to 
CSR. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes? 
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now first in our report we then 
analysed this – because for all intents and purposes this is an RFP that 
has been issued. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It’s headed as such. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes, albeit for (indistinct) is an 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 152 of 213 
 
RFP. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Chair on 16 July 2012 Treasury 
issued a practice note, maybe let me just take Chair to that specific 
because it becomes relevant for this transaction and as well the 
(indistinct) transaction.   It’s on page – Volume 3, (indistinct) on 
Volume 11, so Volume 3, page 5137.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  While we’re there ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  ... Mr Sedumedi must we go to the document 
10 
itself or are you dealing with the issues arising.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Do we need to look at it or you will be able to make 
the point you’re making. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I can make the point and the 
(indistinct) but I correctly (indistinct) as it appears.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I will always cross-check you and (indistinct) 
yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  But then we can then focus on 
slide 13, the essence of that particular practice note was to prescribe 
the new thresholds for local content and production because from time 
20 
to time DTI will designate cer tain sectors as being qualifying for local 
content and production so this one focuses itself on the rail rolling 
stock and you will see these are the percentages that are stipulated in 
the practice note.  There’s a clause in that practice note that says th e 
RFP or the big documents it must be a bid condition that only bids that 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 153 of 213 
 
comply with minimum threshold will be considered.  It actually instructs 
an Organ of State that you must put this as a condition, in your RFP 
document you must up front indicate to y our potential bidders that this 
is a (indistinct) sector and you shall comply with this condition and only 
those that meet this threshold will then be evaluated further.  
 
Now when you look at this specific RFP it’s not prescribed that 
condition because this RFP is 2014 so the mandatory requirement that 
this put by the practice note that that must be included in a bid 
document that is not put on this particular RFP.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the instruction note is from July 2012, so 
10 
at the time of production of this RFP it was in force already.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It was in force already. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now the effect so on a point 
alone this RFP itself was irregular because it didn’t comply with the 
requirements of the law, so this RFP to understand that the RFP failed 
to put that condition as mandated by the practice note that renders the 
RFP itself to be irregular.  But we don’t look at the effect thereo f, but 
20 
now CSR submitted who has responded to this RFP on the 14 t h of 
March 2014, their response is found in Volume 11 page 8657, and this 
was accepted by Transnet, this is the RFP – the proposal that 
eventually formed the contractual relationship between Transnet and 
CSR.  Forty of the hundred locomotives were going to be completely 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 154 of 213 
 
manufactured in China. 
 
If I can take the Chair to page 8666 it’s a local content 
information for 100 sets of 21E, overleaf you will see that the local 
content at the bottom of that table, the local content percentage was 
15%.  When the practice note required that the – this is for electric, the 
local content was 60%, so this is a product of one the condition not 
being put in the RFP document and now you can even see the direct 
results of that requirement not being met.  I mean the fact that forty of 
the hundred comes from China, the practice note expects 60% of the 
product to be locally produced, not 60% of the total package of goods 
10 
that you are procuring. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So your interpretation of that requirement is 
of every product manufactured 60% must have been locally sourced.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is the whole rationale 
behind designating the (indistinct), you are seeing as a country you 
have done your res earch, because that’s what even the (indistinct) tells 
you that even if you look IPAP being the policy from DTI that where 
you’ve conducted enough research to establish the capabilities of the 
country will then put, pack those thresholds at that particular  level. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So in splitting the various locomotives 
20 
between China and South Africa that is not addressing the key issue 
that as DTI requires be addressed by way of local production.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That’s correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So you say at 8666 and 8667 this is a 
document received from CSR and there is a clear indication that the 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 155 of 213 
 
local content component will only 15%  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  15% and the fact that only 40, 
sorry, only 60 of the full complement will be manufactured in South 
Africa. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And notwithstanding the requirement of the 
practice note for 60% local content.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   Content and production.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And if I understood your reference to the RFP 
inconsistent with the RFP itself which I understood had prescribed a 
supply development percentage of 70%? 
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Chair that is – supply 
development is something else. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Something different, okay. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  As the separate concept from 
...(intervention)  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We’re still at local development. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct, we will come to the 
issue of the (indistinct) now when you look at the response that comes 
from CSR addressing that aspect at least of the SD.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then let’s take it in the manner that you have 
20 
approached, we have dealt with your slide 30 ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, before we proceed the request for proposals did 
not deal with this  in circumstances where it was mandatory that it 
should deal with it. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That’s correct Chair. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 156 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the course of your investigation did you check 
whether in previous transactions for locomotives I think there may hav e 
been one a few years earlier, or a few  years before 2012 did you check 
whether maybe you know local content had always been there even if it 
was not mandatory in respect for proposals?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Chair the practice note came into 
effect 2012.   
CHAIRPERSON:  But that’s when it became mandatory.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The 1064 transaction had that provision.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR 
TSHIAMO 
MICHAEL 
SEDUMEDI: 
 
So 
we 
know 
Transnet 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So this transaction remember 
Chair it happens in the context or during the same period when 1064 is 
being procured, so the bid documents for 1064 had that specific 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, had that requirement, but this one did not have.  
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  This one did not have it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and they were more or less the same time?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Same time Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of the persons or person or body preparing 
or formulating the request for proposals does it happen to be very 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 157 of 213 
 
different people or is it one of those situation where it’s the same 
department, the same – maybe it’s different persons but in the same 
unit or what, or is  that something you didn’t get a chance to apply your 
mind to? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Ordinarily the RFP process would 
be managed by the supply chain management department of Transnet, 
you will recall even on the – you will recall when we dealt with  the 95 
Mr Giyani being the Chief Procurement Officer he (indistinct) supply 
chain unit would have initiated their bid process which is why Miss 
Mljeje was one of the persons that you were required to contact, so 
10 
under normal circumstances that is the proc ess that would be 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s the section that ...(intervention)  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That’s the section that ordinarily 
would deal with this aspect.  What is not clear from the records is the 
role if any that was play ed by Supply Chain Management in the 
issuance of the RFP, but what it just see is this letter that’s being 
signed by Mr Molefe, being issued to CSR.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and do you know what role supply chain 
management may have played in regard to the 1064, the RFP for the 
20 
1064? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They played a role there?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  They played a critical role in the 
...(intervention)  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 158 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the RFP had this requirement?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The RFP had that requirement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Here the RFP – well this doesn’t have this 
requirement, and we don’t know what role if any supply chain 
management played in regard to it.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Certainly Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair, so then the we dealt with 
your 8663 which is the RFP, you then referred us to 8657 which you – 
at volume 12 still which you indicated was CSR’s response to that RFP.  
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes Chair the 86 ...(intervention)  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That’s the last document you had referred us 
to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to repeat the page number, 8657?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  8657 – slide 31. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The response from CSR? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes Chair are you there?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay I was inviting you to now deal with that 
response. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Alright, this response on 8657 the 
20 
two issues that we picked up on page 8657 until page 8659 are the 
various options that CSR proposed to Transnet  The difference in the 
main between the three options are the following:  
 
Option one is when all 100 locomotives are assembled, 
manufactured and assembled in China as it appears from paragraph, 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 159 of 213 
 
sub-paragraph 1 of 1.1, page 8657, right? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Then if you look at Option two 
appearing on 8658 the difference on number one there is the sixty 
locomotives will be manufactured and assembled in China with the 40 
in South Africa, assembled a t TET, TET being Transnet Engineering a 
Division within Transnet. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Option three is the one that we 
spoke about where the 40 locomotives will be manufactured and 
10 
assembled in South Africa. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  40 in China, 60 in South Africa. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  40 China, 60 in South Africa, so 
that’s the difference between the three options, obviously as well the 
price difference between those three options, but (indistinct) central is 
that aspect in the payment terms. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now what – and we now I can 
confirm to the Chair Option three was the one that was chosen, 
confirmation for that you will find ...(intervention)  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is Option 1.3? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  No Option three. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Option three under paragraph 1.3?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Under 1.3 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That’s correct. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 160 of 213 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is the option that eventually 
was accepted by Transnet and confirmation of that you will find Chair 
on page 8672 which is an extract of the agreement that was concluded 
between CSR and Transnet. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On this transaction, but later on 
we will take you through this specific document.  Now what is key about 
this option three are two issues, the delivery that CSR proposed you 
recall that in the RFP Transnet wanted an expeditious delivery of the 
locos, latest March 2015.  This proposal, which is accepted,  sets out 
10 
proposals or indicate that they will deliver the first locomotive in 
February 2015, and the last one in September 2015.  Now that whole 
urgency concept of this thing is urgent, it needs to be done quicker, 
CSR is not complying with that requireme nt. 
 
Secondly the (indistinct) the fact that the RFP required 70%, 
CSR in its proposal of 14 March it says it can do 60% of the SD, that – 
so we are saying those two will indicate to us that their proposal itself 
was not compliant with that which we were r equesting as Transnet. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now on that score if we have regard and 
keeping our finger at 8659 if we have regard to the 100 RFP it – the 
20 
RFP indicated that one of the conditions is payment and and I’m trying 
to locate my RFP, is payment of a  10% deposit on the achievement of 
certain milestones, do you recall that?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct yes Chair, 8663. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  8663, thank you very much. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 161 of 213 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes, 4E. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes sir.  Now I read then what you say is 
Option three which was – is what was eventually contracted upon and I 
look at the payment conditions, they seem to be significantly higher the 
deposit payments than what was contemplated in RFP?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct Chair and you will 
recall this was one of the issues that was raised by the earlier 
witnesses, (indistinct) in particular, but if you look at this payment 
condition it’s 30% of the current amount to be paid before the contract 
comes into effect, as opposed to the 10% that was stipulated in the 
10 
RFP. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And it goes further to say 30% of the contract 
amount to be paid after designed review.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct but not later than six 
months after the effectiveness of the contract. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then in the first six months of signature of 
the contract 60% must be paid out and at that juncture there is not a 
single locomotive on the South African tracks?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay do you know, were you able to 
20 
determine on what basis Transnet accepted these very high payment 
conditions and did not comply with their own stipulation in the RFP of 
10%, is there anything you are able to lay your hands on that could 
shed light on how this came to be? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Nothing on record Chair sheds 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 162 of 213 
 
light on what would have informed Transnet’s reasoning in accepting 
the terms that are not even in line with what was put up in the RFP.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is there a record of any negotiation around 
these issues between Transnet and CSR?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Not that was made available to 
us, even when we conducted our own forensic searching the imaging of 
the servers we could not pick up any of these issues.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So with reference to what you have already 
referred the Chair to as the contract at 867 is the Chair entitled to 
accept that on presentation of the option the option was accepted lock, 
10 
stock and barrel without further query?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  From the look of things because 
all the terms that are on Option three they found their way in the 
schedule to the LCA as it appears on page 8672.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you in the course of your investigation go back to 
– I’m going back to an issue that we dealt with maybe ten minutes, 
fifteen minutes ago, did you go back to the media to see how this 
negative publicity that the management was talking about which they 
said was associated with the confinement of Project Tumatuwe, to see 
20 
whether you were – you are able to see whether the negativity related 
to the identity of the entity or on the process of confinement?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  No Chair we didn’t go as far as 
that (indistinct) can be noted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I would like that to be done. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 163 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It shall be done Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Go back to because they when they presented this 
submission three months later they seem to suggest that the negativity 
was connected with the identity of Mzuwe.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So let’s see whether if we check that, that will be 
...(intervention)  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We shall Chair and we will provide you with 
all newspaper articles and such relating to that issue.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja, ja, okay. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now we then have gone through page 31 of 
your slides and we have, you have expressed a view on the contract 
that was subsequently concluded on the terms, counter -proposed if I 
may say by CSR at your slide 32, you’ve dealt with those issues. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you.  You then want to deal with further 
– in further detail with some of the payments made in terms of the 
contract subsequently concluded with the CSR and and you start that a t 
your slide 33. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair, if we still keep our 
20 
finger on that page 8672 Chair, that extra ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 86? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  8672. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Like I said this is a Schedule 1 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 164 of 213 
 
being the pricing and payment terms of the agreement.  In terms of this 
agreement in particular Clause 122B which appears on 8673 but we will 
obviously read it from Clause 122 first.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So at the foot of 8672? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes, so let’s start on page 8672, 
because that’s where paragraph 1.2.2 starts.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It says: 
“No milestone payment shall be due ...”  
We ignore A for now, it’s not relevant for  our discussion. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And we go to B, that appears on 
page 8673, except in respect of the final payment, until the contractor 
has provided evidence (indistinct) to the company that the advance 
payment bond extends to the amount due in respect of that applicable 
milestone payment.  All it says in a sense is that the contractor in this 
instance being CSR must provide Transnet with an advance payment 
guarantee or a bond as referred to in this clause before any milestone 
payment can be made, obviously bar the last (indistinct) being the final 
payment so to understand you’re going to make in advance payments 
20 
let us have security because the whole rationale is for Transnet to have 
security for all the payments that  it advances to their contractors. 
 
Now in this transaction if you go to slide 34 Chair, we know 
there was a first milestone payment that milestone payment indeed 
there was an advance payment guarantee.  However on 1 October when 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 165 of 213 
 
we made payment of R1 320 000. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  R1 billion I guess. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Or R1 billion my apologies. 
CHAIRPERSON:  R1 billion. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  R1 320  
CHAIRPERSON:  320 million 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Million 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And 20 000 – we had to rehearse 
with the I think it is the law how to pronounce this big figures Chair so 
10 
it is… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I heard it right the first time Mr Sedumedi.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So this payment was made 
without Transnet that is on that date of 1 October having received any 
APG Advanced Payment Guarantee from Transnet.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  From CSR. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  From CSR  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And I want to take the Chair to 
20 
the same Volume page 8686. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is an email dated the 10 
October. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 166 of 213 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Addressed to Mr Anoj Singh from 
Mr Thamsanqa Gianni and copied Mdletshe and Ms Nomfuyo Galeni was 
at a stage a CFO at TFR. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  If I may just interrupt you shortly.  Somewhere 
we forgot the transcribers.  Thamsanqa Jiyane it is Thamsanqa  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Nqa. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Second name is Jiyane.  This other name is 
Lindiwe Mdletshe, Lindiwe Mdletshe.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thanks you may proceed. 
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Alright.   
“Dear Chief I am aware that the issue of the payment 
to CSR without an APG exposes Transnet.  I take full 
responsibility to the payment being effected without 
the APG being issued and finance paid on an 
instruction from my office.  If you [indistinct] which 
led to the APG not being issued on ti me and we are 
not clear – and we are not clear as to CSR on when 
exactly the payment will be made.”  
So this email seems to accept on the face of it that it was improper or 
20 
Transnet was put on risk when this payment was made without an APG 
being in place and Mr Jiyani on this score accepts that he is the one 
that caused the payment to be done without an APG.  So it is clear that 
this as well was in breach of that clause 1 22B that I had earlier quoted 
which is a schedule to the [indistinct] requires that pri or to any advance 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 167 of 213 
 
payment being done at least minus the last [indistinct] payment there 
ought to be an APG in place. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now remind us what – what position did Mr 
Jiyani hold at this point within Transnet?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Mr Jiyani at that time was the 
Chief Procurement Officer at Transnet Freight Rail.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Understanding as you do the policies and 
procurement policies and delegations of authority within Transnet did 
Mr Jiyani have any authority to authorise paym ent of that 1.3 billion 
without the necessary guarantee in place?  
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Definitely not Chairperson. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So in as he states taking full responsibility for 
that payment…  
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  What is the basis for  saying he was not? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Because in terms of the 
[indistinct] it will indicate who are the parties that would have authority 
to alter the terms of any agreement that Transnet would have with its 
suppliers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  [Indistinct] just a Chief 
20 
Procurement Officer responsible for procurement of goods and safety.  
So she took responsibility for all applicable aspects.  As soon as now 
there is a contractual in [indistinct] that function it is out of his pay 
view and even terms of the amounts the amount that we are speaking 
about here did not fall within his delegated authority.  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 168 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you see it is one thing if somebody from Transnet 
telling me that.  You are not from Transnet.  So that is why I am asking. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What the basis?  Is it because you have seen?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  We have seen. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Relevant documents that set out who has what power 
and who does not have what power. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  My apologies I just [indistinct] 
yes.  As part of our investigation we did peruse various documents that 
indicated who had what particular authority within Transnet.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So you tested whether or not Mr Jiyani w ould 
have had the authority to instruct treasury in the manner that he did to 
pay the R1.3 billion. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And having done that interrogation you 
satisfies yourselves that he did not have such authority?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who would have had the authority?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The – I do not have the 
documents in front me but definitely in terms of the amounts  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  This would have been a sum that 
falls within – at the very least would have been…  
CHAIRPERSON:  Would have been the Chief. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Would have been – at the Group 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 169 of 213 
 
level if [indistinct] maybe even the Chief Executive but defin itely not 
anybody below …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Not the [indistinct] lower. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Not anybody below the level of 
Chief. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Group Chief. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then perhaps I am sure it would not be too 
much of an imposition for you to look through that tonight and perhaps 
10 
tomorrow with reference to the delegation of authority and any other 
relevant policy you would be able to definitively answer the question 
and point the Chair to the relevant clauses. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct.  I will do 
certainly. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then my question is when Mr Jiyani under 
those circumstances states:  I take full responsibility for payment of the 
1.3 billion without an APG being issued an in place that is cold comfort 
to Transnet?  What is your view?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Being a lawyer you always say 
20 
this comfort as cold as it may sound it is not something that fell within 
the mandate of Mr Jiyani.  No matter how noble the intention might 
have been or the fact that his [indistinct] full responsibility.  Taking full 
responsibility that means then the consequences must follow because 
you then breached our policies as Transnet.  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 170 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So you are saying he did not even have 
authority to give comfort?  Okay.  Yes.  Anything else you would like to 
draw the Chair’s attention to at 8686 that email?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  No that is basically [indistinct] 
special issues. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before then you go my question to you is 
when you look at that email the last paragraph before the salutations it 
reads: 
“There is another payment due in 5 days and I know that we will be 
engaging CSR to delay the payment.  We may end up in the same 
10 
situation once more.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  8686 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Sello.  I am interrupting you but we should have 
discussed this earlier. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have in mind that we should try and go beyond four 
o’clock today. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If that is fine with you and the witness.  On Thursday 
20 
we might not be able to sit after lunch.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So therefore it is necessary to try and make sure that 
the hours that we will not sit we make for them here by adding some 
hour – extra hours.  But I am not sure in terms of your line up of 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 171 of 213 
 
witnesses how that might affect your line up.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  It does impact Chair in this sense.  I was 
hoping to have finis hed with three witnesses by Thursday.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That was assuming that we will run until 
Thursday close of business. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But of course… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now it is not going to happen we accept that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So I am trying to think how we – we make up. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As things stand we were supposed – the aim 
had been to finish with Mr Sedumedi today.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Because the next witness is going to become 
fairly technical and the pace would be slower.  
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But we will not be achieving that.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Maybe what…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We may try  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Today we run to perhaps five o’clock.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Five o’clock ja 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And we start tomorrow at nine o’clock.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 172 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Until five. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And we have another early start on Thursda y. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And see where we are at on Thursday lunch 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes because…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And another – a different witness – okay – 
true still relating to Transnet. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Was scheduled for Friday and at the current 
planning he would take the whole day.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Because if we do not sit after lunch on Thursday 
we would lose two or three hours. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If before – I mean on Thursday.  If before Thursday 
we add these hours that we are adding we certainly will make up for the 
loss of two or three hours. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes definitely Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So but for today we can go up to five?  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We can go up to five. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can go up to five. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then maybe – and tomorrow we can start at nine?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We can start at nine. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 173 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  We can start at nine. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I am happy to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  YEs. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Sedumedi you are available?  Yes Chair.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I am. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is going up to five fine with you today?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is very fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And starting at nine tomorrow  it is fine? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Very fine Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. Let us do that and then maybe 
10 
tomorrow at some stage you can talk to me about how not sitting on 
Thursday afternoon might affect your  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  What affect it has? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Might affect your line up of witnesses but obviously 
we – we are certainly going to end up using not less hours than we 
were going to use in the whole week.  And it is a question of probably 
whether witnesses are able to come a  bit earlier where it is necessary 
to do so. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I am sure we can manage that on our side 
Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Let us see how far we get. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you.  Then we can take an adjournment – 
a short adjournment at four. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At four. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 174 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja and then – and then resume and continue up to 
four – up to five. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  We will thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Mr Sedumedi we were still at 8686 and out of 
interest that last paragraph before the salutations there that refers to 
another payment being due in five days from the date of the email and 
states that quote, unquote “we will be enga ging CSR to delay the 
10 
payment we may end up in the same situation once more.”  My first 
question I do not know if you looked into this issue?  What payment 
would have been due in five days based on the terms of the contract as 
at 10 October 2014?  What nex t payment could – is Mr Jiyani 
conceivably talking of?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That Chair because if I – if I look 
at the schedule of payments. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That on the face of the document 
ought to be effect [indistinct] payment payable on the date of issuance 
20 
of an acceptance certificate for a locomotive.  So presumably reading 
this email in relation to the agreement that payment would be relating 
to an – in certain [indistinct] of the contract price being w hen the first 
locomotive passes an acceptance test.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But then that is where my confusion arises 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 175 of 213 
 
becasuse… 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Ja it does as well. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Because on CSR’s counter offer the first 
locomotive would roll off the line in February 2015?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And reading Mr Jiyani’s email of 10 October 
2014 he says another payment is due in 5 days so that would 
presumably be around 15 t h, 16 t h October? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDU MEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  How do I reconcile all these – you have not… 
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  No.  We have not because 
evidently that sentence in any event is not even in line with the 
payment terms. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Absolutely. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  As appearing on the agreement 
itself. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Absolutely. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So it – quite keen to see what 
payment was he referring to.  But I did speak to this transaction 
[indistinct] I am not quite sure on that one. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Well if the – if the email is anything to go by it 
would seem to be the same transaction.   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As [indistinct] ja.  And are you aware of a 
further payment made subsequent to this 1.32 billion in the course of 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 176 of 213 
 
your investigations did you look at that – any other payments? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes because obviously there 
were other payments because the locomotives were delivered so some 
[indistinct] which entitled CSR to be paid indeed were achieved.  So 
there were payments that were done but those payments seemed to 
have at least have had the required APG’s.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But besides the two that you refer to at your 
slide 34 are you suggesting the third  payment was when delivery 
started taking place of the locomotives?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is something that I cannot 
10 
speak off the cuff but I think by tomorrow we can [indistinct] but I know 
my colleagues…  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Be able to achieve that. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Always had these spreadsheets 
that were indicating various payments that were made to CSR so by 
tomorrow morning we will be able to confirm this aspect.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  According to your slides that would 
then bring you to the conclusion of the issues you deal with in your 
report on 100 locomotives?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  On your current slides that would then take us 
to 1064? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Indeed. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  We are ready when you are.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  I am.  The – on slide 38 Chair we 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 177 of 213 
 
just indicate the various topics that we will be addressing when we 
present the – our findings on 1064. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes go ahead. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Again as you can see that will be 
the business case itself but we will not delve much into it because 
amongst others Mr Callard had dealt with it.  We will speak to the 
unlawfulness of the RFP that was issued.  Again the  changes that 
occurred during the [indistinct] process of 1064.  The non -compliance 
with local content and production, batch pricing, the Tequesta 
agreement and the increase in the ETC.  Even though I will not 
10 
necessarily speak about that in depth because there is another witness 
who will speak to those items.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Sorry just to get clear.  You will speak on 
everything on that list of contents in detail except to the extent 
necessary except the increase in ETC?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  In the ETC. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Because that is for another witness?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes but the ETC that we will be 
speaking about here will be mainly relating to the failure of Transnet to 
obtain the requisite approval or reporting the tra nsaction to its 
20 
executive authority being the shareholder Minister.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO: Okay.   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now again by [indistinct] 
background just to recall 1064’s part of the 1202 and you also confirm 
that on 23 July 2012 the Transnet issued the tender for the 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 178 of 213 
 
procurement of 1064 and just to note Chair but just for noting nothing 
much will come out of it in terms of our presentation that by the time 
the tender was issued the business case that we are talking about was 
not yet finalised.  So the tender went out before the business case was 
approved.  Because the business case was only approved sometime 
April 2013 when the tenders went out a year earlier.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So on that score then what was the tender 
based on if not on the business case? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  During those early days a draft 
document was – Mr Callard did indicate that he had worked on the 
10 
business case which was presented to TFRIC Transnet Freight Rail 
Investment Committee. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And CAPIC that is the Capital 
Investment Committee but at that structure it was then decided that the 
business case must be given to an external service provider insistence 
when it was McKinsey to validate the business case beca use there 
were some issues that the committee had with some of the assumptions 
and other issues that were presented to them so the business case was 
not approved it was then given to McKinsey who only finalised their 
20 
work because late on in early April, Ma rch 2013 for its adoption in 
2013.  So we are quite correct when it was issued the business case 
was not there but some elements coming out of the drafts of the 
business case already you could see them being reflected in the scope 
of work that was containe d in the RFP albeit not yet approved by the 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 179 of 213 
 
board. 
ADV 
MAHLAPE 
SELLO: 
 
Did 
you 
test 
the 
lawfulness 
or 
appropriateness of that approach?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Those of us who are purists in 
procurement will tell you that SCM Supply Chain Management starts 
with Demand Management.  So Demand Management you must ensure 
that all the things – first and in fact what is it that you need?  How must 
it be procured?  What is the value of that transaction?  That then 
closes up issue of demand.  We have now esta blished I need so much 
of the goods that must be procured.  This is how they have been costed 
10 
and this is the value and this is how we are going to procure them.  So 
that is where now the business case comes in.  In actual fact the – 
subsequent the 2012 pr ocurement procedure manual of Transnet 
demands that.  It says before you got on tender all procedures should 
have been completed.  But what you must state though is that by the 
time this one went out the applicable PPM was at 200 2009 PPM that 
did not elaborate at length the steps [indistinct] about Demand 
Management, Acquisition 
Management, 
Procurement 
and 
Control 
Management.  So that is a notion that you always know that before you 
could procure at least have a business case that informs that which you 
20 
are procuring.  It is why as well now if you look at evaluation 
[indistinct] to know that when you are asked some of the officials when 
we interviewed to what extent did you use the business case when you 
evaluating now they did not even have regard to the b usiness case.  So 
ja.  Even though on our report we did not necessarily make that finding 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 180 of 213 
 
but that is something that we noted to say by the time this was issued 
there was no approved business case at the time but there was an 
approval from the board that the procurement was taking place earlier 
acknowledge the fact that the business case is still underway but – and 
the principles coming out of it were presented to the board.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So that is the furthest tha t we 
could take that point. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay thank you.  You may proceed then with 
your slide presentation it now takes us to …  
10 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now if we now got to slide 40?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  What is it now?  Yes slide 40. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  We now look at testing the 
lawfulness or otherwise of the RFP document.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Like you said the board approved 
the RFP process in 25 April 2012. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The actual advert not the 
documents were advertised on the 15 July 2012.  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That we will find on that part of 
the record.  We make mention only as dealing with 100 Chair I did bring 
to your attention the fact that at least on the 16 July there was this 
instruction note that required bidders to have a local – there is a local 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 181 of 213 
 
production and content.  So that principle becomes relevant again in 
this transaction.  And we just quoted that extr act again.  Now this 
instruction note provides that those who meet the threshold must be 
evaluated on the basis of 80/20 orientation depending on the value of 
costs of the transaction.  Now that requirement at a stage was a bit of 
a problem for Transnet wh y and I will show the Chair in the next slide.  
All skilled 2 entities those are the major public entities that are on 
schedule 2 of the PFMA were exempted from certain provisions of the 
PFMA.  Maybe what we must look at if you allow me so that maybe deal 
with that. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And then come back to slide 41.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On slide 42 it is a summary of the 
exemption that was issued from the 7 December 2011 expiring I think  
around about 7 December 2012 so it was a year’s exemption.  The 
items on the left those are the provisions which – in which entities like 
Transnet were exempted from that is a regulation 2.2 that confirms that 
an organ of state must supply the PPPFA.  Key  1 again there is 
evaluation on 80/20 and 90/20 they were exempted from using that 
20 
criteria.  What they were not exempted from appears on the right 
column being what is relevant is regulation 9.  On [indistinct] for local 
content and production.  So it was  not – you are not exempted from not 
compliance provision you were required in an event that you are – you 
fall within the general sector you are either required to least comply 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 182 of 213 
 
with us – requirement and as well obvious reasons the issue of the tax 
clearance certificate.  Now if you go back to slide 41.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Hm.   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  At that time Transnet was not 
using a 90/10 evaluation criteria.  So when this came up it became 
apparent that they now have to abandon the criteria th ey have been 
using all along and use 90/10.  All get a further exemption from the 
Minister.  So they then decided to split the RFP into two.  Part 1 and 
part 2. Part 1 dealt mainly with the technical scope of work.  So issues 
relating to evaluation were de ferred to a later date when they were 
10 
hoping that at that stage when they issue part 2 the whole exemption 
process would have been completed and probably then would have 
obtained an exemption from treasury.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So that is what the issue was all 
about. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before you go further. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I am at your 42.  Are we to understand – 
standing this manner and I will call it the 2011 exemption.  
20 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The 2011 exemption which was in place for a 
period of one year exempted Transnet from – entirely Transnet from the 
provisions – certain provisions of the PPPFA?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 183 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  That exemption however did not include 
regulation 9? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So regulation 9 dealing with designated 
sectors for local content production was never part of the first 
exemption? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes.  I understand it was never 
part of the exemption at all. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So when the decision is taken to split the 
RFP’s to await a decision a decision could only have been in respect of 
10 
Transnet now getting a further exemption which is in respect of 9 which 
it did not have in terms of 2011 exemption?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is that correct? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  With specific reference to how to 
evaluate the bids that made the threshold, correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  In terms on 9? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  In terms of 9 that is right. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair I think we are on to your – four o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we will take a short adjournment of ten minutes 
20 
so we will resume at ten past four.  We adjourn.  
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
INQUIRY RESUMES  
CHAIRPERSON:  You may proceed. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 184 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Sedumedi we are into 
the last mile for the day.  You have just taken us through the  2011 
exemption and the peculiarities of Regulation 9 which you – you 
indicated that – which you indicated that Transnet had never been 
exempt for? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  You can take your discussion from 
there.  Your mic please, thank you. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Apologies.  So like I said in – in the 
(indistinct) Transnet was quite aware of this challenge.  It is why they 
10 
issued part – deferred the issuance of part – Part B or Part 2 out of 
(indistinct) stage hoping to get this exemption.  Now despite that 
exemption that had been forthcoming Transnet nevertheless in 
December issued the second part of the RFP with the following criteria 
which was not in line with the long term requirement on slide 43.  The 
Chair can just focus on stage 6.  You will note that stage 6 is an extract 
of the evaluation criteria taken from the RFP document as it appears on 
volume 2 page 4527.  You will note there Chair that (indistinct) is 90 for 
price – 90 points for price and 10 points for B-BBEE.  In this regard 
Transnet issued the bid with an (indistinct) it was 60/20 – 60 percent 
20 
for price, 20 for SD and 20 for B -BBEE.  This typically would have been 
the criteria that they used during the exemption period.  Now on slide 
44 like I said you will see Transnet was quite aware of this 
requirement.  Now we had a letter in volume 1 page 43 – 4316. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Volume 1? 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 185 of 213 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Volume 1. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  4316? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It is a … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  4316 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Volume 1 for the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Got it. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Chair this is a letter from the former 
Honorary Minister Malusi Gigaba who was at that time the Minister of 
10 
Public Enterprises. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  This correspondence is addressed in 
the context of this consternation that I made mention of earlier of 
saying the impact that it was becoming app arent that this specific 
(indistinct) was going to affect how Transnet all along have been 
evaluating its bids.  So I think it will probably that one reads at least 
the first two paragraphs of that letter because what – what is – because 
I do not know should I read that or should I summarise as per my slide?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Whatever works best but I think it is 
20 
appropriate we place the letter fully on record with reference to the 
date it was issued … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And the subject matter as per the heading 
line. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 186 of 213 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay.  This letter is from the Minister 
of Public Enterprises dated 7  December 2012. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Addressed to the then Chairperson of 
the Board Mr Mafika Mkhwanazi.  The subject is the Preferential 
Procurement 
Policy 
Framework 
Act 
and 
the 
Locomotive 
Fleet 
Procurement.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It reads thus: 
“There 
are 
a 
number 
of 
unresolved 
issues 
10 
pertaining to the extension of exemption to State 
Owned Companies from Regulations 2.2 through to 
eight and so forth.”  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  “I believe that these issues 
can have a material impact on the ability of 
Transnet 
to 
extract 
optimal 
commercial 
developmental and transformational value from 
strategy procurements.  Given the situation …”  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you – you are reading the first paragraph 
20 
of that letter? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is the first paragraph …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  This letter Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 187 of 213 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Second paragraph. 
“Given the situation I am personally engaging with 
the Minister of Finance to resolve these issues and 
I am confident we will co me to a mutually agreeable 
outcome. 
 
In 
the 
meantime 
Transnet 
should 
continue to procure as if the extension to the 
exemption 
is 
in 
place. 
 
In 
addition 
no 
communication should take place between the SOC 
and National Treasury pertaining to the PPPFA until 
the situation has been resolved.”  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  “Should any queries be 
directed 
to 
the 
SOC 
from 
National 
Treasury 
regarding the PPPFA please refer National Treasury 
to my office.” 
So the import of this letter as is a pparent from those two paragraphs 
was that the Honourable Mr  (indistinct) operate as if the exemption is 
still in place in the sense and I think in particular you see in the last 
paragraph – you know – I must read that because that is where the 
issue is.  Let us just read that third paragraph.  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  “I am aware that Transnet 
is anxious to proceed with the procurement of the 
1 064 locomotives.  With regard to the instruction 
note relating to the invitation and evaluation of – 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 188 of 213 
 
based on a stipulated minimum threshold for 
(indistinct) production content for the (indistinct).”  
This Chair is the same Practice Note that we spoke about earlier on.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of July 2012? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Of July 2012. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  “Transnet should not – 
should procure taking the designation of thresholds 
into account meaning indeed you must have a 
requirement for local content and production.”  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So effectively saying apply it in the meantime?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Apply … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do not ignore it? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Do not ignore it.  Now the next 
paragraph is an important one. 
“However Transnet should not feel constrained by 
Section 5.1.2 of the Ins truction Note and should 
rather establish an (indistinct) framework that 
provides reasonable incentives to suppliers to 
support 
our 
(indistinct) 
and 
transformation 
20 
objectives.” 
Clause 5.1.2 of the Practice Note is the one that said:  
“Those bidders that mee t the threshold must be 
evaluated on a 90/10 basis.”  
So in this paragraph the Minister is saying do not feel obliged or 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 189 of 213 
 
constrained by that Clause 5.1 to apply a different framework that will 
optimise what are benefits that at - Transnet at that stage envisaged to 
derive when they apply a 60/20/20 formulation.  Now the view that we 
(indistinct) with due respect to the Minister as noble as maybe the 
intentions might have been but he is not having the authority to 
override the law and prescribe any criteria t hat is not part of the 
Instruction Note.  So to the extent that the RFP then did not comply 
with the agreement that RFP was irregular as it offends the principle of 
(indistinct). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And if you – you may confirm that Treasury 
10 
Notes issued by Treasury derived (indistinct) from the PFMA?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The PFMA, correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then that – the RFP was issued with a 
different scoring framework.  Instead of 90/10 they went for 60/20 – 60 
price, 20 SD, 20 B-BBEE … 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As appears at your slide 43. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So with regard to the previous ones that we were 
20 
dealing with there was no reference to this local  content requirement at 
all? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct because remember the 
previous… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 190 of 213 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Transaction there have been the – 
you must remember 95 …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  But 95 occurred when the Practice 
Note was not in place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  100 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Like you said earlier on required this 
… 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Practice Note was already in  place.  
So it ought to have been … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  But the - the question that Chair 
asked earlier … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  To say whether when we were dealing 
with 100 whether other RFPs …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Did they have (indistinct). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  If the Chair can go to slide 43. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 191 of 213 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Slide … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Slide 43? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  43. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The Chair will note that on stage 3 …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Indeed local content was factored in.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Local production 55 per cent for 
diesel and 60 percent for electric.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  You may proceed. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So that – those were our findings on 
that part of the RFP. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And you conclude on that topic at slide 4 4 to 
point out that Transnet did not have the authority to deviate from the 
provisions of the Instruction Note?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  But they did nonetheless?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  They did nonetheless. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  You may proceed with your presentation.  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay.  The next slide this slide just 
in terms it deals with the changes to the evaluation criteria.  The tender 
specifications for 1 064 in particular – I think – it was Annexure K it 
detailed the specifications order that the bidders must comply with.  It 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 192 of 213 
 
is called Bo-Bo and Co-Co Chair.  Bo-Bo and Co-Co simply refers to the 
type of an axle of a locomotive, alright.  You must arrange with 
Mr Callard.  He is the one who explain ed this to me the (indistinct).  In 
a sense a Bo-Bo is two axle because it is A-B so that is two.  Co-Co is 
three axle that is where C comes from.  So it is Co -Co.  So there is – it 
is not like it is some cartoons or some – so it is Bo-Bo for a two axle 
and Co-Co for a three axle.  So that is what the bidder can submit 
either a Bo-Bo or a Co-Co. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So we should not take Bo-Bo and Co-Co to be 
characters in some cartoons?  
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is what I am saying. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  I take note. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now in response to that again indeed 
the – the bidders responded by submitting either a Bo -Bo or a Co-Co.  
Now in a case of the required – the bids were for electrics – 599 
electrics and – sorry - it was for electrics and for diesels.  Now on the 
electric bidders the table that you see there is an extract from the 
functionality evaluation that was conducted by the CFET technical 
because there was a CFET technical and CFET finance.  So the 
technical were evaluating the functionality.  In terms of the criteria only 
20 
those that need 80 percent functionality would progress to a next phase 
of evaluation.  If you cannot do that it means then you are incapable of 
providing what which Transnet required.  Now on the Bo -Bo was to 
show that indeed it was a requirement of the RFP.  The team evaluated 
all the submissions.  This table is a result of them evaluating Bo -Bo.  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 193 of 213 
 
Five bidders met the 80 percent threshold only (indistinct) was 72 
percent.  There was a Bo -Bo.  In the same box other bidders - in the 
same bid – other bidders would have had both.  So they also evaluated 
Co-Co submissions.  Now in this instance CNR only submitted a Bo -Bo 
submission.  Which is why if you look at the results on page 46 CNR 
joined (indistinct) in not meeting the requirements.  In actual fact it was 
(indistinct).  They did not submit a Bo -Bo – sorry – a Co-Co proposal.  
Now during that process when you review documents we are advised 
that Supply Chain Services advised the team that Transnet no longer 
requires Bo-Bo submissions.  They must only consider Co -Co 
10 
submissions.  So therefore exclude Bo-Bo bidders when you progress 
to the next stage.  Not that led to a situation where at CNR who only 
submitted a Bo-Bo could not progress to the next phas e of evaluation. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Huh-uh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the requirement not earlier that each bidder 
should submit both Bo-Bos and Co-Cos? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And/or. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh it was and/or. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And /or. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  In – in actual fact on the diesel side 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI: 
 
Bidders 
submitted 
Co-Co 
submissions. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 194 of 213 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Only? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Only without any Bo-Bo submissions 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  And they proceeded …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  To the next level.  So in this instance 
the only person who could not proceed was CNR because they did not 
submit any Co-Co proposal. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I think you are – what you said about a minute 
10 
ago seemed to me to suggest that there was a change of rules?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Just talk to that again. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I must have missed something.  I want to understand 
that. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Alright.  The CFET – because this 
advert on the minutes of a CFET it says that a decision was taken by 
Supply Chain Services.  They got memorandum from someone at TFR 
that only Co-Co submissions must be considered and exclude Bo -Bo 
20 
submissions.  So therefore when evaluate (indistinct) you have done 
this evaluation but do not progress any person with a Bo -Bo because 
Transnet has taken a decision to procure only Co -Co submissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so initially the – in terms of the request for 
proposals … 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 195 of 213 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may – as a bidder you may submit a Bo-Bo or a 
Co-Co or both. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Or both, correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and then at a certain stage before the evaluation 
exercises either started or finalised at a certain stage that rule is 
changed that requirements is changed?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is now said only the evaluation bidders – 
bidders bids must be evaluated only in relation to Co -Cos? 
10 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So if you submitted a Bo-Bo or Bo-Bos that means 
you are disqualified now?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct.  In actual fact Chair that is 
what is important.  The fact that the CFET at (indistinct) evaluated 
Bo-Bo because at that stage the rule was not changed.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Because otherwise they would not 
have  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
20 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Even bothered to evaluate the  Bo-Bo 
submissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So the rule was changed after …  
CHAIRPERSON:  After the evaluations? 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 196 of 213 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  After the evaluation at least of the …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Of some of the …? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Of the functionality …  
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the functionality? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So – but subsequent to that the rule was 
changed to say have no regard to …  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Bo-Bo, 
CHAIRPERSON:  A Bo-Bo? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Only have regard to Co-Cos? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So which meant that if you had been – you had 
submitted a Bo-Bo or Bo-Bos then you would not proceed? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct.  As it is apparent on this 
table … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That indicates that CNR at the 
bottom … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Got zeros? 
20 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It got zero because there was no 
submission to be evaluated from them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The rules are changing. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Rules are changing.  Yes, okay.  Proceed.  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 197 of 213 
 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Now the conclusion is similar to 
obviously the – similar that we arrived at for 95 is that it was irregular 
for Transnet to deviate from the prescribed specifications and the 
criteria that was stipulated in the RFP because it then deprived 
Transnet of a benefit of evaluating all competitive bids because in 
terms of the RFP it did requ ire all those that passed 80 percent to be 
assessed now on price.  Now here we are as Transnet.  Now we do not 
have the benefit of actually seeing if maybe CNR would have been the 
one of cheaper – I would not say (indistinct) – but it is that opportunity 
which was deprived of us in view of the fact that there was now this 
10 
change in the (indistinct) because I mean the bidders submit their bids 
in line with what is contained in the specifications.  Now if you 
(indistinct) change the rules of the game it affec ts the whole motion of 
fairness and competitiveness of the procurement process.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is there and document that perhaps sheds 
light on the reasons for the change introduced by Transnet that they no 
longer desire Bo-Bo but will confine themselves to Co-Cos? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On the documents that you peruse 
that reason is not apparent but I know for a fact that during our 
interviews as well we did bring this to the attention of Mr  Jiyane was 
20 
the Chief Procurement Officer and asked him  really why as procurement 
– you are Chief Procurement Officer.  A change in the evaluation 
criteria at this late stage is surely irregular.  What was the reason?  He 
said that is (indistinct) that I cannot (indistinct) say.  I must just double 
check what did Transnet – but I know he made mention of a CEO or 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 198 of 213 
 
somebody who then said in actual fact having thought of the matter he 
thinks the Co-Co would suitably be better a product for Transnet than 
Co-Co. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Than Bo-Bo? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Than Bo-Bo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELL:  Yes.  It is getting on in the day.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It has got – it has got to be a Bo-Bo. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  So that – that was the first feature of 
unlawful change of evaluation - of an evaluation process that you speak 
10 
of? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Then moving on then with your slide 
presentation. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  This now again is the change that 
occurred when there was an evaluation of the financial  offers or the 
bids - the financial component of the submissions and if - there is a 
CFET Report Finance …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That appears on EXHIBIT BB4B page 
20 
644.  This is a document that was used by Mr  Callard in his tes timony. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It shows that there was this Transnet 
Board approved – (indistinct) approved criteria for (indistinct) the total 
cost of ownership.  Total cost of ownership is one of the sub elements 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 199 of 213 
 
within price but what we must indicate is that this criteria was 
(indistinct) approved by the Board.  It must (indistinct) appear on the 
RFP document itself. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  But they had to seek the Board 
approval before they could make so.  This is the – the table on slide 48 
indicates that particular scoring for various elements – price, TCO, the 
various schedule terms, (indistinct), contractual compliance.  Now we 
note from the report that the team that was evaluating had challeng es 
in evaluating the total cost of ownership.  They alleged that different 
10 
bidders they could not compare apples with apples by certain bidders 
on maintenance – as an example – you schedule maintenance.  Others 
must unscheduled maintenance and all this.  N ow again the team then 
opted to introduce alternative methods of evaluating this element.  If 
you look at …  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Before you go to that.  You indicated that the 
TCO was Board approved?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  It was - TCO and how it was 
evaluated was a Board approved criteria.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay but you indicated that it did not find 
20 
reflection in the RFP itself?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  In the RFP they did not necessarily 
flash out the various elements of TCO which is why (indistin ct) to first 
get the Board approval to say these are the – these are criteria that we 
are going to use for TCO. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 200 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Have you considered the – whether any of the 
elements of the TCO were required to be catered for in a bid …  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Look … 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Even if they did not come under the heading 
“TCO”? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  There was – there was reference in 
my recollection to the issue of (indistinct) speaks to maintenance 
issues.  There was reference which is why in actual fact the bidders 
were able to respond to the elements that speak to this item.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So you are saying even if the Chair were to 
10 
accept that perhaps the TCO could not be imposed on the evaluation 
process as it was approved because it was not previously shared with 
the bidders.  Insofar as maintenance is concerned the bidders were 
required to caterer for that (intervenes)?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That is correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  (Indistinct) that item was evaluated 
… 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Because the bidders knew – what is 
20 
that – that they need to – to submit. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  You may proceed. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On this slide Chair you have got  
three scenarios that were there.  There is another one on top.  I is all 
the elements of TCO.  If you use (indistinct) one you are (indistinct) 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 201 of 213 
 
TCO as approved all the elements irrespective of the confusion that you 
might have.  You will note – as an example – that there will be – this 
was from bidder one to seven – they scored differently when the Board 
approved TCO was used.  Also number two they excluded scheduled 
maintenance – sorry – unscheduled maintenance and bonus points.  
They changed their – their points differ.  Scenario three, when they 
exclude those the unscheduled maintenance and the scheduled 
maintenance and a bonus point again.  It was an impact on how the 
bidder fairs.  Now again a change in evaluation criteria at this time of 
evaluation it was our view that it was irregular because more so if such 
10 
change has an effect of affecting the scoring that a particular bidder 
would have.  What we know as a matter of fact now that scenario three 
in actual fact was the one that was eventually adopted moving forward. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now scenario three was the one adopted?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Scenario three is the one that was 
eventually used. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The effect of that was do not evaluate bidders 
on scheduled and non-scheduled maintenance? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Notwithstanding the fact that the RFP required 
20 
them to cost for that maintenance?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  (Indistinct). 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  As that cost would translate to Transnet as 
part of the total cost of ownership?  
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 202 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Did that result in any advantage to a 
particular bidder or did that or on the other hand unduly prejudice a 
particular bidder? 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On the face of it Chair if you look at 
this slide bidder seven if you use scenario one tops internal scoring at 
least for this element.  It has 14 points.  Whereas if you use scenario 
three that bidder they are no points allocated for it for this particular 
element.  Obviously as we – we – you know – in investigation we did 
realise that – because we did an exercise of saying if we – because it 
is never just about one component.  
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  There is another component called 
delivery schedule – to say if – because after you say Schedule 3 that 
bidder fell off, bidder number seven, it was never, it never progressed 
to further stages.  We then tried to apply the results of scenario one to 
a total score, we can confirm that from the lo ok of things in any event 
that bidder would not have progressed, but the point that he made in 
our report was that it doesn’t matter, don’t look at the outcome, focus 
first on irregularity, the fact that the irregularities would not have made 
any difference in the outcome should not be an issue, because it is 
20 
bidders who are unsuccessful who most of the time will be the ones 
that will raise queries, and surely in our procurement such bidders as 
well they are entitled to procedural fairness in evaluation.   
 
It doesn’t matter whether eventually they are going to win the 
bid or not, the principle is that changing evaluation mid -stream again is 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 203 of 213 
 
an irregularity, irrespective of the fact that that would have changed the 
complexion of the outcome. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELL O:  The means don’t justify ...(intervention)  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The means don’t justify the end.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, yes you may proceed. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So that is the point that we made 
on this particular (indistinct) onc e again there seem to have been a 
midstream change in the evaluation criteria.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, can we proceed? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  We can proceed.  Leaving for 
10 
another issues of evaluation, the issue of (indistinct) Chair resurfaces 
on this matter, I won’t go through that, by now we are now quite familiar 
with the requirements. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  We must confirm that when the 
bidders at stage three submit their bids at least on the face of it they 
seem to have complied, so there seems to be no issue with the bidders 
compliance, with at least this 5.1 of the practice note.  However during 
the negotiations the post-tender negotiations as they were called and 
as they are termed in terms of the Transnet PPM , three of the – 
20 
because as you can imagine during negotiations prices were going up 
and down, various issues were introduced, (indistinct) and all that.  
When we analyse the spreadsheet and Mr Callard in his testimony he 
made reference to those spreadshee ts, when we analyse those 
spreadsheets the figures that they used for to denote foreign content, 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 204 of 213 
 
input content as they call it and the content changed from the figures 
that were there at the beginning.   
 
The results thereof was that three of the four OEM’ s fell short 
now of the prescribed local content threshold, in particular CNR instead 
of meeting the (indistinct) they were now on 37.57, Bombardier and 
CSR were required to be at 60%, those are the figures that they had as 
it appears on page 51, only GE m et the requirement and that exercise 
Chair is contained in the slide 52, which we used to calculate that local 
content.  These figures were taken from the spreadsheet that the 
negotiation team was using, and we confirmed as well that it is these 
10 
figures, because obviously  we had to first check it is not maybe a draft 
version which may be seen at a later stage, we were able to check and 
confirm the prices that appeared on the spreadsheet directly to the 
contracts that contracts that eventually concluded wit h the OEM, so 
that then gave us an assurance that these are spreadsheets, these are 
the figures that informed, that eventually formed the basis of 
(indistinct).  Based on these figures then indeed it confirmed that, and 
applying obviously the formula because it’s not a (indistinct) you just 
apply the formula as prescribed in the practice note that tells you how 
you must determine local content and that’s how we got information of 
20 
the non-compliance. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now if you just go a slide back to your 51, 
when this result obtained that during negotiations CNR fell below the 
minimum threshold for electrics, no for diesels, and Bombardier and 
CSR insofar as electrics are concerned also fell beyond the prescribed 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 205 of 213 
 
threshold what ought to have happened at that junction? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  At that juncture these bidders 
ought to have been disqualified because at this – this happens before 
award, these bidders ought to have been advised that you are no longer 
meeting the prescribed minimum threshol d so we cannot proceed 
further, it is either (indistinct) negotiation and they ought to have then 
at least then adjusted their figures or if they couldn’t then we shouldn’t 
have proceeded with them because there was no question and we could 
have then gone to the second highest bidder to engage with them to 
ensure that at least that second bidder complies with the requirements 
10 
and also then meet the commercial offers that Transnet was 
comfortable with. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, and we know now that CNR, Bomb ardier 
and CSR nonetheless went through and succeeded.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  The were awarded contracts. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That’s correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Notwithstanding that result. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That’s correct Chair.  When I 
spoke earlier about the engagements that we were having with the 
20 
OEM’s this is one of the issues that we are addressing with them Chair.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay then if you may proceed.  Start from the 
new topic now. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  This is a new topic Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes, we have your slide 53. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 206 of 213 
 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Slide 53? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  The purpose of the slide, we will 
go into the detail but the Chair must just note that when there was an 
increase in the ETC from 38 to 49 one of the cost elements was an 
amount of R2.7billion called batch pricing, I will take the Chair through 
what batch pricing is, we must just note why we are talkin g about this 
issue why are you making ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  2.7billion? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  R2.7billion Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you said million. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  This one Chair I know it’s billion.  
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s been a long day. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  2.7billion Chair is one of the cost 
items that contributed to an increase in the ATC, but for us to 
understand this concept we must first go to Volume 2, page 4552.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  4552? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  4552. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Just for orientation purposes that 
20 
is part of ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  One second.  4552 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  4552 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On volume 2? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Volume 2. 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 207 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair, is that part of a document starting 
at 4524? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Volume 2 ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it written questionnaire on the middle column?  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes the first, at the top of the page it has a 
table. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  This document is part of 
10 
essentially the RFP, the RFP document that was issued by Transnet for 
the electrical locomotives, but similar provisions are contained as well 
in the diesel.  What I just want to bring Chair’s attention to 
...(intervention)  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  May I just for the record indicate the RFP, this 
particular RFP you speak of, of which 4552 is a part starts at page 
4524?   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Is that correct? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Yes. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you, you may proceed. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Under clause 3.1 of that 
document titled seven year GFB locomotive delivery schedule.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  There’s a table there that 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 208 of 213 
 
indicates on top delivered at – different dates for delivery periods, 
2014/15 up until 2019, at the bottom it s hows the quantity of 
locomotives 65, (indistinct) and 44, totally 599, now the narration that 
explains this clause, the first bullet, Transnet requires flexibility in 
accessing options for the acquisition of the locomotives.  These options 
may include suspending or postponing a delivery of the locomotives 
until a later date, or changing quantities.  Transnet however does not 
expect to pay a price premium should it access any of its options, that’s 
what it says here, is that the event that we decide to chang e quantities 
as Transnet we do not expect to pay a price premium.  We juxtapose 
10 
that with the second bullet. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  At 4553? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Transnet reserves the right to 
terminate the locomotive acquisition program or any part thereof at any 
stage during the seven year period should circumstances so dictate.  
Therefore Transnet isn’t obliged to acquire the full amount of the 599 
locomotives.  Bidders are therefore required to provide break pricing 
for each of the stages indicate d below should Transnet decide to 
terminate the acquisition process at any of its stages and then there’s a 
table that indicates there are different that the bidders must price to 
20 
say in the event there’s a break in here 2914/15 when the 65 
locomotives what will be the price per locomotive, so they will just 
complete that bottom column to indicate how much would the price per 
locomotive be, depending on the point where Transnet decides to 
terminate the program after their agreement has been concluded.  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 209 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So that’s what at least was 
provided for in the bid documents.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then if we start with you second bullet 
point and we talk of the notion of break pricing that would arise only in 
circumstances where there is a live contract?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct Chair. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So the parties first contract and in the course 
of execution of the contract Transnet then seeks to amend either the 
timeframes, the quantities or vol umes of delivery, in that instance the 
10 
bidders would be entitled to charge a break price?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  A break price, if (indistinct) to 
break or terminated the program in any of those particular years with 
the applicable number of locos at that particular time. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay we understand the notion of break price.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct, but what was important 
for us is this break pricing we flagged the previous bullet that spoke of 
the fact that in the event that Transnet decides to change quantities it 
should not pay a price premium. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Now on that score that on the first, on what 
20 
point does the first bullet point anticipate Transnet changing the 
quantity of locomotives is it before or post contract conclusion? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  A reading of this clause indicates 
that obviously this is before the contract is concluded, whereas the 
second bullet it indicates if in year four or five we decide to terminate 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 210 of 213 
 
what would be the applicable pr ice per locomotive at that stage, so it is 
clear that this provision could only have kicked in at the time when the 
agreement was live.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay by this provision is the break pricing?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Correct ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay, you may proceed. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Just to confirm as well on page 
4548 ...(intervention)  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Of the same volume? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Of the same volume. 
10 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That’s Volume two? 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Volume two Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  4548? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  4548.  The bullet that I want to 
draw (indistinct) those bullets they start on the previous page being 
Clause 12, being disclaimers. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And we are still in the RFP? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Still, this is all contained in the 
RFP. 
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  On paragraph 12, on 4547, 
respondents are hereby advised that Transnet is not committed to any 
course of action as a result of its issuance of this RFP, and/or its 
receipt of a proposal in response to it, in particular please note that 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 211 of 213 
 
Transnet reserves the following rights.  Now we want to go to the one 
on page 4548 being ...(intervention)  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Overleaf? 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   Overleaf paragraph 13.8 and 
13.9, it reserves the right to award a contract for only a portion of the 
proposed goods which are within the scope of this RFP.  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, did you say ...(intervention)  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  13.8 of 4548. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay ja, 4548 ja, that’s where I am.  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  So Transnet reserves the right to 
10 
award a contract for only a portion of the proposed goods which in the 
scope of this RFP. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  And is that – Chair we’re at 4548, you’re 
reading 13.8 at the top of 4548?  
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:   
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  Transnet has the right to split the 
20 
award of the contract between more than one supplier, so already at an 
RFP stage Transnet reserve the right that it may decide in as much as 
the RFP envisaged the full 599 diesel being awarded to one supplier 
but it at least reserved the right to split the award between more than 
one bidder, that was clear at RFP stage and this being clear as well 
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 212 of 213 
 
remember as well when this happens, it will speak to the award, which 
ordinarily would reduce the qualities (indistinct) that bullet tha t we read 
earlier on, it said it doesn’t expect to pay a price premium should there 
be a change in quantities, so at the stage we know when you got the 
RFP that this is what Transnet contemplates.   
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  So then let’s try and understand that  
stipulation that prior to contracting Transnet reserves the right to 
reduce the number of locomotives that it eventually acquires, read that 
with the disclaimers that you’ve just pointed the Chair to, the sum 
effect of – would this understanding be correc t, that I am going out as 
10 
Transnet on a tender for 599, if I eventually decide to award 299 and I 
split it amongst various bidders none of the bidders may penalise me 
for that decision, is that the sum total of it?  
MR TSHIAMO MICHAEL SEDUMEDI:  That’s correct, that’s the sum 
total, if you get that first bullet that we read earlier on about the price 
premium. 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Okay.  Right yes Chair it’s been drawn to my 
attention as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay we will adjourn for the day and then as 
arranged we will – how long do you expect to be with him still?  
20 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  I should be done Chair by lunch, then the next 
witness can do the afternoon session.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, can do the afternoon session.  
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, we will start at nine tomorrow morning.  
28 MAY 2019 – DAY 100 
 
Page 213 of 213 
 
ADV MAHLAPE SELLO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 29 MAY 2019
