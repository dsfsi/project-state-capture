MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thank you. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you start Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to – yesterday I referred to part of the 
evidence that was given by Mr Themba Maseko. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before this commission when I noted Mr Sundaram’s 
evidence in his statement [excuse me] which was to the effect that I 
10 
think Mr Atul Gupta said that he could get any national or provincial 
minister to come to the breakfast… 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  The breakfast briefing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Briefings. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  That is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That they held.  I said I seem to remember that Mr 
Themba Maseko gave evidence to the effect that in his meeting with Mr 
Ajay Gupta Mr Ajay Gupta told him that he or they that is the Gupta 
family could get any minister to or could call any minister – I just want 
to – I think I did find the… 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  The reference? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The reference and I just want to – to read it so that I 
do not misrepresent. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What Mr Themba Maseko said.  It is at paragraph 28 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 4 of 127 
 
of his statement which is at Exhibit E1. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph – page 18 of Exhibit E1 before this 
commission.  Before paragraph 28 Mr Maseko deals with the fact that 
he explained to Mr Ajay Gupta how things worked in regard to 
advertisement from the government side.  Then he says at paragraph 
27 and 28: 
“He dismissed by explanation and proceeded to tell 
me that my job is to go and identify, collect and 
allocate all the communication budget amounts in the 
10 
various departments to his company.” 
Paragraph 28 that was 27:  Paragraph 28 he says: 
“He, that is Mr Ajay Gupta then told me that I should 
let him know if any department or minister gives me 
any problems and he would deal with them directly.  I 
asked him to elaborate and he told me that he will 
personally summon and deal with any minister who 
does not cooperate in this regard.” 
Then he says: 
“I then objected to the way he was talking about 
20 
ministers in such derogatory terms.  He seemed 
oblivious to the point I was making and emphasised 
that he could deal with any minister who did not co-
operate.” 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 5 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the part that I was interested in is the one where 
Mr Maseko said Mr Ajay Gupta said he could personally summon and 
deal with any minister. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who did not co-operate. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I just wanted to make sure I am not… 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes to place it on record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Misrepresenting what Mr Maseko said. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes thanks you may proceed. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Thank 
you.  Mr Sundaram will you please turn – look at Exhibit CC1[a] and [b]. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  We go back to your main 
statement again. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  At the part – you have covered 
all of the evidence that is in paragraphs 1 right up to 17 and this 
morning we – I would like to refer you to paragraph 18 where you deal 
20 
with the SABC archive deal. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could you just tell the 
Chairperson what was your understanding of this deal? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Um. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 6 of 127 
 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry you referred to paragraph 18? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Paragraph 18, 18. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of his statement? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Of his – yes of his main 
statement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  It is got a sub- heading. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Ja I found it. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  You found it.  Okay thank you. 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Chairman so this was a deal that I got to 
know of when I was in India and Mr Laxmi Goel said that they had a 
very sweet deal for archives because that was one of my worries when 
you set up a station you need archives to start with otherwise you know 
especially when you are – when you have an [indistinct] where you 
have rivals who existed for many years.  So they had a very reversed 
archive.  So that was one of my worries.  So what Mr Laxmi Goel said 
was that the Gupta brothers and Mr Nazeem Howa have had a very 
sweet deal with the SABC where about 100 hours of footage would be 
given at throw away prices. What he described as peanuts that we get 
20 
that at peanuts and he said one of my immediate priorities would be to 
hire an archivist a professional archivist who could take that footage 
which was on analogue with SABC and convert it into a digital format.  
And he said that should be done as soon possible you know with the – 
that Nazeem would have the editorial team from the TNA sat down and 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 7 of 127 
 
make a list of all the archive historical value that is required.  Also 
contemporary footage – footage for instance of the Marikana incident of 
recent news makers like Julius Malema for instance and all of that list 
was created by Mr Nazeem Howa with the editorial staff at the TNA.  
And this was given out to a person called Rahul Singh.  Now Rahul 
Singh was an archivist who has many years of experience had come 
from India.  He is currently the Chief Archivist at the India Today Group 
which is one of the largest television networks.  So he was asked to go 
with what are known as mini DV tapes because the – and go to SABC 
over a period of about a month and record for about eight hours footage 
10 
that was there and get that back to the office. Over the weekends he 
would digitise it which is basically taking it from tape and putting it on 
a server so that it could be used for broadcast.  Now this was a little 
surprising for me because the SABC was set to launch its own 
television station and we were potentially a rival for that station. For 
them to at that point take a policy decision to give a huge supply of 
oxygen to a potential rival through this archival footage was something 
that came to me as – you know I was very puzzled about why they 
would do it.  Also I was told by Nazeem in discussions you know so he 
would boast about it that you know this is a deal that he got done 
20 
through his influence that they did not have to pay a lot of bribes it was 
done oh well taking people out for a meal or buying them drinks.  
Because just the name of the Gupta’s that they are behind it and the 
fact that the whole world knew that they had the blessings and the 
backing of the President would make things very easy for them.  So he 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 8 of 127 
 
was very excited about the fact that he had got such a brilliant deal.  
What was also making – you know when we had conversations in the 
executive committee or otherwise was the fact that he said they are so 
stupid that they have given us a deal where – which involves two parts.  
One was the actual purchase at a price but also every time that ANN7 
used that footage there was some royalties to be paid to SABC.  But 
they did that without having an effective system in place which could 
monitor how many seconds or minutes of the footage was being used.  
So his assertion at that time was that they are stupid because they do 
not have that monitoring system and it is entirely up us.  We may have 
10 
used say one hour footage over a month but we will you know disclose 
that we used about a minute and pay for a minute and get away with 
the – or even say that we did not use anything.  There is no way that 
the SABC could then know what it was.  You know how much footage 
was used.  So – so – so over a period of time this is how it happened 
you know. So Rahul would go over with a bunch of tapes every day to 
the SABC office.  There would be an edit system that would be given to 
him to copy the footage. The footage was then very neatly since he is a 
professional archivist he would metatag the whole thing.  He would 
categorise it under various you know political, sports, historic archives 
20 
and keep it there and also what he will tell me is that the footage that – 
that the ANN7 had after it was acquired from SABC was much better 
organised and digitised. So it was much faster for us to use it in terms 
of breaking news or pull out the footage and put it on air – than even 
SABC at that time because the SABC archives were still on tape.  It 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 9 of 127 
 
was not on server like what ANN7 was doing from day 1  So – so the 
deal of such a nature in my understanding I have been a television 
professional now for 26 years and I can tell you is that if you buy 
footage it is sold by the second and archival footage is much higher in 
value than contemporary footage.  Also contemporary footage which 
has got very high news value for instance if it is the assonation of a 
head of state which has been caught on tape is much higher value than 
– than footage of just say a few buildings you know the parliament or 
others.  So what surprised me in this deal that there was one a bulk 
rate that was given and this rate was for archival footage for footage 
10 
that was contemporary. For footage that was buildings across the 
nation which I found was very funny.  In my assessment footage of this 
nature which is 100 hours would cost in the millions of dollars and what 
they – what they got – the rate at which they got it was something 
which was a throw away price which was something which was done as 
a favour and in my understanding and my conversations with Nazeem 
and the Gupta brothers it was done because the officials at SABC knew 
that the Gupta brothers were close to President Zuma and they did not 
want to come in the way of anything or did not want to face any 
consequences of showing any resistance.  
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So at the time when Rahul 
was visiting the SABC you were already within the country, am I right? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and you say that you had 
witnessed him going to the SABC for about a month? 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 10 of 127 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Would he come – would he 
leave your offices in the morning and come back in the afternoons 
every day or how – or how do you arrive at a month? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  You see as far as I remember we – it was 
about six years ago he would go in the morning and he would be at the 
SABC office the whole day and he would come back in the evening.  
And over the weekends all the footage that had collected he would then 
digitise that which is basically take it from tape onto the server which 
could be used for broadcast. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So – and at the end of the day he will tell 
me how many hours had already been collected and it is my 
understanding and I have confirmed this with him as well before I came 
here is that he got about 100 hours of footage from the SABC archives 
during his – during this time. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  The next witness that is 
going to testify is Mr Scott who was the sales executive within the 
SABC.  He is going to be talking to this issue. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Hm. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  But is testimony is that only 
2000 minutes was sold. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Not 100 hours.  What is your 
comment to that? 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 11 of 127 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Perhaps 2000 minutes was sold but 100 
hours was given.  100 hours was what ANN7 got. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  This is something that I know which I 
remember absolutely. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  They could have sold 2000 minutes maybe 
that is the contract that they had I would not know that but what was 
received in the archives of ANN7 which is – which was on their server 
was about 100 hours.  And this – I am is there is forensic investigation 
10 
into this – into the servers at the ANN7 I am sure you know the truth 
would come out on this. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So if you talking 100 
hours you talking 6000 minutes? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That is correct. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  So – and you are certain that 
that is what was received by ANN7? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That is correct. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and… 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Because I was getting the figures every day 
20 
and there was a tally that was done towards the end.  It was 
approximately 100 hours.  It was close to 100 hours but definitely – 
definitely more than 2000 minutes as is being suggested. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  It was close to 100 hours. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 12 of 127 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  If you say you were 
logging it daily were you logging it – how were you monitoring the 
receipt of these? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No I would ask Rahul.  Because what Rahul 
did was he on an excel sheet he would make a detail of the footage. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  A brief description of the footage. The 
number of minutes that that footage was and he would sign off on that. 
So there was – there were proper records that were maintained of this 
on an excel sheet and I was shown those excel sheets by him on his 
10 
laptop at the end of the day and that is how I knew how much was 
coming in.   And I remember very correctly, very distinctly that it was 
about 100 hours by the time he had finished with going to SABC, 
coming back with the footage. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Were you involved at all 
in the payments that were made by ANN7 to SABC in relation to this 
deal? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I was not part of any commercial deals at 
all at ANN7. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  My position was mostly editorial and you 
know in terms of the work flow and the launch. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Were you aware of any 
monies that were paid towards copy rights that is the usage of the 
footage by the ANN7 to the SABC 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 13 of 127 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I left too early.  I was told that a part of the 
contract was that whatever footage ANN7 uses on a monthly basis they 
were supposed to pay per second some royalty to SABC. But ANN7 had 
conned SABC into giving them a contract which said that there was no 
– that the ANN7 would self-declare how many seconds were used of 
SABC footage and I can tell you for a fact that there was no way to 
monitor this either at ANN7 or at SABC.  So SABC would have had to 
go over the declaration that ANN7 got and from day 1 you know I 
understand from my conversations with Nazeem Howa there was an 
intention on the part of ANN7 to give a figure that was much lower than 
10 
what was being used.  That they thought was the sweet part of the deal 
that they made with SABC. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now let us just talk about 
the monitoring after usage.  You quite correct the evidence of Mr Scott 
is going to be that he would invite them to declare and then they would 
say to him for the month of April we used seven minutes and then he 
would say seven minutes times R2000 which is what they were charging 
them for copyright.  So let us just deal with the monitoring process.  Is 
it international – is there an international way of monitoring usage and 
protecting the archival content of a broadcaster? 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Well most people who are worried about 
their copyrights and also have commercial interests like this have their 
own monitoring departments.  For instance if I have done a deal with 
ANN7 my monitoring department at SABC should actually be looking at 
every second of footage on a 24 hour basis and then billing them 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 14 of 127 
 
according to that.  Rather than waiting for the client to disclose and tell 
me which could any ways be disputed you know.  They could be under 
invoicing. They could be doing a whole lot of other things.  The best 
process in this would be to have a monitoring department which 
monitors on a 24 hour basis or like what U-tube does nowadays you 
know so 
you 
bypass human 
intervention altogether and 
have 
algorithms’ that could – which know the electronic footprint of the 
footage audio video that you have and match it against a broadcast and 
give you the exact number of seconds for which this has been used.  
There are various ways in which the use of footage can be – or use of 
10 
copyrighted footage can be monitored which are used by broadcasters 
everywhere.  And I think it was a very – you know I would think at best 
it would be a very innocent mistake on the part of SABC to agree to 
such a deal where without monitoring you are asking the Gupta 
brothers to disclose on their own how much footage they used because 
you know that was not a commercially wise decision. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Are you aware of 
something that is called the bant in code as to how that works?  And 
whether when you were here in South African whether any of the 
broadcasters that you ever dealt with used that if there was an archive 
20 
or content that they wanted to sell to ANN7? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  The only broadcaster who I know wanted to 
sell archival footage to ANN7 was SABC. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And I am not aware of this code. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 15 of 127 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Of the code yes.  So the 
criticism that you level at them is that they actually allowed the user to 
determine how much it should pay for because in essence if the user 
does not disclose that I used 40 minutes of your footage and I will 
simply decide as a user if I am a devious user that I used only five. And 
as the SABC you have absolutely no way of monitoring whether in fact 
they used forty or five? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Ja absolutely I mean that is not the way 
commercial deals are done.  You have to have you know into the 
contract you have to [indistinct] accountability.  You have to [indistinct] 
10 
a fact that there is no scope for you know for want of any other word a 
misunderstanding or a misreading of figures between two parties.  So 
there had to be in this contract a system where there could have been 
an accurate indisputable and auditable system which could determine 
how much footage was used and how much money was paid which was 
not done in this case.  Now this could be something that was done by 
somebody who was negotiating who is not really familiar with deals like 
this or it could have been done with an intent I would not know about 
that. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and they would have lost.  
20 
If you take the 100 hours that you talking about that is 6000 minutes 
there is a lot of revenue that they would have lost even if one goes 
according to the R2000 per second sale of that footage. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Hm.  Absolutely I would agree with that you 
know. This is – I mean what SABC did was exposed themselves to fraud 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 16 of 127 
 
knowingly. So why they did it is something that I would not know – I 
would not understand. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and… 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  It is not a commercial decision and what 
Nazeem Howa called it was a sweet deal so why would they give a 
sweet deal to ANN7 why I was told is because – and what they said it 
was because the SABC officials knew that the Gupta’s were close to 
the President and they did not want to come in their way or ask too 
many questions so they just gave a sweet deal to them. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and Mr Scott is going to 
10 
testify that although according the pricing guide that the SABC has they 
had to sell the 2000 minutes at R100 per minute but it was – there was 
a discount that was given to ANN7 because according to Mr Scott it was 
the biggest sale that they received from one client.  And then the 
discount that was given was R30 and therefore they had to pay R70 per 
minute. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Okay.  See I would – I mean as somebody 
who had been in the broadcast business would want to know why would 
you want to give footage at a discount to a potential rival?  If I were in 
this position and I know I am just in hindsight anybody can say 
20 
anything but I would have charged them more than what I charge other 
clients because this is a potential rival.  So they were given a discount 
and like I said footage of this nature cannot be valued on a blanket 
basis.  There is archival footage say of Nelson Mandela from the 70’s 
and 80’s which is of a far higher value than of a Julius Malema which 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 17 of 127 
 
was shot yesterday.  So you cannot say that here is a blanket claim 
that we give you for all of that.  So the valuation if you see was not 
done on any prudent basis.  It is my understanding of the thing.  And 
also if there is a rate card that they had for this footage was this rate 
card made just for this deal or is this something that existed before?  Is 
something that would be interesting to know.  But like I said a 100 
hours of footage costs in the millions of dollars and the valuation of 
that is a – is something that would require chartered accountants that 
would require professionals who would value.  You know it is like you 
go to a shop and there is antique furniture there and there is furniture 
10 
that is made today and there is broken furniture and you sell all of it at 
the same rate.  If I were to give you analogy of a furniture shop. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That is what they have done so which – as 
somebody who has been in this profession I find that a little puzzling 
you know why would – why would they do that?  Why would they do 
something like that? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. Thank you.  Maybe Mr 
Scott is going to be able to explain some of those questions that you 
are raising.  Then in paragraph 22 you deal with a visa and labour law 
20 
violations.  Could you just tell the Chairperson because we believe that 
there is maybe I will take you to that record of Mr – to that article of Mr 
Bateman as to how did you discover that the issuing of visas to some of 
the employees of ANN7 which were from India was not done according 
to the laws of the country or were done in a manner that was irregular?  
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 18 of 127 
 
What made you to be aware of that? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Well you know the – when I arrived here I 
was taken to a guest house which had Nepali national who was working 
there and not getting any salary.  His salary was given in cash in India 
and he was working there and when I spoke with him he told me a lot of 
things which you know left me thinking.  For instance he was there on a 
tourist visa.  He was not on a work permit but he was working there.  
He had to cook for dozens of people you know not just the people who 
are staying in the guest house but also the labourers would come from 
India to construct the studio [indistinct].  Now he told me about working 
10 
conditions that they were put in which were sub-human.  You know the 
labourers would come from India on tourists’ visas for staying at the 
studio Promisis while they were constructing it. There was very basic 
facilities for toilets and wash rooms. They were you know so this Nepali 
national would cook for them and take – and the drivers would ferry the 
food to those people. And also I remember Ajay Gupta and others 
complaining about how those people there a large number of them were 
coming to the New Age office to use the washrooms.  So on the one 
hand you do not provide them enough washrooms at site and when they 
come to the office you know there is a total amount of disgust that he 
20 
would talk about.  So – so those – they would sleep at site, they would 
work at site, they would be working 24 hours.  There was no labour 
laws that were applicable to those people.  And in my view you know I 
would be corrected by an expert if there is one why would – you know 
when there is abundant supply of skilled and unskilled labour for 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 19 of 127 
 
construction in South Africa why would they get these people from there 
and they were – and I was told later that Ashu Chawla through the 
offices of the President could give any number of visas to any number 
of people. So if it works out cheaper for them to get – fly people down 
by the plane loads from India to construct here that is what they would 
do rather than pay salaries here.  Mr Gupta also had a lot of 
uncharitable things to say about workers here.  He said they were lazy, 
they would work certain number of hours.  If you ask them to work 
overnight they would not do that.  They would not stay at the site and 
work so just get people from India let them stay at the site.  Give them 
10 
very basic facilities.  Give them a sack of rice to cook on site.  Give 
them – supply them some meals from the guest house and you know – 
put them in – you know I would call them sub-human conditions in 
which they were working.  So that is when I found out that these kinds 
of violations were taking place here.  Also towards the launch we had 
required a few more people because I – you know while we were 
making our strategies and plans in India we had said that we will get 
some skills from South Africa.  For instance the PCR staff was 
something that we said we will get from South Africa.  And also the 
camera people and all of those things.  But it was suddenly decided 
20 
that the production control room we could not hire anybody from South 
Africa because 1. The people that we were getting were very expensive 
according to the – to Mr – to Atul Gupta and Mr Laxmi Goel and it would 
be cheaper for us to get people from India.  Also certain critical 
positions they want the controls with them they did not trust South 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 20 of 127 
 
African Nationals or journalists to take those positions.  So the 
production control room and the video [indistinct] are being one of 
those issues.  And the idea then was to get a whole lot of people very 
quickly from India before the launch because they did not want to hire 
from South Africa and I was very resistant on that.  I refused to sign on 
any of the documents which would get - for the number of people from 
India because I thought that was – you know – it was not required.  We 
had a number of people in South Africa who could do that job. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Hm. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So my decision – they overwrote my 
10 
decision and Mr Laxmi Goel in India appointed a lot of people many of 
whom were sent here on visitor visa to work here before the launch and 
that is something that I could do nothing about because – you know – I 
did not sign off on that and most of them came here and I was a 
witness to the kind of violation that was happening in this.  In that case 
also the same thing happened.  Mr Ashu Chawla was given a list of 
people who were to be brought from there.  He would contact – you 
know – be in touch with the President’s Office, would be in touch with 
the Home Department and immediately – you know – within a day or so 
the visa’s would be issued and the – plane loads of people would come 
20 
here and start working.  I have complained … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  About this as well. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and then – so when you 
realised that this was happening am I correct that then you wrote to – 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 21 of 127 
 
after you left South Africa … 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  You raised this with the 
Department of Home Affairs? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Oh that is correct.  So I wrote them two 
mails – you know – a mail and a follow up mail but I am – you know – 
very disappointed that it has been six years I have not got a single 
response from the Home Department seeking more details or seeking 
any extra information about the complaint that I gave them. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Even – you know when – I mean I am 
digressing a little bit.  Even at the SABC when my book came out – now 
the details are there – I was told that the SABC Board had constituted a 
forensic investigation into the averments that I made but to date it has 
been over a year since that Committee was set up.  I have never been 
contacted to give out any details or any of that – you know.  So that is 
– that leaves me a little disappointed – you know.  It is almost like – 
you know – for six years I have been fighting a lone battle and I have 
had no support from the teams the departments that are supposed to 
investigate these charges.  So … 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I want to place that on record. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Maybe just to deal with 
the – with the Home Affairs issue first. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Huh-uh. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 22 of 127 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  If you have a look at CC – 
EXHIBIT CC1D Mr Chairman which is the lever arch file submission by 
Mr Apleni. May I draw your attention to page 207?  In fact starting from 
210 – I beg your pardon.  That is where your emails are – 210.  Have 
you found it? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Oh, thank you.  Now that first – 
if you – if you just one page back you will find another email at 209 and 
that is dated 6 September 2013. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Huh-uh. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  But it seems to me that the one 
that is dated – that appears at 211 is dated 4 September.  Am I right?  
Is that the 4 t h or 14 September – 2-1-1? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  2-1-1? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I think in the printing there has been an 
error … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  But I would go with what was on the 
original.  You know – I think it should be the 4 t h. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  It looks like the 4 t h to me as 
well.  Yes, so are these the emails that you directed to the Department 
of Home Affairs? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And I see that you had copied 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 23 of 127 
 
on the emails some of the recipients there Mr Apleni and you have got 
a whole list of other people? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Where did you get these 
addresses? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I went on the website of the Home 
Department and I – you know – they have got a whole lot of office 
bearers and their email IDs that were listed. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So I put a complaint to each of the office 
10 
bearers and also to the Head there.  Now I knew that – you know – 
there could be a dispute later on.  So what I did was to also mark a 
copy of this complaint to various journalists. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Hoping that if – you know – that it will be 
taken by the media and there would be some pressure on the 
department to investigate these charges but like I said I am not aware 
of any investigation that has happened.  I was not involved in any of 
that. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and you in the email that is 
20 
at page 209 you make mention of certain people where you say – you 
suggest that their visas were issued in a manner that was not regular. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and could you just read 
into the record maybe start off with or maybe because it is a short 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 24 of 127 
 
email.  Maybe if you could just read that email. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So this is … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  At page 2-0-9. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Oh, 2-0-9. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And this is dated 6 September 2013 at 
08:33 am.  So this is addressed to all the officials at the Home 
Department and the journalists that I have also marked on this. 
“Dear Sir, I am pained to note that despite my 
complaint to you a few days ago I have got an 
10 
acknowledgement from you.  I would also like to 
report that Infinity Media shareholder Atul Gupta 
and Laxmi Goel have started a large scale cover up 
operation to hide the tracks of the visa fraud they 
are perpetrating.  (Indistinct) of the dozen of Indian 
labourers have quickly left South Africa many Indian 
nationals who have come on business visas are 
also been asked to stop reporting to work after I 
made my complaint to you public.  I fear they will 
be sent back to India as a means to destroy 
20 
evidence.  You can still probe the issue by 
discreetly seeking details from the editorial staff 
about the work done by the internationals who came 
in 
on 
business 
visas. 
 
These 
include 
Sanjay Pandey, 
Vishnu Shankar, 
Anand Prakash, 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 25 of 127 
 
Shamin among others.  The delay in probing the 
matter has already given time to Mr Gupta and 
Mr Goel to destroy evidence and cover their tracks.  
I hope you will acknowledge my mail and start to 
probe at the earliest, Rajesh Sundaram.” 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  As you are 
aware as we conveyed this to you on Sunday that Mr Apleni has 
actually put the document that shows that there was in fact an 
investigation into your complaint. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Huh-uh. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Do you accept that? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I am not aware of that because I was never 
informed of it. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  My emails went unanswered.  There was no 
response that I got at any time. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Maybe before we go to report 
maybe just to mention that you had complained and Mr Barry Bateman 
20 
… 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Also took the matter up with 
Home Affairs. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes, yes. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 26 of 127 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And his email appears at page 
208 and he is – he is a journalist of Pretoria Correspondent Eyewitness 
News and then his letter – his email of – that appears.  It is dated 
9 October 2013 and he had addressed the email to Mr Ronnie Mamoepa 
of the Department of Home Affairs and he was raising the issue that 
you had complained about the matter and the department had – had not 
attended to it. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Are you aware of that? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I am seeing this letter for the first time. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  The email for the first time? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Alright, okay.  So he – he took 
the matter up and then in that email he – if you read the very last 
sentence. 
“The following people have been working …” 
If you read that he has listed some of the people that you listed in the 
previous email that you read.  Could you just read those names out? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Which page is this? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Sorry – page 2-0-7 still. 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  “Dear Ronnie, I am just following 
up to confirm that you are on top of this.  I have 
since our chat yesterday spoken to Mr Sundaram.  
He has confirmed that not a single person from the 
department has responded to his complaint nearly a 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 27 of 127 
 
week after he sent it to senior officials in the 
department a DG and DDG and several others.  It is 
worth noting that Sundaram sent a follow up letter 
to the above mentioned people in which he said he 
had become aware of a cover up.  Despite this the 
department still had not reacted.  Sundaram has 
raised 
concerns 
that 
department 
officials 
are 
complacent in these visas irregularities which could 
explain the department’s lack of urgency.  The 
following people have been working at ANN7 as 
10 
editorial staff.  However they are alleged in the 
country on business visas.  These visas were 
arranged through Sahara Computers.  Please check 
the 
visas 
and 
of 
course 
the 
names 
are 
Anand Prakash, 
Sanjay Pandey, 
Deepak Kaushik, 
Shamin Hussain, 
Vishnu Shankar, 
Y P Singh, 
Ravi Puri and Sunil Kumar.  Please check the visas 
that were issued to these people to confirm whether 
they are business visas or work visas.  My deadline 
for 
this 
information 
is 
midday. 
 
Regards, 
20 
Barry Bateman Pretoria Correspondent Eyewitness 
News and the details.” 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you and there is 
another email that you had to send after you had viewed on TV a 
response by the former Minister of Home Affairs Dr Naledi Pandor. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 28 of 127 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  What – what happened that 
time?  You listened and you saw what the Minister had respond – was 
responding to Parliament. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  And I – I did not listen to what she said but 
I had read a few media reports about what was being said and I knew 
that there was much more to the – to the investigation than what was 
being reported.  So then I had written saying that – you know – the 
10 
other aspects should also be investigated about this. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  If you could just turn to 
page 2-1-4. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  That is what Mr Apleni has put 
up.  In fact maybe Chair if I could just take Chairperson to 2-0-1 
because that … 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  2-0-1? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  2-0-1 yes.  It is a submission. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and you can – that – that 
says feedback report on the media complaint that in the immigration 
status of foreigners employed by Africa News Network – ANN7.  Do you 
see that? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 29 of 127 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And then they were providing 
the Minister with feedback. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And in the second – on the 
second page – page 2-0-2 … 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  You will see that the list of 
names that came from Mr Bateman’s list in the email and also 
incorporating some of the names that you had on your list … 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Huh-uh. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Those persons are listed there. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And then there is a discussion 
that - they deal with a discussion in the matter but I would like you to 
just look at what their findings I would imagine were because in 
paragraph 6 what do they say there – at page 2-0-2? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM: 
 
“On 
further 
investigation 
Inspectorate discussed that 31 foreign nationals are 
on intra-company permit.  However one of these 31 
has already resigned and left the country.  Our 
20 
mission in New Delhi has been contacted to ensure 
that the permit is cancelled.” 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and then if you turn over 
the page what do they say in paragraph 7? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  “The other nine foreign employees 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 30 of 127 
 
are on visitor visas with a condition of attending 
business minutes.  Three of the nine have already 
left the country.” 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and they attach those 
passports and then maybe we should just read - it is not to – it is not 
too long because then I will take you to the relevant pages. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Sure. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes to deal with them.  Okay 
and then paragraph 8. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  “The employer indicated that they 
10 
intend keeping the others six foreign employees.  
As a result the employer has approached the 
department and made a request for a visa of the 
requirement 
for 
work 
permit 
and 
should 
the 
department approve they will make an application 
for these employees to be issued with critical skills 
permits.” 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN 
SC: 
 Yes 
and 
then 
the 
next 
paragraph. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  “The media complaint referred to 
20 
eight foreigners and the employer confirmed four.  
Namely 
Anand Prakash, 
Sanjay Pandey, 
Deepak Kaushik and Vishnu Shankar.  According to 
the employer three of these four have already left 
the country and the Inspectorate has confirmed that 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 31 of 127 
 
Sanjay Pandey, 
Deepak Kaushik 
and 
Vishnu Shankar left the country on the 5 t h and 
6 September 2013.” 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN 
SC: 
 
Yes 
and 
then 
the 
last 
paragraph. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  “The employer mentions that the 
other 
four 
namely 
Ravi Puri, 
Shamin Hussain, 
Y P Singh and Sunil Kumar were consultants sent 
by Essel Media and have since left the country.  
The Inspectorate is still awaiting their full details 
10 
from the Mission in India in order to confirm if 
indeed they have left the country.” 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  At page 2-0-4 they have 
recommendations.  What do they recommend to (intervenes)? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  If – if I may add also. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  There is a bit of a – you know – a factual 
error here because I remember that Ravi Puri and Sunil Kumar were not 
employees of Essel Media but they were employees of a company 
called STV which is owned by the brother of Mr Laxmi Goel. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So they were not – to the best of my 
knowledge I remember that they were not employees of Essel Media but 
they were employees of STV. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you and then if you 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 32 of 127 
 
turn over the page they have recommendations there. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  “Recommendations.  The following 
recommendations 
are 
made 
based 
on 
the 
discussions about:  that the Minister take note of 
the contents of this report.  Foreign employees on 
visitor’s visas be ordered to leave the country and 
be allowed to apply for the correct permits from 
country of origin.” 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and that was signed – the 
person’s name that is put under there – the signature – under 
10 
signature? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Mkuseli Apleni. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and the designation? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Director-General. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN 
SC: 
 
Okay 
and 
then 
the 
recommendation was approved and the person who signed is the 
Minister of Home Affairs? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes who is that person? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  It is Ms G N M Pandor. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and the date? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  The date is 21/09/2013. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So would you then accept 
that there was an investigation that was done immediately after these 
complaints because your complaint is dated 4 September/6 September 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 33 of 127 
 
… 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And by the time you wrote in 
October an inquiry – an investigation had been done. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  However informal it was but it 
had been conducted. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  It had been conducted … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  But I think I should have been given a – you 
10 
know – a say in this – you know – they should have asked me because I 
have given them – you know – the few inaccuracies that have come in.  
Also – you know – these are the names that I remember of the editorial 
staff.  There were a whole lot of other labour – labourers would come in 
there, the construction workers, the skilled/unskilled people.  That has 
not been part of this investigation which is something that I mentioned 
in my complaint as well.  So – so what they have done here is that they 
have selectively used certain elements.  I was not part of this – you 
know – I was never contained for my views on this – on my complaint 
but a whole lot of the others who had come … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did they ever acknowledge receipt of your complaint? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did they ever write to you … 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Never. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or communicate with you in anyway? 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 34 of 127 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  It has been about six years now.  I have not 
received any … 
CHAIRPERSON:  And … 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Acknowledgement or any – anything from 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And it is only when you were preparing for giving your 
evidence here that you got to know that something … 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was done even though it was – did not cover 
everybody that you had complained about and … 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does not appear to have been adequate? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you and I referred you 
yesterday to page 2-1-3 – if you recall where your name appears as 
item number 31. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  You recall that? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  I would like you to go to 
page 2-1-4. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  There as you can see there are 
names there that are highlighted in red. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 35 of 127 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And there is – there seems to 
be a page missing but – but it does not because it is a continuation 
from 31.  I beg your pardon.  So if you look at – there are one, two, 
three, four names that are highlighted in red.  Could you just read 
those names and read what they are – the nature of their visas and 
also read what the comment is right at the end – that is the last column 
– the fourth column – the fifth column? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So item number 33 … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Is Anand Prakash.  There is a passport 
number which is given. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Visitors visa issued on 14/08/2013 with the 
condition for business meetings valid for 30 days – expired. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  He was a studio director.  He was not there 
for meetings.  He was actually a studio director doing work in the PCR 
switching videos. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and had they contacted you 
20 
before conducting this investigation you would have given them that 
information? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Absolutely.  I would have done that. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you and then the 
next name? 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 36 of 127 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  36, Sanjay Pandey.  His passport number is 
given and visitor’s visa issued on 12/08/2013 with the condition for 
business meetings valid for 90 days and it is valid and left the country 
but he was not there for business meetings.  He was actually the one 
who coordinated the whole production for the launch and he was also 
taking care of the overall PCR operations while the launch happened. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  So he was actually working at the Midrand 
Office. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And then number 38? 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Deepak Kaushik, visitor’s visa issued on 
14/08/2013 with a condition for business meetings valid for 30 days, 
expired left the country.  He was also working during the launch. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Are you able to tell whether 
they left before you left the country or after you left? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  They left after I left the country. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  After you left the country? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then the last 
one? 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Vishnu Shankar, they have got his passport.  
Visitor’s permit issued on 12/08/2013 with the condition for business 
meetings valid for 60 days – 60 days yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Valid, left the country.  He was part of the 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 37 of 127 
 
output test there.  He was clearing scripts.  He was making rundowns 
and – and he was doing editorial work in violation of the visa that he 
was issued. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So as far as you are 
concerned even the information that is here is unreliable? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I would say that – you know – because we 
had a newsroom full of journalists who knew what these people were 
doing. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  If they had gone not to me but any of the 
10 
people working at that time at ANN7 they would have known that these 
people were working there.  They were not there for meetings.  They 
were not there for any other purpose – not as tourists – but they were 
actually actively working in the newsroom … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  In violation and I would want to state here 
as well that I did not sign off on these appointments.  I did not sign off 
on any of these people coming and working in South Africa. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  This was put before me and I had 
20 
categorically said I would not do it. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you and then lastly 
if I may just take you to page 365 or maybe this is a parliamentary just 
for authentication purposes.  If I may just take the Chairperson to page 
359. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 38 of 127 
 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  369? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  3-5-9 – 3-5-9 Mr Chair.  3-5-9 
yes.  It is just towards the end of the bundle.  Are you there 
Mr Sundaram?  Found it? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Okay, thank you.  That is – that 
document has a logo Home Affairs Department and it is written 
submission and then subject – what is the subject there? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Parliamentary Question Number 2490 
National Assembly:  written reply – Mr GBD McIntosh COPE. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and what is the purpose of 
that? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  To provide Minister with a draft response 
attached as Annexure 1 – the Parliamentary Question 2490 (NA) for 
consideration and approval. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and if you go to a – and 
then it is the page that has got signatures.  If you go to page 361 there 
is a recommendation there. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN 
SC: 
 
And 
what 
is 
the 
20 
recommendation? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  “It is recommended that Minister 
approve 
the 
draft response prepared 
by 
the 
department in respect of Parliamentary Question 
2490.” 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 39 of 127 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and it is signed by the 
Director-General? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Director-General on 3 October 2013. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And it appears to have been 
approved by the Minister on which date? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes.  On 6 October 2013. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and then there is a huge 
list.  I am sure it started with the Chief Directors, Chief Admin Clerks 
but at page 363 then we get to see what the actual question 2490 that 
was posed by Mr McIntosh what – what the question was. 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Okay.  Could you just read that 
into the record please? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  On which page is this? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Page 3-6-3. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  2490. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  2490, yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Ja. 
“Whether her department will take any steps with 
regard to allegations details furnished that some 
20 
staff members from India were employed illegally 
and without work permits by Africa News Network 7.  
If not what is the department’s position with regard 
to a, this matter and b, other whistle blowers who 
bring similar occurrences to the attention of a 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 40 of 127 
 
department.  If so what are the relevant details?” 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you and then if you 
turn over the page at page 364 that question as you can see there is a 
stamp that appears to be from Parliament. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Do you see that? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  At the bottom of that page 
dated 17 September.  No I think this is the copy that was received by 
the Commission.  I beg your pardon – received from the Commission 
10 
from Parliament and it is marked 2980 but I would like you to go to 
page 366 because that is where a reply is given by the department to 
the question. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Mr Chairperson we can confirm 
that this appears to be incomplete but it is indeed complete.  We had 
received it from Parliament.  Yes, thank you and the reply – what is the 
reply to the question that is already read at page 366? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
“The Department of Home Affairs acted immediately 
20 
on the allegations that Africa News Network 7 had 
employed foreign nationals without proper work 
permits.  It was alleged in the complaint received 
by the department that eight foreign nationals were 
employed by ANN7 without proper work permits.  A 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 41 of 127 
 
parliamentary investigation – a preliminary …” 
Sorry. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM: 
 
“A 
preliminary 
investigation 
conducted by the department confirmed that eight 
foreigners were in possession of visitor’s permits 
and in the country legally.  The condition of the 
permits allowed them to attend business meetings.  
The department also discovered that four of the 
eight foreigners had already left the country and the 
10 
remaining four were found to be conducting training 
for employees but they were not on the payroll of 
ANN7.  Despite the fact that ANN7 did not consider 
them 
to 
be 
employees 
since 
they 
were not 
remunerated for such an activity the department 
found that the four persons who violated the 
condition of their permits and were therefore 
ordered to leave the country.  The department has 
confirmed that they all have left the country.  The 
department understands that whistle blowers raise 
20 
concerns so that those concerns can be addressed.  
Any person who would like to raise concerns about 
similar occurrences is encouraged to call the 
department hotline on 0800601190 and they can do 
so anonymously and are also not expected to prove 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 42 of 127 
 
the allegations.” 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN 
SC: 
 
Yes, 
thank 
you. 
 
The 
Chairperson asked you whether you were ever contacted by the 
department after you had filed your complaints.  Maybe it is – it would 
be proper for me to refer the Chairperson to a submission that 
Mr Apleni has put up and his explanation about your correspondence.  
If I may just refer the Chairperson to page 1 – it is a letter – it is a 
submission but framed in the form of a letter addressed to the 
Chairperson – to the Secretary of the Commission.  Page 1 of that.  You 
just have to – right – right at the beginning. 
10 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Page 1? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Are you on page 1? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  As you can see it is addressed 
to Mr Pedlar who is the Acting Secretary of the Commission.  In 
paragraph 4 of that could you just read briefly what he says there? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  “I wish to state upfront that I do 
not 
know, 
have 
never 
met, 
received 
any 
correspondence or ever spoken to any Gupta family 
member of associates.” 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and then in paragraph 8 he 
deals with the correspondence there.  That we have dealt – we have 
dealt with your emails … 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Those dated the 4 t h and 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 43 of 127 
 
6 September.  What does he say about him not receiving those emails? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  You want me to read that? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Okay. 
“In this case according to the information provided 
to me by the department in particular from the DGs 
Office 
the 
emails 
dated 
the 
4 t h 
and 
6 September 2013 were never received.  Based on 
this response I have requested a confirmation from 
the Department’s Information Technology Section 
10 
which indicates that they have reviewed my email 
account and could not find the mentioned emails.  
In this case I wish to refer the attention of the 
Commission to Annexure 4 attached herein for ease 
of reference.  Therefore the only email which my 
then office received was that of 9 October 2018 and 
the view of the office was that the matter was 
already closed since the report by the Inspectorate 
was already concluded.  In this regard I wish to 
state that the said email of 9 October 2018 was 
20 
never brought to my personal attention.” 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  Then in 
summary of your evidence about these employees who had these visas 
which would be legally obtained in a manner in fact confirmed some 
who have left the country.  Do you know of any of these employees who 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 44 of 127 
 
are still within the country? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No, not aware.    
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You got a chance to read Mr Apleni’s documentation 
in regard to what the Department of Home Affairs did, is that right? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    I have not read the whole thing, I have 
gone through the summary, the relevant portions of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well did you come across anything that suggest 
that the investigation that the Department of Home Affairs did entailed 
doing something against or about those other than the employees other 
10 
than the employees from India who may have facilitated the breaking of 
the law in regard to their employment?  Did you come across anything 
that suggested that the Department had done something about this, had 
reported it to the relevant authorities or Department of Labour or the 
Police or the National Prosecuting Authority, did you come across 
anything like that? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    In my reading I’ve seen they’ve talked 
about the employees but what action they’ve taken against the 
employer for violating the visa norms is something that I do not know.  
They do accept that there were people working on work, on visit visas 
20 
and business visas here, but that purely is a violation of the law, but I 
would also like to say that  you know as a whistleblower in this matter 
the fact that I was never contacted to get information because I had all 
the information about these people, ANN7 would say that they were 
here for training or for business meetings, but the fact that they were 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 45 of 127 
 
not I was not consulted, and I am also surprised that you have a 
newsroom full of people who are working with them, none of those 
employees at ANN7 were also contacted during this investigation, so I 
find that a little puzzling. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, there are no statements from those employees 
whether they just attended meetings or they actually worked or 
anything like that. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Also the people who worked in the 
newsroom, for instance Vishnu Shankar was there clearing scripts, so 
you can ask any of the journalists who were working at that time 
10 
whether he was working or he was there attending meetings.  There 
would be multiple people in the newsroom, they would say that he was 
making run-downs, he was working in a shift there, you know if you give 
him the morning shift he would come in the morning shift or evening 
shift, he was working there in the newsroom, and there are dozens of 
witnesses to that, none of whom I think were contacted as per my 
reading of this.  It was an investigation that was conducted (indistinct) 
of natural justice not followed because you know if I’m the complainant 
and I’m the whistleblower I should have been contacted to give more 
details, I was always willing to do that, and it was me who went out of 
20 
the way to write news while I was also doing other work in India, to 
persuade them to do this investigation and when I come here to South 
Africa and it was the first time I know that there’s been an investigation 
and these are the details. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hmm, okay, thank you. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 46 of 127 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  There’s 
just something that we didn’t deal with yesterday that relates to how 
ANN7 was allocated the slot by MultiChoice. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Could you just briefly just tell 
the Chairperson as to how that happened? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Well they were very adamant about a 
particular number, now I have written that number in the book and I 
need to refer to that. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Maybe if I could just refer 
10 
the witness instrument to page 66 of your book. 
CHAIRPERSON:  66? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    I will just quickly refer. 
 
Yes.  Ja, the slot that they wanted was 404 because that was a 
prime slot that was between two existing news stations, and the Gupta 
brothers feared that DSTV was somehow inimical to them and they 
would give them a slot which is not with the news channels but 
somewhere else where it would be difficult for people to find it and that 
would affect their ratings, so – but I found DSTV to be extremely 
20 
professional in their conduct, they would want technical details, they 
would want to know you now whether ANN7 has actually started a 24 
hour dry run which is never the case before the station actually 
launched.  ANN7 went 24/7 on broadcast the day it was launched.  
Before that they would do a few hours and then wind it up because 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 47 of 127 
 
none of the equipment or all of the equipment that was required for a 
24 hour operation had not come in.  Like I said before even the studio 
robotic cameras came in the last minute and were being installed on 
the day of the launch. 
 
So there was a whole lot of lying which we were required to do 
when we went to the DSTV meetings you know, so especially Mr Y P 
Singh who was the technical, he was looking at the technical 
installation and the integration at that time he would be asked to go to 
those meetings and with a straight face he would have to tell them lies 
about how we were at a very advanced stage and that we were already 
10 
doing 24 hour news bulletins and all of that. 
 
Also I was told on multiple occasions that they would use the 
President’s office to pressure DSTV to give them the slot that they 
wanted which is 404, and this is something that I was told repeatedly 
and we had multiple meetings with DSTV at their office and at every 
time the level of progress or you know the installation technology the 
information that we were giving them was all wrong and we were, many, 
many days, many weeks behind schedule. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you, then if you may 
then go back to our statement, you have dealt with Home Affairs. 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And at paragraph 27 you deal 
with certain payments that were made, can you just tell the Chairperson 
what is it that you want to convey in paragraph 27 and 28 please, at 
page 4 of your statement. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 48 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say paragraph 27 and 28? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  That’s correct Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of his statement? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Of his, yes, thank you page 4.  
Have you found it? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:   Page 27? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, what are you saying in 
those paragraphs? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Well you know that many of the expenses 
were paid in cash in (indistinct) in India, for instance the person who 
10 
designed and fabricated the set was paid in Indian Rupees by Mr Laxmi 
Goel, I was a witness to that.  Also wads if thousand Rupee notes were 
handed out to the person who did the look and feel of the station, which 
is basically the graphics and the graphic templates for the on-screen 
graphics that were there.  He was paid in cash in front of me, in Delhi 
and also you know going back to the previous point where he said that 
a lot of employees that were not paid, they were working gratis on 
business visas, that is not true because most of those people before 
they came here were paid in cash by Mr Laxmi Goel in India, their first 
month’s salary and that’s why  they  came here so there would be no 
20 
records of them having any banking transactions between ANN7 and 
them here because they were being paid cash in India. 
 
Also there were many of the employees like for instance the 
labourers 
who 
came 
here 
to 
construct 
the 
studio, 
also 
the 
housekeeping, the Bali National was working there, they were all paid 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 49 of 127 
 
in cash in India.   
 
So this is something that I know is a clear violation of the tax 
laws in India.  My understanding of the tax laws in India is that if you’re 
paying anything above 5 000 Rupees it should be done either through 
an electronic transfer or through a cheque, you cannot have cash 
payments and this is something that was happening there with the 
sanction of the (indistinct).  Mr Laxmi Goel was giving this cash you 
know at his office and this was something that the Gupta brothers here 
knew, which Nazeem Howa knew and they were okay with, because 
these employees were coming from India and you know on records here 
10 
it would be like no banking transactions between ANN7 and them but 
they were actually being paid in India for the work that they were doing 
here.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:   So this again is something that I did not 
approve of at that point. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Mr Chairman 
that concludes the evidence on the statements of the witness, if I may 
just at this point address the Chairperson on the affidavits of Mr 
Williams which he submitted yesterday, which is the exhibits which are 
20 
placed before the Chairperson this morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe before you do that Mr Sundaram you may or 
may not have covered this but I just want to check that you have 
covered it, in paragraph 23 of your statement, page three thereof you 
one, two, three, four, five, six, what appears to be sub-paragraphs up 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 50 of 127 
 
to seven, in paragraph five, no, in paragraph four you say: 
“Atul Gupta also told me that a large number of these 
employees would be brought in on tourist visas and made to 
work for a few months.  If they are not found suitable they 
could be dismissed and sent back.  Work permits would be 
issued later to those who proved their worth.” 
Paragraph five you say: 
“When I questioned Atul Gupta about the legality of making 
people work on tourist visas he said ...” and then you quote:  “I 
have the government in my pocket, you don’t worry about what 
10 
is legal and what is illegal.” 
Did Mr Atul Gupta say that? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:    Yes he did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you are sure about that? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:   Absolutely, I am yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  And then in your book at page 46 you talk 
about, you write about discussions relating to the Waterkloof landing 
incident. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Hmm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you say, and I will read quite a bit: 
20 
“Atul spent a lot of time justifying the Waterkloof landing 
incident which happened just days before our arrival at this 
first meeting.” 
And then you quote and I think you are suggesting that this is what 
Atul, Mr Atul Gupta said: 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 51 of 127 
 
“Our family is close to President Zuma, we have never hidden 
it.  We are a powerful family and I am sure all the hype around 
this landing will also pass with time.  We land at airforce 
stations in India all the time, so what is wrong with landing our 
guests at an airforce base here with all due clearances.  We 
are being targeted.” 
And then the last paragraph of that page you quote him as having said: 
”President Zuma knows our family well and we have deep 
bonds with his family.  We have enough influence in the 
government to clear our name and it is not just President 
10 
Zuma, we have close links with all senior ANC leaders.  We 
are (indistinct), we are Indian Jews, we do not keep all our 
eggs in one basket.  Whoever becomes President of South 
Africa in the years to come I can assure you he will be our 
friend.” 
Did Mr Atul Gupta say what you say he said in this page? 
“ 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Oh yes he said these things multiple times 
you know because immediately after we had arrived here, that was 
around the time when the Waterkloof incident then happened and some 
20 
of the people who had come from India were a little worried whether 
they took a wrong decision and this was in some senses, although not 
directly said by him, but this – in some terms to reassure the people 
who came from India that look you don’t need to worry, it would seem 
like you know when you read in the media that we are in a lot of 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 52 of 127 
 
trouble, but we are not, we’ve got you know great friendship with the 
President, and he said multiple times that we’ve got the government in 
our pocket.  Now that’s something that he would keep repeating, like if 
I asked him about the visa violations he would say oh we’ve got the 
government in our pockets, you don’t worry about what’s legal and 
what’s not legal, so this is something that he would keep repeating post 
the Waterkloof incident, especially if he found somebody a little worried 
about you know all the media, the negative media that the Guptas were 
getting you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mmm, mmm. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Sorry Mr Chairman it has been 
brought to my attention that it is quarter past eleven. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes maybe let’s just finish one or two others that I 
want to check with Mr Sundaram. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think you did cover this yesterday in regard to 
suggestions of presenters, you say at page 108 of your book: 
“Nazeem and Atul also had a list of presenters sent by 
President 
Zuma, 
this 
included 
former 
Government 
spokesperson Jimmy Manyi.” 
20 
Did you, is that true? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  That is true yes.  I want to add that you 
know this was something that was recommended by President Zuma in 
one of the meetings, you know when they were asked about presenters 
I very distinctly remember President Zuma telling Nazeem that you 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 53 of 127 
 
know he thinks Jimmy Manyi would be a good presenter and that he 
should be considered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  We will take the tea adjournment and just have 
a look at one or two things that I just want to check whether – do you 
confirm that? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will take the tea adjournment now, and resume at 
twenty five to twelve. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS  
10 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to draw – to check something.  Mr 
Sundaram.  I am sorry.  In – at page 82 of your book you – you say the 
following somewhere in the middle of the page like Laxmi I hope I 
pronounced the name correctly. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  He I think that is Atul – Mr Atul Gupta because 
even the previous sentence you talk about him. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say:  
20 
“Like Laxmi he blamed the media for playing up the 
incident.  He claimed his family had the required 
permission to lend the jet and in the same breath he 
mentioned the proximity his family enjoyed with 
President Zuma and his family.” 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 54 of 127 
 
And then you quote and you attribute this to Mr Atul Gupta and I guess 
I will see in your supplementary affidavit which codes you regard as 
proper codes or where you meant to just make the point and did not 
mean to say that is what the person said word for word.   
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You, you say and you quote and you say: 
“Atul Gupta said President Zuma is on our side.  He 
knows our family and we helped him when he was 
down and out.  He will help us through this as well.  
You know top ministers of the Zuma cabinet attended 
10 
the wording. This is a direct endorsement for us.  
The personnel against whom action has been taken 
will be reinstated very soon.  We are an influential 
family here and no one can point fingers at us.” 
Atul boasted.  I did not read this to you before did I? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I did not read this before? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  No you did not Mr Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Now did Mr Atul Gupta say this to you? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes he did. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have no doubt about it? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No he said this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Absolutely. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You have got it in quotes could it be that it is not 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 55 of 127 
 
word for word but he made these points or is it what he said word for 
word? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  This is not word to word. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  But this is something that he has told me 
many times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Or well the interactions over the months 
that I working there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well you see there – there are two parts in this 
10 
passage that attract my attention.  The one is that according to you Mr 
Atul Gupta said that President Zuma is on our side he knows our family 
and we helped him when he was down and out.  He will help us through 
– through this as well.  Now what attracts me to that is that earlier this 
year one of the witnesses who have given evidence before me Mr Fikile 
Mbalula he is a member I believe of the National Executive Committee 
of the ruling party the ANC and at different times has been Minister and 
Deputy Minister in President Zuma’s government.  He is a – he has 
been appointed at Minister recently as well.  When he gave evidence 
before me one of the things he said was that in a certain NEC meeting 
20 
of the ANC the question of the proximity of President Zuma to the 
Gupta family was raised and there was concern that that friendship or 
alleged friendship between them was damaging the image of the ruling 
party and the image of the government.  And Mr Mbalula said Mr 
Zuma’s response either on that occasion or on other occasions and 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 56 of 127 
 
maybe it is not but Mr Mbabula maybe it is another witness I am not 
sure now or maybe it was Mr Ramatlhodi I cannot remember but one of 
the – one of the witnesses said who attended who was a NEC member 
said Mr Zuma when asked why he was not terminating his friendship 
with the Gupta family he said that that family had helped his children 
when nobody else could help them.  I think in terms of employment.  So 
I just find it interesting that you say that Mr Atul Gupta said President 
Zuma is on our side he knows our family and we helped him when he 
was down and out.  He will help us through this as well.  So I – that is 
one of things that attracted me.  The second one is that you say Mr Atul 
10 
Gupta said the personnel against whom action has been taken will be 
reinstated very soon.  Now you must just tell me what personnel were – 
was he talking about there?  I think this was in the context of the 
Waterkloof landing if I understand what you say in the book? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was he – what was Mr Atul Gupta talking about 
when he said the personnel against whom action has been taken will be 
reinstated very soon.  We are an influential family here and no one will 
– can point fingers at us. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Well this was around the time when the 
20 
Waterkloof incident was being investigated and there were a few 
officials who had been – there was some action that was taken against 
them and they were if I remember correctly were either dismissed or 
suspended from service.  So you know so this was the time and a lot of 
the people who had come from India were getting a little anxious about 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 57 of 127 
 
the Waterkloof and if you know the kind of impact it would have on the 
family.  So he would boast and tell us on multiple occasions that 
whoever – you know – of course in the short term the would have to 
show that there was some action that was taken that some heads have 
rolled.  But he said those do not worry about them they will be all 
reinstated.  That you know he will use whatever influence is there that 
anybody who helped him will not face any consequences of their action 
and that they would be reinstated at a better position at a future date.  
Now I would not know whether that happened but that is something that 
he would talk about.  That he would ensure that anybody who faced 
10 
action because they helped the Gupta family during the Waterkloof 
incident will not – you know they may have – be facing consequences in 
the short term but in the long term that will be happy they did it 
because they would be rewarded for it with much higher positions and 
you know the family would help them.  Use their influence to get them 
out of whatever punitive action has been taken against them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So this was in 2014?  You were in South Africa in 
2014? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No – 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2013? 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay well I – the – Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those investigating the issue of the Waterkloof 
landing. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 58 of 127 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes Mr Chairman 
CHAIRPERSON:  Need to check.  I seem to remember that in the media 
there were suggestions that somebody or certain people who were said 
to have been blamed for the Waterkloof landing were promoted or were 
given certain positions that did not seem to be in line with disapproving  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Disapproving the action. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Their alleged role. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it will be important for the commission 
investigators to have a look and see also whether such – if whether 
10 
there were any promotions or reinstatements such as I talked about.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Here which Mr Sundaram is talking about and when 
they happened. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For example we know which – which months he was in 
South Africa when – if his evidence is true that Mr Atul Gupta said this 
we need to check whether in fact something along those lines seems to 
have happened. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. Thank you Mr Chair we 
20 
have noted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you very much.  Thank 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 59 of 127 
 
you.  Mr Chairman the one thing I forgot to do was to hand up – was to 
ask that the book be given an Exhibit number? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Might I ask that it be marked 
Exhibit CC1[f]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe we should get a … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  We will mark it for the 
Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  We should get maybe a clean copy because… 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  A clean copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja a clean copy. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  I do have. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and you will mark it. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you will mark it Exhibit  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  I will mark it Exhibit CC1[f]. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay that is fine. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you very much.  Thank 
you.  Mr Chairman the one aspect that I would like the Chairperson to 
deal with the affidavit of Mr Williams.  It – various paragraphs he 
makes mention like paragraph 11 of CC1[e].   
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 60 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Williams. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes CC1[e] 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes at paragraph 11 if I may 
just direct the Chairperson to those paragraphs.  Paragraph 11, 
paragraph 18 and 19 but if you start with paragraph 11.  This is what he 
says at page 7 paginated page 7.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Who is his – this was handed up? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  This was handed up… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Today so I do not know anything about it. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  This is Mr Moegsien Williams. 
He is one of the implicated persons. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  He is one of the implicated persons? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes he did not respond during 
the time allowed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  He simply – this we received 
yesterday. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  When the commission had 
20 
started leading the evidence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what is it? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  What – it is an affidavit.  There 
is no notice of motion. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 61 of 127 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  He makes it clear in the 
affidavit Mr Chairman that he does not wish to cross-examine Mr 
Sundaram.  He also makes it very clear in paragraphs 18 and 19 that 
he does not wish to come and testify before the commission. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  The legal team has taken a 
view depending on what the Chairperson’s direction is going to be that 
in the light of the fact that he does not wish to come he does not wish 
to cross-examine Mr Sundaram then Mr Sundaram must be afforded an 
opportunity to respond to his affidavit in writing should the person – 
10 
Chairperson direct so.  Or the other alternative of course would be that 
these matters that he disputes in Mr Sundaram’s evidence that Mr 
Sundaram be given an opportunity to deal with those now and in 
evidence but we are all subject to the direction by the Chairperson 
because there is no – we do not know what – he simply says I am 
placing this before the commission but he denies most of the evidence 
of Mr Sundaram.  But he does of course admit one meeting where the 
President was present at the President’s residential home – official 
residence and that is the meeting of the 22 June 2013.  And he says it 
might very well be that it is that meeting but what he disputes is 
20 
whether at that meeting matters that related to editorial policy and 
everything else were discussed.  So… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja well if – if she does not want to subject herself to 
giving evidence if that is what she says. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  If I may read it – 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 62 of 127 
 
paragraph 11 Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Paragraph 11? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes page 7.   
“I have in the circumstances anxiously considered my 
position in relation to the notice.  I will not make 
application 
to 
cross-examine 
the 
witness 
but 
nevertheless wish to submit this affidavit and request 
the commission its legal team and the investigators 
10 
to consider what I set out herein.” 
And then in paragraph 18 and 19: 
“I submit that the evidence of Mr Sundaram is not 
true and his evidence ought to be properly tested 
with a view of determining the credibility and veracity 
of the allegations he makes.  It is doubtful that 
cross-examination of the witness will be allowed in 
the circumstances and I will therefore not apply to 
cross-examine the witness.” 
In paragraph 19. 
20 
“I accordingly do not wish to assert my right to cross-
examine and do not apply to cross-examine Mr 
Sundaram.  I have confidence in the evidence 
leaders and that they will present all relevant 
evidenced to the commissioner and that such 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 63 of 127 
 
evidence would be presented to the commission 
fairly and objectively.” 
And lastly paragraph 20 Mr Chairman. 
“For the reasons set out herein under I also do not intend 
to give evidence before the commission for the following 
reasons. 
1.  I have not done anything improper and have not 
committed any crimes. 
2. I have most certainly not committed the offences of 
corruption and fraud or participated in such offences 
10 
in any way whatsoever. 
3. I am not in possession of any evidence which may 
assist this commission to make any conclusive 
findings insofar as the commission’s terms of 
reference are concerned.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well have you had a chance to reflect on the 
usefulness of this affidavit? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  The – it is useful in the sense 
that  
He has made mention of certain areas which he believes that we could 
20 
investigate.  First of all he denies that the security at the President’s 
official residence is as lax as Mr Sundaram had testified.  And he 
points that security records would show that he is in fact correct in that 
regard.  And secondly he says he refers to a certain agency that says – 
that where he says that that agency could assist the commission in – in 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 64 of 127 
 
getting more information.  Then that – to that extent it would assist the 
investigators to follow up on those leads.  It is for that reason that we 
believe that it will also be prudent for Mr Sundaram to actually sit down 
and deal with his affidavit in writing and maybe file a supplementary 
affidavit dealing with all the matters that he alleges in this affidavit.  
Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But that would have to happen at some stage because 
Mr Sundaram is leaving today or… 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  That is correct.  He is leaving 
today. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  But we will monitor that 
Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  We could monitor the 
submission of the affidavit.  Mr Sundaram could attend to it speedily 
and then 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And then we will make sure that 
it gets submitted quickly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But did you say there are certain aspects that you 
would prefer to… 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 65 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  To give him a chance to deal with. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  That is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us deal with those that you can deal with. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the affidavit can be made available to Mr 
Sundaram and he can respond to it but whatever it is that he can deal 
with now let him deal with it. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Let him – thank you.  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What he cannot deal with because he needs more 
time then will have to be dealt with at a later stage. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr 
Chairman.  Mr Sundaram may I just take you to paragraph let me just 
see turn the page. – sorry.  At paragraph 8 if you go to paragraph 8 of 
Mr William’s – that is Exhibit CC1[e].  Do you have it? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  In paragraph 8 oh 
sorry, sorry this is work of the commission it deals with him complaining 
about the notice.  But I would like to direct you to paragraph 30 I beg 
your pardon.  In paragraph 30 this is what Mr Williams says: 
“I held this position which is the position of the 
20 
editorial director in independent newspaper which he 
deals with in paragraph 29.  I held this position until 
September 2012 when I took up the position as the 
editor of the New Age Newspaper.  In June 2017 I 
reached retirement age and I retired at the age of 65 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 66 of 127 
 
from my position as the editor of the New Age 
newspaper.  I had in the interim also served as the 
Editor in Chief of the television news channel ANN7.” 
Do you know the period when Mr Williams was the editor of ANN7? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  No I do not it is after I had left from here. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and here he does not give 
us the dates as to when he took up the position, is that correct in this 
paragraph? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes that is correct. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and then if you go to page 
10 
37.  He says: 
“I considered the allegations against me in an 
extremely 
serious 
light 
especially 
that 
these 
allegations may tarnish or blemish my reputation.  A 
reputation of professional and personal integrity.  I 
have taken a lifetime to build up and which I cherish.  
It may now be destroyed as a consequence of 
allegations made by an individual who has an axe to 
grind.” 
What do you say to that? 
20 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Well I have gone through the affidavit and I 
think it is a bunch of half-truths and absolute lies and I would say that I 
stand by my affidavits and supplementary affidavit and everything I 
have said in those things.  The meetings that he is disputing can very 
well be verified by the investigators in terms of the records that have 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 67 of 127 
 
been maintained at President Zuma’s residence.  I have given dates, 
exact dates of those meetings and also you know the meetings that 
happened in July and August there are tentative dates.  It is Sunday in 
July so records there, the CCTV footage – there is a whole lot of ways 
in which these meetings can be verified.  I stand by the position that I 
have taken.  All the facts that I have given in my affidavit I absolutely 
stand by them. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  And then in – 
at paragraph 39 he says: 
“Based on what I have read it appears to be clear 
10 
that Mr Sundaram has not been very successful in 
obtaining employment after his brief tenure with 
ANN7.  That he is reliant upon the sales of his book 
and that he may well be motivated by an immense 
dislike for the Gupta family and in particular Mr Atul 
Gupta.” 
Can we pause there and ask you after you left ANN7 did you manage to 
get any employment in India and when last if you did when did that 
happen and how long did it last? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Well ever since I went back from here I 
20 
have launched two television stations in Chennai.  New Seven Tamil 
and Kalvari News and I have not been out of employment you know I 
chose to not work while I writing the book for a few months and I 
resigned from Kalvari News which is the second station I set up just 
last year in August.  That was because I had to prepare for my 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 68 of 127 
 
transplant.  I have been asked by my doctors to stay away from full 
time work for six months post the transplant and I have had no 
[indistinct] of work after I quit there.  I have also had the position of a 
consultant for the Rajasthan Patrika Group and I have worked straight 
through and the days or months that I have not worked is because of 
medical reasons or the time immediately after I came back when I was 
writing the book.  So this like other elements in this affidavit is an 
absolute lie. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and then just recently 
maybe a month ago did you do any work – were you working last 
10 
month? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Yes I was approached by the Bennett 
Colman a company which owns the Times of India Group to be a senior 
journalist to be on the panel for the election coverage.  So they have a 
channel called Miranal and I was on the panel for the election coverage 
right from a few weeks before the elections till the end of elections.  I 
am still one of the panellists for Miranal right now and I am also an 
editorial consultant with a newspaper based in Washington DC called 
India America Today.  So I mean that is a position that I have as – on a 
consultative basis.  So what Mr Moegsien Williams is saying is 
20 
something which has no factual basis and it is an absolute lie like most 
of the other things in his affidavit. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  And then he 
continues:  
“All of this against the background of a disastrous 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 69 of 127 
 
launch of the television station a launch he was 
primarily responsible for.  Apart from having spent 
only three months in the country having not been 
very successful as an editor of ANN7 having a 
tumultuous relationship with his employers and 
having left the republic under a cloud Mr Sundaram 
appears to justify his lack of success at ANN7 with 
reference to allegations which are simply not true in 
a book he wishes to sell and to protect a 
professional reputation.” 
10 
Two questions arising from that.  Did you leave the republic under a 
cloud and if so what was that – are you aware of that cloud I do not 
know? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Absolutely not.  I have explained in my book 
that the disastrous launch or a train wreck as I called it. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Was because of the micro management by 
Atul Gupta the tearing hurry in which they did not allow the 
professionals to take a decision.  The technicians were under 
tremendous pressure and nobody would at the end of the day because 
20 
of the sheer fear that they had of Atul Gupta’s rage would tell him that 
you know what he was doing was wrong and that we were heading 
towards a disaster.  Even those who told him that were seen with 
suspicion and the reason why the launch at the ANN7 was a disaster 
was [indistinct]  because of Mr Atul Gupta and the fact that he would go 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 70 of 127 
 
into a fit of rage if anybody went against what he was saying.  He 
ignored professional advice and for us towards the end it was clear that 
we were almost on a suicide mission you know. We were going into this 
we knew that it was sure failure at the end of it but as professionals we 
knew that we had to go into we could not abandon it and we went 
straight head on.  And like I said yesterday the reason why we came 
out of this without in the form that we did was because of the hard work 
that you know the South African technicians and journalists put in this 
place.  It could have been much worse had that not been the situation.  
They were the glue that made sure that you know within a matter of 
10 
weeks we were in a position where we could launch of course it was not 
to the professional standards that I have launched other channels but I 
would say here categorically that that was because I was not allowed to 
work.  I was working with my hands tied behind my back and constantly 
micro managed by the Gupta brothers especially Mr Atul Gupta. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and then he says when he 
deals with the meetings at the official residence of the former president 
at paragraph 42 he says: 
“I do not consider the affidavits deposed to by Mr Sundaram to directly 
implicate me in any acts of corruption or fraud.  I understand the 
20 
allegations to simply mean that I in the company of others attended 
three meetings at the official residence of the former president Mr 
Jacob Zuma in Pretoria in that I furthermore was present at a visit to 
the studios of ANN7 by Mr Zuma on 19 August 2013.” 
And then he describes how he met the president for the first time but 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 71 of 127 
 
this is what I would like you to comment on?  He say at paragraph 46: 
“During my tenure as Editor of New Age newspaper I 
also met Mr Zuma on two further occasions when I 
accompanied members of my staff and or reporters of 
ANN7 for on the record interviews with the former 
president and for several off the record briefings 
subsequently.  I interposed to invite attention to 
reflect that members of the media regularly meet with 
senior politicians and do so for a variety of reasons.  
Quite frequently politicians would engage members 
10 
of the media in relation to matters concerning their 
political parties and in an endeavour to – of 
attempting to persuade members of the media to be 
sympathetic to their party or their particular cause or 
even sway to sway members of the media in favour 
of their political views.” 
Is this what he says is it a common occurrence as he put it? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I think what he is talking about is a 
diversionary tactic.  I am talking apples he is talking oranges.  For an 
editor or a journalist to go meet politicians and presidents that is 
20 
nothing out of the ordinary but these meetings why I would say is 
different is because he is not only the editor of the New Age he is a 
director in the company that is owned which is not disclosed in this.  
He also has not disclosed that the President’s son is a shareholder in 
the company that he is talking about and he is denying engaging in 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 72 of 127 
 
commercial discussions with the President.  And I can understand why 
he is doing that.  Because then he would be implicating himself.  So – 
and I think the facts are in my book here about the number of meetings 
that he attended and the number of meetings that he did not.  I have 
clearly aid that he was part of the first meeting. There was one meeting 
in which he was visiting Cape Town and he could not come and also 
details of the fourth meeting are also given.  So most of the facts that 
he is relying on are also dubious in this case.  And to answer your 
question I would say when editor meeting a politician or the president 
is not out of the ordinary what is out of the ordinary is that fact that as 
10 
a director of the company you going with the owners of your newspaper 
for business dealings that I think is – brings a direct conflict of interest.  
It is not definitely not pertaining to the highest standards of journalistic 
ethics that I know of. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And in paragraph 50, 51, 
52 and 54 there he deals with the fact that it is an – what you say that 
there were matters of editorial policy that were discussed with the 
President that is not correct.  But I am just summarising it instead of 
just reading everything into the record.  He says that that is not what 
happened. They were going there as any other media would go and get 
20 
the ear of the President as he suggests in the previous paragraph that I 
read to you.  What do you say to that? 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I would say that he is lying in his affidavit.  
That I stand by what I have said.  What was discussed was matters of 
editorial policy about the design of the studios, about commercials in 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 73 of 127 
 
terms of the expense heads and things like that.  I stand by whatever I 
have said in my affidavit and I contradict what he is saying. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Maybe just to confirm 
what he had already conveyed to the Chairperson without reading from 
the paragraph – paragraph 66.  Where he says: 
“Although I do not recall the specific date on which 
I attended the meeting it may very well be 
22 June 2013 the date referred to by Mr Sundaram.  
It is no small significance that he is unable to 
recollect the date in July or August when the 
10 
second and third meetings are alleged to have 
taken place.  As I am confident the records at the 
security checkpoints within this official estate of 
Government residence will not support the presence 
of any of the individuals claimed to have been at 
the residence of the President during July and 
august 2013.  Regardless of the dates though I am 
confident that the delegation only visited the 
President’s residence on one occasion.” 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  Well I would want to put this to him – you 
20 
know – the fact that he does not want to cross-examine me or the fact 
that he does not want to subject himself to cross-examination speaks 
volumes.  What I would say is that what I have said is factually correct.  
We were wheeled in to the President’s residence.  There are records of 
the Gupta fleet cars in which we went and a record of that was sent 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 74 of 127 
 
through Aslan to Mr Ashu Chawla and there would be records of that 
there.  I am sure there are CCTV cameras at the porch where you could 
see where the entries took place.  By the specific dates I have not put 
in here because I would not know for sure but I know that it was a 
Sunday in July 2013 and I would say that if – if the investigators were 
to go and look at the CCTV footage - to look at the records of the 
security in terms of the cars that enter there.  They would know that 
what I am saying is the truth.  As far as August is concerned a similar 
thing I would request the investigators to go through and I would 
challenge Mr Moegsien Williams – you know – if there is – you know 
10 
that what he is saying is an absolute lie and if I have to stay an extra 
day I would do that if he wants to cross-examine me.  I am willing to 
face him and I am sure when the investigators get their evidence they 
would know that what I am saying is the absolute truth. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  About these meetings. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Those 
are the matters that I wish to raise with Mr Sundaram. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With regard to the keeping of records at the 
President’s official residence you did testify that you noticed that it

appeared - when you went to the President’s official residence that 
security was quite lax and you said you did not know whether that is 
how it normally was or whether it was simply because you were part of 
the – this was a delegation from the Gupta family.  Do you have any 
recollection whether anybody was recording that the delegation – that 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 75 of 127 
 
people were coming in and out?  Leaving out any security cameras. 
MR RAJESH SUNDARAM:  I know for a fact that before the event for 
these meetings the vehicle numbers and these vehicles were from the 
Gupta fleet of cars and I am sure there are records of that.  We only 
went in the SUVs from the Gupta fleet and they were – the numbers – 
the registration numbers of these vehicles were given in advance to 
Mr Ashu Chawla who would then give it to the President’s office and as 
soon as we were about to enter the gate they would see the numbers 
and they would just wave us straight through in.  In the second meeting 
when Mr Ashu Chawla was driving they saw his face and they just 
10 
waved us in.  I was always carrying my passport because you know in 
case there is requirement for an ID to be given at the residence but I 
have no recollection of my ID ever been checked.  I am not sure but I 
am quite certain there would be CCTV cameras there which – which can 
clear – you know – we can go back and check records of and if the 
vehicle numbers were given am sure there will be a record of that as 
well - you know – because there would be a security entry that is made 
somewhere.  So I am absolutely confident that – you know – these 
meetings did take place.  I attended those meetings and the 
discussions were on the topics that I have said in the affidavit. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What has happened to a supplementary affidavit by 
him relating to the quotations in his statement? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Mr Chairperson from this 
morning I got a sense that Chairperson would like him to deal with all 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 76 of 127 
 
the quotations in the book or just the quotations in the statement? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh well one, certainly in the statement … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But insofar as there is evidence in the book there is – 
the contents of the book or parts of the contents of the book … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That he is – he has confirmed here. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the extent that any parts thereof are put in 
quotations he must just – he must tell us … 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whether those were quotations as we all understand 
them to say … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Those were word for word.  That is what the person 
said word for word … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or whether it was something else. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so only insofar as it relates to what he has 
20 
confirmed. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN 
SC: 
 
Yes, 
thank 
you.  
Mr Chairperson could he then be allowed time maybe by next week that 
is we obtain the supplementary or would the Chairperson prefer to have 
it sooner? 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 77 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well that is – that is fine.  It can be – it can be 
delivered in due course. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I was hoping that it would have been done overnight 
but to the extent that it did not involve the book.  It might … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Have required more time. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes Mr Chairperson. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that – that is fine.  You can make arrangements 
for … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  For him to deal with that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  His supplementary affidavit to be delivered in due 
course. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.

MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  100 percent correct … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  And true. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Can you just tell the 
Chairperson that you were once employed by the South African 
Broadcasting Corporation – the SABC?  Could you tell the Chairperson 
when and – when did you join the SABC? 
20 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  I joined the SABC in 1995 and I was 
called into the office of the General Manager Human Resources on 
13 April last year being on contract for 25 years – nearly – and he said 
to me sir sorry we are not going to renew your contract.  You are too 
White and you are too old. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 82 of 127 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  So I left the end of April last year. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Alright.  Can you take it step by 
step, alright?  When you first joined the SABC in what capacity were 
you employed? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  I joined them as sales person in the 
Content Enterprises Department until 2009.  I joined them in 1995 
during the Rugby World Cup and Mr Snooki Segalla in 2009 felt that 
news 
archive 
footage 
should 
fall 
under 
news 
and 
generate 
money/income for news.  So content enterprises then got split.  They 
10 
were only allowed to sell programming and a new department called 
News Agency was formed to sell all news content footage … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  And I joined them in 2009 where they 
started off. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and then what was the 
actual position that you held in that department? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  What was the …? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  The positon that you held? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Was senior sales representative. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and how many were you in 
that department? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Including an intern four, excluding 
the intern three. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 83 of 127 
 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT: 
 
Myself, 
a 
lady 
who 
was 
the 
administrator and another gent who also sold news items to the public. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So what was the role of a 
senior sales representative? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Well basically to help broadcasters 
and production houses to get the correct footage when they made 
programs for the SABC or any other company and to make sure that 
they receive the correct footage and also to avoid all copyright issues. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  You – the investigators of 
the Commission as you know had approached you and you had depose 
10 
to this affidavit to deal with certain aspects or a particular sale of the 
archival content.  Am I right? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  When I got approached by … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  ANN7? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  At that stage it was Infinity Media.  
No, Mr Nazeem Howa came to see me – a real gentleman.  He sat down 
and we discussed how archives work and I explained to him a, we do 
not transfer any material on behalf of outside clients because if they 
20 
are not happy we have wasted our time and our tapes and everything.  
You will have to make somebody available from your offices to come 
and select what you want and he was talking in general – you know. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  What one would need to start a 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 84 of 127 
 
television station.  I said … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Alright, before … 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Nazeem I am prepared to help you 
people – you know.  What is historical?  The SABC started off in 1979. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Prior to that African Mirror footage – 
so there is nothing historical about SABC footage whatsoever. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Alright.  Just a minute please 
Mr Scott. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Yes he might turn around and say to 
10 
me but what about the release of Nelson Mandela.  That is not 
historical. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  That has got to be dealt with the 
SABC alone.  It helps to – well – as a matter of fact Reuters, ITN has 
got far better footage of the release of Nelson Mandela than the SABC. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Mr Scott just … 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Sorry. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Just a minute please.  I 
am sorry Mr Chairperson Mr Scott has indicated that he is hard of 
20 
hearing.  So we might just have a slight problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is fine. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes thank you.  Just how 
did Mr Howa get to know about you or how did that meeting between 
the two of you happen? 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 85 of 127 
 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  I got a call from the secretary of the 
Acting CEO at that stage Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng and she said to me 
Sias Hlaudi would like to see you. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  I said when.  She said to me 
tomorrow morning 9 o’ clock.  So the next morning 9 o’ clock I went up 
to his office.  He was not there.  He got stuck in traffic in Sandton and 
well everybody knows me a, I do not work Africa time.  If an 
appointment is for 9 o’ clock it is 9 o’ clock not five past nine.  I turned 
around and I said to her do me a favour I am not going to waste the 
10 
SABCs time and my time.  I am going back to the office.  When he 
arrives phone me. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  I was basically on my way down to 
my office when he phoned me and he apologised and he said to me 
sorry I am late but I am in the office now.  So I went back to his office 
and he wanted to know how the sale of archive material works.  So I 
explained to him you have got do research – you know.  You have got to 
transfer it from original to copy. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Sorry.  Sorry Mr Scott.  Let us 
20 
take that process slowly because you deal with that process in 
paragraph 7 onwards of your statement. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Just describe it slowly to the 
Chairperson.  How does that process work? 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 86 of 127 
 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Okay.  Let me start from the 
beginning.  I start in the process.  A, I want an email from the client 
requesting material.  The client must tell me exactly what the material 
will be used for.  Then I will quote the client and if the client accepts 
the quotation then only will I go further by doing research on what the 
client wants and then arrange for the client to come in and select the 
material.  Our conversation lasted about 10 minutes maximum and he 
said to me Sias expect a call from someone who needs footage and that 
is the last heard I have heard from Mr Motsoeneng about the deal with 
ANN7 and I cannot recall if it was the same afternoon or the next day 
10 
that Mr Howa phoned me, asked to see me, made an appointment.  He 
came in about the next day I would say.  We sat in my office and we 
discussed the whole process and I then emailed him a quotation which 
he accepted and I would say about three days later a gentleman by the 
name of Rahul was sent to me to start selecting the material and in the 
meanwhile I – the fourth person who was an intern.  I managed to get 
appointed permanent.  Moloko very, very bright gentleman.  He did his 
Masters in between doing in his internship.  I do not know he managed 
to do it but he did. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Is that Mr Moloko Maserumule? 
20 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Maserumule. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Ja.   He then started to work 
permanently in the news agency department and I explained to him 
what Nazeem wanted and I said to Moloko as per all our clients you 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 87 of 127 
 
have got to sit with whoever comes in.  I will help you with research.  
Draw the tapes – make sure that if the appointment is 9 o’ clock 9 o’ 
clock he starts.  The tapes must be ready and Rahul from ANN7 kept 
his time on the spot.  Always arrived on time like Moloko and they 
started to work. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Let us just go back 
slightly.  You have not told the - the Chairperson what is it that 
Mr Howa said to you he wanted.  You have not described exactly the 
content that he actually wanted. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Mr Howa said to me Sias can you 
10 
help us with material to start off a new channel in South Africa and I 
immediately said to him Nazeem at that stage the late Nelson Mandela 
was very sick.  I said to him a, you cannot go on air without material of 
Mr Nelson Mandela and he agreed.  I also said to him you cannot start 
a channel if you do not have good visuals of all the major cities of 
South Africa – Pretoria, Bloemfontein, Cape Town, Durban and you 
name it and he agreed and Marikana was quite in the press at that 
stage and I said to him Marikana footage we have got and he said to 
me ja Sias any riots – any protests you name it.  That was basically 
what we discussed. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  So he wanted a wide range of 
material? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  A wide range of footage.  Not only – 
as a matter of fact it would have been a pleasure if he asked me 2000 
minutes of Nelson Mandela only because we have got over 2000 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 88 of 127 
 
minutes of Nelson Mandela. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Starting with tapes 4575 which is the 
release of Nelson Mandela.  4589 his speech – Grand Parade Speech – 
going over on to 4590 and then the next one would be Madiba arriving 
in Soweto – not much of that.  Only the Orland Stadium Speech.  Ja, 
next week he spoke at Kingsmead in Durban – throw your weapons in 
the sea. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So then after he then told 
you exactly what he wanted then you had an idea of … 
10 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  I had a good idea … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Of what he wanted? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Of what to research for and you name 
it and I also said to him Nazeem do me a favour.  You people discuss it 
between you.  Tell Rahul or whoever comes in to bring me a list of what 
you think you want and whilst he is here working on the other stuff I will 
do the research and make sure the tapes are there. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  I never received a list from them.  
They depended on me completely. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So then – so this happens 
before there is negotiations about how much they are going to pay, how 
much is it going to cost them because you have no idea of the content 
that they wanted? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Advocate let us put it this way there 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 89 of 127 
 
was no difference in price between what type of content a production 
house or a broadcaster wanted.  The price would have remained the 
same.  It is used for broadcast purposes.  So whether they wanted 
Marikana or Madiba footage or Winnie footage or – it does not matter.  
The price would have remained the same per minute. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Can you go to page 17 of 
that - of your statement?  It will be under a divider marked 3. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  And it is 3? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You mean paragraph 17? 
10 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Yes advocate. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You said page 17. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Page 17 Mr Chairman.  Yes, 
under item – the divider marked number 3.  It is Annexure JJS3.  It is 
called – what is that – what is that Mr Scott?  Have you found it?  Are 
you there? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Sorry. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Have you found it?  Have you 
found the document? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Number 3, yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  What is it? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  It is a price guide. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  It is a price guide.  Is that the 
price guide of the SABC? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  That is a price guide for - for the sale 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 90 of 127 
 
of stock footage. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could you just highlight 
what the price is that is relevant for the transaction that you are talking 
about? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Your Honourable I want to start off by 
pointing out these are price guides and not a set price list.  1A – R100 
per minute of footage transferred and taken away.  That is a standard 
price which we ask.  If you walk in and you want to buy 10 minutes you 
would have paid R1 000 plus VAT. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, alright.  Okay, let us look 
10 
at the next one.  What is that for - that R500 per hour? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Okay.  It was agreed from B to D to 
waive it and it was also agreed between Jimmy Matthews and myself to 
deviate from R100 per minute to R70 per minute. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Yes, we are not there yet.  
We are getting to that but I just want you to explain to the – to the 
Chairperson.  You have told us the R100 per minute if you transfer and 
you take away what is the R500 per hour?  What is that for? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Okay.  The R500 per hour Your 
Honourable is basically if a client comes in and we had that a lot of 
20 
times that somebody would come in, sit in front of a monitor, waste two, 
three, four hours in the edit suite and do not pay.  So the R500 per 
hour part thereof was to use the edit suite of the SABC. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  That was a technical charge to use a 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 91 of 127 
 
– because you have got to remember there are two machines. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  There is a machine that copies and 
then there is a machine where you put your master tapes in. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  So you needed two machines and the 
R500 was to copy from tape – master tape to copy tape. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  To copy tape? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Alright and then if – if I come to 
10 
the SABC and I am the one who wants material and I would come and 
sit down with you or Mr Maserumule.  So for the time that I have come 
in there and I am sitting and I am copying the material from the master 
tape onto the copy tape.  So you would charge for that time.  That is 
what the R500 is for? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  That is correct. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, alright.  Then let us move 
on to the R150 per 10 items. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Clients would send in a list of 300 
items which they think they might need.  You know to do research on 
20 
300 items takes a little bit of time.  So we have tried to restrict them to 
be specific by charging them R150 per 10 items or part thereof. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, alright.  So this is all stuff 
that would go onto the (intervenes)? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Ja that is all technical costs. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 92 of 127 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  All technical costs and then you 
have got them in one – in D. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  D. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Okay.  In the case of ANN7 they 
brought in their own copy tapes but if a client wants the material on a 
DVCPRO Format then we just R150 and we provide the copy or the 
SABC provides the copy. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Alright and then we deal in E, 
F, G with copyright.  Could you explain to the Chairperson what these 
10 
copyrights are for? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    Ja, E reproduction company or 
anybody for that sake, makes a program and it’s being broadcast on the 
SABC only, then we charge less for copyright, we charge R750 per 30 
seconds.  If a client walks in, a (indistinct) walks in, says I saw this 
beautiful church service about ten years ago on TV, I would like to 
show it to my congregation, can I have a copy please.  I would then 
explain to him it’s all your visual presentation, in other words you show 
it to more than one person and you’re going to have to pay R500 for 30 
seconds copyright.   
20 
 
Okay then we get to the money side of it, copyright, opposition 
broadcasters, NCA, DSTV, (Indistinct) Vera, ANN7 as well, we would 
charge R2 000 per 30 seconds copyright. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  So these are your competitors? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    That is our competitors. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 93 of 127 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, alright and then 
...(intervention)  
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:   And Carte Blanche they only reason 
why they paid more, R2 750, is because they stream all their, the Carte 
Blanche programs, I charge them R750 per 30 seconds to put it on 
YouTube or wherever they like to. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and you’ve got different 
pricing for overseas broadcasters? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:   Pardon?   
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  You have, sorry, you have 
10 
different pricing for overseas broadcasters? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    Ja, overseas broadcasters we quote 
it into US Dollar or Euro or Pound depending on you know where the 
broadcasters are from. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and – but for the purposes 
of your testimony these are not relevant, am I right? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    Sorry? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  For the purposes of your 
evidence the overseas prices are not relevant? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    No definitely not. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, and then if you turn over 
the page at page 18 you have advertising use was that relevant to 
ANN7? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    No Nazeem explained to me that 
they’re going to use it in South Africa only and there was no reason to 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 94 of 127 
 
doubt him.  As far as I know, nobody has told me or showed me 
otherwise, as far as I know they only used our footage in South Africa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Don’t you need from this witness only what was – 
what were the terms of the arrangement between SABC and ANN7, if he 
knows them, what was the norm, what were the normal terms.  Was 
there a deviation from those terms, how much deviation was there, what 
was the justification for the deviation, if any.  Do we need anything 
more than that? 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  No Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Let’s get that.    
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Alright thank you especially 
because he’s struggling to hear…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:    We’re going too much roundabout let’s get to it. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Now then Mr 
Howa comes to you and then you said you gave him a quotation, what 
was the quotation that you gave him? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    With? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  You gave him a quotation. 
20 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    Ja I gave a quotation only after I 
had a chat to our CE, Chief Executive of news Jimmy Matthews and I 
said to him, Jimmy – I was excited because A), we’ve never sold 2000 
minutes of footage to one client and I knew it was going to be a big 
deal and we chatted and chatted and chatted and we decided okay no 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 95 of 127 
 
fine, instead of charging R100 per minute we’re going to charge R70 
per minute.  I went back and I emailed him, Nazeem Howa, I said to 
him, this is the best I can do, and he came back and said, accepted. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and then what about the 
R500 for…(intervention). 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    No that we waived, we decided not 
to charge it because if I had to add that, I would have chased them 
away completely.  
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Alright can you just talk try 
and…(intervention). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:    But what was wrong with that, wasn’t your – wasn’t 
your job to charge…(intervention). 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    Sorry? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Wasn’t your job to charge according to the price 
guide, was your job not to charge according to the price guide 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    It was Your Honourable but if I do 
get the permission from whoever is in charge of overall news and 
Jimmy said, let’s waive it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what reason did Mr Matthews advance for saying 
that R500 per hour should be waived? 
20 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    Sorry I’ve got a hearing problem. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I’m sorry, I was told you do have a hearing 
problem, let me try and raise my voice.  Can you hear me now? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    A little bit better. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay maybe let me bring the mic closer, this mic can 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 96 of 127 
 
still not come closer, you must make arrangements let’s see if I pull it.  
What was the reason that Mr Matthews gave as to why you should 
waive the R500 per hour? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    Your Honourable there was no 
reason given whatsoever.  We chatted about the size of the deal and he 
– I can recall him even saying it’s going to be a big job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It’s a big job from the side of SABC…(intervention). 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    Well the big job became my big job 
but it was part of my work that I had to do in any event, no, no reasons 
was given, quite frankly, you know, I think anybody in that position 
10 
would have done it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would have? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    Would have done what Jimmy did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes why do you say that? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    At that stage, what goes through 
one’s mind, you’ve got 140 000 rand immediately if you finish the 2000 
minutes 
at 
R70 
per 
minute, 
why 
worry 
about 
an 
additional 
R30 000/R40 000, get the R140 000 in asap. 
CHAIRPERSON: But was there a request from the client for the 
R500.00 to be waived?   
20 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    If I’ve got copies of all the packing 
slips I can work out that we did not lose all that much money.  Raul did 
not came in any day so not all those many hours were spent in the edit 
feeds, what we did was, Maloko would park the tapes where he would 
start and select from so…(intervention). 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 97 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no the question was, was there a request fro the 
client for the R500.00 to be waived? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    No not at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Mr Chairman I 
beg our pardon, I thought you were saying something else. Now if we 
take  - from what you have described earlier, because they didn’t give 
you a list of what they wanted, so it would mean that when Mr Raul 
comes and meets with Mr Maloko – Mr (indistinct) they would have to 
sit down and sift through the content that they wanted. 
10 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    View and transfer. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  View and transfer, so that 
would have taken hours, am I right? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    That’s – couldn’t have taken them 
more than 40 hours in total.  Advocate you’ve got to remember they 
only took away 33 hours in total, 33,03 hour in total, that’s what they 
took away, 1 982 minutes, that would give you 33.03 hours.  You 
transfer – a minute transfer to a minute, so it would have taken them – 
the tape might stop eject a tape put a new tape in that would waste a 
little bit of time, 33 hours wouldn’t have taken them more than 40/45 
20 
hours maximum. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes but the 33 hours multiplied 
by 500 would have still been – have been a good revenue for the SABC. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    33 Hours that would have been 
R16 500. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 98 of 127 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes do you regard that as 
insignificant? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    Pardon? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Do you regard that amount as 
insignificant? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    Well instead of losing a deal, you 
know I  regard that amount as minor really. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But who said you were going to lose a deal?   
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    When Mr Howa came to see me he 
was talking about, there’s not much money you know and difficult times 
10 
and all that…(intervention). 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he never asked for a discount. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    Pardon? 
CHAIRPERSON:  But he never asked for a discount, he never asked for 
you to waive anything isn’t it? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    No you’re quite right we just gave 
it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja without being asked.   
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    Without being asked. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:    Thank you Mr Chairman.  
20 
Where is the – did you then conclude an agreement with him other than 
the quotation that you spoke about, was there an agreement that was 
concluded between the SABC and ANN7? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    I cannot recall a hundred percent if 
there was a legal binding contract or if we only worked on the emails as 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 99 of 127 
 
an agreement. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Alright, let’s just talk about 
that, who would have referred – because I understand you have a legal 
department am I right, who would have referred these terms that you 
agreed on with Mr Howa to the legal department for them to draft an 
agreement, who’s responsibility was it? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    It was quite a big department and if 
you request a contract, it would be referred to one of the legal people 
that’s not all that busy, quite a couple of people could draw up the 
contract. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes but who must take the first 
step, that, please draw up the contract. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    My department had to take the first 
step. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes did your department do 
that? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    I cannot recall whether we did or 
not. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Okay but as you are sitting 
there now have you been able to locate, from the time you sold to ANN7 
20 
till today, although you’re out of employment now, have you ever been 
able to locate a contract upon which you said, look this is what – those 
are the terms of the contract and this is how things are going to be 
done. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    Since this thing started advocate I 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 100 of 127 
 
have not approached the SABC for anything, the good work was done 
by Dr Anthony and all this copies of stuff which you see here was done 
by your investigator, I did not approach the SABC for anything. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Before you left – but did you 
ever have sight of an agreement…(intervention). 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:    Quite frankly before I left, you 
know, State Capture – being called to the State Capture, that was the 
last thing on my mind.  I saw a small article in the newspapers about 
the book and I think it was the Beeld newspaper stating that they’ve got 
footage for a hamburger and Maloko and Maloko came back, ha, ha, ha, 
10 
ha, you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I think we must take the adjournment. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes I think so, thank you Mr 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    When we come back we need to try and wrap up. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes we’ll do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:    We’ll take the lunch adjournment and we will come 
back at 2 o’clock we adjourn. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready?  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chair.  Mr Scott 
could you turn to page 6 paragraph 15 of your affidavit - paragraph 
1-5? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Number 6? 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 101 of 127 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, page 6 … 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  1-5? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Paragraph 1-5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is paragraph 1-5 on what page? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Page 6 Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Of his statement? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Of - of his statement yes.  In 
that paragraph you say that: 
“To your recollection this was the first time that a 
discount had ever been offered.” 
10 
Is that correct? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  No, please answer a yes or a 
no. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you and then you 
also say that: 
“The discussions between yourself and Mr Howa 
were happening via email.” 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  That is correct. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And is it correct that there is no 
agreement – written agreement that you are aware of that was 
concluded with him? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  Now if you go 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 102 of 127 
 
to paragraph 17 - same page – what do you say in paragraph 17?  Can 
you just read that into the record? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  What do I say about paragraph? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  17, yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:   It is 100 percent correct it took 
approximately a month to do all the work. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  It is 100 percent correct as stated in 
paragraph 17. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  So it is correct? 
10 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  So it took over a month and you 
did not charge for them using the booth during that period? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  It took quite a while to search and 
get the correct footage, yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say the transfer to archive footage is it a transfer 
to archive footage or is it a transfer of the archive to something else?  
Did I speak softly? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  In paragraph 17 of your statement you talk 
about the transfer to archive footage.  I am asking whether it was a 
transfer of the archive footage to something. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  To a copy tape Your Honourable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But was it a transfer of the archive footage not to? 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 103 of 127 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Not to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you Mr Chairperson 
and in the following paragraph you deal with the packing slips. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  That is correct advocate. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Sorry, when you respond you 
must always say – respond to the Chairperson.  I am not sure whether 
he heard that. 
10 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you very much.  In 
that paragraph you – if you could just read after the package slip 
JJS081.  You say there you actually charge them for 1982 minutes of 
footage but you charge for the entire price for the 2000 minutes.  Is 
that what you did? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  That is correct Chairperson. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could you just quickly 
take us through the minutes that are reflected on the table that you see 
there? 
20 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  On 17 July they took 44 minutes 
away.  18 July 34 minutes and … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Sorry.  I think the minutes are 
under duration. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  The minutes are? 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 104 of 127 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Under duration. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Ja that is the duration ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes you must read from 
that for the record. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can you see the column that is written description of 
goods?  Can you see that column? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Can I just go through the packing slip 
quickly Chairperson?  If you do not mind.  I just want to check … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  If you go under eight - the 
10 
divider marked eight.  That is where the packing slips are.  Have you 
found it Mr Scott? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  I am what? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Just look at the divider marked 
eight. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  JJS5. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  I just want to check that. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Alright, okay. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  240 minutes. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Ja, under duration you will see … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  What they have taken away.  17 July 
240 minutes and it goes right through till 22 August – the last time they 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 105 of 127 
 
were there – 40 minutes.  That is the duration which they took away. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is seems to 22 August not the 27 t h.  Is that 
right? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  22 August. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, the 22 n d.  I thought you said the 27 t h.  I am sorry 
but can you see the column that is immediately before the column 
written duration? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Description of goods. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That one the first item there is 44 DVCPRO.  That is 
the description of goods.  Are you able to enlighten me more as to … 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  I am trying to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  What that is? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Sorry Chairperson but I am trying 
myself.  It is a little bit confusing at this stage … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  And I want to see exactly what … 
CHAIRPERSON:  That was. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Where they got it from. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  May I just help you?  If you turn 
to page 22 – 22 on the right hand corner.  That is the – I think that is 
what you are looking for.  That will show you the 240 minutes and that 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 106 of 127 
 
will give you the date of 17 July 2013.  That is the packing slip that 
goes with that item. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Where? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Page 22. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Page 22? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think if I understand him correctly. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He is looking for something that will tell him what that 
44 DVCPRO is … 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I may be mistaken. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  That is reflected 
Mr Chairperson on the packing slip.  He is looking for a packing slip. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Could we assist – could …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, somebody can assist him. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  I do not have a page 22. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Alright, okay. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Page 7, oh that one.  Your 
Honourable from the … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Packing slip one will see that I 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 107 of 127 
 
signed out four DVCPRO tapes to them … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Which they brought in originally and I 
signed them because they finished the four DVCPRO tapes and the 
total duration came to 240 minutes … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Which they transferred with that day 
or over a two/three day period. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, what I want to try and understand is what 44 
10 
DVCPRO … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  What does that mean? 
CHAIRPERSON:  What does that refer to?  What goods were those? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Your Honourable I have got no clue.  
I do not know where this description comes from. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that so? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But from your own understanding what would it be – 
what type of goods – because it says description of goods.  What type 
of goods? 
20 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT: 
 
Chairperson 
there 
is 
no such 
description for footage whatsoever. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  44 DVCPRO, 34 DVCPRO no. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But it is in your affidavit.  You signed the affidavit – 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 108 of 127 
 
your statement and you just confirmed - when you started your 
evidence you confirmed that the contents of your affidavit are correct.  
So how could you be the one saying that you do not know what 44 
DVCPRO refers to? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Could that be the size of the 
tape? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Sorry. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Could it be the size of the 
tape? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Definitely not.  The size of the tapes 
10 
vary from 33, 66 and 126. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Alright, but when you 
signed it what were you signing because at page 22 – you remember 22 
where you were before? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  When I? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Page 22. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see where you referred to a slip about five 
minutes ago … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At page 22.  You confirmed that you signed that slip.  
20 
Is that right?  Page 22 … 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Page 22 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  I signed out for actual DVCPRO 
tapes … 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 109 of 127 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  And the total duration of those four 
tapes came to 240 minutes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who wrote 240 minutes? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  That is my handwriting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Your handwriting? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But they … 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  But Moloko checked the duration of 
10 
each and every tape. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that is fine. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Then … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Whose handwriting or who wrote 44 DVCPROs on that 
slip?  Whose handwriting …? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  That is not 44 Chairperson.  It is four 
times DVCPRO.  I did. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is it?  Just read it. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  It is four times DVCPRO. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Four times DVC programs. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  DVCPROs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  PROs, ja what is that? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  That is the name of a tape. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh those are tapes? 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 110 of 127 
 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it is not 44.  It is four times? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  It is four times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then when you go to page 7 of your statement under 
description of goods where it says 44 DVCPRO.  Should it be reading 
four times? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  This looks like a typing error.  It 
should be … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, it should be four times? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Ja, four times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If it says four times then it would make sense to you? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Ja, definitely no doubt about it. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then it would be the tapes? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Ja and I am correcting mine. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So shall it reflect the 
same in all? It will be three times going down? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Ja. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Alright, okay.  So you made an 
error there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Will it be three times … 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  (Intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Four times, three times, three times, eight times, 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 111 of 127 
 
seven times, three times, four times, two times?  Is that what it will be 
– what it should be on that column? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Four, seven, 10, 25, 28, 30, 38.  It 
adds up to the amount of DVCPRO tapes which they brought in … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  38 in total. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but let us take it step by step.  You saw where it 
says 44 – 44. You said it should be four times 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  It is four times DVCPRO. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You now that it says 34.  So that is … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  34. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  34 should be three times. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Three times? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The following one?  30 should be what, three times? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Three. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And 84 underneath? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Should be eight. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  74? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Should be seven. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Should be seven.  34 should be three. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Should be three. 
CHAIRPERSON:  44 should be four. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 112 of 127 
 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Should be four. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And 24 should be two. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Two and 48 should be four. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then in the next 
paragraphs then you give in your statement the totals of the amounts 
that were paid by ANN7 at the rate of them having been charged for the 
2000 minutes at R70 per minute and you give those totals in paragraph 
10 
– paragraphs 21 and 22.  Is that correct? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  That is correct. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And were those amounts paid to 
the SABC?  As the invoices were they paid? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  All invoices were paid. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  All of them were paid? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  All of them. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you and then let us 
just deal with the one aspect then on – how then were you dealing with 
them in order for you to see what content they have used?  How were 
20 
you getting declarations from them?  Can you just tell the Chairperson 
that process that you followed quickly? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  I would email them and ask for a 
declaration.  Like I did with all clients and fortunately you know it cost 
too much to have a microchip installed in each and every tape which 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 113 of 127 
 
you sell to the public or to production houses.  So you rely on their 
honesty. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  So how it does work with a 
microchip.  Supposing that you can afford – if you were to afford it how 
would it work? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  A microchip gets planted onto a tape 
and whoever uses that tape will register onto your computer. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  So is that want is called burnt 
in code or is it something different? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  No, it is something different. 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Okay.  Are you aware of the 
burnt in code system? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT: 
 
The 
burnt 
in 
time 
code, yes 
definitely. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Okay what is - how does 
that one work? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  If you have got a burnt in time code 
on your tape you cannot use it for anything because it is time code that 
runs at the bottom of the tape continuously … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  And you cannot use it for any 
programming whatsoever. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  But will you be able – 
supposing that you give me with the burnt in time code.  Does that 
mean that if I said I wanted it for five seconds I can only use it for five 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 114 of 127 
 
seconds and not more? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  No, wait.  You can only use it for five 
seconds and no more? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  If you have put in that 
burnt in code. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  You put in a burnt code you can put it 
in for two hours, three hours.  You can put it in for as long as you like. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  But you cannot use that footage to do 
any production.  The footage completely becomes useless. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  What renders it useless?  Is that what you call bank 
in code or what you …? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  It is burnt in time code as in in 
burnt. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Burnt in time code? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Burnt in time code, ja.  It is a code 
that runs at the bottom of the tape or you can put it right in the centre 
of the tape or on top of the tape.  If you do not want anybody to use 
your material. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And then for monitoring you 
said you simply relied on them on their honesty.  That is all.  That was 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 115 of 127 
 
the only monitoring mechanism you put in place? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  You had to rely on their honesty. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is no mechanism. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  There is no mechanism other 
than saying if I come to you and I buy from you your content you will 
expect me to be honest with you and then I will pay for what I declare 
to you. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  And that was the only system 
that was there? 
10 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is – were there other occasions before this one where 
you sold archive footage to somebody or a company which would use it 
and you would – they would have to pay you for using it? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Chairperson I am not aware of 
anybody who has used any footage without declaring.  I am going to 
mention Carte Blanche now.  Carte Blanche even went as far to declare 
on a Sunday before they went out on air the Sunday evening.  The 
people I have worked with production houses, broadcaster tend to be 
20 
very, very honest.  I have never had any problems in footage 
declarations never. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well what mechanism was in place to make sure that 
if they were dishonest you would have found out? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  What mechanism in place? 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 116 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  What mechanism was in place to make sure that if 
they were dishonest you would know?  You would find out? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Nothing really except for me who 
would follow via email on a regular basis. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but that – if a person says I have used the 
footage for one hour when they have used it for five hours you would 
not know whether they have been honest with you or not.  Is it not? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Right Chairperson.  There is just no 
way we could have sent somebody out to their offices to go and check 
each and every bit of footage.  You know … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you had sent somebody would it have been easy to 
– to find out how much the footage – for how much time the footage had 
been used or would that not have been possible to determine? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  We relied on the honesty of the 
clients. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but I am asking a different question.  The 
question is if you did not trust the client what is it that you could have 
done to check whether you are being misled or not when a client tells 
you I used the footage for X amount of time when in fact it was for 
more. 
20 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Chairperson I could have asked for 
him DVD burnt in time code copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and that would have told you exactly how much 
time had been used? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Definitely.  No doubt about it. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 117 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was that something that was available at the time 
that this transaction took place? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Yes.  I could have asked them for a 
DVCPRO copy … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Of whatever they have broadcast. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  That would have meant our DVCPRO 
copy – a two hour DVD copy.  They went out 24 hours a day.  That 
would have meant 12 DVDs a day.  Ja, I could have asked them. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that would have been fine.  They would – there is 
nothing – not - that is not viable about doing it that way.  Is there? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Quite right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and why was it not – why was that not done? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  When I approached them after 
Madiba passed away they immediately responded and they came back 
and they declared in an honest way.  Sias we have used 27 minutes of 
your footage.  So I trusted them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but what did you say in an honest way because 
you do not – you do not have a way of knowing whether they were 
20 
being honest.  Should you not simply say they said to me they used 27 
minutes and I accepted that but you do not know whether they were 
being honest?  You did not know that.  Did you? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  You are right Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in the process SABC could - may well have in 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 118 of 127 
 
effect been robbed of revenue that it could have obtained.  I am saying 
robbed not in a criminal sense.  It – it suffered loss.  It could have 
gained revenue and it did not gain that revenue. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  You are right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You accept that? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  I agree 100 percent Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you Mr Chairperson. 
10 
Maybe just lastly then Mr Scott you said there were payments.  Are 
those the ones reflected at page 64? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  The invoices are before that but 
you have got payments that are listed at page 64.  64 would be written 
on the right top hand corner. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Advocate. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So on from the questions 
20 
that the Chairperson had asked you then you would – I take it that you 
would not take issue with the evidence of Mr Sundaram that the manner 
in which a declaration was made by your office relying on the user of 
the footage was not a good way of – was not a commercially viable 
manner of – of doing business. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 119 of 127 
 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  I agree.  There should have been a 
method in place to check each and every second footage going out of 
the building. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes and that was your 
responsibility? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Maybe – I was never told it is my 
responsibility.  Sale of footage started long before I started working for 
the SABC. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes but for 25 years as you 
were working with the SABC you continued in the same manner which 
10 
you described to the Chairperson without putting in the other 
mechanism of the burnt in code? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Ja, but quite frankly you know right 
from the day I started we had faith and trust in the clients.  I was never 
told to play policeman, never. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But Mr Scott I can understand when you trust 
somebody that you have – you know and you have known for a long 
time but sometime the client is somebody that you meet for the first 
time when they want the footage.  So how do you – how do you work on 
the basis that that person is an honest person when you rely – there is 
20 
no track record to rely on. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Chairperson you just hope that the 
client acts in good faith. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, but you cannot run a business like that.  Can you 
and that might not be your fault but really if you give somebody 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 120 of 127 
 
something that they can use to make money because that footage this 
particular client wanted to use in the course of business - of their 
business you know – ANN7 and they know that to - if they give you – 
they know that you will not have a way or you will take their word when 
they say we used it for one hour when in fact they used it for three 
hours and they know if they say it is three hours they pay more.  If they 
say one hour they pay less you know.  There are people out there who 
will say – who will misled you.  So unless you – you have had – you 
know – a track record of dealing with them and their honesty has been 
proved it should be problematic because if you run a business simply 
10 
on a basis that you will trust that every client who goes through your 
door is an honest person then there will be problems.  You appreciate 
that? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  I do Chairperson and I agree 100 
percent there should have been a way … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  To monitor … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNS SCOTT:  Footage going out of the building. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And especially because from what you have said it is 
20 
not as if there was no way of – there was no mechanism that could be 
put in place.  From what you have said there was a mechanism that 
could be put in place to make sure that you could know exactly how 
much time had been used and the question is when you have got a 
mechanism that is meant to protect SABC in that situation.  Why is it 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 121 of 127 
 
not – why was it not used and then we now have evidence that this 
archive footage was given to ANN7 for an unjustifiably low amount.  
That is – I think the previous witness said somebody from ANN7 used to 
say that they got this footage for peanuts from SABC.  You understand? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  I did not hear the last part? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The last witness who was before you came here … 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He gave evidence and said somebody from ANN7 or 
somebody connected with ANN7 to whom the footage was sold by SABC 
was boasting around saying that they got this footage from SABC for 
10 
peanuts.  I think there was mention of beer and – for beer and 
something else.  I do not know whether you said that or somebody else. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Chairperson if that person got it for 
peanuts he did not get it from me a, and b, I have stuck to the 
agreement which I had with Nazeem Howa. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, thank you. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you 
Mr Chairperson.  Thank you Mr Chairperson that is the evidence from 
this witness, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So the footage that you have personal knowledge the 
20 
footage that you sold all together amounted to footage for how much 
time?  Is it 2000? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  2000 minutes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2000 minutes is that right? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  1982 to be precise. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 122 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Mr Howa or ANN7 paid how much for that? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  They paid R70 for 2000 minutes 
because I had this agreement with them that at R70 you take 2000 and 
they paid R140 000. 
CHAIRPERSON:  R140 000? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Ja, excluding VAT. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And do you say that that amount which they paid was 
reasonable and accorded with what SABC used to charge generally for 
10 
footage? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Did I? 
CHAIRPERSON:  That the amount that they paid are you saying it as 
reasonable and that it accorded with the rates that SABC used to 
charge for archive footage? 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT: 
 
The 
amount 
was 
100 
percent 
according to what I have quoted them and also as per the minutes 
which they were supposed to take away. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we going to get any witness other witnesses who 
talk to the reasonable or otherwise of the price (intervenes)? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Unfortunately Mr Chairman this 
is the only witness who was working in that department who was 
dealing with the pricing and everything else and he was the only 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 123 of 127 
 
person. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well there should be an investigation whether the 
complaint … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That this footage was sold for a song whether that – 
there is justification in that complaint or not. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  I am aware of a forensic 
investigation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  That the investigators indicated 
10 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  That had been conducted but it 
was done in a very shoddy manner and (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja what – what needs to be done is to establish what 
the norm in the industry is. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  In the industry is, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was R70 at that time was it the norm – you know. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For that kind of footage and – or not – you know. 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They had R100 but … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, they reduced it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Miscounted and reduced it. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 124 of 127 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that is what needs to be done. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Otherwise we are not in a position to say whether 
there was anything wrong with selling it for that amount. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN 
SC: 
 
Yes. 
 
Thank 
you, 
yes 
Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  I mean if there is a – I am sure there should be 
lots of other transactions of that kind within the country but even if 
there are not am sure that an investigation to what happened in other 
countries with TV stations or whatever … 
10 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can be checked and then can be compared with the 
R100 per minute or R70 per minute to see whether that … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Should change or not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is more or less in line or not. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you Mr Scott.  Thank you very much.  You are 
excused.  Thank you for coming. 
MR JOSIAS JOHANNES SCOTT:  Thank you Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 125 of 127 
 
Mr Chairman.  In the same bundle there is a confirmatory affidavit of 
Mr Moloko Maserumule who was just assisting Mr Scott – Mr Rahul in 
collating the – the footage and it is – it is the very last document in that 
bundle and it is marked number two because he really has no in depth 
knowledge.  We simply ask that his statement just be submitted into 
evidence without him having to be called to testify.  Yes, because he 
simply there is (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So I think the most important thing is to 
investigate what was the norm … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of prices.  What was the – what were the 
prices and – and then the other question is whether the transaction was 
done in accordance with established procedures at SABC. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  The 
investigators have made notes.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  That – that is the evidence for 
today Mr Chairman.  I am advised that Transnet will conclude its 
20 
evidence then tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If – if we had known we would finish this time we 
could have – Dr Bloom could have come and maybe we could have … 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Finished today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Finished today. 
04 JUNE 2019 – DAY 105 
 
Page 126 of 127 
 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes.  It is just that it was 
difficult … 
CHAIRPERSON:  To tell. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Especially with the first witness 
in the morning. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  It was hard to tell what time he 
would finish. 
CHAIRPERON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  No that is alright and tomorrow it is Dr Bloom 
and who? 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  I think there is a Mr Vukela or 
something. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  I am not sure of the name, but I 
think Transnet is – has planned I think two witnesses for tomorrow. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Tomorrow we will start at 10 … 
20 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And we adjourn for the day. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn. 
ADV THANDI VICTORIA NORMAN SC:  Thank you.
