PROCEEDINGS RESUME ON 26 FEBRUARY 2020 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good morning Ms Norman, good morning everybody. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Good morning Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you ready? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair this morning we are going to lead 
the evidence of Ms Lulama Mokhobo.  Chair in – her evidence is 
contained in Exhibit CC21.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair that exhibit was – is already 
…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was previously admitted. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It was previously admitted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But what we did was to take all of her 
statements and put them in one file and remove them from the 21 which 
contained all the other statements belonging to other witnesses so as 
to make it easy to lead her on the later statement of hers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I wonder whether you should not just have made 
20 
copies and not take them out of the …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Of the others. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Other one. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright – no, no by that I mean Chair they 
are still there is that one. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 3 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  They still – oh okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes but for the purposes of today’s 
hearing. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You made copies. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No they are still there yes.  Thank you 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – but it remains as Exhibit …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It remains CC21. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  21? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But there is something you have added I would 
imagine? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The supplementary – the latest 
supplementary. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Which she is going to testify to. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But now the – what you would have added. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Would be something that was not there when it was 
admitted? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  When it was admitted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct Chair yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 4 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we should keep Exhibit CC21 as it was when it 
was admitted. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Or – and then make this 21A and B. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes maybe what we should do is you can keep 21 to 
be just a duplicate. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of what was admitted. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then have whatever you have added. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As Exhibit 21A or something. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We will do that Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But let it be separate exhibits. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Somebody who looks at Exhibit 21 and sees that it 
was remitted on a certain. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does not see a statement that was signed after. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We will do that yes.  Thank you. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 5 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. Chair …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  The – how much has been added?  Is it a 
supplementary statement only or are there …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  There is two supplementary statements 
Chair but the one supplementary that was added it is her evidence 
which she submitted to the SIU.  So from folder 2 that did form part of 
her first statement but what is new in this bundle …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You talk about folder 2 you mean B? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  B – I beg your pardon. Divider B. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That formed part of her evidence because 
she – it was attached there as an annexure.  So sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Her evidence before the Commission. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Before the SIU. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is her evidence – that is her affidavit before the 
SIU? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct Chair yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But today what she is talking about is 
20 
what is under folder C.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that is the …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The second supplementary. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 6 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what falls under divider C was not in Exhibit 21? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What about what falls under Exhibit B? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Because that was before she testified in 
September. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So what we need to do then is just admit her 
10 
supplementary affidavit that is under C as a separate exhibit? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then later on or during the break you can take it 
out and put it on a different folder. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and market it – thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  So that when we say this is Exhibit 21 it is 
exactly the same as …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  As it was. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was and then there is Exhibit 21A. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which is the addition. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We will do that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which is – will be separate. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We will do that Chair.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Do you want me to admit this? 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 7 of 157 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair could you – the 
supplementary affidavit of Ms Mokhobo be admitted as Exhibit CC21A. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The supplementary affidavit deposed to by Ms Lulama 
Mokhobo on ...(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  October. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the date? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The date appears it is October – I beg 
your pardon Chair.  It appears at page 89 that will be on the 16 t h of 
October. 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the 16 t h of October 2019. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is admitted and will be marked together with its 
annexures as Exhibit 21A. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Yesterday Chair we 
referred to the Exhibit CC43 which is of Ms Theresa Geldenhuys but it 
was not admitted formerly into the record.  Could that be admitted?  
May I just mention Chair that Chair’s bundle is not before the 
Commission we omitted to ask the Protectors to bring that one but with 
20 
your leave we shall make use of the witness which will become the 
Chair’s one and then we will change it when we get it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you going to need that one for …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  For today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For Ms Mokhobo’s evidence. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 8 of 157 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair there is the referencing that we 
have make relating to this. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:  You say at this stage you do not have my bundle? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We do not have yours at this stage Chair 
but we made provision.  We took the witness’s bundle which is clean 
and we were going to use it for Chair today. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then we have a separate copy that we 
10 
have given to the witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MOKHOBO:  And with your leave we will use – Chair will use – will 
have reference to the witness bundle and then it will be replaced before 
the end of the day. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, no it is already there.  It is – we 
placed it there already.  Sorry.  Just in front of you – there thank you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  The rest of the contents of this lever arch file except 
Ms Geldenhuys’ affidavit – or is it an affidavit? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is – right Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are there two affidavits by her? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes the one – yes Chair would recall that 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 9 of 157 
 
she is the one who responds to Minister Carrim’s evidence.  We 
mentioned it yesterday and …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  One has not been deposed to. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes but the deposed one appears at page 
8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ends at page 8? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The 27 t h of January. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the status of the one that has not been 
10 
deposed to? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  She sent the one that was not deposed to 
first and then she subsequently commissioned with her ID number 
redacted in the one that appears from pages 1 to 8. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there any need for the one that is not deposed to? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No Chair, no but because it has already 
been sequenced and paginated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You did not want to …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No we did not want to take it out because 
it will leave that gap.  The affidavit of Mr Theresa Victoria Geldenhuys 
20 
deposed to on the 16 t h of February 2020 and the annexures thereto will 
be marked as – will be admitted and marked as Exhibit CC43. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  And lastly Chair may I 
also ask to introduce another exhibit which Ms Mokhobo is going to 
make – we are going to ask her to refer to that is CC42. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 10 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In this one that is the CC43. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is no other affidavit in it which is not an 
annexure to Ms Geldenhuys’ affidavit? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No Chair she only annexes minutes of 
meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what do you say about this other one? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That one Chair is an affidavit from Ms 
Lindiwe Viola Bayi who is the Company Secretary at the SABC – Group 
Company Secretary at the SABC and her signature appears Chair at 
page 2 and she deposed to that affidavit on the 21 s t of February.  All 
that she does Chair is to authenticate the minutes that she attaches 
20 
together with the original agreement – with a copy of the agreement 
between MultiChoice and SABC.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the other documents are annexures to her 
affidavit? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  They are annexures to her affidavit that is 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 11 of 157 
 
correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The affidavit of Ms Lindiwe Viola Bayi and the 
annexures thereto are admitted and will be marked as Exhibit CC42. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Thank you Chair.  May 
the witness be sworn in Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. Please administer the oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record? 
MS MOKHOBO:  I, Lulama Mokhobo. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath? 
MS MOKHOBO:  No. 
10 
REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your 
conscience? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you will give will be the 
truth; the whole truth and nothing else but the truth, if so please raise 
your right hand and say, so help me God. 
MS MOKHOBO:  So help me God. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Ms Mokhobo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you for coming back Ms Mokhobo 
MS MOKHOBO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I just want to make sure I have got the pronunciation 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 12 of 157 
 
of your surname correctly because somehow I think I have been saying 
– I have been pronouncing it as if the first O is A so if you can just – is 
it Mokhobo? 
MS MOKHOBO:  It is Mokhobo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mokhobo. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes.  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh thank you Chair. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair I have also been 
10 
pronouncing at Mokhobo then not Mokhobo? 
MS MOKHOBO:  That is correct.  Mokhobo 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Mokgobo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja so do not pronounce like IsiZulu or IsiXhosa. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is what I am doing.  I apologise.  
Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is Mokhobo.  Ja okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Ms Mokhobo you have in front 
20 
of you Exhibit CC21 but your – the statement that you are going to 
make reference to today appears from pages 70 onwards and they will 
be under a divider marked C. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And that statement has now been admitted 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 13 of 157 
 
as Exhibit CC21A.  So that is the only one that we will refer to and 
other documents that we may make reference to.   Could you please 
take a look at page 70 and do you identify that as your affidavit? 
MS MOKHOBO:  I do. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay if you go to page 89. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry I wonder whether that microphone is not 
too far. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  From her. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I could hear you but maybe you might bring it – I 
see it is pointing skywards as well. 
10 
MS MOKHOBO:  It was. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe it should – I do not know who interfered maybe 
bend it a little bit. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  At page 89 is that your 
signature? 
20 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And did you depose to that affidavit on the 
16 t h of October 2019 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  And that the contents of that 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 14 of 157 
 
supplementary affidavit true and correct? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  You recall that Chair had 
invited you to submit a statement that deals with the Digital Migration 
Project and that is what you have done, is that correct? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You did testify before the Commission on 
the 4 t h of September 2019? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  What I would like to do is to take you 
10 
to page – to paragraph 44 that appears at page 83 because in terms of 
sequence I believe that is where you should start about your role in the 
SABC Digital Migration Program.  Could you just tell Chair briefly what 
was your role in this program? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Chair I …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the Digital Migration Program. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Migration Program that is correct Chair 
yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Are you looking at – from point 45? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  44 – page 83. 
20 
MS MOKHOBO:  44. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 83. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Chair I thought it was important to locate where I was 
coming from as a Member of the SABC charged with running that 
institution.  And in this paragraph I table my experience.  I had been 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 15 of 157 
 
one of the industry players in the 1980’s to be precise starting from 
1982 as the Head of the now defunct Bop TV edutel which was an 
educational radio and TV section of Bop TV and I was there for 10 
years.  And I go on to say having experienced the power of 
instructional and educational TV and radio technology and content in 
education in rural development particularly in poverty stricken 
communities and having seen teachers with poor qualifications and 
learners whose chance at bright futures were severely threatened by 
their lack of access to quality education blossom as a result of the TV 
and radio technology interventions.  I could therefore grasp the vast 
10 
opportunities that DDT with STB Control enabled technology could 
provide.  I was during the phase when the Broadcasting Digital 
Migration Policy was being developed one of the people who were 
invited to give input.  I was also a Member of the Sentech Board and 
was intimately aware of the possibilities that were at hand.  I therefore 
view the SABC as possibly the best placed organ of state to be at the 
forefront of preparing nation to becoming a citizenry filled with hope 
and determination to learn and apply its learning for the greater good 
of family community and nation.  The participation of the marginalised 
in the digital dividend and knowledge economy would indeed help make 
20 
South Africa a better place for all who live in it.  At a practical level the 
SABC Technology Division reported to me.  I was therefore involved in 
providing strategic insights and playing the critical oversight role of 
ensuring that approved plans were implemented and budget utilisation 
was focussed on critical measurable deliverables.  The most critical of 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 16 of 157 
 
which was the digitising of all areas of the SABC critical to digital 
migration.  I was thus able to share in the strategies research and 
development activities through the creation of the SABC’s own STB 
encrypted laboratory testing facility and the showcasing of SABC’s 
capabilities.  And the showcasing Chair was done at a big convention 
which focussed on DTT and there were internationals who came in with 
all manner of equipment and the SABC actually won I think it was a 
silver award for what they showed.  The showed their interactivity.  
They almost went as far as to show even gaming as one of the options 
that could be included if the Set Top Box was encrypted. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And you say you worked there with – 
you mentioned Mr Sipho Masinga? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And what role did he play? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Mr Masinga was the Group Executive for Technology. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  A very well trained engineer with numerous related 
qualifications and he showed an astuteness and creativity that if 
harnessed even after I had left the SABC would have led the 
organisation into going beyond its traditional broadcasting role and 
20 
becoming a non-linear hub of knowledge through technological 
possibilities provided by Digital Broadcasting and User Receiver 
Technology and here I mean the Set Top Boxes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Encrypted Set Top Boxes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 17 of 157 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So if then with that background that you 
have given the Chair when then the whole proposal about how this 
relationship between MultiChoice and the SABC was going to work you 
had the best appreciation of what would have – what would benefit the 
SABC? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  I did. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then I am going to take you back 
ma’am to page 72 now because there you just highlight the events that 
10 
led up to that led to the signing of the agreement between MultiChoice 
and the SABC.   
CHAIRPERSON:  I do not know whether I got this from reading 
statements or whether it was evidence that you did cover in your – or it 
was something that you did cover in your evidence previously but I do 
recall – I seem to recall that in your evidence you did say that this 
agreement was signed on a day when you were away from work – you 
were on leave or something.  So the only reason why I am mentioning 
that is obviously that we do not need to cover what you have already 
covered before.  But Ms Norman would be alive to that. 
20 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 18 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But obviously it might be necessary to go back a little 
bit so as to connect the story properly. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  It just goes back by I think a day 
Chair and \ then …(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine.  That is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  On the 15 t h of May could 
you just tell Chair what – summarise what happened on the 15 t h of May 
2013? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Chair I make a statement here which is very aligned to 
statements that the Chair has heard from the Minister yesterday and 
from other members of his team who have testified here.  And here I 
say on the 15 t h of May 2013 when MultiChoice wrote a set of proposed 
provisions to Mr Motsoeneng that would form the basis of the 
MultiChoice and SABC Multi Channel Agreement, MultiChoice had seen 
20 
an opportunity to cause a major policy shift in the Digital Terrestrial 
Transformation Project.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and you refer to Annexure 1 which 
appears at page 90 which was a letter addressed – are you there? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 19 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 90 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is a letter that was addressed to Mr 
Hlaudi.  Who wrote that letter to him? 
MS MOKHOBO:  It was …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Hlaudi Motsoeneng I beg your pardon. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes the letter was written by Mr Imtiaz Patel the then 
CEO of MultiChoice. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then if you go to the – well we 
10 
do not have to deal with all of those because they are – they form part 
of some of the terms of the agreement but I will take you to the crucial 
terms which you are here to talk about. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Today.  And then could you just tell the 
Chair then what happened on the 6 t h of June according to your 
statement because it is where …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If no other witness has dealt with the contents of the 
20 
…(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The letter it might be important that even if Ms 
Mokhobo does not read the whole letter. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 20 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  She highlights the main features of the letter as she 
says it here. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  Would you 
proceed to do so Ms Mokhobo? 
MS MOKHOBO:  I shall Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  The letter begins with a thanking of the SABC I guess 
Mr Motsoeneng for the meetings – constructive meetings and open 
dialogues that they had regarding the development of a mutually 
beneficial agreement between SABC and MultiChoice.  He goes on to 
10 
say: 
“As you are aware it is our intention that a wider 
partnership between the SABC and MCA has developed 
over time.  We appreciate that the SABC has to fulfil its 
mandate as Public Broadcaster in South Africa but at the 
same time it is the leading and most diverse free to a 
broadcaster operating in the country.  MCA believes that 
building a partnership with the SABC will be beneficial to 
both organisations.  MCA’s primary business is content, 
…(indistinct), technology and platform development.  
20 
MCA has an active subscriber base of some 4.5 million 
digital satellite households and provides access to some 
20 million viewers in South Africa.  We believe that MCA 
can assist SABC in enhancing on its mandate as Public 
Broadcaster and immediately expand its free to air

broadcasting operations.  DTT in South Africa is 
currently in a mess with risk for the all existing 
broadcasters.  free to air broadcasters are faced with 
the challenge of advertising reviews being diluted over a 
number of free to air channels.  Pay TV broadcasters on 
DTT have limited capacity available which reduces the 
ability to provide an attractive multi-channel pay offering 
to subscribers.  The SABC will have to invest in the 
content for its DTT platform with advertiser revenues 
only being generated much later once the free to air DTT 
10 
platform and base has been established.  We propose 
that the SABC and MCA work together to develop their 
respective DTT and or digital satellite platforms.  This 
can take the form of cooperation agreements and 
channel supply agreements.  This will provide the SABC 
immediate access to MCA’s active digital satellite 
subscriber 
base 
with 
an 
opportunity 
to 
generate 
guaranteed channel revenue and advertising revenue 
from day one.  This presents the SABC with substantial 
potential upside for success of its operations and the 
20 
free to air DTT platform.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Can I just take you then directly to the 
proposal at page 91? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.   
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 22 of 157 
 
MS MOKHOBO:  “The Channel Supply Proposal. 
1.1  The SABC will provide MCA with the following 
channels, an exclusive entertainment channel, SABC 
Premium and a 24 hour news channel SABC News.   
In the return for the delivery of the channels listed above 
by SABC MultiChoice will pay the SABC a flat fee of 
R500 million payable over a period of five years.  The 
SABC will bear the full costs for the production of the 
channels.  The SABC shall retain all advertising 
generated on these channels.  The Entertainment 
10 
Channel will be exclusive to MCA and MCA will be 
authorised to distribute the Entertainment Channel on its 
distribution platforms.  The SABC News channel will be 
exclusive to MCA satellite platform and MCA will be 
authorised to distribute the SABC News channel on all 
its distribution platforms.  The SABC will however be 
allowed to distribute the SABC News channel on its own 
free to air DTT platform subject to points 9 below.” 
I suppose I should go directly to point 9 below? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes please. 
MS MOKHOBO:  “The offer presupposes that all SABC channels 
on its DTT platform will be made available to the public 
unencrypted, without a conditional access system and 
thereby

decoder.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  And that becomes the 
issue that you raise at the meeting of the 6 t h of June 2013? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you just quickly go to paragraphs 
11.1 and 11.2 where you deal with the proposed terms of the agreement 
that you canvassed largely at the meeting that would – we are now at 
page 72 – back to page 72. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Back to page 72.  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
10 
MS MOKHOBO:  What would you like me to …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes if you turn the page. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  This is where you discuss the terms that 
were contentious. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That were discussed points 9 and point 10 
of the draft agreement that was submitted I believe at the meeting – 
that was debated at the meeting. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Could you just quickly tell the 
Chair what – why did you have a problem with those particular clauses? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Chair I had a very serious problem with points 9 
…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 24 of 157 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman will that cover paragraph 11 of her 
…(intervenes)? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is paragraph 11 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Paragraph 11. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Are you there? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
10 
MS MOKHOBO:  Paragraph 11 should I read paragraph 11? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you can read ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Okay. 
“On 6 June 2013 the SABC Interim Board and MCA’s 
Chairman Mr Lidela, CEO Mr Imtiaz Patel together with 
Mr Greg Humbaga met to discuss the substance of the 
future multi-channel agreement as a follow up to the 
letter referred to in point 9 above.  Of particular 
20 
contention as maybe gleaned from the verbatim minutes 
of the said meeting were two provisions that effectively 
dictated the SABC’s 2008 digital migration broadcast 
policy based strategy on Set Top Box encryption.” 
They state Point 9: 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 25 of 157 
 
“The off presupposes that all SABC Channels on its DTT 
Platform will be made available to the public and 
encrypted without a conditional access system and 
thereby incidentally receivable by the MCA DT Decoder.” 
Point 10 states: 
“MCA, the SABC, Sentech is required work together to 
promote coverage of all the SABC free to air channels on 
the SABC free to air.  Multiplex will be made available to 
MCA Satellite Platform subject to available capacity.  
This is in order to enable the SABC to generate revenue 
10 
from day one.” 
Point 12.  This is where I began to explain why the two clauses 
were problematic. 
“I was joined by SABC Board Member Mr Mavuso in 
categorically stating that points 9 and 10 were not 
enforceable through the future Multichannel Agreement 
and 
entirely 
depended 
on 
the 
Department 
of 
Communications and Governments deciding to amend 
the 2008 BDM Policy to reflect the change.  Moreover 
the DOC had begun a Must Carry Regulations review 
20 
process which could ultimately lead to the SABC being 
paid for any channels that were broadcast through MCA 
and other satellite platforms.” 
So essentially Chair we were sitting with people with very 
serious commercial interests who effectively wanted to dominate the 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 26 of 157 
 
market by hook or crook and they saw the SABC as probably the most 
critical organisation which could lend credence to their attempt at 
basically taking the entire market over and shutting out anybody who 
tried to be a decentre. 
The BDM Policy of 2008 Chair as far as I was concerned as 
the person who had been placed in that organisation to not only run it, 
but safeguard its duty in the current state and in the future and ensure 
the – that from all perspectives of its mission and vision that it covered 
them and the core mission of the SABC was to empower the citizenry of 
South Africa and how do you empower the citizenry if you do not do it 
10 
via information. 
Best placed organisation to provide on the spot information 
throughout the country without filters.  Now the citizens would at the 
time and I think it is worse now Chair with the losses of jobs that we 
are seeing in the country with the deepening of employment crisis and 
the deepening of poverty.  They deserved to be given an opportunity to 
have access to any piece of information that they would need. 
An encrypted DT box would enable a return path that would 
enable a citizen sitting anywhere in the country for as long as they had 
a TV set.  Even the old black and white box would be able to work 
20 
through the Set Top Box.  Would be able to search for information on 
the internet using that box.  We had also and this was also a policy 
provision and I do cover that later, but if you will allow me 
…(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  You can deal with it now. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 27 of 157 
 
MS MOKHOBO:  Advocate. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Certainly. 
MS MOKHOBO:  We had also been enjoined through the BDM Policy to 
ensure that the Set Top Boxes would have a return path and that return 
path would enable a telephone capability whether it would be via a cord 
or if with the sophistication that we have in the country now – via 
Bluetooth or whatever means and with Telkom also been a State Entity 
coming on Board as a provider of telephony countrywide to enable also 
over and above its core function of enable people to talk to each other 
via the phone, but to enable access to their internet network that would 
10 
come through the Set Top Box. 
 
So effectively old people, young people in faraway places 
would not have to travel the distances that they would need to travel to 
get to any place where they would require help.  Whether it would be 
for registering a child’s birth, for registering an old lady to receive 
pension and for all manner of things that I cannot off the top of my 
head mention right now.  The list is too long. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would include internet cafes and so on? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They would not have to – young people would not 
20 
have to try and go and – distances to look for those. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Indeed Chair …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MOKHOBO:  And the beauty of it all …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 28 of 157 
 
MS MOKHOBO:  Is they would not have to spend a penny, because 
they would have their own internet café at home.  They would be able 
to go in and do their research.  I am very passionate about education 
Chair.  I come from an educator background.  I am very, very 
passionate about education and we know how in trouble our schooling 
system is. 
How we – our children continue to not to do well and not very 
long ago there was a research document that was published which 
suggested that the standard of education in our country seems to be 
going lower instead of getting better. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I would not be surprised if that is true. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I would not be surprised.  I watch celebrations about 
Matric results and I think that the families whose children celebrate 
their achievements are entitled to celebrate.  That is good, but I think 
we do not put enough emphasis on many learners who did not make it 
up to Matric and I think that recently it was said that in terms of 
Africans that figure is about half – if I am not – or even more than half. 
If you look at those who started together at Grade 1.  That by 
the time that class reaches Matric and passes it is not less than half 
20 
who did not go up to Matric.  They drop out or stop at some stage and 
when we celebrate those who have achieved we need to worry about 
those as well who have been lost in the system.  So I share your 
passion for education. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Thank you Chair. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 29 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you were saying that there is so much of value 
that the SABC would have been able to give to the citizenry if the 
encrypted Set Top Boxes had been continued with in terms of the 
Digital Migration and what MultiChoice and Naspers wanted to do was 
to effectively strengthen their monopoly of – their dominance of the 
market, but in effect the consequences and effects on the citizenry 
were far reaching? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Indeed Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Indeed.  I saw how children and their teachers would – 
they would actually glow at how much they could understand concepts 
better, because they would have somebody who knows the subject 
matter better.  Teaching to them via television.  They would be able to 
see experiments.  A lot of these schools do not have laboratories and 
yet we decry the fact that we do not have enough children trained in 
science and mathematics. 
How do you get trained – how do they get trained in those 
when they do not have laboratories and secondly when the teachers 
20 
themselves do not have the appropriate qualifications or ability to 
impart the knowledge.  So you would be able to get almost a distance 
learning program running throughout the country with the best teachers 
and the children would be able to watch those programs and if they 
could not watch them at the time when they run and that is where the 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 30 of 157 
 
PVR functionality is so important. 
They could set their PVR to record the program for 
themselves.  So when they get home at the time when they are studying 
they could switch on and watch it.  The same case goes for the 
teachers themselves who would be able to use the information they get 
to better match the information and learning requirements of their 
children, but as we know the challenge does not go away.  At least not 
right now. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So effectively one of the points you make is that one 
of the advantages would have been that when for example we talk 
10 
about challenges about maths and science teachers and maths and 
science as subjects in very many schools in our country and talk about 
the fact that very many schools do not have qualified maths and 
science teachers. 
This could have resulted in a situation where a teacher who 
is very well qualified could actually be accessed in a way by millions in 
the country if he or she was teaching maths or science.  So that even 
though you might not have a qualified teacher in maths and science.  
You could benefit quite a lot from this teacher who might be – these 
teachers who might be providing lessons through this program. 
20 
MS MOKHOBO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
MS MOKHOBO:  And I know that MultiChoice will probably argue that 
they do have a learning channel on their platform and that learning 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 31 of 157 
 
channel provides for that.  Remember the facts of the matter is a lot – 
millions actually of South Africans cannot afford to pay those 
subscription fees. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exactly.  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  They cannot and what happens is …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MOKHOBO:  If they fail to pay …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MOKHOBO:  They are unplugged. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS MOKHOBO:  They are switched off. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  So the whole argument that the SABC or people like 
myself …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Who wanted encryption …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Wanted to be able to switch citizens off.  It was the 
most nonsensical argument ever, ever Chair.  There is no way that 
anybody would switch anybody off, but people would be able to get 
20 
access to their education at zero cost to themselves.  All they needed 
to have …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Is the electricity to run the TV. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 32 of 157 
 
MS MOKHOBO:  Is to be able to connect to the port.  It is to be – you 
know the PVR …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Functionality would enable them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
MS MOKHOBO:  That is all Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then on the 2 n d of July 
whilst you were on leave the – it is now common cause the agreement 
was signed? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and I just want to take you to that 
agreement.  Chair that agreement appears in Exhibit CC42. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just before …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I am sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We go there. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
Prior 
to 
MultiChoice’s 
letter 
addressed 
to 
Mr Motsoeneng arriving.  Had you been aware of any discussions that 
might have been taking place prior to that between anybody from SABC 
and MultiChoice about any possible cooperation? 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 33 of 157 
 
MS MOKHOBO: 
 
Chair, 
discussions 
around 
cooperating 
with 
MultiChoice began at the time when I had just begun at the SABC 
…(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  In 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  When the – Parliament – Members of Cabinet were 
getting very upset with the SABC for not establishing the 24-hour news 
channel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS MOKHOBO:  There were elections coming up.  There was so much 
pressure on the SABC to create space for a lot of news and in 
particular …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  The coverage of different political parties and etcetera 
and the SABC on its own could not create the channel, because there 
was a ruling that all the space that was available was going to be used 
for the future and we could not touch it and therefore we could not 
create a new channel on the SABC and so the only other alternative 
was to then go to MultiChoice and discuss the possibility and it turned 
20 
out that many people had already been lobbying MultiChoice for the 
possibility of having a 24 …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Hour news channel. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 34 of 157 
 
MS MOKHOBO:  So our discussions began then Chair and in my 
previous admission I did state that nothing came of those initial 
discussions and contract, because the money that MultiChoice was 
willing to pay was too little. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  I think I remember that, ja. 
MS MOKHOBO:  The critical thing Chair is that the contract did not 
have any of these very strange clauses that became a bone of 
contention for many of us. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  If I may just 
10 
take you to CC42 – Exhibit CC42 which is the affidavit of 
Ms ...(indistinct) – Ms …(indistinct) at page 161.  That agreement 
begins from page 153, but I would like to draw your attention to 161.  
Are you there? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes Advocate.  Yes.  I am there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Could you 
please just read – there are two clauses I would like you to place on 
record and the one is clause 2.1.3.  Has Chair found it?  Page 161 
Chair.  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am at page 161. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  One, yes Chair.  Just for reference.  Chair 
may want to have a look at page 153. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that where it starts? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Where it starts for the witness to identify 
what that agreement is. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 35 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  It is important for us …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To be able to say the …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The agreement starts from page so and so 
…(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  150 …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And goes up …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To page so and so. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then we can go to the particular page. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It goes up to page – it has got a lot of 
annexures.  Page 199. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you identify what that agreement is 
20 
just on page 153? 
MS MOKHOBO:  On page 1 …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  153. 
MS MOKHOBO:  153. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 36 of 157 
 
MS MOKHOBO:  It is a Commercial and Master Channel Distribution 
Agreement 
between 
MultiChoice 
(Pty) 
Ltd 
and 
South 
African 
Broadcasting Corporation …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  SOC Ltd. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then may I just refer you to 
page 161. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC: 
 
Could 
you 
please 
have 
a 
look 
…(intervenes)? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that is a separate agreement from the other one 
that we have been – we were discussing yesterday with Mr Carrim? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is a – this one is the same …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is the same. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From that one or is it the same agreement? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is the same Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MS MOKHOBO:  It is the same agreement Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay.  Alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  It is the same agreement.  Thank 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Could you just read 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 37 of 157 
 
paragraphs 2 – clauses 2.1.3 and 2.15? 
MS MOKHOBO:  2.1.3 states: 
“MCA will pay the SABC an annual fee of R100 million 
excluding VAT during the time in consideration of the 
rights granted and obligations undertaken by the SABC.  
Increase by 5% per annum during each year of the term 
as from the anniversary of the start date with an amount 
of R30 million being payable within 30 days of the start 
date as a refundable advance in part payment of the 
annual fees for the first year of the agreement pending 
10 
the launch of the pay TV channels.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then 2.1.5. 
MS MOKHOBO:  “The channel signals for the SABC/FTA 
Channels as transmitted in South Africa would at all 
times be available to and receivable on the M-Net DTT 
Set Top Boxes distributed in South Africa.  The SABC 
agrees that the SABC FTA Channels will not at any time 
be encrypted or allowed any conditional access system 
to be applied in respective of the channel signals for the 
SABC FTA Channels transmitted on the SABC DTT 
20 
Platform in South Africa.  So that viewers are able to 
view SABC FTA Channels without requiring anything 
other than the installation of the M-Net DTT Set Top 
Box.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Would I be correct to say that that 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 38 of 157 
 
was similar to what clause 9 was in the proposal? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Indeed Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, but then if you go to that final 
agreement and you go to clause 9.  You will find that it deals with 
something different.  clause 9 will be at page – I beg your pardon Chair 
– would be at page 173. 
MS MOKHOBO:  I am there Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Are you there; and then it deals with SMS 
…(intervenes). 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And that is not what was in the proposed – 
original proposed one which you objected to?  What I am saying it was 
not clause 9 then. 
MS MOKHOBO:  No.  It was not …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Clause 9 then. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let us hear first what clause 9 says. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  clause 9 – could you just read 
quickly what clause 9 says? 
20 
MS MOKHOBO:  “MCA shall provide or cause to be provided 
Subscriber Management Services (“SMS”) in the 
performance benchmark MCA shall …” 
Sorry.  I think I have skipped a page.  I do apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 39 of 157 
 
MS MOKHOBO:  Let me read it again. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MOKHOBO:  “MCA shall provide or cause to be provided 
Subscriber Management Services (“SMS”) in the 
channels as maybe included by MCA on its 
television platforms as generally accepted and 
understood in the industry at the date of signature 
hereof. 
 
The 
SABC 
acknowledges 
that 
all 
proprietary and intellectual property rights rising 
from conduct by MCA of the SMS shell is between 
10 
the SABC and MAC rests exclusively in MCA.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you and in – maybe in 
fairness just to balance up whatever we are going to deal with in the 
end …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was a point you made.  I did not get it 
…(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About whether this captured something that was in 
the proposal or something. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Will you just deal with that again?  I did not 
…(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You did not get that one Chair? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No.  Chair, I had referred the witness – I 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 40 of 157 
 
had asked the witness Ms Mokhobo to read paragraph 2.1 – clause 
2.1.5 …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And the question that followed was 
because this dealt with whatever was going to be furnished would not 
be encrypted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So I asked her whether that was similar to 
the clause 9 that she objected to and then she said yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes …(intervenes). 
MS MOKHOBO:  H’mm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But she could – just repeat what you said 
in reference to clause 2.1.5? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Chair, if I may just clarify …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Something quickly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MOKHOBO:  The letter was a proposal and out of propose or the 
proposal they then drafted the agreement. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Therefore you will find clause 9 appearing in a 
different clause on the contract itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 41 of 157 
 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  So there is nothing that has been removed.  What has 
rather happened …(intervenes)? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  It was substantial and not captured? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What was in the letter in substance found its way to 
the agreement? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
MS MOKHOBO:  All of what was in the letter …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  All of what was in the letter. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Plus there were some additional clauses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Such as the SMS clause …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Which was not in the original …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
MS MOKHOBO:  Proposal letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 42 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  So in essence then 
when this then was signed then one would have expected that there 
must have been agreement now between MultiChoice and SABC to say 
keep your nine – clauses 9 and 10.  We are happy with them. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Seemingly Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and in your discussions with us and 
when we went through the minutes which I had asked you to go through 
them.  Did you manage to get hold of a minute that would show that on 
the – at the meeting of the 2 n d of July 2013 which you did not attend 
10 
there was approval of that agreement? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Chair, there is a very strange set of minutes.  
Advocate could you please …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Guide us to the exact …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Pages in the files? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  May I take you Chair to 
exhibit …(intervenes)? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe while you are looking Ms Norman. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Can I just ask this? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Mokhobo, prior to your going on leave and I am 
talking about the leave when in your absence the agreement was 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 43 of 157 
 
signed.  Had you been informed or where you aware that the 
interactions between SABC and MultiChoice had reached a stage where 
an agreement could be signed anytime? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Chair, the last meeting that we had with MultiChoice 
was the meeting where myself and other Board Members, notably 
Mr Mavuso, raised very sharply our discomfort with the two clauses and 
the fact of the matter was that they were going to be reviewed or 
removed, because there was no way that I could have sat there and 
agreed that the law be broken. 
Policies, statements from Government becomes law.  There 
10 
was no way I could have been party to that happening.  So that meeting 
had discussed quite intensely – it was – shall I say there was a little bit 
of camaraderie in that meeting.  There was a little bit of joking 
backwards and forwards. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Between MultiChoice and SABC? 
MS MOKHOBO:  And SABC …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
MS MOKHOBO:  But there was absolutely clarity on things that should 
not have been in discussion …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS MOKHOBO:  As being included in the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Therefore it was quite surprising …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MOKHOBO:  When I read the letter. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 44 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MOKHOBO:  That they sent to Mr Motsoeneng.  That those clauses 
were still there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Those suggestions were still there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Which they had been tabled as conditions precedence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MOKHOBO:  You cannot hold an entity like the …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
10 
MS MOKHOBO:  SABC to ransom like that but …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MOKHOBO:  There was a veiled threat.  That it is either you agree 
to these clauses or we walk away.  Chair, I may be criticised for this, 
but I would rather have walked away …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MOKHOBO:  From the contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Than to compromise the SABC in this way 
…(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  H’mm. 
MS MOKHOBO:  And Chair I think it is very important that I bring to 
your attention that following my submission at the previous sitting 
where I presented. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In the Commission? 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 45 of 157 
 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  In the Commission.  I got a call from a Star 
Newspaper journalist who said to me there were people who were 
saying I had lied and I think it actually made its way to a lead story in 
one of the – in the Star.  Wherein whoever sent them that letter – the 
letter of my response to MultiChoice when I was acknowledging that we 
have received the letter. 
However there have to be discussions that will look at 
arriving at – how did I put it?  Arriving at terms that will be agreeable to 
10 
both parties and that was very clear.  You cannot come to me and say 
this is what I want and we agree that we will discuss and arrive at 
terms that we can both agree on and you go off and create what you – 
sorry Chair to be saying you. 
So what the journalist then did was to write that story and 
then without bringing focus to the fact that I had said categorically on 
terms that will be agreed.  They made it seem like I was lying.  I had 
written that letter to MultiChoice which meant that I agreed with those 
terms.  When it was totally untrue and I remember Chair the following 
day there was a further thing that said Mokhobo lied and this had to do 
20 
with the TNA breakfast or our relationship with the Guptas. 
It is scares me what the media can do, because my reputation 
was essentially thrown into the toilet.  Over a matter as crucial as this 
that should not have been trifled with in that way.  I just thought I 
should bring it up too. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 46 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  That is fine.  You just need to make sure that the 
letter that you wrote that if it is not already with the Commission that it 
is with the Commission, so that would be important.   Now so just in 
terms of sequence of events the meeting that SABC had with 
MultiChoice where you say you and Mr Mavuso made it quite clear that 
these two points were not going to be agreed to as far as you are 
concerned, that meeting – did that meeting take place prior to the letter 
from MultiChoice to Mr Motsoeneng that we saw earlier?  
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes Chair the discussion came up. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You can’t remember the date or we might be able to 
10 
find the date, we don’t have to look for it if we – oh you can ja okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   I can yes Chair, the letter to Motsoeneng 
is the 15 t h of May 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And the meeting that Ms Mokhobo 
referred to is the meeting of the 6 t h of June 2013. 
MS MOKHOBO:   Thank you for triggering my memory there Advocate, 
indeed that meeting was discussing the contents of ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   In that time, so the meeting was after the letter? 
MS MOKHOBO:   The meeting was after the letter. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay. 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Now did Mr Motsoeneng attend that meeting? 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes he did. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He was there. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 47 of 157 
 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Do you remember what his stance was on the issue if 
inclusion if he articulated any view at all? 
MS MOKHOBO:   Chair ...(intervenes) 
CHAIRPERSON:   It might be just ...(intervenes). 
MS MOKHOBO:   It would be hard for me to remember verbatim what 
he said but I do know that he mentions that those clauses were a non-
issue. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
10 
MS MOKHOBO:   I am not sure whether he said that at that meeting or 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or at another meeting. 
MS MOKHOBO:   At a subsequent meeting, but to him those clauses 
were a non-issue and could be dropped, or sorry, should be or could be 
included. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh he was saying they were non-issue as far as the 
SABC was concerned from his point of view? 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So he was taking a view that was different from 
20 
yours and Mr Mavuso? 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Because you were feeling very strongly that they 
should be dropped. 
MS MOKHOBO:   Indeed. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 48 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you say that the meeting was characterised by a 
positive spirit. 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   In the sense that it was not fighting as such, 
everyone was taking or rather you and Mr Mavuso were taking a very 
firm view on these two points and from MultiChoice side from what you 
said I infer that they didn’t seem to be very opposed to dropping them, 
they didn’t seem to be too emphatic at that meeting at least? 
MS MOKHOBO:   Chair they were very emphatic. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They were emphatic that they ...(intervenes). 
10 
MS MOKHOBO:   That’s where the words condition precedence came 
from. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:   That it is either those clauses were included or 
nothing. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay, so MultiChoice on the one side and you 
and Mr Mavuso on the – well MultiChoice on the one side and Mr 
Motsoeneng they were quite firm that these clauses should be part of 
the agreement. 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You and Mr Mavuso were quite firm that they should 
not. 
MS MOKHOBO:   They shouldn’t be yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay.  So the meeting – did the meeting end on 
the basis that there seemed to be an impasse on these two points or 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 49 of 157 
 
how did the meeting end, was there to be a follow up meeting or was 
there just to be a letter that would be sent. 
MS MOKHOBO:   The meeting ended up on a note that there would 
have 
to 
be 
a 
thorough 
review 
of 
these 
matters, 
Advocate 
...(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Maybe I could direct Chair to the 
resolution. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   We’re talking the meeting of the 6 t h am I 
correct?  Is Chair still asking about the meeting of the 6 t h? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   The meeting between MultiChoice and SABC 
...(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, that’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
Subsequent 
to 
the 
letter 
for 
MultiChoice 
...(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes Chair so this is the meeting of the 6 t h 
Chair, that appears in Bundle CC42. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   That – the minutes will begin from page 
15 and ...(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   You say Exhibit CC4? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   CC42. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, do we have that here or not? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes we do have Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, okay.   Okay now I am confused, CC42, it 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 50 of 157 
 
sounded like 64, okay right, what is the page? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank Chair, the page where you will find 
there is this what we’ve got there is no resolution per se but I think I 
will direct Chair to what the chairman says in the end. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   The Chair – sorry Chair – you were 
chairing the meeting Ms Mokhobo am I correct? 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes I was chairing the meeting. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   You were chairing the meeting yes, I am 
just looking for where you say, but answer the question that the Chair 
10 
had asked first about what Mr Motsoeneng’s attitude was, Chair would 
find that at page 19, if I may just quickly read that.    
“Thank you Chair, as far as I am concerned this is not 
an issue anymore from where I am sitting because the 
Minister 
pronounced 
herself 
about 
this 
matter.  
Remember the eTV and us and so on, that case, the 
issue here is we are not going to go that route as far 
as I am aware personally.  The conditional access, the 
way we call it technically is not going to be because 
now but the DOC is reviewing the policy to deal with 
20 
this matter. Even in Parliament during the budget 
speech now I remember the Minister did highlight this 
issue, so I don’t think it is an issue now, whether we – 
and then there is a space – both of us I think for me 
Chair I think for now it is a non-issue because it is a 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 51 of 157 
 
policy that even government is reviewing because 
from our side well we have different views, this is not 
official what I am saying.  The views was that as 
SABC we can’t allow people to by law we can’t switch 
off people’s TV license if they don’t pay TV license, 
that is the standpoint they took, but not as a collective 
but different views and that different views influenced 
the DOC to review the policy to check whether really 
this is necessary for SABC.  So that is our 
standpoint.” 
10 
And Chair – I beg your pardon?   Yes, and then page – and 
then – this is what Ms Tshabalala says on the same page: 
“Thank you Mthias for giving us that feedback.  I think 
you know all relationships we have got to find a way 
of a win-win situation.  I think if I may reign or if other 
Board Members would really like your input on this 
maybe through your Chairperson since you have 
presented this condition if you can just give a day to 
bounce it to the Minister because you know we have 
as Mr Mavuso mentioned we have an unclear position 
20 
on the matter and then we can approve all others 
except for that one, and we can revert back to you but 
of course we have to agree to all others, so I would 
like CO to go to the other clauses, thank you.” 
And then Ms Mokhobo says: 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 52 of 157 
 
“Okay yes so we hold clause 10, clause 9 in abeyance 
while we get absolute clarity because what we need is 
a written confirmation of the stance and we cannot 
presuppose a relationship on the basis of what is not 
written.  A statement is a statement until it is 
committed to paper.  Thank you for that Chair.  The 
second clause, which is clause 10 ...” 
And then she goes on to deal with clause 10, and then in the 
end it is decided if we could – are you there Ms Mokhobo?   Are you 
finding where ...(intervenes)? 
10 
MS MOKHOBO:   I am struggling to find the pages, I’m sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh is that so. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Oh, we’ve left you, it’s CC42, on the 
spine of the file. 
MS MOKHOBO:   Oh!  Which one? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   It’s CC42. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It should be written CC42.   
MS MOKHOBO:   Oh, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Oh, I beg your pardon, I thought you were 
on there.    
20 
MS MOKHOBO:   My apologies. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes thank you, could ...(intervenes). 
MS MOKHOBO:   And it is ...(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   I was reading from page 19, this appears 
to be a transcript of the minutes, am I right? 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 53 of 157 
 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes, correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And then in the end this is what is stated. 
CHAIRPERSON:   When you saying the end on what page are you? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Then the end Chair would be page 24. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, and there – sorry maybe before we 
get to 24 I just want to get to where Ms Mokhobo concludes the 
meeting, it goes on, I beg your pardon Chair, I just need to find it.  And 
then okay – then at page 23, this is what Ms Tshabalala says yes, this 
is the one I was looking for because I did direct, ja Chair we can just 
10 
towards the end of that page Chair, I think five lines towards the end. 
“Ja, Chair we can just give you the comfort that we 
are taking the matter there and we are also expressed 
urgency into the meeting so when you go to the Board 
on the 12 t h there is a resolution.  Well thank you very 
much, thank you.” 
So from the documents that we referred Minister Carrim to 
yesterday there was an indication that there was going to be a Board 
Meeting on the 12 t h of June 2013. 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes, yes Chair. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And according to your understanding at 
this meeting which you had with MultiChoice was the issue about 
clauses 9 and 10 resolved? 
MS MOKHOBO:   No. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, thank you.  And then if I may take 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 54 of 157 
 
you to the next minute which appears Chair at page 112 on the same 
bundle, CC42, this is the minutes of a special finance investment 
procurement and technology meeting.   Or maybe before we go there, I 
beg your pardon, let’s deal with the one behind after that which is the 
12 t h of June, because there was going to be a Board Meeting on the 
12 t h of June. 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Now if that ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe before that Ms Norman there is something 
that I find strange in that meeting, is it 6 t h of June? 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   6 t h of June yes Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, about the fact that those representing the SABC 
are not speaking with one voice, one expects normally that if you have 
a meeting like that with another organisation there would have been 
discussions among those from SABC who would attend such a meeting 
and the right person to state the SABC’s position would be the one to 
speak and state the SABC’s position, is this normal that it happened 
this way because you now have yourself and Mr Mavuso stating how 
you see the matters, you have Motsoeneng taking a view that’s 
different from your view.   I don’t know whether Ms Tshabalala was 
20 
taken any view at that stage, but you were the CEO so something says 
to me how does the COO come to a meeting like that and express his 
own view? 
MS MOKHOBO:   Chair ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   But maybe my way of looking at it is not the right 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 55 of 157 
 
way, maybe the position is maybe why not all the people are supposed 
to be at the meeting representing SABC afraid to express their own 
different views as opposed to expressing the view of the organisation. 
MS MOKHOBO:   Chair this was a very, very sad time at the SABC 
where there was literally a chasm between the group executives, those 
led by Motsoeneng and those led by myself and myself not being the 
most liked person by the Chair of the SABC.   She mentions – I do not 
have the minutes and perhaps Advocate you would be able to find 
exactly where she talks about clandestine meetings. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I think there was a reference to clandestine  
10 
meetings ...(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Chair that’s ...(indistinct)  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:   There was a reference to clandestine meetings where 
she held these meetings with Hlaudi and his team and they made their 
own conclusions about what needed to happen DTT and neither myself 
nor the Group Executive of Technology, Sipho Masinga, were privy to t 
those meetings, they were held entirely in secret, so we were all taken 
aback when they came with a position that was contrary, because I 
believed, and so did other people within the organisation who worked 
20 
with me, that we are an organ of state and are governed by the rules, 
the laws and policies of the State and that unless there is a change in 
a rule or a policy we cannot deviate from it. 
 
And for me it really didn’t matter how other people could see 
the future unfolding without government being involved.  For me it was 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 56 of 157 
 
important that we stay within the law and maybe I am very pedantic and 
in fact it was said at some point that I was a WWW …(indistinct, African 
language) or something like that, meaning that I plodded – I refused to 
make critical decisions on things that when I felt that I could not take a 
decision on a matter because it was unlawful I said that and some 
people didn’t like it, so this was one of those instances where people 
went away and managed to convince the Chair that what they were 
proposing was a better deal and it had nothing to do with me, I was not 
involved, I was not privy to it 
 
So it was not surprising that at that meeting there were two 
10 
camps the Mavuso Lulama Camp that said no and then there was this 
other camp that Hlaudi was running with. 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am very interested and maybe this can be dealt 
with at a later stage, but I am very interested in understanding how that 
came about because as I hear evidence relating to the SABC part of 
what I am trying to understand is, were there forces outside of the 
SABC that were effectively dictating what was happening within the 
SABC or what certain people within the SABC were doing and if so who 
were the people involved in doing that?    
Because normally if you are the leader of an organisation you 
20 
are the head, everybody needs to accept that you are the head and you 
have the right to pronounce on certain issues as between the GCEO 
and the Board there would be the separation of where the Board comes 
in, where the executive comes in but you know the leader, the head of 
the organisation on certain issues you know must pronounce and before 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 57 of 157 
 
he or she does so she or he may consult with his or her colleagues and 
hear different views and those colleagues are supposed to accept that 
their views might not consult with her views or his views but that she or 
he being the head will make the judgment call, and that’s it, but now 
you have a situation where in a meeting with an organisation from 
outside about what agreement could be reached you have the GCEO 
and a Board Member taking one view, you have a COO in this meeting 
taking a view that is contrary to that articulated by the GCEO and the 
Member of the Board, it just looks very, very ugly, you know. 
So if in terms of your evidence today there is something that 
10 
you might be able to configure it in getting me to understand how the 
SABC came to that and to understand whether there were people from 
outside the SABC who were responsible for this, that would help, 
because one wants to see whether the SABC was captured by 
somebody or what, okay.     
MS MOKHOBO:   I’m not sure if Chair wants me to respond to some of 
this? 
CHAIRPERSON:   If there is something you can say now you can do so. 
MS MOKHOBO:   Chair the SABC had been contested terrain for years 
prior to my going there – in there.  There were people who reported to 
20 
other people in powerful places and they would try to throw their weight 
around and impose their will.  I think the former Minister yesterday 
articulated how he was told by Mr Motsoeneng in no uncertain terms 
about certain issues that Mr Motsoeneng had no right knowing about.  
He boasted to me many times how he was close to the President, how 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 58 of 157 
 
he had been at the President’s until two am, how this or the other, 
President, President, and I think I mentioned in the previous session 
when I said in front of you Chair that there would be Ministers coming 
to see Mr Motsoeneng and not me, which was strange as the head of 
the company if you have the high ranking individual you would expect 
them to see you, but there were agendas and sub-agendas, we 
certainly didn’t the serve the same agenda. 
 
For me the agenda was very simple, it was go in make the 
organisation work, make it deliver on its mandate, make sure that 
everything it does is lawful and ultimately make sure that it is 
10 
profitable.  But there were other sub-agendas and Chair speaks of 
culture, certainly the interest of MultiChoice became paramount to 
Motsoeneng to the detriment of the organisation.   Yes, he claims that 
he succeeded in bringing R500 million into the organisation, it was 
R100 million per year.  There is somewhere where I do very roughly 
calculations about different scenarios for the SABC, that was very little 
compared to what the SABC was forced to concede as a result of this 
man. 
 
Chair the SABC had a history of Boards not agreeing with each 
other and just as they say the tone gets set at the top you know, if the 
20 
top being the Board itself was not agreed on certain principles and we 
had Board Members siding with this person and others siding with the 
other there is no way that the organisation could work as a healthy 
organisation, and as I say this had been going on for years. 
 
I am not sure what will fix that organisation, other than to 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 59 of 157 
 
ensure that people who are brought in are people of real integrity who 
are ethical, who are totally committed to what is good for the 
organisation and do not forget at any given time what their true 
purpose in the organisation is, but sadly it was not to be. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well Ms Norman you have heard what I am very 
interested in, not that I am not interested in other things but I am very 
interested in the issue that I have raised because it is a very strange 
situation.  Mr Carrim testified yesterday that before he took his policy 
amendment to Cabinet on the 2 n d of December 2013 he had a meeting 
10 
with the President who was happy with the amendment, what he was 
coming with.  The President was part I assume of the meeting of 
Cabinet that approved, and he made it clear that the President never 
expressed any disagreement to him about the policy, and yet you have 
an official of the SABC, a high-ranking official who seems to have 
pursued an agreement that would be contrary or pursued a position that 
would be contrary to that of the SABC and that of government and as 
Ms Mokhobo says then she says there were many times when he 
claimed to have had meetings with the President, so it is important to 
try and understand if there is any link. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair, we have gone past the 
tea time would it ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, let us take the tea adjournment, it is t25 past 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 60 of 157 
 
now, we will resume at 11:40. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:   All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I have had a five minutes delay because of 
some urgent issues relating to the Commission.  Let us continue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair.  Ms Mokhobo may I please 
refer you to page 117, same bundle that you were dealing with before we 
10 
adjourned, CC42. 
MS MOKHOBO:   117? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   117, yes.  Same bundle Chair, CC42 at page 
117. 
CHAIRPERSON:   117? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that the minutes of the. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   The minutes of the 12 t h of  June 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, I got that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you. 
20 
MS MOKHOBO:   I found it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   This was the minutes – the meeting that Ms 
Tshabalala referred to.  I have read where she said there will be a Board 
Meeting on the 12 t h of June. 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes Chair. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 61 of 157 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   I would simply like to take you – with – 
without taking too much time, to where that resolution of that meeting is 
and that appears at page 120, but before the resolution there is a 
paragraph which I would like you to read where the Acting COO reported 
something.  Could you just go there, to that paragraph please?  It starts 
with, it begins with the ACOO pointed out. 
MS MOKHOBO:   Oh okay. 
“The ACOO pointed out that the previous Board had 
approved the MultiChoice proposal and the only 
outstanding issue had been that of funding.  The key 
10 
issue for the Interim Board was to ...(intervenes).”    
CHAIRPERSON:   I am sorry, I am sorry.  Is it reading at? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Sorry, page 120 Chair.  120 Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Where about? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   We 
said, 
where 
you 
have 
resolutions 
number Chair, it is the paragraph preceding that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay, alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, thank you Chair. 
MS MOKHOBO:   Okay. 
“The ACOO pointed out that the previous Board had 
20 
approved the MultiChoice proposal and the only 
outstanding issue had been that of funding.  The key 
issue for the Interim Board was to ensure the 
sustainability of such funding.  The Board pointed out 
that it acknowledge that the previous Board did 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 62 of 157 
 
approve the proposal and was not about to reinvent 
the wheel.  However, the Interim Board needed to 
understand the context of the matter and whether the 
initial MultiChoice proposal which had been approved 
by the previous Board had been changed.  Through 
the 
instructions 
between 
Management 
and 
MultiChoice, it was evident that the commitment had 
increased as there was more money being offered 
than 
originally 
discussed 
which 
showed 
good 
progress 
and 
was 
to 
the 
advantage 
of 
the 
10 
Corporation.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   If we, can we pause there?  Are you aware, 
because this is now the 12 t h of June 2013? 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And the minutes you dealt with, was the 
minutes of the 6t h of June 2013.  Are you aware of any Board previously 
that had approved the MultiChoice proposal, as if you are talking about 
the same proposal? 
MS MOKHOBO:   That was a different proposal. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
20 
MS MOKHOBO:   Which did not have any contentious clauses. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, but it did not relate to the DTT one? 
MS MOKHOBO:   No. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, thank you.  And then what was the 
resolution of …(intervenes). 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 63 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, let us just make sure we get that clear.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   What the Acting COO is talking about there is the 
MultiChoice proposal that was contained in the letter that we talked about 
earlier from MultiChoice to Mr Motsoeneng, is that right? 
MS MOKHOBO:   I believe so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what he is talking about? 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Are you – and you are saying that it is not true that 
there had by this time been any Board of the SABC which had approved 
10 
that proposal? 
MS MOKHOBO:   That was the previous proposal Chair.  It was not under 
this Board.  This was in 2012. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:   There had been a – we had completed the business 
plan.  It was approved by the Board and it was signed as an approved 
contract, but it was different to this new contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that is what I want to be clear about, that having 
looked at these minutes, are you satisfied that the Acting COO in this 
paragraph is talking about the MultiChoice proposal that was contained in 
20 
the letter from MultiChoice to Mr Motsoeneng that we referred to earlier 
on? 
MS MOKHOBO:   Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Or are you not sure? 
MS MOKHOBO:   Chair I think that perhaps we can unpack this a little bit. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 64 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, we can unpack, ja. 
MS MOKHOBO:   In the first instance, he talks about the MultiChoice 
proposal that then resulted in the contentious agreement that he signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:   And then he goes on – then the statement goes on now 
to talk about the previous agreement that had been concluded. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:   Which was not very attractive ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   In issue 
MS MOKHOBO:   In terms of the monetary gain. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:   From MultiChoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:   So it is two different …(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   He is talking about two proposals? 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes.  It is a proposal – there is a proposal and then 
there is a previous contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Now do we – do the Minister suppose to tell us 
what the item was that was being discussed here, and at page 119 the 
item is said to be MultiChoice proposal.  It says the Chair: 
20 
2.1 “The Chairman pointed out that the Board had 
previously met with MultiChoice where they 
presented their proposal to the SABC in respect 
of the 24-hour News Channel.  In the ensuing 
discussions there was disagreement concerning 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 65 of 157 
 
clauses 9 and 10 of the Memorandum of 
Agreement.  The Board had undertaken to 
discuss the concerns with the Minister and 
thereafter to revert to MultiChoice.” 
That far – it is quite clear that the Chairperson there is talking 
about the latest proposal at the time, which was contained in the 
MultiChoice letter to Mr Motsoeneng, that part is clear. 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So that one it would be fair to say the item for 
discussion was that proposal, is that right? 
10 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes.  Yes Chair, that is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was their latest proposal not the earlier one that had 
been finalised? 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, Ms Norman you might be able to take it from there.  
I just want to see whether any misrepresentations were made to – about 
this meeting about whether the proposal – the latest proposal, at the 
time, had been approved by the Board or not. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That is what I am trying to understand. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you Chair.  Chair you are quite 
correct, it deals with his latest proposal because the preceding 
paragraphs deal with clauses 9 and 10.  I beg your pardon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   No, it is me. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Oh is it you?  Sorry. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 66 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   Alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And then maybe Ms Mokhobo there is 
another paragraph where you see, because I would like to ...(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   Maybe Ms Mokhobo can check if she did have a chance 
to refresh her memory of the previous paragraph. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   She can confirm whether the other paragraphs that I 
have not read. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes 
CHAIRPERSON:   After reading the first one under this item, whether they 
10 
talk about the latest proposal. 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes they do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   They do, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So, to the extent that in the paragraph that you read 
earlier on, the Acting COO may be talking about any proposal other than 
the latest proposal, then he would be talking about a matter that was 
really not on the table? 
MS MOKHOBO:   Chair, he speaks about – he speaks – oh I see, sorry.  I 
did not read it properly.  He speaks about the previous MultiChoice 
20 
proposal.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:   The key issue for – so he is comparing that old contract, 
the proposal pertaining to the old contract and the actual contract, he is 
comparing it to this new contract that he is now wanting to be signed.  I 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 67 of 157 
 
do not know if I am making myself clear. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, I am – I understand what you say, you see these 
minutes as I understand them, if you go back to page 119, under 2 it says 
approvals, and I take it that what that means is, items that require 
approvals. 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So the next 2.1, the first item that requires approval is 
the MultiChoice proposal and from that first paragraph we know what – 
which MultiChoice proposal that refers to.  And both you and Ms Norman 
have told me that the next few paragraphs talk about the latest proposal; 
10 
at the time of MultiChoice, but when we come to that paragraph just 
before resolution number 12/06/13, the Acting COO you say, talks about 
both the previous proposal that had been finalised as I understand the 
position as well as the latest proposal, is that correct? 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Is that your understanding? 
MS MOKHOBO:   My understanding is this Chair.  This paragraph that we 
have been looking at, the ACCO talks about an approved MultiChoice 
proposal which was done under the previous Board, but that proposal 
which subsequently became a contract was not the same …(intervenes). 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   That was done and dusted? 
MS MOKHOBO:   Was not the same as the one where there is clause 9 
and 10 that is in disagreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:   So, I am not sure what the value of him raising this was, 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 68 of 157 
 
but I think he just wanted to say well there is a better deal.  There was a 
bad deal with the previous one now there is a better deal, I cannot think 
of it any other way.  I do not want to conclude that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Two paragraphs earlier or three paragraphs earlier, you 
are said to have said – you are said to have cautioned the Board that 
whatever decision was taken, if there was an intention by the DOC to 
change the current Broadcasting Digital Migration Policy, it had to be in 
writing for the SABC’s own protection.  So it is quite clear that at that 
point you are speaking to the issue on which a decision is required. 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Then after you had said that, the Acting COO is said to 
have confirmed that he had engaged with the DOC’s policy division where 
it advised him that the Minister would address a formal letter to the 
Chairman of the Board, addressing both clauses 9 and 10.  In essence 
clause 9 would no longer be applicable as the matter of controlled access 
was no longer an issue and therefore would be removed from the 
MultiChoice proposal, I wonder if that is correct?  The Board requested 
the Acting COO to follow up with the DOC to ensure that the Minister’s 
letter was received by the SABC, and then in response to Mr Lubisi’s 
enquiry, the GCEO pointed out that the SABC’s legal Department had 
20 
been fully involved in the matter, that they would advise and draft the 
contract if the matter was approved.  At that stage it seems that 
everybody is talking about the issue on which a decision is required.  
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And that is the latest MultiChoice proposal. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 69 of 157 
 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then it is – then next paragraph, the Acting COO 
pointed out that the previous Board had approved the MultiChoice 
proposal and the only outstanding issue had been that of funding. 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   On the face of it that sentence seems to be out of 
place. 
MS MOKHOBO:   It is Chair because I am not sure why he brought this 
matter to the table. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
10 
MS MOKHOBO:   Except maybe to drive his point that the new proposal 
and contract should be approved and signed off. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:   I think it was merely to drive that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes and then he says the key issue for the Interim 
Board was to ensure the sustainability of such funding.  Again, that is 
talking about something that is not what is being discussed.   
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The Board pointed out he is talking about the previous 
Board I assume? 
20 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Pointed out that it acknowledged that the previous 
Board, oh no he must be talking about the current Board at the time.  The 
Board pointed out that it acknowledged that the previous Board did 
approve the proposal and was not about to reinvent the wheel.  Let us 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 70 of 157 
 
pause there.  To the extent that his reference to the proposal in that 
sentence may be said to be a reference to the then current proposal from 
MultiChoice, would he have been correct to say that the Board that was 
current at the time had approved the MultiChoice proposal?  It cannot be 
because this was still being discussed.  So it must be the – he must be 
talking about the previous one. 
MS MOKHOBO:   The previous. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But again you cannot understand why it would be 
relevant to talk about that approval is it not? 
MS MOKHOBO:   That is how his mind worked.  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  And then – so he says the Board did not want to 
reinvent the Wheel, so it is difficult to understand, then he says however, 
the Interim Board needed to understand the context of the matter and 
whether the initial MultiChoice proposal now he says the initial which has 
been approved by the previous Board had been changed through the 
interactions between the management and MultiChoice it was evident that 
the commitment had increased as there was more money being offered 
then original discussed which showed good progress and was to the 
advantage of the cooperation.  Well, I do not know about you but I cannot 
make head or tail about what he is seeking to contribute to the question 
20 
whether there should be an approval of the proposal – the latest proposal 
of MultiChoice at the time.  I am not able to say exactly what the 
relevance of the contribution is. 
MS MOKHOBO:    Ja, he was conflating the two. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay.  Alright.  Ms Norman you might be able to 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 71 of 157 
 
clarify anything that seems unclear to me. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, no, no in fact it is in fact confusing 
Chair that is why I wanted Ms Mokhobo to because the impression 
created there is that there was a Board Meeting when this proposal was 
approved and saying to this Interim Board but what are you even dealing 
with here. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   This was approved already and if that Board 
understood it that way one would have believed that there was in fact an 
approval that was in existence when there was not such an approval.  
10 
Yes, thank you Chair.  Could you then go to the resolution?   What was 
the resolution? 
MS MOKHOBO:   The resolution was that subject to the receipt from the 
Minister making pronouncements on the issues relating to clause 9 and 
10 of the proposed MultiChoice Memorandum of agreement.  The Board 
hereby approves the MultiChoice proposal for Group Exco to deliberate 
the operational matters including included in the proposed memorandum 
of agreement.  So, this was the Board saying well, Group Exco you can 
start working, deliberating on operational matters but it does not say it is 
approved.  It says subject to the letter from the Minister confirming the 
20 
change. 
CHAIRPERSON:   That would be a letter that would show approval for 
dropping encryption? 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  Okay. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 72 of 157 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And that is the one that Chair had read 
referred to in the third paragraph from the resolutions? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, thank you.  And then the second 
resolution? 
MS MOKHOBO:   The ACOO follows up with the DOC in respect of the 
delivery of the letter of the Minister advising the SABC on the 
pronouncements relating to clauses 9 and 10 as included in the proposed 
Memorandum of agreements.  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And according to your understanding was 
10 
that letter ever received? 
MS MOKHOBO:   No. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The Minister at that time was it Mr Carrim? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   It was 
MS MOKHOBO:   No, no. it was Ms Dinapule 
MS MOKHOBO:   It was Ms Dinapule. 
CHAIRPERSON:   It was Ms Dinapule.  Oh okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you.  That is the minute of the 12 t h of 
June. 
20 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Now I would like to take to you to the 
minute …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well, it will also be important I know that you have 
been interviewing or the Commissioner has been interviewing her or 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 73 of 157 
 
talking to her it will be important that she we hear what she has to say 
about what Mr Motsoeneng exactly said at this meeting. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   He had been in touch with the – a division in the 
Department of Communications or he might even have said he had been 
in touch with the Minister. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So we need to find that, Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   So we need to find that out.  Thank you 
Chair. We will do.  Thank you, Chair.  And then the minutes of the second 
10 
the meeting of the 2 n d of July was a day earlier than the signing of the 
agreement it was signed on the 3r d of July 2013.  Is that correct? 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Now, that you will find the minutes you will 
find at page 112. 
MS MOKHOBO:   Thank you, Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you and I would like to take you to 
what some of the things that are said by some of the Board Members 
which maybe you could just shed some light?  Could you please have a 
look at page 113? 
20 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And Mr Mavuso was Chairing that meeting?  
You were not present at this meeting? 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes, Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   This is the one where you had taken leave?  
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 74 of 157 
 
Now in paragraph 2.2, could you just read 2.2 the first paragraph? 
MS MOKHOBO:   Mr Motsoeneng requested that this item be removed?  
Oh okay let me just read the title. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:   The title says: 
“Terms of the MultiChoice Agreement in Respect of 
24-hour news channel.  Mr Motsoeneng requested 
that this item be removed from the agenda because 
the MultiChoice and SABC Legal Teams were still in 
the process of finalizing the negotiations.  The 
10 
Chairman stated that this special meeting had been 
urgently convened to give particular attention and 
approval to items 2.1 and 2.2.  He raises concerns 
that there were no supporting documents in respect 
of these urgent items to enable the Members to 
discuss, deliberate and make correct decisions.  Mr 
Motsoeneng 
responded 
that 
where 
supporting 
documents were not submitted the items should not 
be considered at the meeting.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes.  And the just to – just for the record 
20 
this meeting was not a Board Meeting? 
MS MOKHOBO:   It was a Sub-Committee meeting. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, what is it called? 
MS MOKHOBO:   The Finance Investment – it is Finance Investment 
Procurement and Technology meeting. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 75 of 157 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, and then then this meeting progresses 
but there is if you look the last paragraph which begins with Ms 
Nepfumbada? 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Could you just read that paragraph? 
MS MOKHOBO:   Ms Nepfumbada stated that:  
“MultiChoice had pointed out that the SABC Board 
had agreed on each issue raised by the SABC’s 
Legal 
Team 
including 
clause 
9. 
 
The 
offer 
presupposed that all SABC channels on its DTT 
10 
platform would be made available to the public 
unencrypted without a conditional access system and 
thereby incidentally receivable by the MCADTT 
decoder.  She expressed concern that this meant that 
the SABC’s content will be accessible to all in sundry 
including those without rights to the SABC’s content.  
MultiChoice had stated that this clause was a deal 
breaker and unless the SABC agreed to this clause 
there would be no contract between the parties.  Mr 
Motsoeneng’s advice to the Legal Team had been 
20 
that this clause was not necessarily a deal breaker 
as only the DUC could make a pronouncement on the 
Mascara regulation issues and therefore clause 9 had 
been reinstated in the contract.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And then the clause where there were 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 76 of 157 
 
concerns had therefore been reinstated into the draft contract as follows, 
could you just read that the bullet points? 
MS MOKHOBO:    “The contract was for a period of five years it 
included the offer that all SABC’s channels on DTT would 
be accessible or available unencrypted to MultiChoice 
meaning without any protection and also without a 
conditional access system.  MultiChoice would determine 
the value for money in terms of the content in respect of 
the entertainment channel and in terms of the revenue 
derived from advertised advertisements on the news and 
10 
entertainment channels.  The SABC would be entitled to 
that revenue.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes, then there is something that the 
Chairman says Mr Matthews talks about the launch so I may not detain 
the Chair with those.  Oh sorry, Mr Motsoeneng there is a paragraph after 
which you have read one, two, three, the third paragraph Mr Motsoeneng 
agreed. 
MS MOKHOBO:   Mr Motsoeneng perhaps just to contextualize that 
Advocate maybe we should read the preceding paragraph first? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, I think that is important. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you, yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:   Yes, because the Chairman stated that 
“The Board had advised MultiChoice that it was not 
created a prohibited mechanism.  It had also been agreed 
to leave the finer details of the agreement to the Legal 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 77 of 157 
 
Teams to resolve.  The agreement had refereed to two 
channels namely News and Entertainment and did not 
include all channels.  The Board’s assumption had been, 
was there had been a common understanding in this 
regard and that this should not stop the proceedings 
whatever matter had been agreed in terms of the monetary 
gains should not be confined to what was on the table as 
the value proposition had to be beneficial to both parties.  
Mr Motsoeneng agreed that MultiChoice should also 
benefit from the agreement however I believe that the 
10 
issues surrounding clause 9 was a simple one.  He stated 
that the SABC‘s content was protected by the Mascara 
regulations and until this was changed no one had the 
right to use SABC’s content.  Mr Motsoeneng did not think 
that the second channel should be part of the agreement 
and the focus should be placed on the 24-hour news 
channel.  He pointed out that if the negotiations with 
MultiChoice were not to the SABC’s benefit the agreement 
should be abandoned.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Okay.  Now this analysis of the one that he 
20 
says because there was the Mascara regulations and therefore no one 
could use the content of the SABC was that correct? 
MS MOKHOBO:   Incorrect.  I think he was jumbled up here. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:   Because the Mascara regulations allowed for satellite 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 78 of 157 
 
carriers it included Top TV at the time to carry SABC channels.  So, I am 
not sure what he was on about here. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes.  Could you just read then in responding 
to Mr Motsoeneng’s comments? 
MS MOKHOBO:    “Ms Tshabalala was comfortable with the legal 
viewpoint provided and requested that the legal division 
cautioned the Team on what should be changed to ensure 
that 
the 
SABC 
maximize 
on 
their 
advantage 
and 
opportunities available.  She emphasised that she did not 
want the SABC to enter into the agreement for purposes of 
10 
urgency.  Mr Nepfumbada advised that she would prefer 
that the News Channel be dealt with separately from the 
Entertainment Channel in order to avoid any further 
issues.  Mr Matthews responded that it had been agreed in 
principle that whilst the contract included both channels 
the launch date could be staggered.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And there is a paragraph that begins with in 
responding to Mr Motsoeneng’s the second the third one after that. 
MS MOKHOBO:   “In responding to Mr Motsoeneng’s comment, the 
Chairman stated that there was consensus to proceed with 
20 
the agreement so there was no dispute, however it was 
important for a senior legal advisor to review the 
mechanism of the agreement as a safety measure in terms 
if the future.  Mr Motsoeneng requested that in the GCO’s 
absence a mandate be provided for him and Mr Olivier to 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 79 of 157 
 
sign the contract.  Ms Tshabalala concurred with Ms 
Solubisi’s request that the agreement be reviewed by a 
senior legal advisor and that such review notes must be 
provided to the Board for comment and approval.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And then what was the resolution? 
MS MOKHOBO:   The resolution was one, the terms of the MultiChoice 
agreement be and I hereby approved subject to the following: 
“A dispute resolution mechanism be included in the 
MultiChoice agreement.  The terms of the MultiChoice 
agreement be reviewed by an independent senior legal 
10 
advisor to ensure that it was in the best interests of both 
parties and the outcome of the review of the MultiChoice 
agreement 
must 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
Board 
for 
information.” 
 
Which is a bit concerning because in the paragraph above it said: 
“The Board must be provided to the Board for comment 
and approval.” 
 
I do not know why then the resolution reads:   
“For information it should be for approval.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And then the last paragraph two. 
20 
MS MOKHOBO:  “Mr Motsoeneng and C Olivier be and are 
hereby mandated to sign the MultiChoice agreement on 
behalf of the SABC.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja but this does not make sense.  How does this 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 80 of 157 
 
Committee, even assuming that it had the authority to give the 
approval, how does it mandate people to sign the MultiChoice 
agreement on behalf of the SABC in circumstances where there are 
outstanding issues on which they need to satisfy themselves? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Absolutely Chair and to take it even further in terms of 
the delegation of authority framework this was not an approving Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS 
MOKHOBO: 
 
Their 
task 
was 
to 
interrogate 
and 
take 
a 
recommendation to the Board. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To the Board, yes. 
10 
MS MOKHOBO:  And the Board could then approve. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  But in addition to that the approval had also to be 
escalated to both the National Treasury and the Department of 
Communications because it was dealing with fundamental shifts from 
policy from the Broadcast Digital Migration policy.  Now they had no 
right to say it can be signed when the upward approval had not been 
garnered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also, at this stage as I understand the position, 
they still did not have the letter from the Minister that had been 
20 
discussed earlier.  And I am sure some of them would have been part of 
the meeting where it was said there would be a letter from the Minister. 
MS MOKHOBO:  You know Chair there is a phrase that I like which 
says, make haste slowly.  Which means yes, you can be quick but be 
slow and in reviewing and ensuring that everything is okay.  This 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 81 of 157 
 
should have been a make haste slowly assumption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Not yes, let us do this very quickly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  There was really no need for that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But also, when they discussed they ought to – when 
they discuss an item, they ought to be alive to whatever discussions 
have preceded that meeting around the same item to say the history of 
this item is the following.  At such and such a meeting this is what was 
said and such and such a meeting this is what was said to the extent 
10 
that certain things were outstanding.  Have they been sorted out now? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Indeed Chair.  I have no ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That does not seem to have happened in so far as the 
letter is concerned. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Chair I would really implore your honour to invite Mr 
Mavuso. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  To come and give you his perspective. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Because this was his meeting. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  And I am sure he has got better insights than myself 
and a whole lot of other people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you, Chair.  Thank you, I think 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 82 of 157 
 
that is all on the ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will give attention to that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We will do Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you very much, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So, then your conclusion is that this body 
as you have answered to the Chair had no authority ...(intervenes). 
MS MOKHOBO:  No, it had no authority. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To approve. 
10 
MS MOKHOBO:  And Chair I have provided Advocate Norman the 
delegation of authority framework of the SABC that shows in very clear 
terms the levels of approvals. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And you have attached it 
...(intervenes). 
MS MOKHOBO:  Even if – I am sorry Advocate.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I beg your pardon. 
MS MOKHOBO:  So even if I was told to sign it, it would have still been 
improper. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS MOKHOBO:  At this level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  It would have still been improper.  So, I would not 
have gone ahead and signed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 83 of 157 
 
MS MOKHOBO:  Unless all the approvals had been received.  The 
letter from the Minister.  Possibly a letter from National Treasury 
because of the policy shifts.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS MOKHOBO:  And ja and Board approval. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you may or may not be able to comment on this.  
Was it not – Mr Mavuso was chairing this meeting of this Committee, 
the same Board Member who stood with you at that meeting with 
MultiChoice?   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it the same Board Member? 
MS MOKHOBO:  It is the same Board Member. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Because I would have expected that because of 
the position he took at that meeting, he would have been more 
circumspect and he would have checked much more than anybody else 
to see whether everything that was supposed to happen sorted out first 
before there could be approval.  So that I would suggest the letter that 
you talked about.   
 
But of course, I cannot remember – the letter might not have 
been discussed at that meeting because the discussion of the letter 
20 
might have been at a Board Meeting.  But if he was at the Board 
Meeting which discussed the letter where Mr Motsoeneng said there 
would be a letter from the Minister then I would have expected him here 
to have said, where is the letter. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 84 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  You may or may not be able to say anything.  I am 
just making an observation. 
MS MOKHOBO:  I would propose that that question be put to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Be put to him, ja.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  That is all 
then on the minutes.  Could we go back to the statement?  Chair I am 
going to refer the witness to a letter that she referred to in answering 
one of your questions earlier before we adjourned for tea.  Where she 
made mention of a letter that she had written where a journalist that 
misquoted her. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That letter Chair appears under folder B.  
It is – it was an Annexure to the previous statement at page 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Exhibit CC21? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  CC21 Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, under folder B. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Under folder B and then that would be 
page 51. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Could you deal with that letter 
Ms Mokhobo?  Or maybe let us start with the one before that is the one 
that you have read.  The 15 t h of May letter that you have read into the 
record. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 85 of 157 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then could you just tell Chair at page 
51 you were responding to Mr Patel.  What did you say to him? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Chair, it is very important to table there the context of 
this letter.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Was in the same spirit as the discussions, the 
numerous discussions we had had at the previous meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the meeting of the 6 t h ...(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  6 t h of June. 
MS MOKHOBO:  The meeting of the 6 t h with MultiChoice and SABC. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Where indeed there was a lot of excitement that, 
“Phew, finally we will have a 24-hour news channel”.  Even though we 
do not agree on certain serious principles that I express there.  So, this 
letter was in the same spirit.  And I was asked by the Board to write the 
letter to Mr Imtiaz. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  So, it reads and it was address to Mr Imtiaz Patel. 
“The Board and Executive Management have duly 
considered 
MultiChoice 
as 
proposal 
regarding 
the 
20 
SABC’s 24-hour news channel and the entertainment 
channel.  And we are pleased to inform you of the 
decision to proceed in accordance with the proposal.  
Very importantly Chair, on the terms that will be agreed 
between the SABC and MultiChoice.  We look forward to 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 86 of 157 
 
a mutually rewarded relationship for the coming 5-year 
period.” 
That caveat is very important Chair.  That the terms had to be 
agreed.  At this point the terms have not been agreed.  And certainly, 
saying we look forward to a mutually rewarded relationship would still 
ride on whether or not we agree on the terms.  So, this was certainly 
nothing approving the terms of the proposal at all. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From what I heard earlier on, was there not a Board 
Meeting just before or just after that date? 
10 
MS MOKHOBO:  Of the 19 t h? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the 19 t h June? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The 19 t h of June, yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair.  There was a Board Meeting. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It was on the 12 t h of June. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It was on the 12 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was one on the 12 t h of June? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  On the 12 t h of June. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Which is the one we dealt with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the one where Mr Motsoeneng talked about a 
letter. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  From the Minister. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 87 of 157 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, no, Chair.  Yes, that is the one where 
Chair has just – sorry ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  The one where I read a number of well ...(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  As to why Mr Mavuso did not pay attention 
because the letter had been mentioned. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, that we just dealt with. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I thought that was a Committee meeting – a Sub-
Committee meeting rather than Board. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair, I am the one who is confused.  I 
10 
beg your pardon. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You are quite right.  The one that she just 
referred to is the 2 n d of July. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The 12 t h of June is where Mr Motsoeneng 
talks about the letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that was a Board. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That was a Board Meeting, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A Board Meeting. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was there another Board Meeting just around 19, 20, 
21 June or just before that after the 12 t h? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I could just ...(intervenes). 
MS MOKHOBO:  Chair there was a Board Meeting. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 88 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Where I was mandated to then write this letter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  But we will have to find ...(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I will have to find the minutes Chair 
...(intervenes). 
MS MOKHOBO:  The minutes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Because the Board – whilst Ms Resvichele 
10 
is looking Chair may we proceed and deal with something else in the 
meantime? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, that is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  if you agree.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And at the meeting ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  And – I am sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry Chair, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Mokhobo, I am trying to understand this letter in 
the context of what you said was alleged by journalist or by certain 
20 
people through a journalist about your position and what you have said.  
It is quite clear that you are saying that the SABC will proceed but that 
you talk about terms that will be agreed. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, you are not saying that it is on terms that have 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 89 of 157 
 
already been agreed? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Indeed Chair, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  But within that context it seems to me that 
maybe the letter should be read to simply mean that the – you are 
saying the Board is quite happy – the decision that the Board had made 
was really to proceed with the discussions. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With a view to an agreement being reached on terms 
that have not been finalized. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is just that I think if you – the way it says, inform 
you of the decision to proceed in accordance with the proposal.  At that 
stage it is like you are accepting the proposal as is. 
MS MOKHOBO:  H’mm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But as you emphasize it says, on the terms that will 
be agreed. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That that is the pro vice, so you emphasize. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay alright. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you, Chair.  Thank you.  Do you 
have any recollection of a Board Meeting which when you – or rather let 
me put it this way.  When the Board mandated you to write this letter to 
Mr Patel, was – did you convey to Mr Patel the decisions of the Board 
or did you simply draft the letter in your own terms? 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 90 of 157 
 
MS MOKHOBO:  No, it was the decision of the Board. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So would the ...(intervenes). 
MS MOKHOBO:  The Board of the Executive Management. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And the minutes which have got that decision are 
somewhere in the bundle as far as you know? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes.  They should be there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  They should. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I just need to get the date of that meeting.  
It would come before the 19 t h of June – 12 t h of June or because the 
10 
only one I have is the 12 t h of June.  I do not have any – the 6 t h of June, 
the 9 t h, the 12 t h so I do not have any Board Meeting minutes.  We do 
not have them between the 12 t h and the 19 t h.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is only those of the 12 t h. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well what we – do you recall Ms Mokhobo whether 
you did see them?  It is a question of locating them or you are not sure 
whether they are there. 
MS MOKHOBO:  I would have to ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You will have to check. 
20 
MS MOKHOBO:  To try and locate them. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no, that is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 91 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  What will – if they are ...(intervenes). 
MS MOKHOBO:  Here it is Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Uh-huh. 
MS MOKHOBO:  The ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Boards Indorsements.  This is on the bundle – Ms 
Geldenhuys bundle. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh okay. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes.  Exhibit CC43 Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  What page? 
10 
MS MOKHOBO:  Page 055. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay so 55. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  55.  12 June. 
MS MOKHOBO:  And this was on the 12 t h of June. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  It was a special Board Meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Right at the top, the first paragraph. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What paragraph? 
MS MOKHOBO:  The first paragraph, right at the top. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Alright, 055. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MOKHOBO:  “The GCO pointed out that what had been 
agreed at the previous meeting was the matter that was 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 92 of 157 
 
currently being pursued.  The Boards indorsement had 
been required to enable management to send a 
confirmation letter to MultiChoice to the effect that the 
SABCs engagement with MultiChoice would preclude 
clauses 9 and 10.  Clause 9 propose that the SABC must 
etcetera.  It was confirmed that until there was a clear 
pronouncement from the Minister in this regard the SABC 
could not commit to clause 9.” 
So, Chair in keeping with the Chairs reading of the letter it 
should certainly have included instead of making a wild a broad 
10 
statement that says on terms that will be agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  I should have been more specific. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  And said, to exclude clause 9 and 10. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  I should have been more specific. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, no, no. 
MS MOKHOBO:  But then I approached it from a very broad 
perspective. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  No, no, no. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It – ja I think you should have been more specific but 
you do say on terms to be agreed.   
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 93 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  And as long as 9 and 10 have not been agreed, it 
does cover it.  It is just that it might have been better if it was more 
specific. 
MS MOKHOBO:  And they knew crystally clear what had not been 
agreed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Yes.  Okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.  Then if you 
go back to the statement.  You have covered most of your evidence 
when you were dealing with the benefits of having encryption and 
towards the latter part of your statement you deal with the tensions 
10 
between yourself and Ms Tshabalala.  And they are recorded there, I 
am not sure that it is ...(intervenes). 
MS MOKHOBO:  What page are you on? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I am now on page – sorry, go back, page 
85. 
MS MOKHOBO:  This is on ...(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  On – sorry CC ...(intervenes). 
MS MOKHOBO:  The Geldenhuys bundle? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No, I beg your pardon.  Exhibit CC21. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Okay. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The folder that has your statement and 
then we are looking at the 21A which will be under divider C.   
MS MOKHOBO:  So that would be page? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That would be page 85. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Page 85. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 94 of 157 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  But maybe before we go there, there 
are the three scenarios that you put just to close this your topic about 
the disadvantages of the – of this deal for the SABC.  Could you just 
tell the Chair about you have arrived at those scenarios?  I am going to 
take you to the page where you deal with scenario one, two and three.  
I beg your pardon, sorry.  You will – before we get to this- sorry, I beg 
your pardon Chair.  I just want to direct you to the exact paragraph. 
   
Actually, I think you dealt with them in the previous statement.  
You were talking about the 500 million and you said that the 500 million 
is way too little as compared to the benefits that the SABC would have 
10 
derived had it taken its time and looked at the contract properly and to 
make sure that it benefits it. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And what informs that view that you have? 
MS MOKHOBO:  The view is informed by a fax that was in fact 
mentioned by the Minister as well yesterday. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  The former Minister yesterday.  Where he spoke of the 
amount of viewership that SABC had at the time.  It was a completely 
dominant player while MultiChoice had a smallish audience profile.  The 
20 
SABC boasted quite a substantial audience – I think at that time the 
SABC alone was responsible for I think it was 65%, I may be wrong but 
anything between 60% and 70% of the audience profile of South Africa. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  In fact, you deal with that in the 
statement that you made to the SIU. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 95 of 157 
 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That appears under B.  I beg your pardon, 
page 37.  Those are the scenarios. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But could you just summarize them? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  There are two scenarios where you say 
that as a result there has been huge losses to the SABC. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
MS MOKHOBO:  The whole stance that the SABC should not have 
attempted to get – to enter into the direct to home perspective which is 
Pay TV perspective was very sad in the sense that it was saying to the 
SABC, do not even try this commercial venture whereas the SABC 
could have done it very successfully.  And in this I illustrate what the 
possibilities could have been.   
 
Now if you just look at the 2019 Abridged Annual Report of 
MultiChoice Africa.  At the time when I looked at it, it was last year, 
which had to do with the last year figures.  MultiChoice had an active 
subscriber base of 7.4 million households and this was up from 4 
20 
million.  In 2011 they had only 4 million and by 2019 they had 7.4 
million.   
 
Now I give a scenario where if the SABC were to come up with 
– no before I go into that Chair.  I am sorry.  The average and this 
contained in their report.  The base average that they use to calculate 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 96 of 157 
 
their revenue is R322 per month per subscriber because they take from 
their most superior bouquet to the lowest bouquet and come up with a 
round figure.  Its total revenue came up to 40.4 billion Rands over its 
2019 financial year.  That is very substantial.   
 
Now I argued that if the SABC through its vast footprint and 
high audience attraction value did go head to head with MCA but 
offering its subscribers a low R40 subscription fee which would cut 
across R40 subscription per month.  And if it only had 4 million 
subscribers who said, yes, we would be able to afford R40 per month, it 
could raise monthly revenues of almost 160 million Rands per annum 
10 
and annually 1.920 billion.  These figures are obviously very 
conservative.  It is really going right down to the lowest levels.  I know 
that MultiChoice’s lowest level is something like R29 if I am not 
mistaken.  But MultiChoice we thought the SABC bouquet running on it 
would probably not have those kinds of audiences.   
 
Now I am saying if we come down to a much smaller subscriber 
base and I know that the subscriber base could actually be much higher 
especially now when affordability levels are so low, we could make 
much more money.  I am saying we as though I am still there, excuse 
me.  The SABC could make much more money.  So, I was just painting 
20 
a scenario of the – what did not make sense to me with people saying, 
no you cannot go into that space because you will not be able to 
manage it or afford it or whatever, it just never made sense to me 
anyway. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 97 of 157 
 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then may we lastly then we just deal 
with the fact that you have already mentioned that the relations 
between you and the Chairperson of the group Board Ms Tshabalala 
were not so good. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, and you have attached minutes to 
show the altercations during the meetings of 2013 – September 2013. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes ma’am. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay thank you.  And then ...(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there something to be highlighted about those 
altercations or not really? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Not really Chair, it is about – but of course 
Ms Mokhobo feels that her integrity was being attacked.  But for the 
purposes of the Commission it does not really deal with – it does not 
relate to the ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does not throw a light on ...(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is just a relationship kind of – that is 
how I look at it.  But unless I am wrong Ms Mokhobo, do you think it 
goes deeper than that? 
20 
MS MOKHOBO:  Chair, I think yes on the surface that is what it is but if 
you go deeper it all had to do with attempts for me to be removed 
because there were – as I said earlier there were agendas. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 98 of 157 
 
MS MOKHOBO:  There were things that people wanted done which I 
was not doing.  So, the undermining was just incredible.  But things got 
very, very bad at the point where we were at the Minister’s roundtable 
discussion and I called Mr Mavuso to ask him to just confirm with me 
whether there had indeed been approval.  Now this is at a different 
level, it is now past the MultiChoice agreement which has been signed 
with the clauses that should not have been there.  It is now at a level 
where the Minister is now trying to have DTT roll out but he has to 
resolve the question of the Set Top Box.  And in that meeting at that 
point the SABC had still not taken the position that there will be no Set 
10 
Top Box control.  Remember the contract was signed, it went off and 
the Board just went quiet about it.  I think everybody was just 
shellshocked and decided not to pursue the matter anymore because it 
was done.   
 
Now here is an opportunity for the SABC to get back its power 
and that opportunity is sitting at the roundtable – the Minister’s 
roundtable with other industry players and establishing that we actually 
as the SABC believe there is value in having the Set Top Box control.  
And then she stands up and she says the SABC has agreed that there 
will be no Set Top Box control.  And no such agreement had been 
20 
reached. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who is saying that now, the Minister? 
MS MOKHOBO:  The Chairperson. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The Chairperson, Ms Tshabalala? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 99 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  And at that point I was in shock and incidentally our 
relationships had become so cold and distant at that point that they sat 
on the other side of the room and I sat on the other side of the room.  I 
was like the lone soldier there you know.  And they were sitting there 
and they decided that is what they were going to say about the Set Top 
Box control.  I was obviously shellshocked and I called Mr Mavuso to 
check if indeed that was true and Mr Mavuso confirmed for me that no, 
the Board never ever arrived at that conclusion.  That there was a 
contract with MultiChoice which agreed with them on that one could 
10 
regard as an expediency to get the contract going.  But there was never 
a fundamental agreement that the Set Top Box control would not be 
supported by the SABC.  The SABC needs it.  We need the – that Set 
Top Box control.  And then I subsequently informed the Minister and the 
DG that here are people who are now almost reverse engineering things 
to meet the MultiChoice agreement.  They are now saying the SABC 
has taken and we had never taken that position.  So there was an 
urgent Board Meeting that was called where the Chairperson proceeded 
to attack me on that.  She said I had breached confidentiality.  How do I 
breach confidentiality when I speak to a Board Member of the 
20 
organisation that I come from you know?  And obviously I had to let it 
be known by my superiors that here was something patently wrong that 
was being conducted.  If I did not do that then I would not be delivering 
on my fiduciary duties. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 100 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  It speaks to the issue that I said I want to hear more 
about. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There are people – there are witnesses who have 
come before the Commission and said in the context of the 
organisations where they were employed that there were attempts by 
certain people or certain forces to remove from Government Entities, 
Government Departments, SOE’s people who did not or were not 
prepared to do wrong.  And it is necessary to explore the validity of this 
proposition wherever there may be matters that may suggest that 
10 
maybe certain people were being pushed out.  Now one cannot get to 
the point of saying whether this was so or not in the SABC without 
hearing more about these challenges.  You have just said that you had 
to speak to the DG and say this is what is happening.  So it becomes 
important to even know what was the DG’s attitude to this kind of 
situation.  What was the Minister’s attitude because based on what Mr 
Carrim told me yesterday one expected that the Minister’s boss, the 
President, was in support of the position that Mr Carrim took which is 
the same position that Mr Mokhobo took.  But here was a situation 
where certain people within SABC seemed to go completely against that 
20 
and at this stage I am – I have not heard that the Minister or officials 
within the Department of Communications came in and said, what are 
you doing?  You know or that kind of thing.  Or show clear support for 
what should be the correct position as far as government is concerned.  
So getting all of that might help one understand even what was going 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 101 of 157 
 
on and – but also might help one understand the people if there were 
any who were behind some of these things and to identify what was the 
agenda?  Was the agenda part of State Capture?  Was the agenda 
something else? Was the agenda corruption? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you so …(intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So I say again Ms Mokhobo after today if you have 
more information to share with the Commission in relation to this 
please feel free to communicate with the Legal Team.  Because I do 
10 
want to try and understand.  This is very strange for me that things 
were happening the way I am hearing were happening within the same 
organisation. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Thank you Chair.  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  You had dealt Ms 
Mokhobo last – on the last occasion with the appointment of Mr 
Motsoeneng. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is when you testified before the 
20 
Commission and then it – but what you did not deal with is what you 
deal with in – at paragraph 59 when you – because of his – according 
to what you say here – according to – because he was disruptive you 
had suggested that he should be removed.  Could you just tell the Chair 
about that at paragraph 59 page 88? 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 102 of 157 
 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair.  I have been suggesting and in fact I got 
into very serious trouble for that initial suggestion the first which I had 
made much earlier after I had started there.  I think it must have been 
around March or thereabouts and I got into serious trouble for having 
suggested that.  But then on the 26 t h of February …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  You make the suggestion at a Board Meeting or 
something? 
MS MOKHOBO:  I made it to Board Members. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To Board Members ja. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS MOKHOBO:  And not in a formal meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Not in a formal meeting? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes.  Because you know for me to make that statement 
I would have had to do it correctly via the HR Department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  And submitted it to the Human Resource Division and 
then it would go to the Sub-Committee to be discussed and then go to 
the Board.  I was feeling this sense of urgency and serious frustration 
because he was making it very difficult for me to do my work.  Blocking 
20 
the staff from submitting documents.  I mean if you were to read there 
was a – I am trying to recall the name – Sizwe …(indistinct, African 
name) evaluation that was done of the SABC and in there they spoke of 
two centre of power.  There was the centre which was the CEO and the 
centre which was the COO.  And they spoke of how haphazard things 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 103 of 157 
 
were in terms of submitting documents to the Board.  In terms of 
getting things done.  The cause was simply because at that point the 
acting CEO felt he needed me out of that organisation and he frustrated 
everything that I did so that ultimately the Board would declare me 
incompetent and fire me.  I remember in 2013 I had not been there long 
when I heard the rumour that by August of the same year I would be 
gone.  And I was due to have an interview with one of the magazines 
and the journalist called and say we heard your CEO has been 
suspended.  In the meantime I was at my desk.  So there were a lot of 
attempts to discard me.  So now eventually the Board woke up to the 
10 
fact that there was something very seriously wrong with the acting 
CEO.  And that happened when he suggested to them that they were all 
implicated in some wrongdoing or the other.  And only that some of 
them they were those who knew that this man was not okay.  But some 
continued to support him until at that point where he said that then they 
woke up to the fact that he was actually very, very dangerous and was 
going to have them fired when he said they were all implicated.  And 
that is the point where they then suggested that he be removed.  So on 
the 26 t h of February in 2013 Chair the Board unanimously agreed to 
remove Mr Motsoeneng from his position as acting COO.  This move 
20 
was however frustrated when it emerged that the Board did not have 
the powers to remove Mr Motsoeneng as he had been appointed by the 
then Minister of Communications Ms Dina Pule.  Doctor Ngobani and 
the Deputy Chairman Mr Thami Ka Plaatjie resigned soon thereafter 
followed by the remainder of the non-executive Board Members in 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 104 of 157 
 
March 2013.  Having being reinstated Mr Motsoeneng continued with 
his disruptive style of management. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And you say that you would not have 
recommended his appointment? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Absolutely not.  Absolutely not. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm.  Now why was what you referred to as I think 
disruptive conduct on his part why was that not being addressed?  Was 
that because you would have needed the support of the Board and 
unless you had that support there was nothing you could do or there 
was very little you could do or what was the position? 
10 
MS MOKHOBO:  The position Chair was that as acting COO any matter 
that had to do with his discipline had to go to the Board.  It could only 
be dealt with by the Board not by myself directly.  And there was no 
appetite for that.  As I said I had even suggested that he should be 
removed and be made to go either back to his former position or 
whatever but I was very clear that I could not work with this man.  A 
COO is such a critical Member of a top management structure because 
that is the person who oversees the daily nitty gritty operations of 
where the delivery needs to happen.  So the channels making sure that 
the channels deliver on time, news deliver on time.  You know all those 
20 
critical areas that would talk to immediate delivery whereas the CEO 
dealt with all the other matters that affected the organisation wide 
issues.  And the fact that he did not understand the fact of the power 
relations that I was indeed his superior and he had to take my word and 
he instead preferred to be friends with the Chairpersons of the Board to 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 105 of 157 
 
take his instructions from them, to go to them and instruct them on how 
to deal with me and the organisation just made it impossible for me.  
Absolutely impossible.  And Chair I am sure the Chair may have heard 
at the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee Commission I think it was 
called a commission as well on the SABC that was chaired by the 
Honourable Vincent Smith. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was an ad hoc Committee I think it was. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Ad hoc Committee yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Ja not commission 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
MS MOKHOBO:  Where both Chairman Ngobani and Chairperson 
Tshabalala told Mr Smith that if they had had things their way they 
would – I would never have been appointed at the SABC.  Now how 
bigger a vote of no confidence do you want than that?  By the time – 
anyway I had left so it had no force or effect on me.  And this was 
despite the fact of the hard work I had put into that organisation.  
Turning around the finances.  Getting a whole lot of things done.  DTT 
roll out the technology roll out had stalled completely.  There was no 
movement and it was critical and urgent.  And just ensuring that the 
broad spectrum of stakeholders who had something to do with the 
20 
SABC understood what we were doing and where we were going.  But in 
retrospect I was happy that they said they would never have chosen me 
because I clearly was not the right candidate for them.  Too pedantic.  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the end of your questions? 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 106 of 157 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Ms Mokhobo you think you might have quite 
something to share with the Commission on the issues that I have 
raised or you will need to reflect? 
MS MOKHOBO:  Chair I think it is very important that I reflect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
MS MOKHOBO:  So that I do not come. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  With half baked. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no that is fine. 
10 
MS MOKHOBO:  Stories. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is fine. 
MS MOKHOBO:  What I do know for sure Chair is the SABC is a 
microcosm of the country so the political climate of the time in the 
country had a direct impact on the SABC.  Different political parties, 
different interests, different expectations and having their own people 
within the organisation.  That was the first problem.  Secondly people 
who were overly ambitious without understanding the job content and 
relying on the highest levels of the country for them to be given space 
to do as they liked.  That was a big problem.  The third one was the 
20 
lack of a shared vision between those who would be placed in I will say 
very broadly SOE’s because we have seen this play itself out thought 
the SOE’s.  Lack of a clear vision and agenda and agreed modus 
operandi between the people who would be appointed in this.  Another 
very big problem.  Because if there is no agreement and I think this 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 107 of 157 
 
goes to even how the Board Members are appointed.  The Board 
Members are appointed by different Members of Parliament who 
belonged to different political affiliations and have different agendas 
and those people who would come in carrying the agendas of those who 
have appointed them.  And those agendas as you know our political 
parties do not see eye to eye on anything.  So immediately you have – 
ja – you just need a matchstick to light the fire.  The SABC did not have 
– has not had a stable Board.  I think this one is probably – there is 
somewhere where I have analysed that and maybe I should send it to 
you. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes please ja. 
MS MOKHOBO:  But it also goes to the Ministers as well. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Somewhere in my documents I do outline. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja there is …(intervenes). 
MS MOKHOBO:  The difficulties. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There is a part where there is a list of Minister. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  The list of Ministers and how long they were actually 
there. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Within a very short space of time. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  They were about ten or more Ministers quite a few of 
them spent less than or around a year and a half. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 108 of 157 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Then moved out then others came in. It must have 
been quite unstable. 
MS MOKHOBO:  And in each instance the people would be removed 
because they did not satisfy an agenda. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes you see that is what I am – I want to know more 
about in case that agenda is something that falls within the terms of the 
Reference of the Commission to try and get to understand whether all 
of this or most of it arose from something that we are looking at. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And who were the role players who were contributing 
to this situation? 
MS MOKHOBO:  But Chair I would even propose to the Chair that 
perhaps have in camera discussion with each one of those Ministers. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes 
MS MOKHOBO:  Because each one of them …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Will have a story to tell. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  And then form your reports and opinion based on that. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  The same as with the Board Members of the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Each one of them has a story to tell. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well it might be something to think about it is 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 109 of 157 
 
just that in camera hearing is not so easy you know. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To do except you know clear circumstances.  One 
wishes that people – that there would be a fair number of people who 
may have been in those positions Board Members and senior managers 
who would say this is about the country.  As you say it is not just SABC 
it is a lot of SOE’s you know.  This is about the country and this 
Commission is the forum at which everyone can make a contribution to 
say, I know about the following and on my analysis this is connected 
with that and that and that and that.  And then the Commission can 
10 
come up with recommendations aimed at ensuring that whatever wrong 
may have happened does not happen again.  So it is – it would be 
important – it would be good if more people who have got this 
knowledge, former Board Members, senior you know executives could 
just come forward and share.  But do reflect and see what further 
contribution you could make.  Because it would be a pity if one ends up 
not having understood the full picture before making recommendations 
because one did not get all the information.   
MS MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Thank you. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Ms Mokhobo. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We thank you for coming to – again to the 
Commission to give evidence.  We appreciate it but for now you are 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 110 of 157 
 
excused. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Let it be for a long time Chair.  I – having to relive my 
experiences. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  Every time is – it is still very traumatic. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS MOKHOBO:  The pain is intense. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No I can understand. 
10 
MS MOKHOBO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  After lunch Chair then 
the LEA’s will continue yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Law Enforcement Agency work stream? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We will hear the evidence of Advocate Mlotshwa I 
think, is that correct? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Colonel Du Plooy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh Colonel Du Plooy okay thank you.  We are going 
20 
to adjourn then we will resume at 14:05. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  We adjourn.

INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 111 of 157 
 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Good afternoon Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Good afternoon Mr Nicholson.  Are you ready? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Indeed I am Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  The witness …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
We 
have 
not 
started 
with 
Colonel Du Plooy 
previously? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  No.  We have not …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  We have not started. 
10 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Alright.  Do you want to just tell us what his 
evidence will connect to?  Just so that everybody understands where 
we are moving to now. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Indeed Chair.  Chair, the witness I am 
calling is Petrus Johannes Du Plooy.  He is a Colonel in the Hawks.  He 
is going testify.  He is the investigating officer in the Intaka matters 
which is – which had been testified about by Mr Trevor White from PwC.  
Mr Trevor White dealt with the factual issues. 
The – Colonel Du Plooy is going to deal with the issues – will 
20 
corroborate some of those issues and will also deal with the issues as 
he is interaction with the National Prosecuting Authority and how it 
came about that this matter was withdrawn. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr White’s evidence related to – if I recall correctly 
two contracts.  Maybe more.  One contract relating to the Department 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 112 of 157 
 
which had as its political head at the time Mr Mabuyakhulu in 
KwaZulu-Natal and the Department of Health when it was – it had 
Ms Nkonyeni as its Political Head.  Was it two contracts or was it – or 
those were two separate contracts and then there was the Amigo case? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  There are two separate contracts and the 
Amigo case.  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Two separate contracts plus the Amigo case? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  That is correct Chair. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  Yes.  Okay.  Alright. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And he will give evidence in regard all – to all three 
10 
or only the two contracts or only the Amigo case? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Only the Amico case Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Okay. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  The Intaka matters as well.  The media 
had dubbed the Amigo matter. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay.  Are you ready that he should be sworn in? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Let the witness be sworn in. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  With leave – with the Chair’s leave. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
20 
REGISTRAR:  Please state your full names for the record. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  Petrus Johannes Du Plooy. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection to taking the prescribed oath?

REGISTRAR:  Do you consider the oath to be binding on your

Page 113 of 157 
 
conscience? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  I do. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you swear that the evidence you give will be the 
truth, the whole truth and nothing else but the truth?  If so please raise 
your right hand and say so help me God. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  So help me God. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Chair, the witness has prepared an 
affidavit.  The affidavit is marked Exhibit RR5.  With the Chair’s leave 
may the exhibit be handed in? 
CHAIRPERSON:  The rest of the documents in the lever arch file are 
10 
they simply annexures to his affidavit? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are there other affidavits or statement that are not 
annexures to his affidavit in the file? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  There is only one affidavit and this 
Colonel Du Plooy’s affidavit in the file. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Okay.  Colonel Petrus Johannes Du Plooy’s 
affidavit and its annexures are admitted and are marked as Exhibit 
RR5. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  I am indebted Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Colonel Du Plooy, have a look at page 1 
of the documents in front of you.  Can you identify that document? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  I do.  It is a sworn affidavit from myself. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And does that affidavit go from pages 1 to 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 114 of 157 
 
10? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  That is correct. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And the annexures thereafter to your 
affidavit which is part of your affidavit go from 11 to 130? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  That is correct. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  If you have – if you look at the bottom 
right hand corner of each page.  Are those your initials? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And at page 11 is that the Commissioner 
of Oath Certificate? 
10 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Do you confirm the contents of the 
affidavit are true and correct? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  I do Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well at the bottom of each page there appears to be 
two people who initialled.  Is it you and the Commissioner of Oaths? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And the Commissioner of Oaths or both 
you and the Commissioner of Oaths have initialled the annexures as 
20 
well? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Now Colonel Du Plooy where are you 
currently employed? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  I am currently employed at Serious Corruption 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 115 of 157 
 
Unit the DPCI Durban. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  What is the DPCI? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry.  You will just have to raise your voice Colonel.  
Maybe the mic also bring it closer – ja.  Ja. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  As I said I am currently employed DPCI 
Durban.  It is the Directorate of Serious Offences.  I am currently the 
Provincial Coordinator for the serious corruption cases. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  What is the DPCI? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  Directorate of Priority Crimes. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And it is also known as the Hawks? 
10 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  How long have you been in the South 
African Police Services? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  I have completed 36 years. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And can you take us through your career 
very briefly in the South African Police Services. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  I joined the SAPS in December 1983.  I have 
performed duties in the uniform section at Johannesburg – well in 
Johannesburg.  I joined the Detectives in 1991.  I lately became part of 
the – what we call the Government Fraud Task Team.  That was formed 
20 
in 1995.  The main function of that task Team was to look at 
Government fraud in KZN. 
It subsequent – I subsequently perform duties in Syndicate 
Fraud Unit Commercial Branch and then what we had is Anti-Corruption 
Task Team or it is also known by – as the ACTT and currently I am in 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 116 of 157 
 
the Serious Corruption Investigation Unit. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay and what other qualifications do you 
have? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  I have got a National Diploma and I have done 
various courses in Commercial Law. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Currently the units where you are working 
what matters do you investigate? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  We investigate matters that emanate from the 
PFMA, MFMA.  We are looking at corruption, fraud, money laundering, 
racketeering at private sector and in public sector. 
10 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay and do you only work with 
policeman in these units? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  No.  We have what we call the multidisciplinary 
approach that have other stakeholders.  Our stakeholders are like 
forensic auditors, National Treasury, the NPA, Asset Forfeiture to name 
some of them. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Colonel if we can look at paragraph 7 at 
page 2.  You refer to three police CAS numbers. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  That is correct. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Do these CAS numbers refer to the Intaka 
20 
matter? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  That is correct. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And we have confirmed that you are the 
investigating officer of these matters? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  That is correct Chair.  These cases are known 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 117 of 157 
 
to me as – the main person being Dr Savoi or his company Intaka.  So 
they all relate to each other in terms of Dr Savoi. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay and starting at paragraph 7.1 who is 
the complainant in that matter? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  This case was registered after Dr Savoi himself 
came forward and gave information to the then Commercial Branch in 
2009. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  So we have the unusual situation where 
Dr Savoi is both the complainant and the suspect – and the accused? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  That is correct Chair.  At the time the 
10 
Scorpions and the Commercial Branch in SAPS were not one unit.  It 
was before the disbandment of the Scorpions.  So what happened is 
Dr Savoi had reported the matter.  We then registered the case and we 
started investigating.  The Scorpions on their side having done a raid in 
Northern Cape and Cape Town where they have seized Dr Savoi’s stuff. 
So when we merged Colonel Jones – that was the main 
person in the Scorpions dealing with that issue then become my 
Commander.  As a – he is a full Colonel.  I was a Lieutenant-Colonel.  
So – and he then named this investigation – we call it Crisscross.  
Apology.  Crisscross at the time although the press branded this whole 
20 
thing as the Amigo’s. 
So from 153-8 the initial case that Savoi reported we then 
had the other case as the investigation progressed and we had forensic 
auditors on Board at Pricewaterhouse or Mr Trevor White that assisted 
us with those three investigations. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 118 of 157 
 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay.  Did Mr Trevor White about these 
three case numbers? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  Yes he did. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  At paragraph 11 at page 3 you mention a 
memo from the NPA.  The memo is at page 12.  Can we go there? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  That is correct Chair.  This memo is a letter 
that Advocate Anton Steinberg – at some state he was the prosecutor in 
this matter before he went to The Hague.  He was at that stage Deputy 
Director of the NPA.  So he perused and he was part of the Organised 
Crime Division in Durban.  So what happened is he perused the matter 
10 
with Appelsbosch and Rietvlei. 
That is PMB CAS 626/01/2010 to do with the water 
purification plants.  10 million for the two hospitals and then after he 
perused the docket he then – it is sort of a decision that he made that 
we are going to proceed and then he wrote this letter to me.  I then 
replied to this letter as well.  In this letter he says in paragraph – I – if 
I just take you to paragraph 2.  He said: 
“Having perused the above-mentioned docket.  I am 
satisfied 
that 
a 
prima 
faci 
case 
of 
fraud 
alternatively conspiracy to commit fraud has been 
20 
made out in respect of the following individuals.” 
He then names seven individuals.  Now the individuals there 
will be the Intaka portion of it and then the Department of Health 
Officials with the HOD, Dr Nyembezi of the Department of Health.  At 
this stage we knew of the other issues in terms of the Oxy Intaka where 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 119 of 157 
 
Professor Mbhele was involved.  This was the first portion that was 
completed. 
So we were investigating it simultaneously in terms of that.  
So he is – basically was happy and he predicted at that stage that once 
this whole thing is done we will be able to do racketeering or 
racketeering prosecution in terms of the Intaka matter. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay.  If we can just go to the next page.  
It is the second paragraph from the top.  If you can just read that out. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  He said: 
“As 
discussed 
at 
our 
previous 
meetings 
in 
10 
connection with this project there appears to be a 
good prospect of charging most if not all of the 
above with racketeering, but this will be dependent 
upon the finalisation of investigation in respect of 
the remaining matters.  In particular the DO – 
Department of Health Oxy Intaka matter and the 
KZN Department of Local Government Traditional 
Affairs acquisition of Wataka Units.” 
The Wataka is the water purification plants from Intaka.  So 
in there he mentioned the three cases, because he was aware of all 
20 
three cases, but the first case that was ready was this 626 with the 
Appelsbosch and Rietvlei issues. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And he also alludes to a racketeering 
charge sheet at the end of the day. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  Yes.  That as well.  That was his subpoena and 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 120 of 157 
 
I think that is what we were work – walking – working towards. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay.  So you have mentioned that the 
author of these documents was Advocate Steinberg.  At page 15, if you 
can just have a look at that. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  That is correct.  He was a Deputy Director of 
Public Prosecutions Organised Crime Division Durban. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And at page 12 what is the date of the 
memo? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  17 June 2010 Chair. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay.  Can you just briefly explain what 
10 
was the purpose of this memo? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  The purpose of this memo is basically to say 
we are ready to prosecute.  I think after this memo they start drafting 
charge sheets in terms of – to place this matter on the roll and he then 
also sort of gave me …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  I thought what you were looking at just 
now was a letter.  Now you talk about a memo.  Where is the memo? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  The document he is referring to is a 
memo.  I apologise Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  H’mm. 
20 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  At page 12 is the memo. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is a letter.  Not a memo.  Not at least what I 
have got on page 12. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  That is correct Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is a letter written Advocate Steinberg to 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 121 of 157 
 
Colonel Du Plooy. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  That is correct.  It is a letter.  I 
apologise. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I just wanted to make sure that we are talking 
about the same document.  It is a letter …(intervenes). 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As I see it there.  It is written in the format of a letter 
and I do not see anything that says memo.  Ja.  Okay.   We are talking 
about the same thing, but it is a letter. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Indeed Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  Okay. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  That is correct Chair.  It is a letter that 
Advocate Steinberg wrote.  He basically told me that I have to do 
certain things and he said he is basically ready to proceed with the Oxy 
Intaka’s.  Pietermaritzburg CAS 626. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay and he refers to project Crisscross.  
Where does that come from? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  As I said.  That is what Colonel Jones from the 
Scorpions that when we amalgamated.  He called that Crisscross. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Did you reply to this memorandum? 
20 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  Chair I did reply to this memorandum. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And is that ...(intervenes)? 
CHAIRPERSON:  To his letter. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  To this letter.  I apologise Chair. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  Sorry Chair.  To the letter Chair, sorry. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 122 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  But this counsel is confusing you. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are not – yes. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Did you reply to this letter and is the 
reply at page 70? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  That is correct Chair.  I wrote a letter to 
Advocate Steinberg and also to my Provincial Commander at that stage 
Commercial Branch Brigadier Lategan and in this letter I basically 
informed him and the Provincial Commissioner’s Office of the – give 
more detail and – about what this was about and also where I note the 
10 
instructions that he had given me, because paragraph 6 of that letter I 
said I have taken note of your queries with regards to the following 
matters and then I mention if there – I also then for sake of that we 
have record – that he have record of this matter. 
If you go to paragraph 7.  I have made an index in terms of 
what was the contents of the docket at this stage.  So it was both I 
hear what you are saying.  I will do – I will comply, but for record 
keeping this is what we are dealing with.  When our investigations and 
reports were finalised the whole lot was then scanned when it came to 
give further particulars to the defence. 
20 
So it was like 250 000 pages.  So for the sake of the – 
Advocate Steinberg I just mentioned what was in the case, because this 
is Pietermaritzburg CAS 626 contents.  If I can say. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  At paragraph 12 at page 3 you mention 
cases from the Northern Cape.  Can you just explain that very briefly? 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 123 of 157 
 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  Chair, the Northern Cape – when the exhibits 
were seized from Dr Savoi in Intaka and we looked at it.  We realised 
that the Oxy Intaka’s and Wataka issue was also pertaining to the 
Northern Cape.  They have a similar problem to us, but we only had 
one set of documents to work with. 
So we call it the Northern Cape leg and a KZN leg and so 
when Mr Trevor White repaired – prepared his reports got five reports 
and I think they have got four reports and I think he did nine reports all 
together for both provinces.  When Asset Forfeiture was done it was 
done for both of these provinces as well, because they could only take 
10 
his money once. 
So that is where the Northern Cape play the important role in 
us and also the exhibits that or the evidence that we are going to use 
in KZN will also then have to be used in the Northern Cape. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  If you go to paragraph 13 you mention 
five forensic reports by PwC, PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  That is correct Chair.  Just to mention it is 
about 350 lever arch files that that we brought from Cape Town.  For 
KZN Mr White prepared five forensic audit reports.  Now if you look at 
paragraph 13.1 Pietermaritzburg CAS 151 is to do with the Oxy Intaka 
20 
or the self-generating oxygen plants.  Pietermaritzburg CAS 626 have 
the water purification plants for Department of Health and Durban 
Central CAS 153-8 had to do with the water purification for Local 
Government and Traditional Affairs. 
Then 
there 
was 
a 
report 
prepared 
specifically 
for 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 124 of 157 
 
Ms Peggy Nkonyeni and that is why the case reference number is the 
same, because Oxy Intaka is 151, but is the supplementary report in 
terms of her.  If you go to paragraph 13.5 Pietermaritzburg CAS 151 is 
again and that is to do with Professor Green-Thompson.  It was also at 
some stage the Head of Department of Health …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  In KZN and is also a ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hang on.  Hang on.  I am not sure where that is.  I 
was thinking you are still talking about Colonel Du Plooy’s response, 
but it does not have paragraph 13. 
10 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  That is it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So it cannot be that response. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  It is at page 3 paragraph 13 of the 
Colonel’s affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Page 3? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Page 3 paragraph 13. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is in his affidavit? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  We moved from the letter.  Okay.  Alright.  Okay.  
Continue. 
20 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  So Chair there was in total five forensic 
reports, but it is pertaining to three case numbers.  So in total five 
reports.  Two of those reports are supplementary reports that was 
requested by the NPA. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  If we go now to paragraphs 14 and 15 of 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 125 of 157 
 
your affidavit at page 4.  Who was the lead prosecutor? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  The lead prosecutor after Advocate Steinberg 
left to The Hague.  It became Advocate Nledile Dunywa.  He worked 
from the DPP’s Office in Pietermaritzburg. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  H’mm. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  He reported to the – at that stage the Acting 
DPP Advocate Simphiwe Mlotshwa. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON: 
 
Now 
you 
make 
the 
point 
that 
Advocate Mlotshwa was very hands on.  Why do you say so? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  This is quite …(intervenes). 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Was what? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Was very hands on. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well let him give the evidence.  Ja.  Tell us about 
Advocate Mlotshwa as Acting DPP in terms of matters that he had to 
deal with. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  Chair, Advocate Mlotshwa had – I use the 
words hands on, because he played a big role in this matter.  For 
instance he was part of the meetings.  He knew what was the evidence 
about. 
 
Although 
the 
lead 
prosecutor 
is 
Advocate Dunywa.  
Advocate Mlotshwa was on par what is happening and he signed all the 
20 
warrants of arrest. 
When I arrested all the people to appear in his court.  It is his 
signature and not Advocate Dunywa’s signature.  So he is the most 
senior at that stage in KZN to sign those warrants.  So he was happy 
that everything was in order when he signed this. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 126 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  You may continue. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  At paragraphs 16 and 17 of your affidavit 
at page 4 you speak of arrest.  Eight suspects were arrested including 
Savoi. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  That is correct Chair.  On the 25 t h of August 
that was when – they initially were arrested for fraud and the first 
appearance was for that and then later on the racketeering indictment 
and certificates were done.  That was signed by Advocate Simelane.  
The NDPP. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And who signed the warrants of arrest? 
10 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  It was Advocate Mlotshwa.  The Acting DPP. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Now if we go to paragraphs 18 and 19 of 
your affidavit which is at page 4 of the bundle. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  Yes. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Was there a draft charge sheet? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  Yes.  If you look at my Annexure PDP3.  What 
the prosecutors have done.  There was not a racketeering charge 
sheet, but when they placed these matters on the role.  They drafted a 
charge sheet for these two individuals specifically and they would then 
forward it to us to see whether it is in line with what the evidence is.  
20 
Now if you go to Annexure PDP3. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  That is at page 24 of the bundle Chair. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  I have received this and I have saved this on 
my computer.  I have written with pen on top in 2011/07/04. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  If we can just …(intervenes). 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 127 of 157 
 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  Yes.  This is a draft charge sheet that I 
received …(intervenes). 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay.  Continue. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  And in this is the draft sheet for this matter 
where it is written by Peggy Nkonyeni would then be placed on the role 
which would then later be converted into a racketeering matter.  The 
charge sheet itself explains what the allegations against the two 
accused is. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  At paragraph 20 of your affidavit which is 
page 4 you refer to a racketeering certificate. 
10 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  That is correct Chair.  I just want to point out 
there is typing error.  Advocate Simelane was the NDPP.  He was not 
the DPP.  There should be an N before the D.  Advocate Dunywa would 
have 
– 
and 
I 
supposed Advocate Mlotshwa 
would 
have 
made 
presentations to the NDPP whereas he responds listening to them 
issued the racketeering certificate and also approved the indictment for 
racketeering charges. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Let us go to page 40 of the bundle which 
is Annexure PDP4 of your affidavit. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  Chair, this is the racketeering certificate that 
20 
was signed on the 31 s t of July by Advocate Menzi Simelane and in this 
he agreed to prosecute 23 or 23 suspects.  If I can call it and it is 
listed here in terms of Section 2(4) of the Prevention of Organised 
Crime Act. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Are there certificates at pages 40 and 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 128 of 157 
 
41? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  That is correct.  It is two pages. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  And if you can just confirm at page 41 
who signed the racketeering certificate? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  It is Advocate Menzi Simelane the National – at 
that stage the National Director Public Prosecutions. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Now in your evidence so far you have 
stated that no less than three Senior Prosecutors were of the view that 
the evidence suggested racketeering.  Is that correct? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  That is correct. 
10 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON: 
 And 
these 
are Advocate Steinberg, 
Advocate Simelane and Advocate Dunywa. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY: 
 
That 
is 
correct, 
but 
I 
believe 
Advocate Mlotshwa also as Acting DPP in KZN also believed the same. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Okay.  If we go to paragraphs 23 and 24 
of your affidavit which is at page 5 of the bundle.  You state: 
“The matter was transferred to the High Court.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr Nicholson.  I would like his evidence to flow from 
him and for him to only look at the statement if he needs to refresh his 
memory.  That is what I would like.  I would like him to, because he 
20 
probably knows the – what he deals with here.  He has had this for 
quite some time on different topics.  I know we say you lead him, but I 
would like him to give his evidence in a way that shows that he only 
looks at the documents when he needs to refresh his memory, but 
otherwise he can deal with the issues.  Do you want to try that?  So  
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 129 of 157 
 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So maybe not so much drawing his attention to any 
paragraph before he can talk about it, because there would be certain 
events he got involved.  Started some investigation.  There was 
Mr White.  At a certain stage he dealt with Mr Dunywa and Mr Mlotshwa 
over a certain period.  This is what happened, after that this is what 
happened so that the evidence as it unfolds is seen as coming from him 
rather than just following the affidavit. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Indeed Chair, I shall try.  What became 
of the circuits hearing indictment or the certificate? 
10 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:      Sorry I didn’t follow? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Do you know what became of the circuits 
hearing certificate? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:      It would be part of the High Court bundle of 
documents together with the indictment that goes with the certificate. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Let me rephrase that, was the suspects 
or the accused ever indicted for ...(intervenes). 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  Yes they appeared, we have Judge McLaren a 
retired Judge.  Chair this is not a simple case, this is not – it’s a 
complicated case like Mr White have testified it took him three days on 
20 
a high level to explain to you, more or less what just the KZN issue is.  
The NPA then thought, we can’t go to a normal High Court and that 
Judge there have other work so let’s get the separate Court with a 
retired Judge.  He was then appointed – Judge McLaren was appointed 
and we got him to do the trial in a period of three months so it was 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 130 of 157 
 
quite a voluminous tedious thing that we had to do.  The accused then 
...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Well I don’t want what you say to be understood in a 
manner which you probably don’t mean.  The fact that the case was 
going to be heard over a long period doesn’t necessarily speak to its 
complexity, it might speak to the fact that there are many witnesses 
which need – who need to be called and there may be a lot of 
documentation because a case can be complex even if it takes two 
days.  So getting Judge McLaren, who I think was probably retired by 
then would have been more for the fact that the case required a Judge 
10 
who was not going to be involved in other cases for the duration of that 
case and a retired Judge would therefore be more suitable because he 
would have the time. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:   Yes, Chair, maybe to just say it in a different 
way, if you look at racketeering charges and you have a trial, you don’t 
want to have a week now and a week six months later because 
racketeering in its own right is not a simple thing and it was a time 
issue to do with how many witnesses were going to be lead, how many 
documents to be handed in but the case was different in the sense that 
it wasn’t a simple case. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes no, no but what I mean is, you don’t suggest or 
do you suggest that those Judges that are not retired could not handle 
because it was complicated? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:      Any Judge would ...(intervenes). 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 131 of 157 
 
CHAIRPERSON:   That’s not what you hear, what you mean is it needed 
a Judge who had time. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:   That’s correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja and a retired Judge would have time, okay. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:      That’s correct Chair and what happened is, 
the accused all appeared in the – we took the case from the 
Pietermaritzburg Regional Court and then they decide that Durban is 
going to be the best place to have it, so the High Court in Durban was 
used.  They appeared on the racketeering charges and it was remanded 
for various time but at the time when the withdrawals was made in this 
10 
case, it was in High Court, in front of the Judge in terms of the 
racketeering charges that was put to the accused.  The – it took a while 
to do this investigation, Chair as I say it’s a lot of documents, National 
Treasury for their time, in order to assist us, they spent of R100 000 
get professional people that scanned all the evidence, the reports, the 
docket.  So that is – and in my statement, paragraph 25, they typed 
2500 pages which is actually 250 000 pages so it wouldn’t have been 
possible to make 23 sets of all of this.  So it was scanned, National 
Treasury paid for it and we only gave the accused a legal disk to say, 
there’s the case.  So it had its benefits for us and then also we don’t 
20 
have to carry all those boxes around whenever we had a meeting to 
discuss something. 
 
At – I just want to – during March 2012, we then received an 
invite to attend, now at that stage as far as I’m concerned the 
investigation was complete we should prepare for trial.  So in 2012 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 132 of 157 
 
Advocate Dunywa then sent us an invite and if I can just refer you to 
PDP6 – Annexure PDP6 ...(intervenes). 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   That’s at page 127 on the Chair’s 
bundle. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, 127? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   127. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:    A Chair we were invited to a meeting, if you 
look at the invite, it’s an e-mail that was forwarded to myself, Trevor 
White, Colonel Jones and then Advocate Malodgwa was cc’d.  Advocate 
10 
Dunywa was the author of this e-mail and he invited us to a meeting 
that was to be held on the 23 r d of March 2012, 20 t h Floor, Southern Life 
Building, that’s the NPA’s building in Durban and he says: 
“Which will be attended by the National Head of SSCU 
and the National Head of Organised Crime of the NPA.” 
At that stage the National Head of the SSCU was Advocate 
Mrwebi and Advocate Mosing was the Head of Organised Crime.  They 
– we looked at the invite and they request me to do something and I 
request, Mr Trevor White, our Forensic Auditor to prepare documents.  
We didn’t really know what this meeting was going to be about, I would 
20 
say, we didn’t go properly prepared to the meeting in a sense that we 
knew exactly what was going to be discussed.  So in this meeting they 
requested me to make a summary of investigating diary, a list of 
exhibits that was handed in from different Government Departments and 
chain statements.  Chair remember, at this stage they already have 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 133 of 157 
 
everything, the whole docket was scanned, so it – there was nothing I 
can take to make them wiser, they already have it.  The Forensic 
Auditor, Mr White, would then – had to do the flow of funds for Mbezi 
Rowmoor Analysis, Intaka flow of funds, those things are already in the 
report you don’t have to ask for it separately if you can go and read it 
yourself ...(intervenes). 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   If I may just ask, at the point of this 
meeting, were the five forensic reports that you have testified about, 
were they already completed? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:      Yes that’s correct Chair. 
10 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Continue. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:    If you – and Chair what is – which I can’t 
understand about this e-mail if you look at point 3 which doesn’t make 
sense to me, it says: 
“Colonel Jones to submit a report on a mammogram case 
indicating, amongst other things why the case was 
withdrawn and a complete docket.” 
Now Chair, just to enlighten you, this was the case against Ms 
Peggy Nkonyeni and Mkwanazi which also now appear in my matter.  
There was a Maritzburg Department of Health to do with a mammogram 
20 
machine, Advocate Hein van der Merwe was the prosecutor, Colonel 
Jones was the investigating officer, I think it was still in the days of the 
Scorpions.  Why they want to see this docket which has got nothing 
with Intaka, I don’t know.  On the day itself, we did not discuss point 
number 3, I don’t know why Advocate Dunywa put this in the letter, it 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 134 of 157 
 
doesn’t make sense, him being my prosecutor it doesn’t make sense.  
I’m not sure if he was told to put it there, I don’t know but as far as I 
know that all the above-mentioned items Advocate Dunywa had full 
knowledge of it, he had it on a disk.  It was available for anybody to 
look at it. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Would this be an indication, maybe that he might not 
have read certain things that had been furnished to him or to his office? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:   No Chair, you can’t make – knowing how we 
did the investigation, Advocate Dunywa had one case it was Intaka, he 
was given an office in Durban and he only had to do this as far as I 
10 
know, I only dealt with him and this was day-to-day, this wasn’t like, I’ll 
see you next week or next month, this was day-to-day and he was not 
the only prosecutor, he had a team of prosecutors.  There was no way 
that Advocate Dunywa will send me this letter and then me thinking he 
didn’t know what the contents of the case is, I can never come to that 
conclusion. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Had the discussions that you had, had with him prior 
to him sending you this e-mail, had those discussions included 
discussions with him of some of the things that I was asking you for or 
that he was asking Mr White for, so that you say that, I know for sure 
20 
that he had – he was aware that such and such a report was already 
with the NPA because we did discuss it, is it that kind of situation or is 
it not that situation? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:    Chair you can’t say that Advocate – or a 
person can’t say that Advocate Dunywa didn’t know, you must 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 135 of 157 
 
remember there’s a racketeering certificate, there was representations 
to the NDPP, you don’t just get a certificate it’s quite a tedious job.  
Advocate Dunywa, in order to draft an indictment, he had to know the 
contents or the merits of the case, he had to know the facts, he would 
have confirmed with us, but he had to know the case inside out.  That, I 
know it’s quite difficult to get a racketeering certificate because they 
make – they went more than once to Pretoria to make a proposal to 
Advocate Simolani.   
CHAIRPERSON:   So you just can’t understand why he was asking for 
these things from you and Mr White? 
10 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:    But besides the point if you look at the 
heading it say, he informs us who’s going to attend to this, now there’s 
role players that had nothing to do with.  Advocate Dunywa works under 
Advocate Malodgwa , DDP – acting DDP at KZN, Advocate Lawrence 
Mrwebi is  a commercial crime ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   National. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:   Ja but National – but Commercial Crime Head, 
Advocate Mosing, Organised Crime Head, it had nothing to do with my 
case and that is why I didn’t really understand what’s happening now, 
what are we going to do this for because I found it strange that Mbhele 
20 
would send me an e-mail like this and then I had to bring these things, 
so I don’t know where he got this from, whether he got told I’ve got no 
idea, Chair we’ll have to ask him about that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And you never – you have never had the chance to 
hear from him, why he asked for these things? 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 136 of 157 
 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:    Chair I never – because the meeting that took 
place if – maybe if I continue you will understand then I made up my 
own mind what is the reason for this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja from Mr White’s evidence I think I know how the 
meeting was handled and the pressure to – the restriction what you 
could talk about. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:   That is correct Chair but the thing is that we 
attended this meeting Chaired by Advocate Mrwebi on the 23 r d of March 
2012, in my statement I mention who was present.  Now if you look at 
Advocate Dunywa, Vemani, Advocate Makosi Mthembu and there was 
10 
another Advocate, I can’t remember him, but another person present.  
Myself Colonel Jones and then Mr Trevor White and then there were the 
two Advocates, Mosing and Lawrence Mrwebi.  They came through the 
door there was a problem – it was very hot that day and they couldn’t 
find either the aircon was not working or they couldn’t find a room 
where we were going to sit and discuss.  
 
Now at that stage we didn’t know what’s going on.  They came 
they sit down it’s the first time I met these people I didn’t work in the 
Scorpions I didn’t know who is Lawrence, Advocate Mrwebi or whoever.  
He introduced himself to us, he said hello, he said that – at some stage 
20 
he said I’m withdrawing against Mr Mike Khulu what evidence we have 
against Peggy Nkonyeni.  He put it straight to the point, not like the 
invite, the invite they didn’t speak of that in the way that it happened in 
that meeting.  I just want to maybe explain to you Chair that I was also 
part of the commercial set up, the commercial NPA and investigating 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 137 of 157 
 
officers is what we call, prosecutor guided.  It’s a close relationship in 
terms of – we have our own Court, we have special – we have our own 
Commercial Crimes Courts it’s much more hands-on, much more 
personal relationship that you’ll normally have with a prosecutor.  They 
ae more involved, they know what we are doing and they – it’s a better 
way of dealing with cases because the cases get more attention, that 
was the whole purpose of this Commercial Court.   
 
This meeting – so if I go to a meeting that was chaired by a 
prosecutor at the SSCU, its – everybody interacts, everybody will have 
a say and then eventually there will be a conclusion and what is the 
10 
way forward.  This meeting didn’t – this was like, I ask you questions, 
you tell me what, the prosecutors came in they sat on my left I sat next 
to them, they kept quiet, whether it’s by instruction or not the questions 
was directed to me because I’m the investigating officer, Mr White was 
sitting across the table and I was trying to explain – now I just want to 
go one step back, in racketeering the prosecutors have, as I see it, how 
they’re going to approach this matter in Court, they have their own 
strategy there’s certain things they want the Court to draw inference 
on, so they have their own – racketeering in itself has its own benefit in 
terms of prosecution. 
20 
 
I can’t say I’m a layman but I’m not a specialist in the charges, 
this was in 2011 and 2012 so it’s a while ago and what happened is, we 
did not have the same interaction.  The prosecutors kept quiet, we got 
answered, when Mr Mrwebi – he wasn’t happy with our answers, I also 
sort of got a little bit uptight because this meeting wasn’t going well in 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 138 of 157 
 
terms of my view and at a point Mr White said to him, you have to give 
me ample time so I can prepare and then I can come and present it 
over three days, give me three days I’ll present the reports to you, you 
can then go through it and we can satisfy your questions that you have  
but in the way that this meeting took place it wasn’t – I at one stage 
said to them, you as the NPA it’s your job to make the decision, make 
the decision, I’m not going to be a party to what you’re saying here 
because my prosecutors are keeping dead quiet they’re not interacting, 
which is unusual for me. 
 
I said, please notify the DPCI and myself in writing what you 
10 
want to do.  Up till today I don’t know what is the reasons for the 
withdrawal, I don’t know why they came there what was the reasons, 
the NPA can answer that better I don’t know that.  I told Advocate 
Mrwebi, maybe not correctly but I told him, you are just here to tick a 
box, they used those words consultation.  If you consult with the police 
it’s fine then everybody is happy. 
CHAIRPERSON:   But you are articulating what you were feeling about 
this whole matter. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:   I wrote a letter to my Head, General Moodley, 
well is now General he was Brigadier it could be Moodley in charge of 
20 
the Anti Corruption Task Team and I knew I had to explain to General 
Dramat’s office as to why these things took place.  Everybody is under 
the impression there’s this racketeering case and now there’s 
withdrawals all of a sudden but at a stage the withdrawal didn’t take 
place the next week or the week thereafter it took some months before 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 139 of 157 
 
it happened.  This was a consultation in order – whether we have to 
persuade them or change their minds, whether they had meeting with 
the prosecutors before they came into that room, I don’t know.  He 
didn’t discuss any evidence about Mr Mike Khulu, only about Peggy 
Nkonyeni.  Chair so ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay yes, Mr Nicholson you might be feeling left out 
right now, you can continue to lead his evidence ja. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Indeed Chair, Colonel du Plooy you 
mentioned that at the commencement of the meeting Advocate Mrwebi 
stated that he’s withdrawing against Mr Mabuyakhulu and he wants to 
10 
hear about miss – the evidence against Ms Nkonyeni, were these 
charges ever withdrawn? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:     The charges were withdrawn against the two 
accused there were other accused as well that the charges were 
withdrawn in High Court. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   The other accused do you have their 
names? 
CHAIRPERSON:   But before we get to the point where they are 
withdrawn, Colonel du Plooy are you done telling me what occurred at 
that meeting what was the – how did that meeting end? 
20 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:      Chair maybe I must refer you to PDP7 I’m 
not sure, it’s page 129, I wrote this letter in 2012, 21 s t of August to 
Brigadier Moodley then, this letter basically explains ...(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   It’s addressed to the National Coordinator. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:    National Coordinator, the ACTT stands for – it 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 140 of 157 
 
was the Anti Corruption Task Team that the President put in place in 
order to address Government fraud and corruption.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:   So Brigadier Moodley was the Head of that, he 
was the Brigadier, he’s now a General today but he was the head of 
that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:   So we had to inform him that we had this 
meeting, so he’s not surprised by – if he reads in the newspaper there’s 
these withdrawals.  So what happened is Advocate Mrwebi told us what 
10 
he’s going to do, I didn’t know – I knew what he was going to do about 
Mr Mabuyakhulu but he didn’t make up his mind or didn’t tell us what 
he’s going to do with Ms Peggy Nkonyeni at that meeting, so we left.  I 
then wrote this letter because on the 16 t h of August 2012 the press 
then phoned me, I think the – it was the Mercury, if I read my own 
paragraph one, of my letter and they are saying that there is going to 
be this withdrawal so they’ve got a letter or they got a letter from the 
accused they knew there was going to be a withdrawal.  I said I don’t 
know because we were never formally informed that there’s going to be 
a withdrawal and on the – I’m just looking for a date. 
20 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   If we can just look at page 129 the first 
paragraph, you say – if you’re going to see that paragraph. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:      Sorry which paragraph are you referring to? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Paragraph 1 on page 129. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  Yes, this is on the 16 t h of August where the 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 141 of 157 
 
press are now asking us questions about the withdrawal against certain 
accused and they apparently have letters that were signed by the 
Acting Director of Public Prosecutions, I think at that stage it was the 
Director, I think Advocate Noko was appointed after Advocate – I think 
this might have been, the word Acting, should not be – I think it’s 
Advocate Noko because Advocate Noko signed letters that was to the 
accused where it says intention of withdrawal.  In other words, the 
accused knew that the cases against them were going to be withdrawn 
before myself.  I’ve actually asked – when I found out about this I 
asked Advocate Dunywa the prosecutor, he said he’s not aware of this, 
10 
he doesn’t know about this withdrawal, he’s saying he wasn’t informed, 
so I take his word for that.  The NPA also released – in paragraph two, 
the NPA also had a press release the following day where they’re 
indicating that these charges are going to be withdrawn and then 
paragraph three I talk about who it is going to be withdrawn against 
which then took place.  Subsequently then the withdrawal took place 
against those accused, against Peggy Nkonyeni, Mike Mabuyakhulu, 
Lindiwe Nkomazi Pendile Thule Ndosi, those three were the Khuboni 
Attorneys that took over from Sandile Khuboni.  
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   The other four names that you 
20 
mentioned, you mentioned Ms Nkonyeni, Mr Mabuyakhulu, the other 
four names that you mentioned there, were you consulted about the 
withdrawal of those Members? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:      No. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Of those accused. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 142 of 157 
 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:      No we only spoke about – the only person 
that was discussed is Peggy Nkonyeni.  He said I’m withdrawing Mike 
Mabuyakhulu but the Mkwanazi’s and the other three not a word 
mentioned about them. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   And if we can just turn to the 
racketeering certificate which is at page 40 of the Chair’s bundle. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:      That is correct. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   All six people that you have mentioned, 
are they part of this racketeering certificate? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:      That is correct, they are part of the 
10 
certificate. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   If you can just say where they are? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:      Accused 3 – accused 4 is Peggy Nkonyeni, 
accused 13 is Mike Mabuyakhulu, accused 15 is Lindiwe Mkwanazi, 
then accused 16 Pendela, accused 17 Thuzi and accused 18 is Nozi, 
the three attorneys. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Now you’ve testified that three days 
were allocated for this matter in Court, what’s the status of this matter 
currently? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:      We have ...(intervenes). 
20 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Three months, I beg your pardon. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  Sorry I didn’t hear.  
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   I said you mentioned that three months 
was allocated for the hearing, for the prosecution of this matter, what’s 
the status of this matter presently. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 143 of 157 
 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:    As we speak today the 5 t h and the 6 t h of May 
is a permanent stay application that’s going to be heard in High Court, 
which Dr Savoi brought or Intaka brought it’s going to be argued – the 
main issues that they’re raising is, you withdraw charges against Peggy 
Nkonyeni and Mike Mabuyakhulu yet you still charge Dr Savoi for the 
same things, how does the evidence change it didn’t go away it’s still 
the same, how does that fit.  They want an answer for that and 
therefore they say, when the NPA dealt with this issue they didn’t follow 
their procedures, it’s basically an abuse of power and that is what the 
defence is arguing in their papers, it’s going to be heard on the 5 t h and 
10 
6 t h of March. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Now if we can just return to the 
withdrawal of the charges, were you in court when the charges were 
withdrawn. 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Are you able to say what transpired in 
Court? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:   Advocate Dunywa stood up he said, as per my 
instructions I’m withdrawing the charges, he didn’t say (indistinct) I 
don’t think there’s a case I’m withdrawing, he said, as per my 
20 
instructions and then he further – he ended up with saying: 
“As the accused were already notified in writing of the 
intention to withdraw by Advocate Noko.” 
So he didn’t have a choice but to withdraw it because the DPP 
of KZN already made the decision for him in writing by notifying the 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 144 of 157 
 
accused then the charges were withdrawn, he actually placed it on 
record on the High Court. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Now you’ve made the point that ACTT 
Act was never provided with reasons for the charges being withdrawn.  
Was the South African Police Services as the wider body, were they 
ever provided with reasons for the charges being withdrawn? 
COLONEL DU PLOOY:    Nobody from the investigation side was ever 
informed of the reasons.  So I – up till today I don’t know what is all the 
reasons, I’ve never seen a presentation or representation in terms of 
why.  Chair if you intend withdrawing charges and you as a prosecutor 
10 
will come to me and say listen, we have to withdraw or we short the 
following items because we need to prove intention or whatever the 
facts is, we will then see whether the investigation can reveal or cover 
that potions that you are lacking or that you require as a prosecutor to 
then complete a proper charge sheet or to prosecute.  In this case it’s 
just withdrawal and a case, sort of, go away.  We never had the 
opportunity to fix – if we did something wrong, we never got that 
opportunity.  the other portion as well is that if you withdraw against 
people, it doesn’t mean they can’t become a witness because these 
people played a role in this – in the actions in terms of how this thing 
20 
played out, I don’t know whether they’re going to be called or whether 
they just disappear especially Mr Mike Mabuyakhulu, Peggy Nkonyeni, 
those people.  There was a period that there was a lot of High Court 
applications, Dr Savoi and his Legal Team brought a lot of applications 
and it was dealt with by the Head Office, not the Durban office by the 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 145 of 157 
 
Head Office of the NPA and with – among all those years I’m talking 
about six, seven, this thing started in 2009 so the case is on hand 11 
years but let’s say the last six years, I’ve never heard of the reasons or 
never given the opportunity to see what can we do to satisfy the NPA 
not to withdraw charges, that never happened. 
CHAIRPERSON:   One second.  Yes Mr Nicholson? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   So, if I hear you correctly, the status of the 
investigation and the withdrawal of the charges as you have stated in 
your – is this a letter or memorandum?  This is a letter at page 129.  That 
is just the, that is just your understanding of how the matters were 
10 
withdrawn and the status of the matters? 
MR DU PLOOY:   Ja, at that stage.  That was 2012.  That was my 
understanding on it.  That letter I drafted I actually explain in paragraph 8 
who these people are that is going to be withdrawn.  If you look at – at 
the second page – or 130 paragraph 8, I actually explain who these 
people are, because I am telling my bosses what is the names that I am 
saying to you how they involved in the matter, and then if you look at 
paragraph 11 of that same letter I say there, I had no dealings, the people 
that withdrew the matter up till today I never met Advocate Noko.  I know 
she was in KZN, I never met her personally.  The matter was withdrawn.  I 
20 
never met, I think her, at this stage the NDPP was Advocate Jiba.  I never 
met her.  I do not know; I do not know her.  I only dealt with Advocate 
Mlotshwa, Advocate Nledile, and currently Advocate Vimbani is my lead 
prosecutor with Advocate Makhosi Mthembu, and I just want to use, by 
way of using an example Chair, about the relationship that the 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 146 of 157 
 
Investigating Officer that I had in this matter, we – the last person that we 
withdrew the case against was Professor Green Thompson.  We went – 
myself and the two Advocates, we went, we consulted various witnesses.  
We realised that as they said it then its – we were not happy with it as it 
is now and if we withdraw against Professor Thompson we can always put 
it later back on the role if there is other issues that was clarified.  I was a 
part of that decision, I played a role, as Investigating Officer I played a 
role in that, not the way that Advocate Mogwebe treated us in that 
meeting.  We were not – we, it was not a participating thing in terms of 
where my Prosecutors can come in and say wait, this is what we decided 
10 
in terms of our strategy, what the Prosecutors kept quiet.  It is like they 
got told to keep quiet.  And then we had – and when we asked for an 
extension, let us properly inform you in terms of the facts as the merits of 
that, he says no I do not have time, my hour is up.   
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Okay, if we go to – just one annexure that 
we have not dealt with, is at page 49 of the Chair’s bundle, and it goes all 
the way through to page 125.  Are you able to identify that document? 
MR DU PLOOY:   This is the indictment that goes with the racketeering 
certificate.  It was forwarded to me.  It is a draft indictment to myself as 
Investigating Officer.  This is the indictment which they then later on 
20 
appeared in Court for racketeering charges, the accused.   
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   If we go to page 92, who’s name appears 
there? 
CHAIRPERSON:   A lot of Colonel du Plooy’s evidence is corroborative, 
so we might not have to go through everything for purposes of   
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 147 of 157 
 
corroboration because a lot of those things are difficult to think anybody 
would dispute them but there are those which may well be disputed and 
therefore it will be important to cover, so I just mentioned that you bare 
that in mind, I am not saying do this, do not do that as long as you bare 
that in mind because a lot of it like that meeting that we have talked 
about, Mr White talked about it extensively, but it is important to have 
corroboration for what transpired at that meeting, that is important 
because that could well be disputed or certain aspects of their evidence 
may well be disputed, but keep an eye for those that are unlikely to be 
disputed. 
10 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Indeed Chair, I am about to wrap up Chair, 
there is just one point that I want to make emanating from this. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   At page 92 of the Chair’s bundle, whose 
name appears there? 
MR DU PLOOY:   It is Advocate Mlotshwa. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   And was Advocate Mlotshwa at the meeting 
of the 23 r d of March? 
MR DU PLOOY:   No, he was invited, or he was cc’d, but he never 
attended. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, …(intervenes).   
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Do you know. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Oh, I am sorry, just ask, ja. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Do you know if he was consulted?  Are you 
able to spread any light on that?   
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 148 of 157 
 
MR DU PLOOY:   No, I cannot remember. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Okay. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Was it not quite strange that he was not invited to the 
meeting if that is what happened?  In circumstances where he was the 
acting head of the NPA in the province and had been very involved 
throughout this matter up to that stage?  
MR DU PLOOY:   I agree with you Chair in a sense that Advocate 
Mogwebe told us he is reviewing the matter.  Normally an outsider from 
that section cannot come and butt into an investigation, prosecution from 
somebody else because they have to do their own thing, but if he was 
10 
sent by the then Acting NDPP to come and review this matter, whatever 
the reasons for that is, I would expect Advocate Mlotshwa to be there, 
because you must remember the Prosecutors have to defend that 
racketeering charge it and that indictment.  It was not the Investigating 
Officers, SAPS or Mr White that drafted that.  We gave them the 
information evidence, they drafted that.  If they believe strongly in their 
case to take it to the High Court, then surely Mr Mlotshwa and the 
Prosecutors can defend that.  I cannot talk on behalf of them, but I would 
expect Mr Mlotshwa to be there. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, thank you.  You said something earlier in your 
20 
evidence with regard to Mr Mogwebe’s Unit in the NPA vis-à-vis this type 
of case, I understood you to be saying that Mr Mogwebe’s, that this type 
of case fell outside of the Unit that Mr Mogwebe was heading.  Did I 
understand you correctly? 
MR DU PLOOY:   Although this case is of commercial content, in other 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 149 of 157 
 
words it will be similar to what he is dealing with it, but it was not his 
responsibility, the DPP KZN, it was his responsibility.  Mr Mogwebe is the 
head of commercial which sits at the, although the various Courts exist in 
the country, he is managing the Prosecutors for that, those Courts from 
the National Office, that is where his office is.  So, we never had one 
meeting with him or Advocate Mosing, or Moseng.  There should not have 
been any interaction with them normally.  They would never be involved, 
but when he came, he said I am reviewing the matter.  In my language it 
means somebody is sending them to have a look at what we are dealing 
with.  That is why I sort of want to agree with you Chair that I think 
10 
Advocate Mlotshwa and at least the Prosecutors should have on the day 
that we had this meeting say their say in front of us.  If I said something 
they did not agree with then they have to say that but, because of the 
strategy of prosecutions which they play a vital role, I could not give 
those answers to Advocate Mogwebe.  I did not decide to prosecute, they 
sitting with, I have got all these Advocates, we went – we attended 
meetings in Pretoria in VGM where the, at Mr Simelane’s office where Dr 
Ramaite there all, like 20, 30 Advocates sitting, and they were aware of 
this.  So it is not like this case, and this case was well publicised in the 
newspapers.  It was an important case in a sense that of the people that 
20 
was involved, it was important because remember we did as a forfeiture 
so we ceased Dr Savoy’s assets.  We want to get our government money 
back …(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   So you were not making a point along the lines that 
this case, that there was somebody else at the Head Office of the NPA 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 150 of 157 
 
under whom this case fell and it was not Mr Mogwebe.  That is not the 
point we are making, we are simply making the point that you had had no 
interactions with him, the people you had had interactions with, were the 
people in the KZN office of the NPA, Mr Mlotshwa and Mr Dudla.   
MR DU PLOOY:   But for prosecution purposes Mr Mogwebe is not in the 
Department that deals with this matter.  The only person that can actually 
send him to come and review a case a full side outside of his office, is 
Advocate Jiba, the NDPP, or the Acting NDPP at the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Who was Acting NDPP at the time. 
MR DU PLOOY:   Because I think in the NPA Act there is certain issues 
10 
that governs in a way that reviews take place.  I am not sure exactly 
what, but you cannot just walk into another guys office and say I want to 
review your …(intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:   Unless of course Advocate Mogwebe and Advocate 
Mosing had gone there with the blessing of the Acting National Director of 
Public Prosecutions? 
MR DU PLOOY:   I did not think Advocate Mlotshwa would have allowed 
them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes 
MR DU PLOOY:   To do that if there was not a blessing somewhere.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   If there was? 
MR DU PLOOY:   If there was not a blessing from Advocate Jiba. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, ja, so 
MR DU PLOOY:   Because what were they doing there in his place? 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, so you think there must have been a blessing from 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 151 of 157 
 
the acting, as you see it. 
MR DU PLOOY:   Chair I cannot see that Advocate Mogwebe wake up one 
morning and thinks I am going to check out that mummy boy’s case and 
see what is happening there.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, yes, okay. 
MR DU PLOOY:   I do not think it happened like that. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Just one more issue before I conclude, 
Colonel Du Plooy you mentioned that – I want to stay away from laboured 
complainants.  The first affidavit in the – in CAS 1538/1/2009, that is a 
10 
Durban Central CAS, was obtained from Dr Savoy. 
MR DU PLOOY:   That is correct yes. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   How did it come about that he reported this 
matter? 
MR DU PLOOY:   Dr Savoy made a donation, well in terms of what he is 
saying he made a donation to the ANC of 1,053 million.  Those monies 
was paid over into Sandile Kabone’s trust account.  He issues, Sandile 
Kabone issued a – call it an invoice where he said it is for legal fees.  Dr 
Savoy then realised then at some stage that, because he claimed VAT on 
it, he then reported it to say, I never had any dealings with Mr Kabone, so 
20 
in other words that invoice for work done is fictitious.  He then paid back 
the VAT in terms of that invoice, that covered the donation to the ANC.  
So what happened is, when he reported it I think he also got advised that 
this might be corruption in a way because the money that was utilised 
from Kabone, then went to Mr Tshabalala and his wife for their debt.  So 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 152 of 157 
 
Advocate – Mr Kabone paid of his, wherever he had debt for his farm, his 
tractors, whatever.  So if you follow the money the money never – that 
specific money in terms of as it come into the bank account and how it 
was spent did not reach the ANC in terms of that million or that 1,053 
million.  Dr Savoy realised it was, I suppose it is a point for legal advice 
and reported the matter.  So I took a – he reported it, I then went back 
and we took a Section 204 statement from him in Cape Town.  So he was 
going to be our person to explain this from the commercial branch, but 
not a person for the Scorpions.  The Scorpions did their own thing, and 
then when we merged it was then decided that Dr Savoy actually is the 
10 
main perpetrator in terms of where all the money went, in terms of the 
procurement portions.  That is when we then combined everything.  The 
Northern Cape and KZN. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Okay.  Those are my questions Chair, 
…(intervenes).   
MR DU PLOOY:   I just want to, sorry I just want to add there Chair that I 
finish up here where I say and this was also one of my problems that I 
had.  There was a submission made to the High Court, and I saw it was 
like a statement and what and not.  And I saw that they mention that 
Advocate Dhunia is not a Prosecutor anymore, and it worried me because 
20 
he is my Prosecutor I am dealing with, I phoned him, and he said to me 
he is still the Prosecutor, I said no Nadile you are not, you have been 
removed.  There is somebody else now but it is not you.  He then assured 
me he did not know about this, so he was removed as Prosecutor for the 
entire matter, KZN.  Kimberly had its own Prosecutor, but for the KZN 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 153 of 157 
 
matter, that is all thanks. 
CHAIRPERSON:   So was the position that you thought he had been 
removed but actually he had not been removed or was the position that he 
had been removed but he did not know he had been removed? 
MR DU PLOOY:   That is correct Chair.  He did not know he was not 
…(intervenes).  
CHAIRPERSON:   And he had been removed?  
MR DU PLOOY:   He did not know that, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And around about when was that when you had that 
discussion with him about being removed or not, do you recall? 
10 
MR DU PLOOY:   I cannot recall the date, but it is at the end.  Thereafter 
he was not involved in the matter anymore. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  So in the end he was not removed, he just did not 
know?  He was removed but he did not know, until they called him.  
MR DU PLOOY:   He was removed but he did not know, they did not tell 
him I am going to remove you. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
MR DU PLOOY:   That did not happen.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, okay, thank you.  Now Mr Nicholson, if there are 
important matters that you think have not been covered and should be 
20 
covered, feel free to cover them.  I do not want you to feel that I 
restricted you too much, I just did not want us to cover things that are 
unlikely to be controversial especially because we – our time is precious, 
but anything that is important that you feel you have not had a chance to 
cover, feel free to cover. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 154 of 157 
 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Chair from my side I have covered all, 
everything that I have prepared on.  I do not think there is anything else. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Colonel Du Plooy is there something that you feel we 
have not – we overlooked, that you think is important for you to mention? 
MR DU PLOOY:   No Chair that is all I have to say. 
CHAIRPERSON:   You think it is covered?   
MR DU PLOOY:   I think it is covered Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, alright, thank you very much Colonel Du Plooy 
for coming to give evidence, we appreciate it very much.  For now you are 
excused.   
10 
MR DU PLOOY:   Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Chair, the other witness who is only 
available tomorrow is Advocate Mlotshwa.  So he will be here tomorrow.  I 
see that we still have some time but unfortunately there is no other 
witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes.  How long is he likely to be? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Not, two hours, not more than three. 
CHAIRPERSON:   And then do you have somebody else? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   There is nobody else.   
20 
CHAIRPERSON:   There is nobody else.  
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Unfortunately, we had intended calling 
Advocate Manyathi however she was only available on the 1 s t, Monday 
and Tuesday. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes. 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 155 of 157 
 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   He was not available for the latter part of 
the week. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay and then arrangements will be made for 
another – for him to come on another day? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   To conclude his evidence yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja, okay that should be done without delay so that we 
are done with this part of the evidence. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   The reports – Mr White’s report or reports and 
whatever reports relates to these matters that emanate from the 
10 
investigation that Mr White conducted.  Do we know whether they have 
been presented to persons who are implicated and that they have been 
given an opportunity to indicate whether they seek to give any evidence 
before the Commission to challenge those reports and that evidence and 
whether they seek leave to cross-examine anybody? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   As far as I understand with Mr Trevor White 
and this witness, Mr Trevor White, there was only two legal 
representatives who came forward to say that they may do an application 
for cross-examination.  
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, oh there was counsel for, oh no – no I am thinking 
20 
about something else Commission Ngobeni. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Yes that is correct, yes, there was a 
counsel for that.   
CHAIRPERSON:   Ja. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   And 
there 
was 
another 
counsel 
here 
26 FEBRUARY 2020 – DAY 219 
 
Page 156 of 157 
 
present while Mr Trevor White testified.   
CHAIRPERSON:   But nobody came who represented for example Ms 
Nkonyeni and Mr Mabuyakhulu, as far as you recall? 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   If I may just speak to – my understanding 
is that they have made representations and they have asked for the 
reports and they have been given them. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Yes, okay maybe, maybe after we have adjourned I 
could be briefed fully on that so that we see what plans need to be made 
to hear what they have to say together with anyone else including people 
like the HOD for Health, of course Dr Savoy and whoever else so that we 
10 
can – we know whether one, they desire to give evidence, they desire to 
do whatever or whether they are saying well because there is a criminal 
trial coming we are electing not to challenge the evidence. 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Indeed Chair, what I can say is that we are 
in the process because that – the DS for 3.3’s have expired.  We are in 
the process of inviting, of writing letters to invite them to make 
submissions and then we will make a decision as the Legal Team if we 
need to take any further steps. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Okay, but after we have adjourned please come through 
so that I can be updated. 
20 
ADV WILLIAM NICHOLSON:   Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:   Thank you very much.  We are going to adjourn the 
proceedings for the day and tomorrow we will resume at normal time, 
namely 10:00.  We adjourn.
