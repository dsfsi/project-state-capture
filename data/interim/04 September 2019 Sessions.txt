CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Mr Chairman the witness 
that we intend calling me this morning is Mr Jonathan Thekiso.  That – 
his statement – there is two bundles before you Mr Chair they would be 
marked Exhibit CC17.1 and Exhibit CC17.2 to CC18. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat that? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  17 – Exhibit CC17. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And the next – the second one – he has 
two statements the one is in that bundle and the other one is in Exhibit 
CC17.2 that is where his supplementary statement is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see – oh why is it written in such small letters 17.1 
and 17.2? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Point 2. Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see I just see on this one CC17 and I am trying to 
look for CC17.1 then I realise after some time that… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh they used a smaller font yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  What page is his statement? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  His statement in CC17.1 is the very first 
statement.  It will be under the divider marked CC17.  And it starts from 
page 1 the statement itself and then the rest are annexures.  Statement 
it goes – starts from page 1 up to page 10 and the remainder are 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 3 of 173 
 
annexures.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well under divider 17 I have got a SABC letter.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  What does the letter say Mr Chairman? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Under divider 17. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In CC17.1 I have got a letter from – with the 
letterheads of SABC not a statement. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No I think – I think Mr Chairman you 
looking – if you could look at the file divider. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay let us – let us. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  File divider CC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Let us start afresh.  17.1 is that the correct one? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is the correct one. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Right. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then if you turn that file you will find a 
divider that is marked CC17.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes,  okay,  right at the beginning. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine.  I thought it was –  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is then his initial statement and then 
20 
a supplementary statement it is in CC17.2 which is in the lever arch file 
marked CC17.2 to CC18. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes – is there another statement? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.

Page 4 of 173 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And where do I find it?  Is it right at the top as well? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It will be on top yes.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay that is a supplementary statement. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  It starts from page 334. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Okay.  Thank you Mr 
Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now before we start I am going to ask you to – in 
regard to each witness to mention to indicate what each witness’ 
10 
evidence – under what part of each witness’ evidence will fall in the 
terms of reference so that I am satisfied that we are – the witness is 
going to be giving evidence that falls under the terms of reference.  I 
am just going to take some time to refresh our memory about the terms 
of reference because I must make sure that the evidence that I hear 
falls within our terms of reference.  The terms of reference read as 
follows: 
“A judicial commission of Inquiry the commission is hereby appointed in 
terms of Section 82(2)F of the Constitution of the Republic of South 
Africa 1996.   
20 
The commission is appointed to investigate matters of public and 
national interests concerning allegations of state capture, corruption 
and fraud.” 
Then they say under 1. 
“The commission shall inquire into make findings, report 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 5 of 173 
 
on and make recommendations concerning the following 
guided by the Public Protector’s State of Capture Report, 
the 
constitution, 
relevant 
legislation, 
policies

December 
2017

number 
91139/2016. 
1.1 Whether and to what extent and by whom attempts 
were made through any form of inducement or for 
any gain whatsoever – or for any gain of whatsoever 
nature to influence members the National Executive 
10 
including Deputy Ministers, office bearers and or 
functionaries employed by or office bearers of any 
state institution or organs of state or directors of the 
boards of SOE’s.  In particular the commission must 
investigate the veracity of allegations that former 
Deputy Minister of Finance, Mr Mcebisi Jonas and 
Ms Mentoor were offered cabinet positions by the 
Gupta family.  That is 1.1. 
1.2 Whether the President had any role in the alleged 
offers of cabinet positions to Mr Mcebisi Jonas and 
20 
Ms Mentoor by the Gupta family as alleged. 
1.3 Whether the appointment of any member of the 
National Executive functionary and or office bearer 
was disclosed to the Gupta family or any other 
unauthorised person before such appointments were 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 6 of 173 
 
formally made and or announced.  And if so whether 
the President or any member of the National 
Executive is responsible for such conduct.  
1.4 Whether the President or any member of the present 
or previous members of his national executive 
including deputy ministers or public official or 
employee of any state owned entities breached or 
violated the constitution or any relevant ethical code 
or legislation by facilitating the unlawful awarding of 
tenders by SOE’s or any organ of state to benefit the 
10 
Gupta family or any other family or individual or 
corporate entity doing business with government or 
any organ of state. 
1.5 The nature and extent of corruption if any in the

business entities or organisations by public entities 
listed under Schedule 2 of the Public Finance 
Management Act Number 1 of 1999 as amended. 
1.6 Whether 
there 
were 
any 
irregularities, 
undue 
enrichment, corruption and undue influence in the

awarding of contracts, mining licences, government 
advertising in the New Age newspaper and any other 
government services in the business dealings of the 
Gupta family with government departments and 
SOE’s. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 7 of 173 
 
1.7 Whether any member of the National Executive and 
including Deputy Ministers unlawfully or corruptly or 
improperly intervened in the matter of the closing of 
banking facilities for Gupta owned companies. 
1.8 Whether any advice as in the Ministry of Finance 
were 
appointed 
without 
proper 
procedures 
in 
particular and as alleged in the complaint to the 
Public Protector whether two senior advisors who 
were appointed by Minister Des Van Rooyen to the 
National 
Treasury 
were 
so 
appointed 
without 
10 
following proper procedures. 
1.9 The nature and extent of corruption if any in the 
awarding of contracts and tenders to companies, 
business entities or organisations by government 
departments, agencies and entities in particular 
whether any member of the National Executive 
including the President, public official, functionary of 
any organ of state influenced the awarding of 
tenders to benefit themselves, their families or 
entities in which they held a personal interest. 
20 
2. These terms of reference may be added to varied or 
amended from time to time.” 
So we need to always bear in mind what the terms of reference of the 
commission are and I just want to make sure that we fall within. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Chair the evidence that 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 8 of 173 
 
we are leading is a continuation of what we stared.  We started this last 
year with the evidence of Doctor Kaufmann who had identified what 
state capture is and he had testified that if you capture the media that 
is state capture.  We continued with that evidence through the evidence 
of Mr Sundaram who indicated the attempts to capture the TV stations.  
So this is a continuation of that.  And Chair would recall that Chair has 
always told us that he needs to answer three questions.  The first 
question is what happened?  The second question is how did it happen?  
And the third question is what must done in order to make sure that it 
does not recur?  Now state capture as it is this phenomenon does not 
10 
come as the Chair would know in a bundle identified as state capture.  
We are adducing evidence to show how the attempts were made and 
that will fall squarely within 1.1 of the terms of reference because there 
– there is reference – in fact the preamble that the Chair has read:  
“The commission is appointed to investigate matters 
of public and national interest concerning allegations 
of state capture, corruption and fraud.  So we are 
dealing with state capture largely of – or attempts to 
capture the media and that is what we started as I 
indicated earlier.  And if one looks at 1.1 that is 
20 
based on the Public Protector Report State Capture 
Report.  Whether and to what extent and by whom 
attempts were made through any form of inducement 
or for any gain of whatsoever nature to influence 
members of the National Executive including Deputy 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 9 of 173 
 
Ministers, 
office 
bearers 
and 
or 
functionaries 
employed 
by 
or 
office 
bearers 
of 
any 
state 
institutions or organs of state or directors or board of 
SOE’s.”   
And then in particular.  So the point that you are making Chair is that if 
there are influences of editorial policies they are influences that direct 
the way in which news must be broadcast to the public.  That is a 
matter of national interest. And Chair had allowed this evidence of Mr 
Sundaram tied in with that of Doctor Kaufmann and we believe that 
these are matters that are critical and they will show – for instance this 
10 
witness is going to show how in that whole process of executing this 
and – this animal called state capture how skilled professionals were 
asked to leave.  You will find for example and example of a person who 
is told go home when the contract still has a period of five years to run. 
But he is told no you can home.  Will you SABC will waive all of its 
rights.  You can go home and then we will simply pay you for that.  That 
is what this witness’ evidence is going to be about.  About the 
consistent manner in which executives that could have perhaps 
protected the SABC from the situation which we described the past two 
days.  All of those employees were asked long before their terms 
20 
expired, you go you sit at home and then in the process they will 
employ an acting person and in the process they pay R12 million, R5 
million, R4 million.  So that is the – that to us Chair is relevant because 
it demonstrates how some of the actions that are going to come later 
tied in with what we are demonstrating now would at the end of the day 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 10 of 173 
 
enable us as the evidence leaders to make the submissions to you that 
indeed this fell within the terms of reference 1.1 and it was indeed 
state capture as these witnesses are going to deal with. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see Mr Sundaram’s evidence was tied in with 
the project of – the establishment of the New Age and ANN7 and there 
is a specific reference to the New Age in the terms of reference. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that was fine.  It is connected with the Gupta 
family and there is specific reference to it to in the terms of reference.  
Now it is not every wrongdoing that may have been happening in 
10 
various state owned entities or government departments that falls 
within the terms of reference   It has got to be wrongdoing that can be 
connected with the terms of reference.  As I was reading them:  
1. Is connection with state capture.   
2. Is to a very large extent corruption and fraud that is connected 
with contracts – the awarding of contracts and tenders. 
So in other words there may well be a lot of wrongdoing that may have 
been happening in government departments and state owned entities 
which was bad and which should be dealt with but which might fall 
outside the terms of reference of the commission.  So it is important 
20 
therefore that when we look at wrongdoing we are able to link it to 
check whether it links with the terms of reference.  Now I mean I have – 
I have read all the terms of reference.  Most of them are linked to 
tenders and doing business – outsiders doing business with organs of 
state or organs of – or cabinet ministers, deputy ministers, other 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 11 of 173 
 
functionaries and office bearers in government – in state owned entities 
and government departments doing certain wrong things in order to 
favour certain individuals with government business and so on.  So I 
am keen that we look at it properly.  You say this witness’ evidence will 
fall under 1.1? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that right? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is right yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now you know 1.1 appears to have a problem and you 
might be able to assist me whether there is a problem.  Before – before 
10 
where it says: in particular and then it talks about Mr Mcebisi Jonas 
and Ms Mentoor before that sentence it does not appear to be 
complete.  It is whether and to what extent and by whom attempts were 
made through any form of inducement or for any gain of whatsoever 
nature to influence members of the National Executive including Deputy 
Ministers, officer bearers and or functionaries employed by or office 
bearers of any state institution or organ of state or directors of the 
boards of SOE’s.  Then it does not say attempts to influence them to do 
what? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  That is – Chair would recall that 
20 
right at the outset when the commission commenced. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  As the legal team we had made 
submissions on the terms of reference. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 12 of 173 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  As to how they should be interpreted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  How far should they go? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And to what extent can they be limited if 
they have to be limited? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So that is the challenge we have.  For 
example if you take the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We are going to deal with the contracts. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We are going to call one or – one of the 
former Ministers to come and explain to you how certain contracts were 
entered into. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But we are going to also show you how 
skilled people were removed in order to enable people who were not 
qualified. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  To be put in those places so as to enable. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  State capture to happen.  And 
unfortunately without us doing that we are not going to be able to 
assist you when at the end of the day we have to submit a report and 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 13 of 173 
 
deal with what is it that happened within the SABC. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see if you – if you lead evidence that shows how 
– that shows wrongdoing that was connected with the awarding of 
contracts and that wrongdoing would have been against the policies. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the – of SABC procurement procedures that – that 
should be fine.  That would be fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes it will be.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That might not – you might not even need 1.1 which 
does not seem to have a value. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know.  It might fall under – under – under 1.4/ 
“Whether the President or any member of the present 
of previous members of his National Executive or 
public official or employee of any state owned 
entities breached or violated the constitution or any 
relevant ethical code or legislation by facilitating the 
unlawful awarding of tenders by SOE’s or any organ 
of state to benefit the Gupta family or any other 
family 
or 
individual 
or 
corporate 
entity 
doing 
20 
business with government or organ of state.” 
If you – if you link it to the awarding of contracts it should fall under 
that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It will – Chair the difficulty is one with the 
evidence as it progresses I cannot take this witness’ evidence 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 14 of 173 
 
individually. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And say this evidence on its own will show 
you state capture. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I have to link it with the other evidence 
that you are going to lead. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then you will see how the process 
itself unfolded and how we get to the point of the contracts.  Because 
10 
in the – in the establishment you need people who are going to 
facilitate procurement and we are going to show you how people were 
removed and who was replaced and how that process unfolded right up 
to the stage then when contracts were entered into, when policies were 
changed. So that is the process that you are following.  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  As long as in the end there will be that link. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  There will – the… 
CHAIRPERSON:  There will be? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But I would like if I could be given a memorandum 
20 
that in due course that will show that in the end this is how the 
witnesses will link up. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes I think… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Their evidence will link up. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Yes Chair no I think there is a 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 15 of 173 
 
memorandum that I had submitted to you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But I can update that memorandum. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you can update that – that memorandum. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes ja but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  But as we – as we proceed I mean I will take it that 
that is what you – that is what you are planning to do to end up linking; 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With – with what others witnesses will say. 
MS YOLANDE VAN BILJON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But that the point is always that you are 
looking at how certain wrong things were done in order to influence the 
awarding of contracts and business to certain individuals or companies 
and so on. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that understanding fine? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It will lead – Chair I would not be leading 
this evidence if it did not tie up with that.   
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is an assurance that I can give you. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no I must – I must be satisfied. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I know Chair but… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I must be satisfied. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You satisfy yourself but I must also be satisfied. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 16 of 173 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Yes.  No true, true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But also Chair in the rules you have made 
it our obligation as the legal team. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The responsibility to place evidence 
before you and I would not place any evidence that I regarded as 
irrelevant to the terms of reference.  And the evidence that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no, no. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  No Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no Ms Norman.  You must satisfy yourself that … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That the evidence is relevant. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But the fact that you have satisfied yourself does not 
mean that I am satisfied. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Chair has not heard the evidence 
that is the difference. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but before it is led I must satisfy myself that it 
will be relevant. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair I had placed…. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because I should not allow evidence that is not 
relevant. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 17 of 173 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No true I accept that Chair but I had 
placed this evidence before Chair last week Wednesday and as I have 
explained to Chair this evidence is relevant because it shows that the 
enablers of state capture had decided to remove skilled people… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman.  I must be satisfied that the evidence 
that is being led is relevant. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And falls within the terms of reference. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I must make a ruling whether it should led or it should 
not be led. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are assisting me to do this job. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you are doing quite well but I still need to be 
satisfied.  So that is why it is important if I have questions that you 
make submissions to say we have submit it is relevant because of a, b, 
c, d. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I listen to what you have to say if I am persuaded 
I agree if I am not persuaded I do not agree. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chair I… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 18 of 173 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  No I hear you Chair I have made 
submissions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That this evidence is relevant because it 
is going to tie in with other evidence that is going to show ultimately 
how the contracts were handled. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No, no in principle that should be fine.  So do give me 
that memorandum that you say you will update but as we go along with 
every witness. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  We must just keep in mind that we are within the 
terms of reference. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I accept that sometimes it may be difficult to 
show with the relevance with regard to a particular witness because the 
relevance might become clearer when another witness comes later on. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To give – that I accept. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That it might happen.  So – and to that extent you 
20 
might be aware of some witnesses who are going to come. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who might clarify certain things but it is important 
that throughout we keep at the back of our minds that we want to fall 
within the terms of reference. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156

ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Mr Thekiso you - is it correct 
that you are employed by the SABC? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In what position are you employed? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  I am the Group Executive of Human 
Resources. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Okay.  What do you deal with within 
Human Resources? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  My role is to provide strategic direction and 
leadership by aligning the HR strategy to the corporate plan of the 
10 
SABC to ensure that the organisation can deliver on the mandate.  
Secondly 
my 
role 
entails 
sustaining 
an 
environment 
that 
is 
characterised by healthy, competent staff members in order to ensure 
that the SABC becomes an employer of choice but quite critically we 
work very closely with line management to make sure that they can 
deliver on the objectives with a view to the SABC achieving the 
mandate. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and I would imagine that before 
you do that you yourself you must be able to say I am qualified enough 
to be able to tackle this job? 
20 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  I believe so Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could you just place your 
qualifications before the Chairperson please? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Chairman I matriculated at Moletsane High 
School in Soweto. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 22 of 173 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that he starts … 
(Laughing) 
CHAIRPERSON:  He - he starts the way I would start. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Would start, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  In 1992.  I have a Bachelor of Social 
Sciences Degree from the University of Cape Town.  I have a Post 
Graduate Diploma in Management the HR stream from Wits University.  
I have an Advanced Executive Program from Unisa School of Business 
Leadership.  I also have a Leadership Development Program which was 
10 
co facilitated by the University of Cape Town and Wits University. 
I also have an Executive Financial Management Program from 
Wits University. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Before you joined the 
SABC where were you employed? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  I was employed in both the private and 
public sectors City of Johannesburg.  I have worked for Telkom 
Directories.  I have also worked for Deloitte.  I have worked for 
Vodacom and at Vodacom I had an opportunity to take assignments and 
I worked in Ghana as well as an assignment in the UK … 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  And in all instances it was an HR 
environment. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you very much.  So then you 
have just told us what your obligations are as - as the Head of Human 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 23 of 173 
 
Resources.  You were asked by the investigators of - of the Commission 
to go through the contracts of the persons that had left the SABC and 
especially where there where agreements of separation between those 
people and the SABC … 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And - and you are just going to take the 
Chairperson through those to show how these people left but your 
assessment of all these contracts as you were asked by the 
investigators of the Commission what - what did - what was revealed by 
the contracts and the manner in which they were - they were entered 
10 
into?  Just roughly without now pinpointing to specific cases.  We are 
going to deal with that. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  What was revealed as we were going 
through the contracts was that people did not want to leave the 
organisation and they - in most instances - and there were agreements 
for them to leave the organisation on the basis that they were paid you 
know in lieu of their contracts.  For instance somebody might have had 
two more years to run in their contract. 
They were basically told to leave the organisation on the 
basis of payment amounting to the balance of the contract.  So our 
20 
assessment is that all in all people still wanted to work for the SABC 
people still wanted to contribute to the SABC but because of reasons 
we do not know they were essentially asked to leave the organisation 
on the basis of particular payments. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and then as an HR - I would regard 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 24 of 173 
 
you as an HR expert given the years that you - and the places that you 
have been dealing with this.  Ordinarily if a person - if there is a 
dispute between the employer and the employee I would imagine that 
would be resolved by a disciplinary hearing? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And you have come across instances 
where there would be a disciplinary hearing and before the SABC is 
vindicated on whether or not it is in the wrong - it was in the wrong or it 
was correct in what it was doing then there is a settlement parting 
ways.  Sometimes that follows even an order from the CCMA that that 
10 
would vindicate the SABC? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  That is quite correct and in - in some 
instances people would have gone through a disciplinary inquiry and 
the ruling of that inquiry would be that the person ought to be 
dismissed … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  But instead of the dismissal taking effect 
the organisation preferred to enter into a settlement agreement and - 
and the person basically leaves the organisation as if they had 
resigned and in addition to that they - you know - they get paid a 
20 
settlement figure - amount. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and you make - you say you do not 
find conclusively that there was purging but you say the indications 
were there.  What is your understanding of purging employees? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  My understanding of purging employees is - 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 25 of 173 
 
is to basically get them out of the way - you know - for reasons they 
may not be aware of or for reasons that are known only by the - by the 
employer of by the person who is actually getting rid of those - that 
particular employee. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and I would like to just take you and 
… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh sorry Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is purging not where the employer or somebody in a 
higher position wants you out of the company or department for an 
10 
illegitimate reason?  In other words is the position not that there has to 
be an illegitimate reason.  If I - if I say you know I think your health is 
no longer - your health does not allow you to give us 100 percent in 
terms of what you are capable of doing and I would rather let you go 
and let me get somebody who can still give us 100 percent. 
That would not be purging in the sense in which it is normally 
understood.  Is it no? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Correct Chair but if the justification for 
wanting to get rid of somebody is the fact that there is a problem with 
your health of course there are mechanisms within the organisation 
20 
through which we can take the person to ascertain the validity of that 
assertion surrounding the health of the individual but if there is nothing 
wrong with the individual and they get told that there is a problem with 
your health and as a result of a problem with your health - health we 
think that you might serve a better purpose at home. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 26 of 173 
 
If that is the case then that amounts to purging because in a 
sense you have not advanced justifiable reasons as to why this 
individual has to get out of the way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You - you see the way I see purging and I want you to 
tell me how you see it is that there has to be an illegitimate reason and 
maybe illegitimate is too wide.  An illegitimate motive maybe because if 
I am just wrong in understanding what procedure must follow but I am 
acting in good faith.  I have got nothing against you.  I am just wrong in 
understanding what is required. 
I might have difficulty understanding that to be purging but if 
10 
I think you are a troublemaker because you keep on asking too many 
questions on things where I think you should not be asking too many 
questions.  You must just let - allow things to happen and those are 
wrong things that I want to happen and I think you - I think you think 
you are clever. 
That - that is separate.  If you are a trade unionist and you 
are always giving me problems because you insist on the rights of 
workers being respected and all of that and that is the reason why I 
want you out.  I think that would be purging.  It is an illegitimate 
reason.  If I think you belong to a wrong political person wrong 
20 
according to me and I only want in that position somebody who belongs 
to a certain political party. 
That is for me on the face of it purging - you know.  If I - if 
you are standing in my way because I want that tender to go to - to be 
given to so and so and you are insisting that it will only be given to 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 27 of 173 
 
whoever legitimately wins the bid - the bid.  That is purging for me.  
You understand? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But if I think that in your position I think the 
performance you give me the best you can give me is about 60 percent 
but I think I want somebody who can give me 80 percent and I - I 
discuss that openly.  It does not appear to me that it might be purging.  
I just want somebody who can do better than you are doing.  You 
understand? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Yes.  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are you more or less agreement with these examples 
that I am - I am giving?  If - if not just indicate where you have a 
different understanding and share with me your perspective. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Thank you Chair.  I am - I am in total 
agreement with - with the examples the Chair is giving but I also want 
to highlight and - and impress the fact that in most instances in as far 
the - you know - the - the employees we are dealing with are 
concerned.  Their departure from the organisation was for mostly 
illegitimate reasons and therefore amount to - to purging. 
CHAIRPERSON:  No.  Then that is - then I am very interested in that.  
20 
You know but if - if the reasons are not illegitimate I might not be 
interested but where the point is the reasons were illegitimate then - 
then I am quite interested.  Yes, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you.  May - may I take 
you to page 5 of - of EXHIBIT 17.1?  I beg your pardon to page 38.  I 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 28 of 173 
 
beg your pardon. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Page 38? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, 38. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Got it Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  This is one of the - a person 
who was once employed by - by the SABC Mr Feliti. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Did you say page 5? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 38.  I beg your pardon Chair.  I 
10 
initially said five.  I made - it is page 38. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Could you just read that letter 
into the record so that we can deal with the matters that the 
Chairperson has raised with you? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  “Contract of Employment between 
the SABC and Dingaan Feliti.” 
That is the subject. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Number one: 
20 
“The above matter as reference.” 
Number two: 
“As you are aware you are employed by the SABC 
on a fixed term contract basis and your fixed term 
contract of employment with the SABC will expire by 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 29 of 173 
 
a - a fluxion of time on 31 August 2018.” 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry.  Before you move.  The letter is 
dated? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  The letter is dated 19 April 2016.  Sorry 
Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So this was almost a period of two years 
before the expiry of that contract? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Correct Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Please continue. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Number three: 
10 
“You are hereby advised that the SABC will not be 
renewing or extending your contract - your fixed 
term contract of employment upon termination 
thereof on 31 August 2018.” 
Which is expiry date.  Number four: 
“Please note that the SABC has in its terms of its 
own prerogative decided to waive its right to the 
provision of services and/or rendition of work by 
you for the remainder of your contract period.  
Accordingly with effect from Friday 22 April 2016 
20 
you are not required to report for duty and/or 
provide services to the SABC and the SABC will be 
under no obligation to and will therefore not provide 
or assign any work or services to you.” 
Number five: 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 30 of 173 
 
“The SABC will in relation to the remainder of your 
contract period pay you the remuneration as 
provided 
for 
in 
your 
fixed 
term 
contract 
of 
employment payable as a once off lump sum.  This 
includes payment in lieu of accrued annual leave, if 
any.  All payments will be subject to the tax laws of 
the Republic of South Africa.” 
Number six: 
“The SABC will deduct and/or set off the amount 
due to you, the value of any outstanding loans 
10 
and/or debts that are repayable and/or due to the 
SABC.” 
Seven: 
“You will be required to handover all SABC property 
and assets back to the SABC on or before 
22 April 2016 at 15:00 to the Human Resources 
Manager Group Services.  This includes your 
access card, laptop computer and 3G card as well 
as your forwarding address and medical card or 
cards.” 
20 
Number eight: 
“Due to the SABC having opted to discharge its full 
payment obligations to you upfront you will with 
effect from 1 May 2016 be responsible for your own 
pension fund and medical aid arrangements.” 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 31 of 173 
 
Number nine: 
“Please 
note 
that 
the 
provisions 
relating 
to 
confidentiality in terms of your fixed term contract 
of employment are and remain applicable.  We 
request that you comply therefore which includes 
keeping this letter and the terms contained herein 
confidential.” 
Number 10: 
“We would like to take this opportunity to wish you 
everything of the best in your future endeavours.” 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So then this person was given from - the 
letter is written the 19 t h and the person was given about three days to 
leave the organisation? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ms Norman I am sorry.  Is there a particular reason 
why you do not mention the name of the person? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I beg your pardon.  No, no reason Chair.  
Mr Feliti.  I beg your pardon.  It is Mr Dingaan Feliti.  I did mention it 
initially yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I did not hear. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So Mr Feliti then was given three days 
from the 19 t h to 22 April 2016? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And there are - there is no reason except 
to say that the SABC itself has decided not to continue with the 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 32 of 173 
 
employment? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Would you regard this - what is contained 
in paragraph 4 would say this was a legitimate or illegitimate reason 
advanced to any employee for terminating employment? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  I would say it is illegitimate. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and it was - one would say it was … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well Ms Norman.  No reason is - is provided in 
paragraph 4 or anywhere in the letter.  Is it not? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No Chair.  No reason except to say I am 
10 
using my own prerogative.  Yes.  So that is basically … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  There is no reason. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A decision was taken by the SABC that it could do 
without Mr - I assume it is Mr Feliti … 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Feliti. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And that it would pay him in full for the remainder of 
his contract which was more than two years. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does - the letter does not say whether the SABC no 
20 
longer needs anybody to do the job that Mr Feliti was doing. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  It does not Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does not say and - and one would have understood 
if the position was that there is no longer any work for him to - to do.  
You know.  Lawyers might argue about whether or not in that event he 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 33 of 173 
 
should be given the whole amount for the rest of the period but at least 
one could say that is the reason … 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But this letter does not say anything like that.  That is 
your understanding as well? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  That - that is my - that is my understanding 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  At the time of this letter were you in this position 
at SABC and therefore would you have known about the circumstances 
surrounding this term - this letter?  I - I ask that question because 
10 
sometimes Human Resources would be consulted when people - 
people’s contracts are being terminated. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  No Chair.  At the time of the termination of 
Mr Dingaan Feliti I was not within the SABC.  This happened in 2016 
and I joined the SABC in 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay.  Alright, but being in the Human Resources 
Department have you had a chance to look at the personnel file relating 
to Mr Feliti if it is still being kept and see whether there is anything 
that gives a good - would give us an understanding as to why the SABC 
took this decision. 
20 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  No, no Chair.  The - the only time I came 
into contact with this documentation was when we were preparing the 
documents … 
CHAIRPERSON:  For the Commission? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  That is correct Chair. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 34 of 173 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  So your knowledge is confined to what is in 
the letter … 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  That is correct. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In terms of the circumstances? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  That is quite correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair and then - then after you 
dealt with each and every employee that left during that period and 
where they were set - oh sorry.  Maybe - let us finish Mr Feliti and you 
will see that at page 49 Chair if I may - not 49.  If I may just direct you 
10 
to see page 42.  That - that payment is payment that relates to 
Mr Feliti.  Am I right? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  That is - that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Does it relate to Mr Feliti? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  The first - if - if Chair has a look at 
page 41 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair will see that - that is the SARS 
income tax schedule … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then the next page - although the 
name is not written but it continues as the second page but - but we 
can - we can easily verify that by looking at the - the table that you 
prepared in your supplementary statement.  Then we can just verify the 
amount.  So if you could just quickly - just for the purposes of 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 35 of 173 
 
answering that question if you could just quickly just turn to your 
supplementary statement - which is in the next file next to - if you could 
just turn to page 336 of that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say 3-6-6? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Yes that is correct Chair.  3-3-6 
Chair.  Double three - 3-3-6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Double three six? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Double three six Chair, yes.  You will find 
that payment … 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In the one, two, three, four, five, six, 
seven - in the eighth column Chair at 3-3-6.  The name of Mr Feliti 
appears there and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  General Manager Human Resources 
appears.  The date 22 April and the amount paid to him appears there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you want to read that amount Ms …? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could you read that?  How - how 
20 
much was that? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  The amount that was paid to Mr Feliti is 
R4 697 000 - sorry - 4 697 059,96. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 36 of 173 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you and then maybe we take 
another case … 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that - that would have been somebody who earned 
more than a million Rand a year because we know that it is supposed to 
represent over two years? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  That is - that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you and then maybe you could 
take another example which you could just go to page 247 Chair of 
10 
Bundle/EXHIBIT CC - sorry - 17.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  At page 2-4-7. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In - in respect of people such as Mr Feliti it will be 
important in due course to have evidence that relates to whether 
somebody else was subsequently employed to … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Replace him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do the same work that he would have been doing for 
the remainder of that period. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And - and obviously also what they were paid … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Compared to what Mr Feliti was paid. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Was paid, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So that - that becomes quite important … 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 37 of 173 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because if somebody else was appointed to do that 
job then it means that for the remainder of the period when Mr Feliti 
supposed to have been there effectively the institution was paying two 
people for the same job. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A job that should be done by one person. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  One person.  Yes, thank you Chair.  Thank 
you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Then the next person 
who also parted ways with the - with the SABC that appears at page 
247 but what you have in - in relation to this person - his name is 
Christian Olivier - is a mutual separation agreement but for the 
purposes of your evidence what you wish to highlight to the 
Chairperson is the amount and the period for which he was paid.  Am I 
correct? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Yes, yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and that would appear at page 249. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well do you not want to tell us first tell who we are 
20 
talking about? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  I did Chair.  I said Mr Olivier. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh.  Why do I always not hear you when you mention 
names? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Or maybe I speak to fast.  It is 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 38 of 173 
 
Mr Christian Olivier Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it Mr C Oliver? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Olivier? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Olivier, yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  There is a separation agreement that 
appears from pages 250 … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And that agreement was not signed by 
10 
Mr Olivier as you can see but it was signed by the SABC.  At - if you 
look at - maybe at page 254 the copy that you furnished to the 
Commission is not signed by Mr Olivier. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Okay sorry I am at 248, should I be moving to 
…[intervenes]. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Chair could you please move to page 
250, we’ll go back to 248 I just want to identify the agreement first. 
Okay at 250 this is called a mutual separation agreement, are you with 
me?     
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    Yes, yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     You must please – please don’t nod just 
say yes. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:   Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Thank you and if you look at page 254 
of that, you will see that there is no signature appearing on behalf of 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 39 of 173 
 
Mr Christian Olivier. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:    Okay and did you extract this information 
from your human resources files? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    That’s correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Were you able to find any other one that 
he had signed? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    No not…[intervenes]. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Only what you had furnished to the 
Commission? 
10 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     And then if you turn over the page at 
page 255 you will see that there is a signature there on behalf of the 
SABC and that’s dated 25 October 2016. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    That’s correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes but there is also another document 
which I would like you to just identify where Mr Olivier has signed and 
said something, that’s Chair appears at page 247. 
CHAIRPERSON:    And the note I at page 248? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes Chair, and then at 247, Chair maybe 
20 
just – so as to state the reason because the Chair had questions about 
the reasons, if you go to page 247 could you just read out what the 
reasons are that are advanced for separating from this employment 
agreement? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    Okay the letter is dated the 25 t h October 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 40 of 173 
 
2016 addressed to Mr C Olivier who was a General Manager Finance 
and Operations for the SABC and the subject is, SABC/Mr Olivier, 
separation, 
 
“The above matter and the meetings held on 24 t h and 25 t h 
 
October 2016 have reference.  During the abovementioned 
 
meetings management made it very clear that there was a 
 
breakdown in the relationship between the SABC and yourself 
 
and that the SABC contemplated severing the relationship 
 
going forward.  You were also informed that management 
 
would prepare a separation agreement and would you provide 
10 
 
you with a breakdown of the amount being offered.  Attached 
 
are the following documents, 1) separation agreement and 2) 
 
document reflecting on the breakdown of the separation 
 
amount offered.  Please be informed that your last day in 
 
service of the SABC will be the 31 s t of October 2016. You will 
 
also not be required to render any further services within 
 
immediate effect.  Furthermore, it should be noted that the 
 
SABC will effect payment of the said separation amount into 
 
your banking account within 7 days from having received the 
 
relevant tax directive.  The SABC herewith wants to thank you 
20 
 
for your contributions made during your tenure with the SABC 
 
and we wish you everything of the best for the future”, 
 
And this was signed by Mosholi Phaga who was the Group 
Executive Human Resources acting at the time and then it goes on, 
 
“Christian Olivier hereby acknowledge receipt of the letter 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 41 of 173 
 
 
and have noted the content thereof and he signed it and 
 
there’s also notes that say I do not agree with this and reserve 
 
my rights”, 
 
And the letter is dated the 25 t h or is signed on the 25 t h October 
2016. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Miss Norman? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    It won’t every letter that he would need to read in 
full he could just give the gist such as this one to say, according to the 
SABC the reason was a breakdown of trust of the relationship and this 
10 
the amount they gave or something like that depending on what really 
is important. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     No, thank you Chair we’ll do that, thank   
you.  And then at page 249 you drew our attention to the period for 
which Mr Olivier was paid and there’s various columns could you just 
talk to those columns that are there and the period for which he was 
paid? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    Okay column one shows the current 
annual TGRP and TGRP stands for total guaranteed remuneration 
package.  The grand total there is R2 172 127.34 so that was the 
20 
annual amount.  The current monthly TGRP is R181 010.61 and the 
next column shows…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
 
 
 
I’m 
sorry 
you 
said 
TGRP 
stands 
for 
total…[intervenes]. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    Total guaranteed remuneration package. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 42 of 173 
 
CHAIRPERSON:     Oh okay and does that amount to your annual 
salary? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    That amounts to…[intervenes] 
CHAIRPERSON:     Normally it does Chair it’s the total cost of 
employment, sometimes I call it total cost of employment. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Ja okay. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    The next column shows 24 months and the 
total amount there is R4 344 254.68.  The next column is 36 months 
shows 36 months in other words the remuneration for 36 months would 
have been R6 516 382.02 and for 48 month the total amount is R651 
10 
638 2000.02 sorry let me take that again, R6 516 382.02, the second 
last column shows 60 months which is R10 860 636.70 and the last 
column shows the remainder of contract which is 62 months the total 
there is R11475 852.39. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     So would that mean that remaining 
period, that’s a period of about five5 years, am I right? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    The remaining period is a period of five 
years.   Let me explain, where this comes from. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    The employee at the time of the 
20 
settlement was 54 years and 10 months old, so they were left with two 
months before they could reach 55 years and at the SABC you qualify 
for early retirement from 55 years and so this total amount is based on 
62 months which is a contract period of five years, so he was 
effectively paid for five years plus two months which is 62 months. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 43 of 173 
 
CHAIRPERSON:     How long was his contract – he was on a fixed-term 
contract? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    He was on a permanent employee at the 
time of the settlement. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Not a fixed-term contract? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    Not a fixed-term contract Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay and you say he was two months away from 
qualifying for retirement, early retirement? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    He was two months away from qualifying 
for early retirement so he would have been 54 years of age plus ten 
10 
months, so he was left with two months before reaching age 55. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    So then, in terms of retirement, ultimate 
retirement he would have been – he would have reached retirement age 
at age 60 because the…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:     The compulsory retirement age is 60. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    So executives for the SABC can – must 
retire at age 60 the rest of the employees retire at age 63.  So instead 
20 
of the organisation waiting for Mr Olivier to serve out the five year term 
leading up to his ultimate retirement at age 60, the organisation 
decided to let him go at age 54 and ten months and then paid him the 
balance of the contract which was 62 months.  Sorry the balance of the 
contract which had been 62 months. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 44 of 173 
 
CHAIRPERSON:     Well I think that is what confused me earlier on, it’s 
not the balance of the contract because you are not a fixed-term 
contact employee, he was just on an indefinite employment contract. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     But once he reached age 60 he would have been 
obliged to retire. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     So basically what they decided is, we will pay 
whatever you would have earned between now and age 60 so that you 
can go. 
10 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    That’s correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes okay. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    Thank you Chair, I’m advised that it’s time 
for the short adjournment. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes maybe before we do that, is the position that 
you don’t know the circumstances surrounding the break-down of the 
relationship? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    It is the position Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     It is the position? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:    Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:     Because Miss Norman this will be important, it 
could be a waste of tax payer’s money but that might have nothing to 
do with our terms of reference but it could be that it is linked so it will 
be important to see whether we are able to tie it to our terms of 
reference. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 45 of 173 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:     And there is an interest in future because I think 
ordinarily if there’s a breakdown of an employment relationship you are 
not obliged, I think, to pay for the whole period that the employer would 
have paid you, you are simply obliged to pay – to give them notice.  
Maybe you might or you might not, depending on a number of things to 
pay what may be called severance pay but it might be that you’re not 
even supposed to pay severance pay because it’s not a retrenchment, 
you know so therefore one might look at it from the point of view of 
what is it that the SABC was obliged to pay and what did it pay and how 
10 
much is that difference and what reasons are really given, what was the 
motive for paying so much money when there was just a breakdown  in 
the relationship. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes Chair thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Okay alright we’ll take the tea adjournment and we 
will resume at twenty five to twelve. We adjourn. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Thank you Chair. 
REGISTRAR:    All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  We may proceed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Mr Chairman.  Thank you.  
The other example that you would like to bring to the attention of the 
Chair Mr Thekiso is that – that the one that relates to Mr Masinga am I 
correct?  It is the next one we would like to deal with and that you will 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 46 of 173 
 
find… 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Mr Chairman you will find that at page 
122. 
CHAIRPERSON:  122? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  122 Mr Chairman Yes.  At least I did hear 
you mention the name this time. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Mr S M Masinga. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Masinga.  That is correct Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  The reason given for the termination 
roughly is that Mr Masinga had engaged in other business interests and 
therefore a conflict – sorry are you lost?  Have you found it? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  No I am fine, I am fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh you seem to be looking for something 
sorry.  Are you at page 122 Mr Thekiso? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  I am. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Thank you Chair. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  What I am saying is to summarise the 
reason – could you just summarise the reason without reading it into 
the record.  The reason for the termination of the fixed term executive 
service agreement? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Thank you Chair.  The reasons for 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 47 of 173 
 
termination of the contract of employment by SABC on Mr Masinga was 
that he was allegedly guilty of a number of misconducts.  But before the 
matter could be ventilated in a proper disciplinary enquiry the 
organisation decided to terminate the fixed term contract and entered 
into a settlement agreement with him. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And if you look at page 133.  I beg 
your pardon, no, no, no I am sorry I turned to the wrong page.  I wanted 
to look at page 130. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  130. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  This is where the agreement is signed by 
10 
both parties.   
CHAIRPERSON:  What was his position please?  Mr Masinga. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Mr Masinga he was I will give you now 
Chair.  It is – it will be in the list.  I will give you now.  I beg your 
pardon Chair.  He was the Group Executive Technology. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh okay.  Did you say we must go to page 133? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair.  I wanted to just for the witness 
to identify – no not to identify the signatures but to see that this was 
signed on the 21 s t April 2016.  Are you there Mr Thekiso? 
CHAIRPERSON:  But are you on another bundle because on this one 
20 
133 is the second page of a letter addressed to Mr Matlala not Mr 
Masinga. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No Chair.  Page 130. 
CHAIRPERSON:  130? 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 48 of 173 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  130 yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I thought two times you said – you agreed 
when I said 133. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I beg your pardon Chair no I am sure I did 
not pay attention to the pages. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay 130. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes or page 130. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So that is 21 April 2016.  Are you 
there? 
10 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  I am there Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  And then according to the 
schedule that you have prepared which should appear at page – in the 
next bundle CC – Exhibit 27.2.  It shows that this was – this 
relationship terminated on 21 April 2016 and that an amount of money 
was paid to him just over R4 million paid to him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page is the amount reflected? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The amount is reflected Chair – if Chair 
goes to the bundle X CC17.2 at page 337.  And if Chair could count just 
8… 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh I can see Masinga S M. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  8 lines – that is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja he was paid R4 539 745.99 – R4.5 effective R4.5 
million. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  R4.5 million yes thank you. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 49 of 173 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  The one amount that you 
did not mention which was a huge – that huge amount or is that one 
of… 
Yes thank you.  The one amount that you did not mention which was a 
huge – that huge amount or is that one of… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was he on a fixed term contract? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Yes he was Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And how much time was left, do we know? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Let me check. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  You see all of those things. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are relevant to give… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Context. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The idea is to say there was something illegitimate 
about this. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Are you looking for information? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright okay.  You just indicate what – 
what you looking for? 
20 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Sorry I am looking – I am trying to find the 
– an indication as to the contract term. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes it will be – just a minute. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Although… 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 50 of 173 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well the – how much time was left in his fixed term 
contract if his contract of employment was a fixed term.  Oh I think the 
heading at page 122 indicates. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It appears – may I take Chair to page 
128? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Aha. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  128 shows that his term of – it says 
Masinga’s fixed term contract with the SABC which became effective 
from 15 May 2015 and was to continue until 31 May 2018. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is hereby terminated with immediate 
effect. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay I can see that is 3.6. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is 3.5 Chair. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  That is correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this was – the termination was the letter of 
terminated was dated 24 June 2015? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The letter of termination… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja at page 122. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes that is correct 122 yes Chair. Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So – so he worked one month? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No Chair it is years.  It is from – this is… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja it says 3.6 at 128. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 51 of 173 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Says:  Masinga’s fixed term contract with the SABC 
which became effective from 15 May 2015. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was to continue until 31 May 2018. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  May 2018. 
CHAIRPERSON:  [Indistinct] terminated with effect from the effective 
date of this agreement. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That means he worked … 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Worked for one month. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For one month one week or something like that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then his contract was terminated. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then he was paid for the full term it 
appears looking at the amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja that may be so but do we have something that 
does say whether he was paid that amount represented the balance of 
his contract? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We do have the schedule Chair which has 
20 
been prepared. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In relation to the documents that Human 
Resources have. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Correct. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 52 of 173 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  If I – that amount Chair which you read 
earlier the R4.5 million. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  That is correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But then Chair if you look at the 
settlement agreement itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It gives a different amount.  It may very 
well be that there is a reason but it almost doubles that amount. 
10 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  If Chair – if I may direct you Chair to page 
127?   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Mr Thekiso would you read 
paragraph 2.2.7 of the settlement amount?  How much – what did they 
say was going to be the payment there? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Okay thanks Chair.  
“2.2.7 Settlement amount means the net total sum of 
20 
R2 678 409.80  which is R2 678 419.80 free of any 
deductions, statutory or otherwise payable by the 
SABC to Masinga in full and final settlement of all 
the legal proceedings and attendant disputes.” 
CHAIRPERSON:  That suggests that that amount of R2.6 million may 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 53 of 173 
 
not necessarily be just the remuneration he would have paid for the 
balance of the term. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It may be that it is meant to settle whatever disputes 
there were between the parties. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Between the members yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because of what it says there.  But that is different 
from the R4.5 million or so that appears in the other bundle and I do 
not know whether even if you deduct tax. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  No. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  It would come to that amount.  It seems … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In fact it is almost double. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is almost double that amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair.  But Chair the witness is going 
to come back with the matters that the Chair had raised.  The witness 
is going to come back and do a proper table of the matters that you 
have raised. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  About the incumbency and all that.  Then 
that way we do not have to waste time going through each and every 
contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Ja. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 54 of 173 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes I think it will – it will facilitate that 
situation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but part – well with all the terminations that we 
are talking about it will be important as I said earlier to show that there 
is an illegitimate reason.  The one that we started with on the face of it. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Hm. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It does appear illegitimate but we might need to get – 
might be necessary to get more information. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON: 
 As 
to 
why 
was 
the 
contract 
terminated 
in 
circumstances where the person was still available to continue. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And was there no need for the duties that he would 
have performed to be performed by anybody or did somebody be – was 
somebody brought in. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And what is more important about that one is that 
there is not even an allegation of any problems in the relationship. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Between that one and the – the employer.  The other 
– the other two that we have dealt with the one there is an allegation of 
a break-down in the relationship. And if indeed that was factually 
correct that might give problems to showing that the money was paid 
illegitimately but the fact that the person had only worked for one 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 55 of 173 
 
month and a few days makes that termination quite questionable. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You know whether somebody working a month is 
enough for you to conclude that there is a break-down in the 
relationship so one needs to see whether there is another reason – 
there is a different reason. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The other one I think was – oh this one I think the two 
– the last two related to trust issues. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Break-down of the relationship both of them I think. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So they might – they might be more difficult than the 
first one to establish an illegitimate reason but it always depends 
whether there are facts which support… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is being alleged but again whatever we are 
doing we have got to leave room for a situation where a termination is 
wrong. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  And maybe has no basis – has no proper basis but 
somebody wrongly thought there was a proper basis and it is not 
necessarily an illegitimate reason. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  True.  Yes true Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 56 of 173 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  And then with the 
exercise of – that you have done in respect of each and every one of 
these terminations which we – you have extracted as those that you 
believe they talk to this whole project of state capture.  But as Chair 
said then the analysis you going to have to do. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Another table and you have to come back 
with that analysis.  But just for conclusion these amounts of all these 
pay-outs during that period of 20 – largely between 2016 most of them, 
2014, 2016 that grand total of what was paid you reflected in Exhibit 
10 
17.2 at page 338. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Correct Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And that amount comes to how much? 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  The amount is R102 403 331.97. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that the amount – total amount paid to various 
employees whose contracts were terminated in certain circumstances 
during a certain period 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  That is correct Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Including the ones we have talked about? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  That is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And in each instance you have got the 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 57 of 173 
 
name of the employee, you have got the title of the employee and then 
you have the amounts paid to them.  But maybe just – what is important 
to – you have also titled them.  You have got the group – there is 
largely most group executives. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  You have got group executive technology.  
You have group executive Chief Executive Office.  You have group 
executive news.  You have got group employee relations consultant. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So most of – you know you have got all of 
10 
those people who were holding those senior group executive radio. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Correct. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So then when you come back then 
you are going to deal – continue with these so as not to waste time do 
the exercise that the Chair has asked you to do in respect of each and 
every one. 
MR JONATHAN THEKISO:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   And the replacement of the people that

and Swaziland now known as University of Swaziland and I matriculated 
in Orlando High in 1974.  My apologies it is so long ago. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you did not have to say it. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 60 of 173 
 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes thank you.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And before oh sorry then on the 16 t h 
February 2012 you joined the SABC, is that correct? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In what capacity were you employed? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I joined as the Group CEO of the SABC> 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes when you joined the SABC where – 
before you joined it where did you work? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Prior to that I had worked as the Group 
Executive for Public Broadcasting Services and that was from 2005 to 
10 
2010. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Still at the SABC? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Still at the SABC. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. Could you then tell the Chair what 
your responsibilities were as a Group Executive office of the SABC? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  My responsibilities were to lead the 
executive team and therefore the entire organisation in delivering on 
the strategic imperatives of the SABC in the implementation of all 
policies that had been approved by the board and in some instances 
coming up with new policies and developing new strategies in order to 
20 
meet the requirements for the SABC for DTT and other activities.  And I 
was also a member of the board – an executive member of the board 
and by virtue of sitting as an executive member of the board one could 
also say I was involved in the development of policies, strategic 
direction and to some degree oversight of the organisation. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 61 of 173 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Ms Mokhobo you deal with this in 
paragraph 7 of your state – I beg your pardon you have not identified 
your statement.  I beg your pardon.  Sorry.  Could you please look at 
the file that is in front of you that is under folder number 21 – that 
divider number 21?  Is that your statement? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes it is. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  If you turn to the last page where – that 
would be at page 9.  Is that your signature? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes it is. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Did you make this statement freely 
10 
and voluntarily? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes I did. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Thank you just to move 
then to what you have stated.  The reasons for the commission’s 
investigators to approach you, you articulate those reasons at 
paragraph 7 of your statement? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Because they had a particular – a specific 
request that – could you just tell the Chair why – what you were asked 
to deal with?  Yes. 
20 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  When I arrived at the SABC the TNA 
breakfasts … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry could you just – what you say in 
paragraph 7 just tell the Chair what is it that you were called to deal 
with by the – by the investigators. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 62 of 173 
 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Oh.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Okay.  I was requested to deal with the 
matters around TNA Media which was the television broadcast arm of 
TNA and the New Age newspaper which was one of the products of 
TNA. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Is it – it is correct that you were involved 
in the signing of the contract between the SABC and the – TNA Media? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes I was. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry what was your answer? 
10 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes I was. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes you were.  Oh before you deal with 
the contracts could you just tell the Chairperson how did it come about 
that SABC wanted to do business with TNA Media? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I am not very clear of the circumstances 
under which TNA started broadcasting jointly – well – it started working 
with the SABC because that happened long before I started at the 
SABC.  However a matter of concern when I arrived there was that they 
were operating without a contract and the dangers of doing that or 
quite obvious that there could suddenly be requirements of the SABC 
20 
that it could not meet and for the protection of the integrity of the 
organisation and the protection of the product that the organisation was 
broadcasting it was important for a contract to be entered into.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So then – so when – they were 
already – when you say they were already doing business with the 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 63 of 173 
 
SABC that means that they were already delivering newspaper with 
SABC? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  They were already delivering newspaper the 
live broadcasts were already happening. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And this was happening without any formal 
contract? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then you deal… 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry.  Do you remember for how long before you 
came they had been doing this or is that something that you cannot 
10 
remember? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Chair unfortunately I do not have the detail. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Okay. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  However I am aware that they had been 
running for – for quite a while. 
CHAIRPERSON:  For quite some time. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  This could be tested with the SABC itself. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  Then you – you – then 
you discover that look there was no contract and what are the steps 
20 
that you took in order to regularise that situation? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  At that point it turned out that the then acting 
head of news Mr Mike Seluma and his executive management team 
were also aware of this problem – I will call it a problem and they had 
written a request to the legal department to draft that contract.  So 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 64 of 173 
 
essentially this process was driven by the news department itself. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  And then thereafter then you had 
this contract which you deal with in paragraph 11 of your statement? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair that contract would be found at page 
– starting from page 10. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes I have got it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  May I direct your 
attention Chair to page 30 I am sorry there is two.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the signature page? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  That is the signature page.  Ms 
Mokhobo is that your signature at page 30? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And your names are reflected there? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  I would like you … 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry which – her signature is the one on behalf 
of SABC is that the one? 
20 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes it is. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh there is your name. Okay thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes Chair yes and this was signed on the 
13 t h March 2012? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes it was. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 65 of 173 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Could you just give the 
Chair briefly what did you understand as the – the material terms of the 
agreement – what is it that was expected of the SABC and what was 
expected of the TNA in terms of the agreement? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  In terms of the agreement the TNA was to 
provide and it did to provide the venues, invite the guests and provide 
all the requirements that the SABC would need in able to broadcast the 
show.  And all of these the TNA would do out of its own volition without 
any assistance from the SABC or any legal obligation to the SABC in 
terms of accessing the different people who appeared on the – for the 
10 
show.  And also the SABC had no responsibility whatsoever with the 
accessing, the creations sorry of the events themselves.   
 
The SABC’s role on the other hand was to broadcast the 
events. And the reason the SABC – for the SABC it was important to do 
that was the events were mainly aimed at government and with the 
SABC’s core value being that of public broadcasting and therefore 
adequately informing and educating the public about what was going on 
in the country in particular in relation to the principles of the country 
and how they ran the country.   
 
The SABC and myself in particular obviously saw this as an 
20 
opportunity to do what was right for the public.  And therefore initially 
they presented themselves as something that was for public good and 
therefore it made sense for the SABC to do it.  But secondly there was 
going to be no exchange of money.  The SABC was not going to pay the 
TNA anything whatsoever for the events and for the expenses that the 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 66 of 173 
 
TNA incurred if it did incur any expenses regarding the setup.  And also 
the TNA would be under no obligation to pay the SABC any money for 
the presence of the SABC.   
 
Now that may sound a little bit strange Chair however 
the reason is quite simple and straightforward.  In terms of the 
Broadcasting Charter and in particular the policies on news the SABC 
could not and was completely debarred from accepting any sponsorship 
for the news itself and the reason was quite simply that if it was 
receiving any monies then it would be difficult for it to remain objective. 
So if Party X provided the cash and the SABC received the 
10 
cash and the SABC needed to cover a story on Party X.  Then Party X 
could very easily say but I am paying you.  So - so it was to block all 
possibilities of corrupt activities happening within the SABC News. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  I would like us to go back.  When you arrived 
there was an arrangement that was already in existence for these 
breakfast shows.  There was no formal contract or agreement between 
the SABC and TNA or anybody about these.  A report must have been 
given to you even if it is verbal to say this is how this thing came 
about.  I would like to hear that. 
What were you told was the main motivation that was given to 
20 
SABC when they were approached to be involved in this thing and what 
- what was in it for those who approached the SABC.  What was in it for 
the SABC and it maybe that what was in it for the SABC was what you 
have said namely the news but I would like you to take me from there? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Chair what I was told was that the - the 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 67 of 173 
 
approach that the News Department had decided to adopt in 
“partnership” with TNA was to expose to the public what Government 
was doing for the public - for the country and to that extent the events 
seemed to be completely apolitical in the sense that just about all 
major political parties would go and - and say what they needed to say 
to the public through this channel and I am thinking of the major parties 
here. 
The DA for instance was - would be present on certain 
occasions and so would - a number of political parties would be 
involved.  So as I initially said Chair when I was informed of the critical 
10 
value that that programming was providing and the board itself - 
Members of the Board were participating very actively in the breakfast 
and that they would be invited and at the opening of each breakfast 
whoever was representing the SABC would go to the podium and say a 
word or two about the event and - and why it was being held. 
So there - there was very intense participation from the SABC 
right at the top level of oversight at the SABC and the political head of 
the SABC and other politicians.  So the - the reasons were sufficiently 
compelling for me to not say no this is wrong.  You cannot do it.  They - 
they were compelling enough to accept that indeed the - the 
20 
programming played a - a critical role. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was your understanding that the idea of these 
breakfast shows had originated from the News Department or had 
originated from TNA or from outside SABC? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  My understanding was that there was a 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 68 of 173 
 
mutual origination.  It is a very strange way to put (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  That would be very strange. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  But what I would suspect is … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  With TNA having been the service provider 
so to speak I am quite sure that they may have engaged the SABC in 
saying can you come on board and let us do this together. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Well maybe somebody else will enlighten … 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because it is likely that the idea came from one side 
10 
and the - approached the other side to say this is what we are thinking 
and then the other side was persuaded and then they - they dealt - 
dealt with it.  So as you understood it.  The purpose was to do what 
with these breakfast shows? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  The purpose was as - as they kind of 
sloganised it.  It was to - to bring Government to the people.  That is 
how it was sloganised and to the extent that the number of broadcasts 
increased and the trips to areas outside of Gauteng increased.  The 
argument was those trips and the set ups in the remote areas were 
important because those people also needed to know what Government 
20 
was doing. 
For instance there is a time towards the elections when I 
know that from the political parties’ perspective it was important for 
them as part of their rallying of the people it was important for them to 
go out and talk to the people and to that extent there were quite a 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 69 of 173 
 
number of regional broadcasts that were done which should be in for 
instance - I know there was one in - in Mmabatho in particular where 
the local politicians were - were present and they did the discussion 
and the question and answer sessions.  So that is really it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so the idea was to so to speak bring Government 
to the people … 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And Government would then tell the people what they 
are doing - what Government is doing I assume … 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I guess that to the extent that it would be 
possible for Government to also hear what people have to say about 
services - service delivery in the various areas.  That is one.  So that - 
that - is - is that correct? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  That is correct and in fact sir - Chair there 
were question and answer sessions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Where there would be an in - personnel from 
the News Department. 
CHAIRPERSON:  A moderator? 
20 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  A news anchor … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Who would be present in the breakfast … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  And facilitate a discussion between whoever 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 70 of 173 
 
the main speakers were and the - the audience that was present and 
they would also run SMS services. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  So the broader public out there that could 
not be in the room. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Could also ask their questions and the 
questions would be run … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Through. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and maybe you - you were still going to deal 
with this.  You have said the SABC was not going to be paid for 
anything and it was not going to pay for anything as you understood it 
… 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But TNA would make money out of it or not?  As you 
understood it. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  You know Chair what I understood was that 
TNA would find a way to organise the events.  As far as I was aware the 
relationship between TNA and - and the SABC on those aspects was 
20 
completely … 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was a distance? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Arm’s length. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  It was - it was very distant. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 71 of 173 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  The SABC had no right to find out how and 
when they were getting the money and how much it was and therefore 
in respecting that relationship in that manner I was never aware of the 
monies that TNA was receiving in the running of the - of the broadcast. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So - so the - the answer would be - would the answer 
be that you did not know whether they were going to make money or not 
make money.  You regarded it as SABC.  You regarded that as really 
none of your business.  Is that right? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes.  Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  In 
paragraph 11 where you have attached the agreement you also indicate 
who was negotiating on behalf of the SABC this contract? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and who was that person? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Mr Thaba Matebe (?). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And in which department was he? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  He was the Acting Head of the Legal 
Department. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and if I were to take you back again 
Ms Mokhobo to page 30 where your signature appears and maybe 
turnover to page 31.  I see there is -the full name of Mr Matebe - did he 
sign on that page? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes.  That is his signature. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 72 of 173 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you and also signed on that 
page and again at page 30 you signed and Mr Nazeem Howa signed? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Did you - before you entered into 
this agreement did you as a person personally at your personal level 
know Mr Nazeem Howa? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  No not - not really.  It sounds like a bit of a 
strange question.  We - we only got introduced when … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  This matter was being attended to. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and at this stage had you met any of 
the Gupta family members.  Do you - have you ever met them at any - 
at any point? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I had met - I think it was Atul Gupta … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Many, many years ago and that was long 
before I joined the SABC the first time early 2000s.  Possibly 2003.  I 
cannot remember but this was when the first meeting of BRICS … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Was coordinated in India and I got invited.  
20 
At the time President Thabo Mbeki was at the helm of this country and I 
was invited as a member of his delegation to attend the - the … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  BRICS? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  The inaugural - it was called - the inaugural 
meeting and that is how I - I met him and I must say that at that time 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 73 of 173 
 
there was no real I would say acknowledgement of each other.  It was 
just people from South Africa saying hello to each other … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  And that was it. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you and then after your 
appointment did you have occasion to meet him? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  After I was appointed it - it was something 
quite - quite strange.  I was - Hlaudi Motsoeneng who was Acting COO 
came to my office and said I - I have to take you somewhere very 
quickly and he would not tell me where it was.  It was all very hush, 
10 
hush and we arrived at this massive house and I saw on the wall 
Sahara Computers and he said well we are here because these people 
want to congratulate you. 
So I went in together with Hlaudi.  I do recall that my phone 
and everybody else’s phone was taken and the battery was removed 
and we led into a dining room where the people who were present 
proceeded to congratulate me (intervenes). 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And who were those people who 
congratulated you? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I seem to recall that there was - well I think 
20 
it was Ajay Gupta if I am not mistaken.  Atul Gupta I think he was there 
was well.  Duduzane Zuma and Mr Ace Magashule’s son.  I cannot 
remember his name and then there was Hlaudi and myself.  If there 
were other people I - I really cannot quite recall them because this was 
a while ago and we sat at the table. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 74 of 173 
 
There was a bit of food and they congratulated me and 
promptly told me that they would have liked to play a - a role in SABC’s 
DDT future because they were interested in creating a news channel 
and that they would hope that I would allow them or enable them to get 
access to a channel and at that point I said to them look I - I do not 
believe that it would be easy to just give anybody a channel. 
I am quite sure that there would have to be a proper tender 
process and a number of - it would be opened up and we expect that a 
number of people would apply also to be part of the DDT network of the 
SABC when it did come about and really there was nothing further to 
10 
discuss and they - they said congratulations and that was the end of it. 
I was not there long - you know.  We then promptly went back 
to the office. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Now - then what was your - when - 
when they were saying - what was your understanding of that 
conversation that you had with them?  That you would make it possible.  
What was your understanding?  What is it that they - they wanted from 
you? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I - I saw it as a - a lobbying of sorts for them 
to be afforded an opportunity on SABC platforms at that time and like I 
20 
said I did not go in prepared because I did not know what this was 
about … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  And as I said it was just to congratulate me. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Did you find that conversation in anyway 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 75 of 173 
 
improper or were you - you found that - I mean I am not going to do 
what they - they want.  I cannot do it until as you say the tender 
processes have been followed but how - how did you assess that 
conversation? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I - I found it a little bit strange that such a - 
a proposition could be put to me but then I - I excused them mentally 
instead of me as well you know this is another lobbying because there 
is always a lot of lobbying going around with people seeking business 
opportunities. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Then just on the reading of your 
10 
statement having been appointed on 16 February 2012 and this contract 
was signed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before you move … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I beg your pardon.  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To another point Ms Norman. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This - this sounds very strange to me.  Here is a - the 
Group CEO of SABC.  Somebody is saying to her please come I want to 
take you somewhere and does not want to tell her where.  How come 
you did not insist to Mr Motsoeneng I cannot just go anywhere just 
20 
because you - you think I should go there?  I am not going where I do 
not know. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  He was very persuasive Chair and besides 
with me being new and him being the Acting C - COO at some point -
Acting CEO and he - he was persuasive because I kept insisting where 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 76 of 173 
 
are we going.  He said no, you will see.  You will see.  Come let us just 
go and there was a car parked ready to take us there.  It was not his 
car.  I - I assumed it was a car belonging to - to the Guptas and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not his car that he normally used? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  No it was not Mr Motsoeneng’s car. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  It was I assumed a Gupta car with a 
chauffeur … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  And I then thought you know what maybe 
10 
there is no real harm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I had no reason at that point …. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  To be suspicious of him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I guess well you might also being new you might 
have also wanted to build relationships with people that you were 
working with including the COO and you might not necessarily needed 
to show distrust or anything without a reason? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair.  Particularly … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  That kind of thing. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Particularly Chair because Hlaudi was such a 
- a trusted member of the SABC Executive … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  And as - as Acting COO he also sat on the 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 77 of 173 
 
board and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  He was very well loved and … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  There were accolades and accolades heaped 
on him all the time. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  So I really no real reason … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  To - to be suspicious. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  And yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But have - having - having gone there to - was it at 
the residence or was it at the company of Sahara Computers? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  It was at the - at the residence. 
CHAIRPERSON:  At the residence? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Then it had a clock outside. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes at the residence? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Having been taken there and now finding out 
that all this was just so that somebody must have a chance to say 
congratulations.  Did you not find that quite strange?  You know.  Why 
must people that one I think you did not know really much and why if 
they want to congratulate you - why must you be taken to them and - 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 78 of 173 
 
was that not - did you not find that strange? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  It was a bit strange Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  It was a bit strange because there was really 
no further substance to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were you upset about it that Mr Motsoeneng take - 
took you for that really? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I was intrigued … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  And maybe slightly annoyed because … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  You know I was - here I was taken away from 
my desk … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  And - and yes it was around lunch time.  So 
you know … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  But I was intrigued. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja but you did not say - did you say anything to 
him afterwards about it or you just allowed it to just die down? 
20 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I cannot quite recall what I said to him Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You cannot remember, yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair and then how soon after 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 79 of 173 
 
your appointment did this meeting - congratulatory meeting take place? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Gosh.  I think it was within a week - within 
the first week. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Of your - of your appointment? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you and between the time of - 
you had the congratulatory meeting and the signing of the agreement 
did you at any stage have any interaction with any of these people or 
some of the people that had congratulated you at all? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  No.  I have to think very carefully now 
10 
because I think what - what happened was in the conversations and 
these were not formal conversations and not minuted the concern was 
raised that you know we are busy doing these breakfasts and there is 
no contract and this was some of the members - Board Members talking 
about it and I agreed with them that indeed you know you could not 
have a relationship of this nature which involved the SABC events and 
personnel going out of the SABC. 
Yes they did that regularly in the regular connection of news.  
However - for other things - however having almost like a - an exclusive 
relationship with a particular party that it was not proper and in fact 
20 
Chair it - it was eventually going to be - there was eventually going to 
be an audit finding because once a relationship is regular then surely it 
has to be regulated. 
Particularly if there are very specific deliverables from - from 
either party.  If you look at in terms of the SABC own process of 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 80 of 173 
 
acquiring content you have to enter into an agreement.  However for 
the news yes it is different because they have to go and cover what is 
going on at the time that it is going on.  So a contract may not be 
necessary but in this one because this was a very steady supplier - 
content supplier.  It was important that there be a contract to regulate 
the relationship. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  So then how frequent was - were 
these breakfast shows? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Chair initially there was supposed to be just 
two times a month.  Now this was 2012.  Then 2012 was just two years 
10 
before the 2014 elections.  There was going to be a - a State of the 
Nation Address in Cape Town, the opening of Parliament and - and 
various other events - important events were - were happening within 
the country. 
There was there launch of the DDT.  There were all kinds of - 
of events that were happening and for the News Department it was 
important content for them and - and that is why they actually initiated 
the contracting process.  It was - it was important for them to have 
access to - to whatever content they could find which spoke directly to 
the people and - and that is how we ended up in a place where the 
20 
contract had to be entered into. 
Now my signature on the contract was really from a protocol 
perspective if I can call it that because the - the - TNA had their Chief 
Executive representing them and I was the Chief Executive of the SABC 
working with the SABC News Team in this regard.  Therefore that is 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 81 of 173 
 
how my signature came on.  I do believe however that it could easily 
have been handled by the Acting Chief Operating Officer together with 
the Group Executive of News. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes because you have already said that 
this was more important for the News Department who was at that time 
heading the News Department? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  It was Mr Jimi Matthews.  He was Acting 
Head of News. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  First there was Mr Mike Seluma … 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Who was there for a very short time and then 
he - he was removed and replaced by Jimi Matthews. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  I had asked about the frequency and 
then you started by saying well they were supposed to be twice a month 
and then when - did those - did they increase over time and if they did 
to what extent? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  They did increase over time.  It is - it is very 
difficult to calculate the extent without looking at the records coming 
out of the SABC News Department itself and I think it may be 
20 
worthwhile to get those records.  I do not have them. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  As - as - you can imagine having left the 
organisation.  I have no access … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 82 of 173 
 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  To a lot of documentation. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Alright.  Can I just take you …? 
CHAIRPERSON:  But - sorry. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But from your own recollection what is your sense of 
how much they increased.  Would it have been three - three times a 
month, four times a month or you cannot even remember that? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I - I … 
CHAIRPERSON:  More or less. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I do not believe Chair that there was an 
10 
exact formula. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  They were all driven by … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Events? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Events … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  And not necessarily by - by a formula. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Maybe we need to deal with the 
aspect that you mentioned.  That you would have your reporters going 
20 
to the places where the breakfast shows were going to happen.  This is 
a matter that was raised by two witnesses yesterday.  By the Head of 
News, Ms Phathiswa Magopeni and by the Financial Chief - Financial 
Officer, Ms Yolande Van Biljon that the SABC never invoiced TNA for 
the costs that they incurred for airtime, for having their reporters 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 83 of 173 
 
travelling there for - their equipment, for all of those expenses. 
They were never invoiced for that.  Do you have an 
explanation as to why that was so? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  At the very - from the very outset it had been 
agreed that the - the content coming out of those breakfasts was very 
newsworthy and SABC News would not accept money to cover a story 
of whatever nature and therefore the - the - if we call the event a base 
for a story.  They could not charge for it and therefore it would not be 
proper for TNA to pay the SABC. 
Chair you may recall that I mentioned earlier that in terms of 
10 
the SABC News Policies and the Broadcasting Charter the SABC was 
allowed to go out and gather news anywhere and to whatever extent 
that it wanted to.  However the SABC News Department could not 
accept cash/money for doing so because that would effectively cause 
their dependence to be - how can I put it? 
CHAIRPERSON:  To be compromised. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Compromised. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    To be compromised yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   So would that even applied to the 
expenses that the SABC would have incurred I gathering or in attending 
20 
the breakfast shows. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Let’s put it this way Chair, the SABC 
worked on budgets so there would be a budget request through news 
and through rigorous process that would end up with Board approval for 
the allocation of the budget.  SABC news would receive its own budget, 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 84 of 173 
 
from there, SABC News was free to do whatever it deemed fit and 
proper and pay for it with their budget.  Therefore, the Group Executive 
head of news together with his management team had it completely 
within their power to expand the monies that they expanded and to 
temper the spending of the monies if they felt that it was too high and it 
is important to state also that any interference on my part, or maybe let 
me say intervention on my part in this regard would have been viewed 
as interference as in me preventing news from doing its job.  Very, very 
fine line here, in the sense that as the Editor in Chief of the SABC 
could not go down to them and say you can’t do this, you can do this 
10 
and they would have to come to me to say we have a problem here, can 
you help us resolve it.  That’s the only way that I would get involved 
with the news department and none of that came to me. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Ma’am from the following paragraphs 
then you deal with the terms of the contract itself but I’d like to take 
you to some specific terms of the contract, maybe starting with the one 
revealing to the frequency of these – if I may just direct you to go to 
page 15 please. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Page 15? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:    What’s the page number? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Page 15 Chair.  According to paragraph 
four of that, that agreement was going to remain in force for how long? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    For a period of 36 months. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes and then there are just some terms 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 85 of 173 
 
that I would like you to just highlight there for instance to the one 
which you have just dealt with, at paragraph 5.6 could you just read 
that term? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:   “It is specifically recorded that the SABC 
 
shall broadcast two events per month and the SABC, shall at 
 
all times   have final editorial control”. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes so did you then,  when you said that 
over time these breakfast shows increased, the number of shows 
increased, did you then sign another agreement or an addendum to this 
agreement? 
10 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    There was no addendum signed and once 
again it had to do with the news department believing that they needed 
the content and therefore being available to cover the content. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes, and may I also take you to the 
paragraph that deals with costs, which is 17.1.21 if my recollection is 
correct, if I may just take you to that Chair, I beg your pardon may I 
just take time Chair to get to that paragraph sorry I’ve marked it, where 
it says that the SABC shall not be liable to pay sub-contractors, I’ll 
take you to that, it’s 7.1.21 not 17 it appears at paragraph – at page 
18, it’s 7.1.21, could you read that term please? 
20 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:   7 point? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     7.1.21, if you go to page 18. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Oh okay, it’s a continuation from 7.1.20 and 
it begins with, 
 
“end at the top there and timeously pay all amounts due to any 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 86 of 173 
 
 
sub-contractor in respect of any services rendered by that sub-
 
contractor in terms of this agreement, if relevant.  SABC shall 
 
not be held liable for payment of any amounts due to such sub-
 
contractors under any circumstances whatsoever and any such 
 
contractor shall have no claim for same against the SABC”. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes and was there, other than the terms 
that you find, for example in paragraph seven which were the duties 
and obligations of the TNA Media, maybe you can just highlight 
because the one about venues, that’s the more prominent term that 
most people refer to and that appears at page 16, the TNA Media shall 
10 
convene the events twice on a monthly basis or as mutually agreed by 
the parties in writing, if you look at 7.1.1. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes so until the time you left the SABC 
you were not privy to any other written terms, changing the original 
terms of this agreement? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    No and Chair I believe that perhaps this 
was a caveat for the news department to have the flexibility to increase 
the broadcast to more than the two times per month and I would 
assume that their in writing possibly happened between them through 
20 
email or phone calls, I’m not certain there. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes and then if you could just highlight 
those terms that you believe important for our purposes because 
there’s one – you had – initially you had told Chair that once there is a 
regular relationship between a particular supplier or maybe [indistinct] 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 87 of 173 
 
supplier and the SABC so there might be wrong with that relationship 
but I’m just, for instance in 7.1.10 on the same page it says, 
 
“Ensure exclusivity to SABC as the official broadcast partner 
 
of the events”. 
 
So it seems to me at this point then the relationship was 
regarded as that of a partnership. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    I think this word was used quite loosely in 
the sense that earlier on we do mention that the relationship should not 
be construed as a partnership of any sorts.  This was just loosely  put 
as two  parties working together, therefore a party which is TNA a party 
10 
which is SABC would then, I suppose, in this instance they were trying 
to emphasise the working together. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Well the paragraph that you want to 
refer to where you say there was – that this relationship was not to be 
construed as a partnership, is that paragraph 6.4 on the same page? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Okay and then who was going to monitor 
then the implementation of this agreement? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    It was mainly the Chief Operating Officer 
and this is acting with [indistinct]at the helm together with the Group 
20 
Executive of News who would be Jimmy Matthews. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes and you would have no role to play 
in making sure that they stuck to the terms of the contract? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    No I wouldn’t have a role to play once 
again with the independence of the news department being enshrined 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 88 of 173 
 
completely. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes thank you and if you go – then on to 
your statement you highlight in your statement, largely, the terms as 
you’ve copied them from the contract themselves, am I correct? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes and all those they go up to 
paragraph 18 and what is of interest largely is the obligations of the 
SABC, you deal with those in paragraph 19, that’s at page five of your 
statement. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Page five? 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes page five and then at 19.1 the 
SABC had identified a particular channel where these were going to be 
held? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Yes Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     And that was in? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    On SABC2 on the morning live slot. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   Yes so the SABC also, 19.2 was going to 
advertise these events?   
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Yes it was. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes was that permissible? 
20 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Yes it was more promoting that such a story 
is going to be coming and that happens across all channels for any 
different event or matter that would be flighted then there would be a 
showing what was going to be coming up. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes and in paragraph 21 you repeat 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 89 of 173 
 
what you said in your evidence that your understanding was that there 
was not going to be any invoicing that was going to happen? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Okay and then you have some figures 
that you’ve put in there in paragraph 23, what are you saying in that 
paragraph? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    In this paragraph I’m stating that through 
the investigators from the Commission who came to me to discuss this 
matter, I found out that, in fact,  the outdoor broadcast had cost 
R20 326 000 over a few years and once again I do not have the exact 
10 
detail of how many years this was but it was over a few years and I 
would certainly request that the Commission requests a clear financial 
breakdown of these from the SABC. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes and then in paragraph 24 you say 
that you can confirm that the events did not stay within the contract 
because then they suddenly escalated in certain cases almost doubled 
and then – when this came to your attention or when you realised that, 
look this is no longer what we had agreed on, what steps did you then 
take? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    As I mentioned earlier I could not intervene 
20 
on that except to ask why there were so many suddenly and I was 
informed that they were critical.  More and more of the major players 
within Government were wanting to present their stories, not only 
Government, SOE’s as well were wanting to be given the opportunity to 
use the platform to inform the public of their work. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 90 of 173 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes and you say in paragraph 26 that 
you understand that another agreement, after you had left was 
concluded? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes with TNA Media. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     That was on, according to you – what is 
the date that you highlight there in paragraph 26? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Come again? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     In paragraph 26 when was that 
10 
concluded? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    On or about the 20 t h of February 2015. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes and then you deal with the renewal 
of the contract and then paragraph 30 you say the preceding paragraph 
that certain information was brought to your attention by the 
investigators of the Commission? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     And then could you just tell Chair what 
you’re communicating in paragraph 30? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    I really – at no stage during my tenure was 
20 
I informed or made aware of the fact that TNA Media was in fact 
charging rather handsome fees from the various State owned 
enterprises, I was never made aware. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes, so that is them charging the other 
SOE’s for the breakfast shows? 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 91 of 173 
 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Indeed Chair and this had to do with the 
fact that, as I initially stated, the relationship was completely arms 
length we only came together at the broadcasting and then separated.  
Anything else that they did beyond that had nothing to do with the 
SABC and that is the reason why somewhere in the statement I do 
mention that the SABC could not be held liable for anything that TNA 
was involved in. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Okay thank you and then in – from 
paragraph 32 onwards then you deal with the distribution of the 
newspapers, that is the New Age? 
10 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Could you just testify to those 
paragraphs and at what point did you get involved and to what extent 
were you involved in the distribution of the New Age within the SABC? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    I was never involved with the distribution of 
the newspapers at all, I was not aware of any contractual arrangement 
between the newspaper wing of TNA and the SABC and so I was quite 
surprised to find – shocked actually to find that the SABC had been 
paying for the newspapers to the amount of R930 873 and I found it 
very difficult to understand that because my understanding was that the 
20 
newspapers were being distributed to the SABC just on the basis of the 
relationship between the SABC and the TNA Media wing.  The TNA 
Media wing would carry stories about the TNA breakfast, so it made 
sense that certain newspapers would be distributed to the SABC so the 
SABC could see how they were being reported on and there was, as far 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 92 of 173 
 
as I knew, there was no agreement for the exchange of money, so I was 
once again taken aback when I saw that the SABC was in fact buying 
the newspapers. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes and the delivery of the newspapers 
would that have been something that you negotiated on prior to you 
signing the contract or advised that it as part of that agreement? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    The newspapers had nothing to do with the 
broadcast contract at all, they were not included if there was any 
negotiation it had to have happened at Mr Motsweni’s level and 
probably Jimmy Matthews and I was never involved in that and I must 
10 
state that within the delegation authority framework and amount of this 
nature would not at all require permission from me for the expenditure 
to be incurred. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   What was the threshold of matters that 
had to be referred to as the Group CEO?   
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    They were – I have this thick document 
which is the delegation of authority document, I’m going to try and see 
very quickly where this could be done. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Did it depend on what the subject matter was or it 
was simply the amount irrespective of…[intervenes]. 
20 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    The threshold that could be expanded for 
instance for an amount of this level it could be approved by a person as 
low as scale code 300 and a scale code 300 individual would be 
supervisory level, 125 is General Manager and then above that is 
Medium Management and scale code 300 would be supervisory level. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 93 of 173 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes and matters that would come to you 
for your approval, could you just give us the…[intervenes]. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Matters that would come to my approval 
would be spending against approved business plans for content 
acquisitioning or commissioning and those would be for scale code 
110A which would be myself and scale code 110 which would be 
Motsweni and Mr T L Olivier’s level and those would be for amounts 
above R50million.  So there was a very clear staggered amounts 
approval framework which was quite categoric in how much who could 
sign for but I must also state Chair that in cases where there was going 
10 
to be a purchase order it had to go through and I would assume that 
there was a purchase order for the purchasing of these newspapers. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     In fact if I may just – to confirm the 
evidence that was received yesterday from Yolande Van Buuren she 
mentioned a figure of R991 671.89 being the total 2018/2017/2016 – 
from 2011 up to 2018 that’s basically the figure that she gave. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    2011 up to? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     From 2011 up to 2018. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Oh okay so it was for over seven years. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     Yes over seven years, yes thank you.  
20 
Chair there’s some other – I would like to take the witness to different 
matters, the parliamentary committee dealings and engagements and 
their findings and I’d like to take you to some of the matter that they 
had raised therein.  I notice that it’s time for the lunch adjournment, 
maybe adjourn at this point? 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 94 of 173 
 
CHAIRPERSON:    How much more time do you think – how much time 
do you think those other matters will take? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     They are just relevant for the purposes 
of making sure that at the end of the day we are able to verify certain 
information from her, they shouldn’t take long. 
CHAIRPERSON:    About fifteen, thirty minutes or you are not sure? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:     I’m not sure Chair because there’s also 
the multi-choice and the DTT matters – yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:    No that’s fine.  Let me just ask one or two questions 
about the newspapers.  Were these newspapers that were delivered on 
10 
a daily basis to SABC that you are talking about? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Chair I’m not quite sure whether they were 
delivered daily or as and when there was a specific mention of the 
SABC, I really am not certain of that, however, if they were being paid 
for then they must have been delivered daily. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    I would assume. 
CHAIRPERSON:     And is it the New Age or it was…[intervenes]. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    The New Age. 
CHAIRPERSON:     New Age, yes so at a certain stage it did come to 
20 
your attention that the New Age was being delivered to SABC? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Yes and in fact it would be put on my desk 
so I was aware…[intervenes]. 
CHAIRPERSON:     It was put on your desk but in terms of volumes did 
you get to know what volumes you were talking about that were being 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 95 of 173 
 
delivered and whether it was just the headquarters of SABC or it was 
SABC throughout the country? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    No Chair I was not aware of the volumes 
but they would be put at the turnstiles, the entrance where the staff 
would go in and they could pick up a copy. 
CHAIRPERSON:     So the way it worked was it that whoever delivered 
them would put them somewhere and staff members of SABC, as they 
came in if they wanted to take a copy they could take a copy, is that 
right? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Yes Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes and you said that initially, maybe not initially 
but initially you thought or your understanding was that these 
newspapers were not being paid for by the SABC, is that right? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Yes Chair, if there was any payment that 
was being made during my time it was certainly concealed from me. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes, so initially you thought that they were just 
giving these newspapers because of the relationship that existed with 
regard to the breakfast shows? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:    Yes but of course that would be strange would it not, 
20 
if they were just giving newspapers without expecting payment for them 
even if there – even if it was because of that relationship with regard to 
the breakfast shows. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Well Chair there is, in television language 
what is called a barter deal which is where you get something back in 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 96 of 173 
 
kind for whatever little bit that maybe has been done.  I assumed they 
were part of a barter deal, obviously not the quantum of the cost of the 
newspaper, obviously being miniscule compared to what was being paid 
by the SABC to be able to do – pay for this staff and the [indistinct] 
etcetera to be able to do the broadcasts. 
CHAIRPERSON:     So if it was just a few copies, even if it was daily 
you would have thought that it was part of that arrangement? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:     But once the volumes reached as certain level you 
wouldn’t think that, would you, once the volumes were – it was quite a 
10 
lot that was being delivered and not being paid for? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Chair I must submit that, that is not one of 
the things that I worried about, that I concerned myself with because I 
did not think there was anything untoward for the delivery of the 
newspapers. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes, but as you saw them did you become aware 
that it was big volumes that were being delivered or that you never saw 
for yourself in terms of where they were being placed and staff saw 
them as they came in, you never saw what they volumes were or you 
just saw the single paper that would be put on your desk each morning? 
20 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    I saw stacks of papers at the entrance into 
the office blocks and then there would be a copy for me on my desk 
together with copies from the other newspaper groups that the SABC 
subscribed to. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 97 of 173 
 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    And it never struck me to probe and find 
out whether we were paying or not paying because surely if we were 
paying and it was above board then that information should have been 
contained in the management accounts that would be issued on a 
monthly basis but there was never a line item that I saw in the news 
management accounts that said, TNA Media newspapers, there was 
never such a line item. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Well I would have thought that if the volumes were 
high and one saw that it looks like on a daily basis there’s a big stack 
of the New Age that gets delivered everyday like that, unless something 
10 
similar was happening with other newspapers, you know, that would 
catch one’s attention to say, this is unusual particularly if anybody can 
come and just take the newspapers, there’s nobody saying pay or 
anything like that and that it ought to say to somebody, I hope we are 
not paying for this and maybe I would like to know if we are paying for 
this or something like that, is that something that you don’t think one 
would expect to occur? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:    Well what I understood from what I was told 
was that they were being delivered for free. 
CHAIRPERSON:     Yes, okay alright let’s take the adjournment we’ll 
20 
resume at five past two, we adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS 
INQUIRY RESUMES 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes we may proceed. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 98 of 173 
 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Mr 
Chairman I placed this afternoon two more volumes before you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The one would be the Parliamentary 
transcripts we do not have to go through them but  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  But for the sake of the witness just to 
state what – what she needs to respond to and also I have placed back 
before you Chair Exhibit 27. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Which deals with the Public Protector’s 
Report of 2014 and lastly I have returned Exhibit 17.1 of Mr Thekiso 
because there is reference to this witness in that bundle.  17.1. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay alright. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think the last part of our discussion Mr Mokhobo I 
wanted to just say that and I maybe I did say it I have forgotten that 
you have responded that seeing a big volumes or a stack of 
newspapers or a particular newspaper always being delivered to the – 
to the institution that should be making money with those newspapers 
20 
in the circumstances where it would be free or you thought it would be 
free may have been something that also should have been of concern. 
To say we do have an agreement with these people that agreement 
provides for everything as far as our relationship is concerned why are 
they giving us free newspapers now?  You understand that – that 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 99 of 173 
 
perspective? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I quite understand Chair. What I stated 
earlier was that this could be construed as a form of a butter deal 
where there is no money exchange but the newspapers would come 
with content about the breakfast shows.  Which should mean that the 
SABC would have the right to see what had been written up about the 
breakfast shows.  And that Chair I believe very strongly should never 
have been something that the SABC would pay for.  The SABC was 
already expending a lot of money to cover the broadcasts.  Getting the 
newspaper in return just so the SABC can see what has been covered, 
10 
what was going on for those people – I mean a lot of the staff at the 
SABC would not be able to see the breakfasts themselves, the shows 
because they would be busy at that time.  But having the newspaper 
would kind of give them an indication of what was discussed.  And that 
was really from that perspective but I think perhaps the people who did 
decide to enter into this commercial contract would have to be 
interrogated as to why they did it.  Because it would have been literally 
adding money – your last pennies to a very wealthy person and that 
does not make sense to me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm.  Thank you. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Ms Mokhobo can 
I just take you to just a few document we do not have to go to them but 
just to put first of all I would like to put it to you the findings of the 
Public Protector.  The – you are quite aware of those because the 
Parliamentary Committee dealt with that, am I right? 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 100 of 173 
 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes and that related to the increment to 
the salary of Mr Motsoeneng the second increment? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And at page 268 the Public Protector made 
the finding Ms Lulama Mokhobo the outgoing GCEO for her improper 
that disciplinary steps must be taken for her improper conduct in the 
approval in the salary increment of Mr Motsoeneng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What page number is that? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That – page 268 Chair which will be in 
10 
Exhibit CC27. 
CHAIRPERSON:  CC27? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  27 that is correct Chair.  That is the 
February 2014 Report of the Public Protector. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh well I was looking at this Parliamentary transcripts 
that is not the one. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  It is not, no Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  [not speaking into microphone] 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  That is correct Chair yes.  At page 268. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  You – then – those findings of 
the Public Protector did serve before the Ad-hoc Committee of 
Parliament? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And in the transcripts you were asked 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 101 of 173 
 
extensively about the increment? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Could you just tell the Chair briefly 
because it will become relevant in another context later in the evidence 
before the SABC as to why you approved the second increment of Mr 
Hlaudi’s salary. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair.  The – when I arrived at the SABC 
I think I have said it before there was an outpouring of adoration on Mr 
Motsoeneng.  There was a belief that he was doing an amazing job and 
that you know he was not being paid enough even as a Group Executive 
10 
member not as acting COO.  And there was a parity exercise that was 
being undertaken by the SABC through which people would be looked 
at from their skill code and then be given an increase if in terms of 
their skill code they were earning below par.  And that was really all 
that the increase was about.  So the Public Protector completely 
misunderstood that and she thought that he was given the increase as 
COO and he was not certainly not given the increase.  As the Chair may 
know SABC’s COO salaries are very high and that money that was 
added to his salary was nowhere near the salary of a COO.  And what 
was very sad for me was that in that misunderstanding there was no 
20 
real room for me to challenge that final finding.  I had responded to the 
draft finding and explained myself on that draft finding but somehow it 
was ignored.  Secondly if indeed I was to be disciplined for having 
raised his salary just so that he could be on the same level as other 
Group Executives I am quite sure that the board if it decided to embark 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 102 of 173 
 
on a disciplinary process against me I am quite sure they would have 
thrown it out because this is a man that they were very happy with.  Ja 
and the other thing is that it was assumed that I had left the SABC 
because of the Public Protector Report it was certainly not because of 
that.  My discussion to leave the SABC began in October and that was 
a few months before the Public Report was – the Public Protector 
Report was released.  It was only released in February on the same 
month that in terms of my notice period my notice had come to an end.  
So it was just a sheer coincidence that she released it at that time.  
And yes I would have stood for – I would have stood up to the 
10 
disciplinary enquiry and had my name cleared there but it just did not 
make sense at that point when I was leaving. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Maybe let us get the – let me get the full context to 
this particular issue.  Mr Motsoeneng was receiving a certain salary for 
the position he held at the time.  Was he still acting COO at the time or 
was he already COO? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  No he was still acting COO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was still acting COO. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  He remained acting COO until I left. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  It was only after I was gone that he was… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.  I think just talk more to the issue than you 
have.  I just want to understand because you know sometimes one read 
all kinds of things in the newspapers and I would rather hear exactly 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 103 of 173 
 
the context here.  How did the whole thing arise?  From what you say it 
looks like it was not just him? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was looking at other people as well.  So I just want 
to get the full context.  How did the issue arise?  Who did it apply to?  
What was done in regard to him?  Was there anything done in regard to 
other people who may have been in the same category?  And how much 
are we talking about?  I just want the full context. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Oh yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If you do remember. 
10 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Chair every year there would be a review 
process for salaries.  And through that process people who were being 
underpaid would be identified.  He was one of those people.  HR would 
then issue a recommendation. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who would issue a recommendation? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Human Resources. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Human Resources. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. Issue a recommendation – they would 
give a status of the salary level and give a sense of what other people 
within that band were receiving and then do a recommendation that 
20 
says we think this person should be at this level.  This person should 
be at another level.   Now in Mr Motsoeneng’s case his matter had to 
be approved by the board Chairperson and he duly approved it because 
he agreed… 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is the increase? 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 104 of 173 
 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  The increase – because he agreed that for 
the kind of work that Mr Motsoeneng was doing he certainly deserved 
that increase and he signed off on it and that is how it was paid.   
There were indeed other people at other levels within the organisation 
unfortunately I cannot remember them properly but perhaps that record 
can also be drawn from the SABC to see.  It was certainly not just him. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So is this something that he Human Resources 
Department would do annually? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or did it just come because of certain circumstances? 
10 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  At the time it came annually. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It came annually? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And they would look at maybe everybody or certain 
categories of people that attracted their attention in terms of maybe 
salary discrepancies or things like that? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  It went largely according to category. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  The levels beneath management who 
belonged to the bargaining council their salaries were set in a very 
20 
straightforward manner through the bargaining council process and 
their increases were also determined through the bargaining council 
process.  But the levels from management and higher those would be 
subjected to scrutiny as to whether or not the individual was being paid 
appropriately.  And yes in many instances there would influence that 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 105 of 173 
 
would come from how much the person was contributing to the 
organisation.  If they were very hardworking and – without doing a 
formal shall I say a very formal, very objective performance review 
organisation wide you had to rely on the manager saying this person is 
doing a good job and yes they are being underpaid let us look at their 
salary increase. Each one of them would bring a different motivation.  
There had to be a motivation.  And on the basis of that motivation then 
HR would then recommend a salary increase. 
CHAIRPERSON:  This may be something that you are able to deal with 
or you might not be able to deal with.  Maybe it might be a Human 
10 
Resources kind of issue but I – I would have thought that there could 
be an increase that is given that is attached to the position as such and 
not to the incumbent to say anybody occupying this position as of this 
year will be paid this.  And that when you start looking – looking at how 
well a particular incumbent is performing his or her duties that – that 
might be something separate and that it is directed at the person rather 
than the position and in that case that is when I would think of 
something like a performance bonus.  Because then that answers to the 
question whether a particular person or incumbent is performing well 
separate from what a person occupying that position is supposed to be 
20 
paid irrespective of what the performance is.  SABC did not have that 
kind of distinction? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Chair is quite right.  The – the salary 
increase was based on what people at that skill code were earning and 
he was far below them.  So he had to be brought up to – to match those 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 106 of 173 
 
people.  There was no performance bonus payment approved during my 
period, during my time and I was very strict about that.  Based on the 
fact that we were still in a very precarious financial position.  Yes the 
SABC was in slight recovery but there were very clear terms of the 
government guarantee that the SABC had raised which National 
Treasury had approved.  And those terms were very categoric in stating 
what the SABC could or could not do with the money.  And I was – I 
was a stickler for sticking to those prescripts that were provided by 
National Treasury.  It would also have been responsible to try and give 
anybody a bonus when there was this massive recovery that the 
10 
organisation had to come out of.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you see I raise that because you mentioned that 
everybody was saying that Mr Motsoeneng was doing so well – was 
performing so well he deserved an increase.  So I am saying I can 
understand if that arises in a situation where you seek to reward good 
performance.  But I do not expect that to be a factor where you are 
simply saying somebody who is doing this job should be paid at this 
rate leaving out the incumbent or whoever may be occupying the 
position.  So that is the background to my question to say why would 
his performance be relevant to whether he was given this increase if it 
20 
was simply to put his level – the salary for his position to the level 
where it should be where anybody coming after him would be paid at 
that level irrespective of how he or she performed? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I really do take your point Chair.  This came 
out from how the case was motivated and the almost overwhelming 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 107 of 173 
 
push for him to get the salary increase and the push was confirmed by 
Doctor Ngubane so I am putting this as you know yes there was that 
legitimate reason which was to put him on par but on top of that there 
was the reasoning that he is also over and above the fact that he is 
underpaid he is also doing an excellent job. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But as far as you recall the increase that he got did it 
simply serve the purpose of putting the salary for a person in his 
position serving in that position where it was thought it should be 
irrespective of the identity or performance of the incumbent or was 
there – was part of the increase to address that and then another part 
10 
sought to address or reward good performance on his part? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Chair it was – the increase was made purely 
to bring him on par with people of that level. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  So based on our discussion looking at it 
now his performance should therefore have been irrelevant? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes that is true Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  If one looks at it now. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  In a sense it is – it is true. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Look there were – there were some doubts 
20 
from other quarters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Based on what later came out from the 
incumbent. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 108 of 173 
 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  The things that he did which were quite 
improper and which then raised at that point some rumbles. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  About whether or not he should have even 
been given a salary increase.  That was obviously based on people’s 
perceptions. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Because they had experienced him in that 
particular way. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  But the fact is he was deserving of an 
increase. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  The – what may be… 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or rather – or rather he might not have been 
deserving of an increase himself. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  The position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But his position. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The position was… 
20 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  The position. 
CHAIRPERSON:  May have been deserving of an increase. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Thank you for that.  Indeed his position was 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 109 of 173 
 
deserving of the increase. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  And lastly 
before Parliament another issue that was canvassed – the one thing 
that we have not spoken about is the date when you left the SABC.  
When did you actually resign from the SABC? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Shoo I – I – I put in my letter of resignation I 
think it was in October and in fact at the board strategy session which 
was held on that particular day I do not have the exact date. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which month? 
10 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Which was held on that particular day.  The 
board Chairperson of that time Ms Ellen Tshabalala announced to the 
board my intention to leave.  And that was in October. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Which year was that? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  That was 2013. 
CHAIRPERSON:  2013 oh.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Maybe to assist the 
witness the date that is contained in the settlement agreement for your 
last day at the SABC is 28 February 2014.  Is that the correct date? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Well that was because after – yes the 28 
20 
February that was – that was my day. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Your last day.  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  It was my last day at SABC. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you.  In Parliament a 
lot was discussed around the package that you received.  You recall 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 110 of 173 
 
that?  Chair on – Chair does not have to go to it but the relevant page 
is in the Exhibit that has got Parliament transcript which will now be 
Exhibit because we have not – introducing it for the first time that will 
be Exhibit 29. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry we – Ms Mokhobo I am sorry we left out in 
our last discussion something that I had mentioned I would like to 
know.  And you may or may not remember it namely what – how much 
was the increase that was given to him now – maybe you might be able 
to say it was 10% of whatever he was earning or is that something you 
cannot remember? 
10 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Chair it was much more than 10%. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  That I am certain of.  
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  It was not 10%. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But you cannot remember. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  No I cannot remember the exact amount. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sure arrangements can be made to find some 
documents to  
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  If there are – I am sure there would be some 
documents in the – at SABC. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  There should be Chair there should be. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I think the HR Group Executive may be able 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 111 of 173 
 
to provide the figures. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The documentation. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  When he comes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay no that is fine. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Chair.  Chair the pages that are 
relevant for this purpose are in the Parliamentary Report which I ask 
that it be marked CC29 that would be from page 1 until page 28. This is 
where 
these 
matters 
are 
discussed 
in 
Parliament 
relating 
to 
Motsoeneng relating to the package or settlement agreement relating to 
Mr Mokhobo and also matters relating briefly to the Multichoice contract 
10 
which is going to be one of the matters that this stream is going to be 
dealing with.  But just because at that point Parliament did not have 
these documents before it and also for the record for you to confirm I 
would like to refer you to Exhibit CC17 – 17.1.  This is the bundle that 
Mr Thekiso had compiled and I would like you to turn to page 155. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I am not sure where to find it Chair. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh sorry it is in – could you please 
assist/A 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think somebody must help her. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Sorry could you just help her.  17.1. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  She has not dealt with 17.1 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes sorry.  Yes thank you at page 155.   
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Page? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 155.  It starts – the separation 
agreement starts from page 154. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 112 of 173 
 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Shoo the numbering here is not… 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  On top. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The red numbers on the top right hand corner. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  On the top – oh okay and it is page 1? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  154. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  154.  Yes I see where it begins. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  Is that the separation 
agreement between you and the SABC? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes thank you.  And then the amounts that 
10 
you received they appear at page 155. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes there was a lot of debate around how 
much you received.  What was Parliaments information about what you 
had received? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Parliament was totally misinformed and I am 
not sure what the reason was apart from probably trying to damage my 
reputation.  Parliament was given a figure of between R8 and R11 
million and it was widely reported in the media reports and I was 
ridiculed when in fact it was totally untrue. That is not the amount that I 
20 
had received. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Could you then for the record and 
also to set that record straight just read out to the Chairperson the 
amounts as reflected on that page? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Chair I received R4 221 179.22 which was 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 113 of 173 
 
equivalent to twelve months of my gross cost to company at the – which 
was equivalent to the total remuneration that I was already earning at 
that time. Then I received a further R1 400 736.00 which was for the 
restraint of trade agreement which effectively barred me from being 
employed by an entity within the same industry.  And there was a 
further accrual of annual leave which was R395 652.51 it seems like a 
lot but I hardly ever took leave. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Thank you.  And then lastly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry that would have been roughly how much 
when you add the – all the three figures? 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  That was before tax am I correct? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes it was before tax. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Those amounts – just. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  It was about R5.6  
CHAIRPERSON: 
 
I 
thought you 
would 
just remember 
without 
calculating. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Chair it was a long time ago and there is a 
lot of stuff that I have buried. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay well. 
20 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  It was around R5. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About 6 – about 6? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  About almost R6 million yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About R6 million. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 114 of 173 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes okay.   
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And then lastly there is something that 
Parliament dealt with in its enquiry which is something that is going to 
come later but there is a witness already who is going to – who has 
given a statement to the commission that is going to be called.  A Mr 
Roy Kruger. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I am sorry Ms Norman we may – I just want to make 
10 
sure we do not leave this without … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Oh yes Chair.   
CHAIRPERSON:  With anything hanging. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  The amount that was equivalent to twelve months 
salary or remuneration why were you given that amount? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  The - the agreement was that I would be paid 
for just one year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Sorry. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  The agreement was that I would be paid for 
20 
just one year.  It - it was an amount that I suppose would be equivalent 
to what the CCMA would recommend to the entity or if - if an employee 
was leaving before completing their contract.  Something like that 
Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well you know earlier on and I assume you may have 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 115 of 173 
 
been sitting there.  We had Mr Thekiso dealing with people who were 
paid certain monies/amounts and so on and as I understand the - the 
focus seems to look at - at least some employees may have been paid 
more than they should have been paid and the reasons or motives may 
have been illegitimate for doing that. 
So you - you did not deal of course with the question of why 
you left and that maybe relevant to why you were paid that amount but 
if you had decided to leave on your own without there being any dispute 
or anything.  I know of no reason why you or anybody on a fixed term 
contract would have to be paid for any - any amount if it was just their 
10 
decision that they want to leave.  So that is why I am - I am asking. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Chair at that time there was a level of 
desperation in particular by the Chair of the Board for me to go 
because I had challenged a lot of her decisions very vigorously and she 
was - she was very angry with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  There are board minutes … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  That show how locked horns over the - the 
MultiChoice Contract … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Because I just did not agree with it … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  At all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 116 of 173 
 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  There were some clauses and I have 
analysed some of the clauses.  I have written them down. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Although I have not given them to the 
evidence leader … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Which were completely inappropriate … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  But they - the Chair of the Board then 
decided that Mr Motsoeneng and Mr Olivier who were both acting in 
10 
their capacities incidentally should go ahead and sign that contract and 
she was very abrasive with me. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I had to take a week off - slightly less than a 
week off to take care of my granddaughter who was gravely ill.  So I 
took emergency leave … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  And in that week while I was gone they then 
decided to meet with MultiChoice and quickly conclude the contract … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  And then quickly agree that the contract 
must be signed … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  But the - the process was fundamentally 
flawed. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 117 of 173 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I did not agree with the process in the first 
place. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Of how they arrived at - at Mr Motsoeneng 
and Mr Olivier signing the contract but secondly there were clauses 
that were just totally improper … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  That were included there. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  That was the first instance … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Where we locked horns and it was really 
ugly.  It was very, very ugly.  The second instance was when the then 
Minister of Communications Mr Yunus Carrim was getting frustrated 
with there being no industry agreement on the - the set-top boxes that 
were going to be used for the digital transformation of the country and 
in terms of the digital migration policy of 2012 which was in force at 
that time it was important for those set-top boxes to have a - a control 
mechanism which was set to do a whole lot of things that would benefit 
20 
the public including the ability for the public to access messaging to 
connect to the internet and be able to do whatever they needed to do 
using the set-top boxes without even having to go and buy a - a 
computer and - and to me and to a whole lot of other people that was 
what expanding the knowledge, economy to the poor was about. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 118 of 173 
 
The poor needed to have access but it was impossible for 
them to - and - and the argument was that.  Well there is cellular 
telephone and how people access content via cellular.  It is extremely 
expensive.  Now those set-top boxes particularly for the (indistinct) 
were going to be given for free and if they had a set-top box which was 
encrypted and which could enable connectivity to a telephone line so it 
would have return path. 
Then you would have citizenry in the most far flung parts of 
this country.  As long as they had even an old black and white box who 
would be able to access Government documents.  Their children would 
10 
be able to access content for them to - to study.  It is a - the - the 
benefits were just enormous but all of that was - was thrown out when 
the MultiChoice Contract was entered into. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With regard to the last issue are you saying that you 
and Minister Carrim were at opposite ends … 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Right. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  No Chair.  Mr - Minister Carrim agreed 
completely with the digital migration policy as it was published in 2008.  
He agreed with it and as I said so did a whole lot of us.  I am - I am 
20 
already originally trained as an educationist.  So for me I saw a 
massive benefits for the children of this country and the adults and 
anybody who needed to be informed. 
So he was in agreement with that but he was frustrated  
because after the - the SABC had signed the MultiChoice Contract the 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 119 of 173 
 
SABC and the MultiChoice Contract effectively prescribed to the SABD 
that the SABC could not accede to the inclusion of encryption on the 
said topics and by doing that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  They basically threw out the entire plan that 
the SABC had and other industry players … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Who saw the benefit … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Of encryption. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  They threw it out. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Now Minister Carrim was caught between two 
- two parties who were not agreeing with - with each other.  The one 
party of which MultiChoice was part of was saying there should be no 
encryption.  There should be a simple set-top box.  After all people will 
eventually find these TV sets that would have these things built onto 
them and this has still not happened up to today. 
You still need a decoder box from MultiChoice in order to see 
20 
their signal.  So I am not sure where they were coming from there.  The 
other argument was that cellular telephone penetration was - was very 
high and people could access data and - and whatever.  The third most 
ridiculous notion was that the SABC would willy-nilly switch off people 
using the encryption technology and that is absolutely not what it was 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 120 of 173 
 
intended for. 
The SABC would never do that at least not under my watch if 
I was still there when this was launched.  Then you had on the other 
hand people who agreed with my perceptions with the views that were 
expressed by the late Minister Matsepe-Casaburri when she wrote the - 
the - she launched the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The policy? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:   
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  The policy and many other Ministers who 
agreed with - with that approach.  So Minister Carrim was caught 
10 
between the two parties.  The one strong voice saying no, no.  The 
other strong voice saying yes … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now was … 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  And so he brought everybody together. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Was the other voice Ms Tshabalala the Chairperson of 
the board. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  The - the Ms Tshabalala voice was that there 
should be no encryption. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and MultiChoice - no she was on the same side 
as - as MultiChoice? 
20 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  She was on the same side as - as 
MultiChoice. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but you were on … 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I was on the other … 
CHAIRPERSON:  On the other side? 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 121 of 173 
 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And you know that Minister Carrim was in agreement 
with you? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  He was on the other side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was in agreement with you? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You and him were - were on the same side on this 
issue? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  We were on the same side. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
10 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Together with his … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Deputy? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  His Deputy, his DG … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  And other people. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Everybody was in agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well it - it - that issue the MultiChoice as well as this 
- this digital - it was called digital? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Digital migration. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  Digital migration is something that the 
Commission - is one of the things that it is looking at.  I am not sure 
how far the investigators are but it is looking at it and I - I am aware of 
- of some of the things because I sat in the Constitutional Court in a 
matter that came to the Constitutional Court at some stage about the 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 122 of 173 
 
issue of that policy and all of those court papers … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Should be collected.  So and - and I would urge you if 
the investigators or the Commission might not have got much 
information from you in regard to that aspect.  I would urge you if 
possible to give the Commission as much information as you know … 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because one of the things that certainly when the 
matter came before the Constitutional Court I could not understand is 
why it was taking so long for Government to make up their mind one 
10 
way or another on the issue and I think I seem to remember that at 
some stage in the public media maybe in the court papers I do not - I 
cannot remember that the - the ruling party on its side was saying what 
has been done is not in accordance with the policy. 
This might not have been at your time.  It might have been at 
- at a different time but it was one of those things where - where you do 
not understand why it is taking so long to implement and if there are 
challenges why do people not just make up their mind.  This is the right 
thing.  If it is the right thing we are doing it.  If it is not the right thing 
make up your mind and make it clear where - where you stand but you 
20 
say that - you - you are saying that your departure from the SABC was 
not really because you just wanted to leave and there was no problem. 
You say there were - there was a problem or there were some 
problems but you say in particular you as the Group CEO and the 
Chairperson of the Board at the time Ms Tshabalala you were in 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 123 of 173 
 
disagreement on the issue of - on this issue of digital migration and - 
and MultiChoice.  The MultiChoice Agreement making it almost 
redundant to look at - at the digital migration or being inconsistent with 
the whole idea. 
You know and the two of you were - could not agree on that 
and she was insistent that she wanted it to go - to happen. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO: 
 
In 
fact 
Chair 
she 
- 
she 
instructed 
Mr Motsoeneng and Mr Olivier to go ahead and sign the contract even 
though the contract had not been processed appropriately within the 
organisation.  In terms of the - the delegation of authority … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO: 
 
It 
made 
- 
it 
makes 
a 
very 
clear 
pronouncement on this.  It says in page 2 of the applicable delegation 
of authority framework. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Paragraph 2.4.  It says: 
“Board Committees are generally constituted with 
powers of recommendation only.  However subject 
to certain statutory limitations the board may in its 
discretion delegate decision making authority in any 
20 
area to one or more of the Board Committees.” 
Now what had happened is whatever Mr Motsoeneng, his 
team and Ms Tshabalala were convinced was the right approach for the 
SABC should have been brought for scrutiny.  At the very least it should 
have started with the - the Group Executive members scrutinising this 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 124 of 173 
 
in terms of the correct due process and once the Group Executive had 
satisfied themselves that the contract - MultiChoice Contract was fair. 
It was good.  It made sense or it was not good but say they 
had said it was good.  It made sense.  They would then have to refer it 
to the Finance Investment and Procurement Sub Committee.  That Sub 
Committee would do the same rigorous process and within that process 
Chair there will be critical things like risk assessment.  The ability for 
the SABC to do what it still needed to do as per its mandate with or 
without the contract and - and to be put through a stress test to see 
whether it is - it was truly illegible for signing off and once the Finance 
10 
Investment and Procurement Sub Committee had done that and it 
agreed that it was fine. 
It would then have to be taken to the board.  For the board to 
give its final stamp of approval and once the board had done that then 
the document could go off and be signed with MultiChoice but it did not 
happen that way.  The last discussion at the Finance Investment and 
Procurement Sub Committee and at that time it was chaired by 
Mr Mavuso, Vusumuzi Mavuso. 
Was there perhaps said okay can this then go to the next 
level for discussion but when they came out of that meeting - now I was 
20 
not in that meeting.  That is when I was on leave.  When that meeting 
ended people then rushed off and decided that there was approval.  
They could go ahead and sign.  So it was entered into unlawfully.  Just 
from that perspective failure to adhere to process. 
CHAIRPERSON:  There was some rush to have it signed … 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 125 of 173 
 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  During the time when you were on leave? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Because I was an encumbrance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Because you were standing in the way? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes, yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So would it be - would it reflect your thinking to say 
you were pushed out of the SABC? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Indeed Chair.  In fact attempts to push me 
out had been going on for quite a while.  I think at least three times 
there were rumours swirling around the organisation that I was going to 
10 
be suspended or was going to be fired and there were lots of lies that 
were being said about me.  The most ridiculous ones being that I was a 
shareholder at ETV. 
Now ETV together with - was - was on the side of the set-up 
box control - the encryption … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  And therefore because I was saying yes 
encryption … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  And we having industry discussions around 
20 
these matters.  They said I was a shareholder at ETV and my children - 
two children - were working for ETV and then people could go to that 
bottom pit of lies to tarnish my name.  So much was said.  I mean it 
was said I was lazy.  I was not doing my job etcetera and things just 
got to head and … 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 126 of 173 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  With regard to your children? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was not true.  They were - you had no children 
working at ETV? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  It was an absolute untruth. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  There was never an attempt by my children 
to look for work at ETV. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So - so it was - was it those two reasons around 
which you and the Chairperson of the Board at the time could not 
10 
agree? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  There - there were further other reasons.  I 
locked horns many times … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  With Mr Motsoeneng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  With - ja.  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  He undermined my authority. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Many, many times … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  And quite a few times Ms Tshabalala gave 
me a dressing down in front of my staff and I could never understand … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Why she would that.  There was absolutely 
no decorum … 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 127 of 173 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  And the reason was quite simply that Chair I 
was refusing to do things that were not according to policy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I was refusing to do that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  And therefore they had to find a way to sully 
my name as far as possible. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I know for a fact that they canvassed the - 
10 
the agreement of some top politicians. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  That I should - I should go. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  So at a point when I decided I was going to 
go was when this final - it was like a final push Chair when the lies 
came out about me and my children and ETV and - and all of that. 
That is when I realised that these people were capable of 
killing me because I just did not understand how anybody could have so 
much malice and having locked horns with the Chair we - we both 
20 
agreed that perhaps it was time that I should go and I drafted a 
memorandum to her stating that I think it was time for me to go and I 
hope I will be quickly compensated because I was being forced to leave 
my seat at the time when I was not ready to through their actions and 
by the time Chair - I think it is very important to note that - and this is 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 128 of 173 
 
something that is never reported on. 
That under my leadership the SABC finances became 
extremely healthy. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I had - I had ensured that the advertising 
industry rebuilt their belief in the SABC and indeed they did.  So 
advertising money started coming into the SABC.  I made sure that all 
the leaking taps were closed.  By leaking taps I mean Chair 
opportunities to spend money wilfully for … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Improperly? 
10 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Improperly - were closed and I did not 
succeed on all aspects but where things came to my attention that 
could potentially cost SABC to lose money I simply said no and 
because of that the dislike for me increased phenomenally and the 
disrespect was just so - so intense. 
You can imagine being a Group CEO and walking down the 
corridor and you know that your staff are thinking whatever they are 
thinking of you because they have heard this or they were present in a 
meeting when this was said.  It is not comfortable at all and I realised 
Chair that it was indeed time for me to go. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well some of this might not have been part of - of - or 
at least maybe the details of - of what you intended dealing with but it 
is quite important and to the extent that it may be necessary whatever 
you might not be able to deal with which surrounds that issue.  What 
led to your departure?  What happened? 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 129 of 173 
 
It might be necessary for - for you to come back if need be 
because it is - it is quite important to understand those things because 
certainly there has been evidence here in regard to other SOEs and to - 
to the fact that people who were standing for what is right and resisting 
any attempts to do wrong things for standing in the way of people who 
wanted to do wrong things would be pushed out in one way or another 
and it is important to - for me to know everything that might make me 
understand whether yours is definitely that situation but from what you 
have said and I am still going to hear other witnesses it - it may well be 
that situation. 
10 
So - but to come back to the amount that you were paid - so 
it seems from what you have said that when you wrote to the 
Chairperson and maybe attached the memorandum or the agreement - 
draft agreement.  You - you said you were prepared to go and you hope 
that you would be compensated appropriately.  Is that right? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair.  I did not write the memorandum 
myself.  She engaged the services of an external party … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Who drafted the separation agreement. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
20 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I was not involved … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  With that at all. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay but whoever it was - was doing so on your 
behalf or on behalf of both parties? 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 130 of 173 
 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  No on behalf of - on behalf of the 
Chairperson (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh on behalf of the Chairperson? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So there had been a discussion between you and the 
Chairperson … 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  The - the … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Before the person was instructed to draft it? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes indeed Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And in terms of that discussion you had indicated that 
10 
you were prepared to leave? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I indicated that I was - I was intending to 
leave … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  And however I would stick to my statutory 
obligation of … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Serving out notice for three months … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  And the funny thing Chair is that towards the 
20 
end of my probation period she wanted me to extend and stay until 
after the elections. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  2014 was election year … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 131 of 173 
 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  And she asked me to stay on until after the 
elections.  At that point I - I just thought - you know - I cannot do this 
anymore. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I had reached the end of my tether. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm, hm.  Okay, but the - the amount that you were 
given which I think you said represented or the agreement says 
represented 12 months remuneration. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Who came up with that - that amount? 
10 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  She came up with it. 
CHAIRPERSON:  She came up with the amount? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Together with … 
CHAIRPERSON:  The third party? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  The third party. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  The third party is a well-known … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Lawyer or not really? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Lawyer who … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
20 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Who deals a lot with SABC staff matters. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay alright.  So - so the amount did not come 
from you? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It came from their side? 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 132 of 173 
 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  It came from them.  From their … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, their side. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Calculations. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja and the way they explained it to you was that this 
is what - the CCMA would normally award.  Is that right? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Where - was - were you told that this is what the 
CCMA would award if for example you took them to - the SABC to the 
CCMA or …? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes.  The CCMA would as - as … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Constructive dismissal or anything like that? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Ja.  The CCMA would as - almost a standard 
practice award one year. 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is what you were told? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay and then you accepted that? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Then I accepted. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So in - in a way was it to you like a settlement to 
make sure that after that there would be no further litigation or how did 
you see it? 
20 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  True Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Or just as some compensation for the fact that you 
were not finishing your term? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I had to claim compensation if I was not 
finishing my term would have been too paid out the remainder of my 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 133 of 173 
 
contract … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Which was three years. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  But I was not willing to engage in that - in 
that fight. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  For the sake of mind … 
CHAIRPERSON:  You were just … 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Integrity. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I thought well - you know - and - and also 
the fact that there was a - a restraint of trade. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  It meant that my family and I would suffer … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  For the period that I was under the restraint.  
So it - it was just fair that … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I should be compensated some money for - 
20 
for not being allowed to work within the industry … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  That I have been in for … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Hm. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  At that point it was more than 20 years. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 134 of 173 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes but - but the one thing you are clear about is that 
you were pushed out? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair.  Indeed. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes and … 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Certainly. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And this - all of this related to you being pushed out? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Thank you and - and you say you have been 
pushed out of SABC for standing for what you believed was right and 
refusing to be party to anything that was wrong? 
10 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Just for the 
purposes of the record.  You - you would recall that after our 
consultation you were requested by me that another statement would be 
required just on the MultiChoice …? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes and I … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Started writing. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.  Yes, thank you.  Can I 
20 
just - just to place the evidence of one witness that is going to come 
after you - maybe some time next week who just on this issue of 
MultiChoice - his statement you do not have to go to it.  I will just read 
out to you what he says.  It is EXHIBIT CC20 to 24 Chair.  This is 
Mr Roy Kruger.  He says in paragraph 46: 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 135 of 173 
 
“The DOC …” 
In - in fact if I may start from paragraph 44 just to confirm 
what (intervenes). 
CHAIRPERSON:  Just repeat the page number. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Page 12 Chair of CC20 to 24. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Are we on the same bundle or a different bundle? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  No - no this is the bundle - sorry.  It is the 
same bundle.  I beg your pardon.  The same bundle that has got this 
witness’ statement.  I beg your pardon.  The right - it will be under - his 
statement is under … 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Divider number 20. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  I have got  
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I have got it and what is the page number? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  The page number is page number 12.  Are 
you there? 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  No, I do … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  I will - I will just read out to you. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes ma’am. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  He is talking about the very issue that you 
are going to deal with in your other statement - the MultiChoice issue - 
the set-top boxes but this is what he says in paragraph 44. 
“Minister Yunus Carrim set up a forum to try and get 
all parties to agree to using a STB Control System 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 136 of 173 
 
or come to a consensus as to how to run the SADDT 
Network according to the existing SA Policy 
Document.” 
45: 
“MultiChoice and the supported by Mr Motsoeneng 
opposed all suggestions of STB Control in the DDT 
Network.” 
46: 
“The DOC received letters of support and go ahead 
on the use of the SENTECH STB Control System 
10 
from both the then GCEO Ms Lulama Mokhobo and 
then Chairman Ms Ellen Tshabalala.” 
That is what he says.  So I just wanted to put to you that 
what you have said that you were in support but then he also says that 
Ms Tshabalala was also in support of - of that. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes Chair.  Very, very strangely we had made 
thorough presentations to the board on the DDT position of the SABC 
which included the set-top box control and all the arguments regarding 
the benefits for the country.  Not for the SABC for the public and the 
board was happy and approved that policy position and on that basis 
20 
Ms Tshabalala then wrote and we co-signed that letter. 
Then suddenly I am not sure what the date - what the date is 
on that letter.  It is - it is very important to recognise the date because 
then suddenly she wrote a subsequent letter to Mr Carrim and I - I do 
not have a copy of that letter but I remember vividly and in that letter 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 137 of 173 
 
she capitulated and said the SABC was not going to support the set-top 
box control. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Now what I cannot quite recall was how that 
was synchronised with the signing of the MultiChoice Contract. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I - I cannot quite recall that.  So it would be 
very good to see … 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  The dates of the letter because then we can 
work it back to … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  When the MultiChoice contract was signed. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No all of things will be … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  Will be dealt … 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Quite important to pursue and all … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Of the documentation and whatever knowledge and 
information that you have please give - give it to the Commission 
because … 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 138 of 173 
 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  I shall do so. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It is very important.  My recollection is that there was 
a lot of money that was involved in - in that whole thing and that it took 
so many years.  I mean up to now … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I think sometime this year there was something in the 
newspaper.  I do not know what development … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  About them. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Thank you. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  In fact Chair we will show - we will give - 
we will have a witness that is going to talk to that. 
CHAIRPERSON:  To deal with that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  And will demonstrate how those boxes are 
just lying somewhere in some warehouses … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Without being delivered. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  So that is the evidence that we are going 
to lead next week. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, ja.  No … 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  And yet vast amounts of money were paid for 
that. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  I think there was something in the 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 139 of 173 
 
newspaper sometime this year and I think I - I asked Mr Pretorius and 
Mr Nombembe to take note and make sure that it is pursued because … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  It was something like there lying somewhere … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And nothing is being done … 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  We will …. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And where money is being lost. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes.  The investigators have got all that 
Chair. 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  We will show it to you next week. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  And those Chair were set-top boxes without 
encryption.  So if there was this excitement about distributor set-top 
box without encryption why were they not distributed.  I do not 
understand. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, yes.  No, thank you. 
20 
ADV THANDI NORMAN 
SC: 
 
Thank 
you 
very 
much 
Chairman.  
Mr Chairman that is for now the evidence from this witness. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Ms Mokhobo. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 140 of 173 
 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And I understand that there is another statement that 
you had already started working on. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Yes I have started working on it Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes.  So in - you - you will probably maybe asked to 
come back at some stage.  Arrangements will be made but thank you 
very much for coming to share your knowledge with - with us about 
these issues.  For now you are excused. 
MS LULAMA MOKHOBO:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you. 
10 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  
Mr Chairman may I ask for leave to change seats and that my learned 
friend Ms Rasivhetshele … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Can take over the next witness? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  How - how much time?  10 minutes, five 
minutes? 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Chair the only - five minutes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Five minutes. 
ADV THANDI NORMAN SC:  Yes, thank you.

CHAIRPERSON:  You are much younger than me, you should not forget 
so easily. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:    I shouldn’t Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, alright, yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:    Thank you Chair, today’s witness is Mr 
Krige, he forms part of the well-known SABC 8, just to bring to the 
Chair’s attention that Mr Krige has a flight to catch later this afternoon, 
so if we have not finished with Mr Krige’s evidence by four o’clock if 
the Chair would just approve for us just to go just a little bit after four 
10 
o’clock, that would be much appreciated. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, no that’s fine.  Can we swear this one in now? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:    Yes, may the witness be sworn in? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, administer the oath or affirmation. 
REGISTRAR:   
Please state your full names for the record? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:     Jakob Daniel Krige. 
REGISTRAR:  Do you have any objection with making the prescribed 
affirmation? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:     No. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you solemnly affirm that the evidence you will give 
20 
shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, if so raise 
you right hand and say I truly affirm?. 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:     I truly affirm.

page one what document is that?  On the first page, you will see the 
page numbers are written in red on your top right hand corner 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:     Ja, it is my affidavit. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:    And will you please turn to page 9 of 
that document. 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:     Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:    Is that your signature in the middle of 
the page? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:     Yes that is my signature. 
10 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:    And you deposed to this affidavit on the 
12 t h of August 2019? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:     Ja. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:    Mr Krige you have also stated that you 
do want to make a correction in your affidavit? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:     Ja, on point number 14 there was a 
mistake slipping in saying that Mr Matthews is the Chief Financial 
Officer but he in fact was the Acting Chief Executive Officer. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:    Thank you.   
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you say paragraph 14?  Oh yes, ja, I can see.  
20 
You will arrange for a supplementary affidavit? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:    Yes Chair, I have already had a 
conversation with Mr Krige about that.

Page 144 of 173 
 
Krige everything is true and correct on the affidavit? 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Ja. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:  Mr Krige where are you currently 
employed? 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   I retired on the 31 s t of May from the 
SABC. 
ADV 
MPHO 
RASIVHETSHEL: 
 
And 
before 
being 
employed 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that this year? 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Say again? 
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is that this year? 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Ja, on the 31 s t of May I retired. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:  And Mr Krige before your retirement on 
the 31 s t of May where were you, how long were employed by the SABC, 
just give us just a short background of your career? 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   I have been employed 1990 at the 
SABC, five years as a field reporter, seven years as a senior producer 
and then the last 15 years I was the Executive Producer of the Current 
Affairs Show, shows of RSG, the Afrikaans Radio Station. 
20 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:  And on paragraph 3 Mr Krige you were 
approached by the investigators of the Commission.  Can you just 
elaborate onto the purpose as to why the investigators approached 
you? 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Ja, I was a part of a group called by the 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 145 of 173 
 
media the SABC 8 after we have been dismissed by the SABC in 2016 
and as far as I understand I was approached to explain the process and 
what happened at that stage. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:  And in paragraph 7 you highlight the 
start of the editorial interference. 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:  From your line managers, can you talk 
about you know when this editorial interference commenced? 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Yes, there was always a sort of editorial 
interference but one of the most profound instances was on 5 t h 
10 
February 2014 when the Acting Head of News at that stage Sebolelo 
Ditlhakanyane, came into my office and informed me that we could not 
report on any of the activities of the EFF, the Economic Freedom Front 
party at that stage, and when I asked her why she said it was an order 
from the 27 t h floor, and my understanding was that it was coming from 
the former CEO Mr Motshlale Motsoeneng, which was strange because 
he was not the editor in chief and he had nothing to do with news, so I 
couldn’t understand the instruction and I explained to her that it was 
not possible to ignore any political party, it was just before an election 
period and she said we had no choice because it was a directive from 
20 
the top and I told her that we will go on broadcasting news and not 
ignore the EFF.   
 
Ten minutes later I received a call from the Secretary of Mr 
Jimi Matthews who was the former Head of News at that stage, the 
Head of News at that stage, he requested me to come to his office, 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 146 of 173 
 
where in the presence of Ms Ditlhakanyane, gave me a speech about 
not conforming to the rest of the SABC and accused my team of 
thinking that they were an island on their own.  He proceeded to tell me 
that I have to obey all instructions from Sebolelo Ditlhakanyane on 
which I responded that if she gives me instruction I will listen to it, and 
evaluate it and then act accordingly, it depends on what the instruction 
is.  Ja, that was what happened there.   
 
What happened also was that on the same year in December 
Mr Motsoeneng appointed Ms Ditlhakanyane in a permanent position as 
Head of News, Mr ...(intervention)  
10 
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, I’m sorry Mr Krige, please finish the story 
about that discussion on the 27 t h, was it the 27 t h floor? 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Ja, that comes later ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja, but I think about whether you, the program was 
allowed to be aired what you wanted to air on TV and they were saying 
no don’t, I want to know ultimately what happened to it? 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Ja, what happened was that there was 
an outcry in the media after it became known that the SABC did not 
want to broadcast any EFF stories, and then the next day or the next – 
within two days the SABC put out a statement denying that there was 
20 
any instruction to that effect.  So then we carried on with coverage of 
the EFF. 
CHAIRPERSON:  But on the day that you got instructions were you not 
planning to air that on the same day? 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   We planned to do that and we did that 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 147 of 173 
 
during our midday program, we had an interview with the EFF which we 
broadcast. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh you did go ahead? 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:  Ja, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Despite the instruction? 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:  Mr Krige that directive, that instruction 
that you had received not to broadcast the EFF was that in line with the 
editorial policy at the time? 
10 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   No not so, it was not in line with any of 
– not in line with the Constitution, not in line with the BCSA’s 
...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  It was just completely wrong? 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Ja, it was just completely wrong, there 
was no way that you can ignore a political party in any country or any 
news for that matter that comes to your attention. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Did Mr Jimi Matthews during – you said he gave you a 
speech or a lecture, did he say why it was that the EFF should not be 
you know events or anything connected with it should not be 
20 
broadcast? 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   No he did not explain that instruction, 
the only thing that he said that I must listen to my line managers in that 
sense the Acting Head of News and that I should listen and obey all 
their instructions but he did not give me the time, the opportunity to 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 148 of 173 
 
discuss that specific instruction? 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, so he spoke in general? 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Ja, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  And then the acting head of – did you say it was Ms 
Ditlhakanyane? 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Ja, Ditlhakanyane ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, Acting Head of Radio News.  Ja, also this was a 
radio broadcast, not a TV broadcast that you were planning. 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Ja, that’s right. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So, and when you were speaking with Mr Matthews 
10 
you parted with  him on the basis that you would listen to whatever 
instruction that Ms Ditlhakanyane would be giving you and evaluate it, 
implying that if you thought that it was a lawful instruction that was in 
line with the policy of SABC you would comply but if you thought it was 
unlawful or contrary to the SABC’s policies you would not comply, is 
that what you were implying? 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   That’s correct, at the SABC and 
according to our editorial policy the decision making stops at the 
Executive Producer and that was my position, it is only when you are 
uncertain of certain decisions that you must make or when there is a lot 
20 
of money involved to do a trip or whatever that you would see the 
upwards referral route, then you will go to your superior or your next 
line manager and discuss it with her, if you are uncertain of the content 
of certain issues then you will do that, but usually the buck stops at the 
Executive Producer and anything from outside we would deem as 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 149 of 173 
 
interference into your programs. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So on that day you went ahead and broadcast 
whatever you wanted to broadcast in regard to the EFF, contrary to Ms 
Ditlhakanyane’s instruction. 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Her instruction ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Were there any consequences to you as a result of 
you not complying with that instruction or not really? 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:  No consequences as I said shortly after 
that the SABC put out a statement which of course ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Denying? 
10 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Ja, protected me and my point of view 
and said ja there is no such an instruction, although it happened, ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes it had happened, okay thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:  Thank you.  Mr Krige let’s jump onto 
paragraph 12 of your statement where you highlight a second incident 
of an editorial interference with the SABC announcing that they were 
not going to cover any protest action. 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Ja, ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I may have, I am sorry, I may have interrupted your 
planning, I think he was starting on turn about Mr Motsoeneng 
20 
appointing Ms Ditlhakanyane in the permanent position when I 
interrupted him, I don’t know if he had finished that part. 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Ja,, I was just referring to the fact that 
later that year Mr Motsoeneng appointed Ms Ditlhakanyane in the 
permanent position of Head of Radio News, Mr Matthews was appointed 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 150 of 173 
 
as the GE of News and Current Affairs while another employee, Ms 
Nonthando Maseko became the Head of Television News, the 
announcement was made on the same day and if – and later in 2019 
when Mr Joe Slovo was – a report was released all three of them were 
fingered as part of people that was part of giving instructions to the 
News Room, I think it was just with making that point. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:  Chair a witness that we have allocated 
for Friday would be able to talk to this report in detail.  Going back to 
paragraph 12 Mr Krige you highlighted a media statement issued by the 
10 
SABC saying they were not going to cover any protest action. 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Ja. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:  Can you talk to this, can you give us the 
foundational phases to you know why this began and you know how the 
editorial interference how was it implemented then? 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   The SABC released a press – sent out a 
press release on the 26 t h of May 2016 where they banned all coverage 
of violent protest action.  Now it was very strange to us and also to the 
media outside because that’s clearly a form of censorship, so on the 
30 t h of May we invited three guests to our show in the morning to 
20 
discuss this development, it was Tim du Plessis who was from Media 
24, Professor Frans Kruger who was from Wits University and Mr Thladi 
Motsoeneng who at first he declined, he did not arrive at the studio.  
So we had a discussion on this policy which was clearly not editorially 
sound, it was not Constitutionally sound, you cannot withhold the 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 151 of 173 
 
information from the people, if you look at the BCSA, if you look at 
ICASA’s regulations and also at our own editorial policy ,it is totally out 
of line. 
 
So we had a discussion and the next morning, the 31 s t of May, 
we conducted a studio interview with Mr Motsoeneng, who was 
accompanied by Mr Anton Heunis who was his sort of – I don’t know 
what he was, he was never introduced, but he sat in the studio maybe 
because he could understand Afrikaans, and afterwards there was a 
debate between me and Mr Motsoeneng and Mr Heunis regarding the 
content of the previous day’s interview and I told them we had a 
10 
problem as journalists to read about certain policy or issues in the 
media and no one within the SABC ever communicated the directive 
directly to us and then I was issued up to the 27 t h floor, where I was 
joined by Mr Heunis, the Acting Head of News, Mr Simon Thebele, Mr 
Matthews, Jimi Mathews, who was the Acting Chief Executive Officer at 
that stage, Ms Ditlhakanyane, and a colleague Ms Kravani Pillay who 
was the Executive Producer of SAFM at that stage, and what happened 
there was that each one of the people made turns to explain certain 
things.  I took notes of it which I typed afterwards, if the Chair wants I 
can just go through what happened there at that meeting. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Mr Motsoeneng started in saying we are 
cleaning up the organisation people are doing their own stuff.  There 
are many journalists outside that want to work for the SABC, the 
environment outside is bad.  And he continued saying no person is 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 152 of 173 
 
independent, the SABC is independent, this is a new SABC, you must 
adapt or find a job somewhere else. 
 
Then he said that Tim du Plessis was from a rival organisation, 
and we cannot allow people from outside to say anything negative 
about the SABC, and he also accused us that we asked Frans Kruger 
leading questions during the interview and then he switched over to 
something that my colleague, Kravani Pillay, will later explain when she 
testifies, about Editors Forum, which was one of the programmes that 
must go, and then Anton Heunis was the advisor, sort of advisor for Mr 
Motsoeneng, said I am an RSG listener, I know I am not a journalist but 
10 
you misunderstand editorial freedom and that we are asking leading 
questions. 
 
And then he asked me why ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  I’m sorry, I am sorry, what is RSG listener?  
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   RSG is the Afrikaans Public 
Broadcasting station on the SABC bouquet, have got a radio station for 
each and every language so RSG ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, it is a radio station? 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Ja, it’s a radio station, like SAFM is for 
t he English speaking people, RSG or Ekukwezi  ...(intervention)  
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  Nkozi FM and so  on. 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Ja, for the different radio stations, so 
RSG is the Afrikaans radio Station. 
CHAIRPERSON:  What is the full name? 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Radio Sonder Grense. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 153 of 173 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay, okay, thank you. 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   So then Anton Heunis asked me why 
didn’t we do an insert about that show that the presence of cameras on 
unrest scenes leads to violence, and ...(intervention)  
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:  Sorry Mr Krige, can you just identify who 
Foete is, because there are ...(intervention)  
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Foete, okay Foete was my nickname, 
that is not my real birth name. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   It comes from Maphuta when I was a 
10 
small boy sir. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, is it like Maphuta in isiZulu? 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Ja, that is correct Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  (laughing) well I can understand what it means but I 
think a lot of people do understand, yes thank you. 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   And then he asked us why didn’t we use 
research to show that the President (indistinct) duly to violence and 
then I asked him, but I said to him but if you liaise with your auditors 
before hand and if you told us that you were going to give this 
instruction then we would have used the research that you based your 
20 
instruction on and then Mr Motsoeneng said but I don’t believe in 
research.  He said you must defend the organisation, no journalist is 
independent, the CEO has a final responsibility for news, which was 
also strange to me because the CEO has got nothing to do with news.  
The COO as the Chief Operating Officer which deals with operations 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 154 of 173 
 
and the CEO is the editor in chief, it was only shortly after that that we 
realised that Mr Motsoeneng changed the editorial policy and it was 
signed off in February, three months earlier, which made him the de 
facto Head of News. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh. 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   But we didn’t know that, it was never 
communicated, it only came later. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Do you recall who would have signed that, would it 
have been himself, making himself head of, the person with final say on 
news or was it somebody else who ...(intervention)  
10 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   What happened there’s a process that 
we started in the end of 2014, at that stage the editorial policy in place 
was from 2004 and we had to renew it so we started with a process at 
the SABC to discuss the policy.  I was part of three of those 
discussions, and then the head of that group, the policy making group, 
said they are going to the – taking the policy to the public and 
afterwards they will come back to us and give feedback regarding the 
changes that would be accepted.  It never happened, it never happened 
and we only realised later that it was pushed through with no 
consultation, no feedback to the people of the SABC and between the 
20 
lines, it was a small paragraph, you could see that the COO was now in 
charge of news, who was Mr Motsoeneng. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   At that stage Motshlade turned to the 
Acting Head of News with Mr Simon Thebele and he said Simon if 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 155 of 173 
 
people do not adhere get rid of them, we cannot have people who 
question management, this is the last time we have a meeting of this 
kind, from now on you handle things on your level, and then Mr 
Matthews the only thing he said it is cold outside, if you don’t like it 
you can go, you have two choices, the door or the window.  And that 
was about it in that meeting. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:  Mr Krige can we jump onto paragraph 15 
where you highlight a pre-election workshop, can you just shortly just 
explain what is the purpose of a pre-election workshop, you know who 
attends a pre-election workshop and so forth? 
10 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   The pre-election workshop usually it is 
attended by all the original editors and the news editors from all the 
Provinces, it is usually we had a workshop like that every year to bring 
all the editors together at one place, but at that stage we – I don’t think 
we had one in a while but before that specific election in 2016 
everyone was flown in from all the provinces and we had an election 
workshop where we discussed the strategy and the planning.  It was a 
sort of a planning meeting for the coverage of the coming election. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:  Okay, and in this election you  highlight 
that Mr Motsoeneng had made certain statements which you had 
20 
recorded in notes. 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Ja. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:  In handwriting notes, in handwritten 
notes. 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Ja. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 156 of 173 
 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:  And those notes are – you have attached 
them as Annexures 03 and 04, Chair that would be on pages 78 – he 
has also highlighted them in the statement because it is difficult for one 
to read the handwritten notes. 
MR JAKOB DANIELS KRIGE:   Ja, it is quite difficult. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:  And the second set would be on page 79.  
Mr Krige ...(intervention)  
CHAIRPERSON:  Did you move away from 78 or are you still at 78? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:  No Chair I did not, these were just to 
indicate that these were actually the handwritten notes from that 
10 
meeting. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Oh, okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:  I am just going to head back into the 
paragraph because it will be quite difficult to look at those handwritten 
notes, but he has captured them in his main statement, in his main 
affidavit. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, okay.  So we go back to his statement? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:  His statement, and that would be 
paragraph 16 on page 6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  Was his statement at the beginning?  No, it is 
20 
not ...(intervention)  
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHEL:  It is not the beginning, it’s under folder 
12, page 6. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Folder 12.  Okay and what paragraph? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  16 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 157 of 173 
 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Paragraph 16. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Mr Krige am I correct in saying this is 
an extraction from what Mr Motsoeneng was saying? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  Ja. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And I have noted that you have put this 
complete paragraph in quotes.  Is this what - word for word as to what 
Mr Motsoeneng was saying or was it just - you know - were you 
paraphrasing?  Can you just explain? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  It - it was a bit of both.  What I did I 
10 
jotted down certain words that he was saying and then directly after 
that I - I typed it out as - as stated here in this affidavit. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Okay.  Can you just read out 16.1?  
What was … 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  Huh-uh. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Stated by Mr Motsoeneng? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  Mr Motsoeneng spoke to us in two 
different - at two different occasions.  The gist of it was that the 
SABC’s independent - no individual is independent.  He said: 
“There is an agenda for the corporation driven by 
20 
three Directors, the CEO, the COO and the CFO.” 
He said: 
“Do not focus on negative stories.  It is important 
that you balance stories.  Told human stories - is 
politicians not human beings?  Reporters at the 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 158 of 173 
 
SABC do not know the world.  When they report 
they mislead listeners.” 
He said: 
“Go to America.  There is poverty.  They do not 
show it.  They do not show when their soldiers die.  
I will take you to BRICS country and you can just go 
to a hotel.  You will see that South Africa is better.” 
Then he referred to the Editorial Policy.  He said: 
“Look - look at the Editorial Policy.  We have 
removed news and replaced it with content.  If you 
10 
as SABC mess up the organisation you mess up 
your life.  I am in charge.  News is now part of 
operations.  We change the world.  We must have 
news with content.  I am in charge.  You must 
adhere to any instruction.  President Zuma is the 
President of the country.  I do not regard him as 
ANC.  You cannot treat him the same.  We will give 
him more time and you can question everyone ...” 
And he mentioned Gwede Mantashe and other names. 
“…except your President. We need to respect him 
20 
especially you SABC.  I expect you to align you with 
my instruction.” 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And - Mr Krige and what was the 
response to these statements that Mr Motsoeneng were saying?  I mean 
you have a room full of editors and people in the profession who are 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 159 of 173 
 
very knowledgeable about editorial policies and how a broadcasting 
should 
work. 
 
What 
was 
the 
response 
to 
his 
statements 
- 
Mr Motsoeneng’s statements? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  I am not sure about what the other 
people’s reaction was.  We were so used to what we call (indistinct) 
speak at that stage that he was just - we thought he was just 
blabbering on.  At that stage what I did I messaged a - a colleague of 
mine back at Auckland Park asking to go through our internet which - 
where the Editorial Policy is displayed and to see which policy the SAB 
- the SABC is using and there was no - no sign of the 2016 or the new 
10 
Editorial Policy. 
It was still the old 2004 policy.  So I was puzzled.  The 
people did not show a lot of reaction.  There were no one questioning 
the fact that - that he said that but he also left directly after that - 
Mr Motsoeneng left and we - there was no time to discuss this - these 
instructions. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  So there was no pursuing what he had 
said at the time.  Just - everybody just left it in the air? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  Ja.  You know how workshops work.  You 
sit there and you listen and you make notes and afterwards everyone is 
20 
doing anyway their own things - you know- and as I said at that stage it 
was very confusing within the newsroom especially after 26 May 
statement.  We did not know what to do.  We did not know to react 
because you cannot cover a protest or broadcast protest. 
You still covering it but do not - do not - you do not broadcast 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 160 of 173 
 
it.  Do you send out a team of reporters to a scene but if there is 
violence then you - you take them back to the office.  So everything 
was very confusing at that stage and there was not a lot of guidance 
from - from someone like Mr Jimi Matthews who was at that stage the - 
well according to us the Editor in Chief. 
He just said he derives his oxygen from the newsroom and 
there is not a lot of oxygen at the 28 t h Floor where he - where his 
offices was and he said he was not going to give any editorial 
guidance.  So he left it to Mr Motsoeneng to give us editorial guidance. 
CHAIRPERSON:  I see that you put what Mr Motsoeneng said in 
10 
quotation marks.  Did you mechanically record what he was saying? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  Hm. 
CHAIRPERSON:  In paragraph 16.1 you just read that whole paragraph 
which is in quotation marks.  Did you mechanically record what he was 
saying? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  There - there was a recording made by 
people who were there but this comes from my notes and it also formed 
part of an affidavit that we - we sent into the Constitutional Court … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  In 2016. 
20 
CHAIRPERSON:  So you - you accurately just wrote down what he was 
saying? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  Ja. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay, thank you. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair.  Mr Krige there has 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 161 of 173 
 
been evidence of potential purging that had happened at the SABC and 
you highlight in paragraph 17 that you - you yourself became a victim of 
this purging at the SABC.  Can you just elaborate on how that came to 
be about - how that came along? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  Ja.  What happened after the - the 
statement to ban violent protest on 26 May?  There was an outcry from 
all over the country from the media and especially the NGOs and there 
was a protest march planned to three of the SABC’s offices and on the 
morning on 20 June we - I participated in a line talk - daily line talk 
where the Acting Head of News Mr Simon Tebele gave instructions to 
10 
remove three of the stories from our top story list. 
To explain we have a diary every day and there is a list of top 
stories and then there is a diary of each and every region. So as an 
editor seated in Johannesburg I can have a look at the top - top stories 
and then look at all the regions and see all the promised stories that 
should arrive before the end of the day or for the next morning’s shown. 
So it gives you an indication of what to expect and the top 
stories are the most important stories and we try every program and 
news bulletin - bulletin to try to focus on those stories.  So that 
morning Mr Simon Tebele removed three of the stories.  It was Y2K.  
20 
The right to know campaign that organised marches to the SABC to 
complain against the - the policy of not showing violence - violent 
protest ja and at that stage the Economics Editor Ms Thandeka Gqubule 
questioned Mr Tebele’s decision and then he explained to her that it - it 
must be removed because it is - it is about us - the SABC and I 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 162 of 173 
 
understand it that that meeting on the 27 t h Floor where they said we 
cannot we criticise the SABC. 
We cannot allow people to criticise the SABC and I made that 
connection at that stage.  So they removed those stories because it 
was negative or it was about the SABC and that whole meeting was 
recorded by my colleague Suna Venter which we later transcribed and it 
is or what you see here is - is part of that transcription where Mr Tebele 
said those stories are out as discussed earlier. 
Then Thandeka explained that we - she - she does not want 
to be part of a decision like that and she said and if this whole issue 
10 
ends up in court and she and I quote there: 
“And when we fall foul of the law - God forbid - we 
better just have recall it even the dissenting voices.  
Please record my voice as dissenting.” 
Then I said: 
“I totally agree with you.  The initial decision or 
initially they said we cannot give other newspapers 
a platform to criticise the SABC.  That I totally 
understand.  They are in the media but this is not a 
media issue.  It is not other newspapers or 
20 
opposition or whatever.  This is NGO.  It is out 
there and if we ignore them we are busy censoring 
our own news and that is totally unacceptable.” 
At that stage Suna Venter who was my colleague at RSG 
said: 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 163 of 173 
 
“And as junior as I am please record my voice as 
dissenting against this.” 
On which I replied: 
“We cannot allow people/individuals in this company 
making decisions on behalf of journalists.  If we are 
going to carry on with that we are going to lose all 
integrity.  The little integrity that we have at the 
moment.” 
And then it carried on.  Mr Tebele acknowledged the fact that 
we - we opposed the decision to remove the stories from the diary and 
10 
then three days later on 23 June Ms Gqubule and Ms - Ms Venter and 
myself were called in separately and notified of our suspension. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Mr Krige let us just go back.  The 
removal of these three stories were against the Editorial Policy.  Is that 
correct? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  Ja.  At the SABC we always have the - the 
problem as part of one of the SOEs and also as part of the media.  It is 
- it was always difficult to - to report on yourself or what happened in 
your own - in your own company.  So I can understand from certain 
people’s point of view that you do not - there is a lot of companies that 
20 
forbid people to talk about their own company but in our - in our 
situation we were also part of the media and according to me we had - 
if there is anything negative about the SABC we have to put it on - out 
there. 
Get people to react.  Give the - the SABC the right to respond 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 164 of 173 
 
and report it as - as our Editorial Policy expects from us.  We cannot - 
we are not in a position - as soon as - there is 22 million people in the 
country that there only source of news is the SABC.  They cannot afford 
newspapers.  They cannot afford DSTV.  So it is very important for the 
SABC to fulfil that role of - of giving news to each and everyone in this 
country and we cannot ignore something like that. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And did Mr Tebele give any justifiable 
reasons that are in line with the Editorial Policy as to why these three 
stories should not be aired? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  No.  His only reason was - was it is - it is 
10 
about us.  That was his only reason and then we continued with the - 
the line talk.  There was no further discussion allowed. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And subsequent to that encounter about 
the removal of these three stories was that when you were dismissed? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  Ja.  What happened then we went to the 
Labour Court on 18 July.  There was a - a disciplinary hearing.  I think 
Ms Krivani Pillay will - will explain that what happened there.  There 
was a - they tried to - to conduct a disciplinary - disciplinary hearing 
but it was never concluded and then we were waiting for a next date to 
appear and before we appeared we were all dismissed.  I was 
20 
dismissed with - along with seven other colleagues. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  So from the time from the disciplinary 
hearing to your dismissal - if - if I am correct that is less than 24 
hours? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  What happened was the initial disciplinary 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 165 of 173 
 
hearing there - there was a planned meeting to go to the Constitutional 
Court on the Friday.  We called it Black Friday and we were supposed - 
me, Thandeka and Suna - were supposed to lead the - the march to the 
- to the Constitutional Court and 23 hours earlier before that we - I 
received a phone call from - from the Disciplinary Committee and telling 
me that I must be at the disciplinary hearing the same morning as the - 
as the march to the - to the Constitutional Court which was a breach of 
their own Disciplinary Code because you need to give someone at least 
24 hours’ notice. 
You must remember at that stage we were locked out of the 
10 
SABC and we had not access to our computers, to any files, to anything 
that you could use in a disciplinary - during a disciplinary hearing to 
defend yourself. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And the Labour Court found your 
dismissals were … 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  In valid. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Not lawful - in valid … 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  Ja. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And you were reinstated thereafter? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  Ja.  As if we were never dismissed, ja. 
20 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair Mr Matthews responded to the 
3.3 Notice that was issued on behalf of Mr Krige.  That would be CC25.  
The small presentation file.  Mr Krige there is a small presentation file 
just next to you on top - CC25.  I am just going to highlight the relevant 
paragraphs.  His response is from page 18. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 166 of 173 
 
CHAIRPERSON:  That is his response to Mr Krige’s statement? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Indeed so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay and you will put his response to Mr Krige 
for Mr Krige to comment on - on what Mr Matthews has to say? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Mr Krige are you there on page 18? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  I am on page 18, yes. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Paragraph 13 he states that: 
“In the Rule 3.3 Notice dated 13 August 2019 it is 
10 
suggested 
that 
I 
have 
been 
implicated 
in 
paragraphs nine, 10, 11, 14 and 14.6 of Mr Krige’s 
affidavit.  I accordingly respond thereto as follows.” 
Paragraph nine of the affidavit: 
“As I have indicated earlier in his affidavit the 
Editor in Chief at the SABC was CEO Motsoeneng.  
He made all decisions in relation to editorial and 
newsworthy matters and in that vein he made 
decisions about what could or could not be 
reported.  It is in that context that I have repeatedly 
20 
indicated that the environment at the SABC at the 
time was toxic or corrosive and that everybody was 
expected to conform to his instructions failing which 
the prospect of termination loomed large.” 
Next paragraph: 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 167 of 173 
 
“On that day Sebonelo Dithlakanyane informed 
Krige …” 
CHAIRPERSON:  Well maybe do you want to let him comment if he has 
any comment on paragraph 30.1? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Indeed so Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is there anything you want to say about what 
Mr Matthews says in paragraph 30.1 that has been read to you? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  He is only half right.  My paragraph nine 
refers to something that happened in 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
10 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  When Mr … 
CHAIRPERSON:  He was no longer there? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  When - when Mr Motsoeneng was - no.  
He was CEO but according to the Editorial Policy at that stage the 
Editor 
in 
Chief 
was 
- 
was 
the 
CEO 
and 
I 
think 
it 
was 
Ms Lulama Mokhobo … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  Who testified earlier at that stage. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  So it is wrong of him to say that Mr - 
20 
Mr Motsoeneng was in fact the de facto news boss in 2014. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes. 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  Maybe he knew something that I - that I 
did not know at that stage but  
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 168 of 173 
 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  According to our Editorial Policy it was 
still the CEO. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Yes, okay. 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  However the - the later part of that is 
correct.  That in 2016 by - at that stage Mr Motsoeneng was already the 
Editor in Chief. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Huh-uh. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  The next paragraph: 
“On that day Sebonelo Dithlakanyane informed 
Krige who was her direct report about Motsoeneng’s 
10 
instructions 
regarding 
the 
EFF. 
 
In light 
of 
Mr Krige’s response to her she approached me for 
advice about him not only in relation to this incident 
but in relation to his generally confrontational 
approach towards her in the past.  It is was general 
- it was in that general context of his historical 
conduct towards her which in my view often 
bordered on racist and sexist conduct that I thought 
it would be appropriate to intervene and inform him 
that his attitude towards Dithlakanyane was not 
20 
appropriate nor acceptable.” 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  Ja.  That is an easy way out.  It is one of 
the - the most common excuses if - if a man differs with a woman.  It is 
either sexist and if she is Black then - then it is racist. He is playing 
the - the man and not the ball.  The issue here was an instruction from 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 169 of 173 
 
my superior - my line manager that we cannot report on any EFF 
activities.  That is the issue. 
Not - not the fact that I am sometimes confrontational.  Of 
course in a - in a newsroom it is a robust environment and sometimes 
we are confrontational and it does not matter if it is a man or a woman 
or Black or - or Coloured.  It is not the issue.  That is not the issue.  
The issue is was the instruction that Sebonelo gave me lawful or not 
but he tries to avoid it by using - you know - sexist or a racist 
implication. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Okay.  Responding to your paragraphs 
10 
10 and 11 of your affidavit.  It reads: 
“In 
paragraph 
10 
Mr Krige 
avers 
that 
on 
1 December 2014 I was appointed in the position of 
Group Executive News. In paragraph 11 Mr Krige 
makes a broad assertion that I have been fingered 
in other words implicated in the report.  His 
assertion is general and non-specific and I have in 
any event dealt with the relevant portions of the 
report above.” 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  Well I read Mr Joe Thloloe’s report and it 
20 
was definite that him - he, Sebonelo and Simon Tebele was giving 
instructions via certain people to the newsroom.  So if that is not 
fingered.  I am not sure what - what he means.  Maybe I made the 
wrong deduction.  We can look - look at it when we discuss the 
Joe Thloloe report and the implications of that. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 170 of 173 
 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  In response to paragraphs 14 and 14.6 
of Mr Krige’s affidavit.  Mr Matthews replies: 
“In these paragraph Mr Krige suggests that I have 
either - I was involved in or sought enforcement of 
Motsoeneng’s decisions to ban any coverage of 
violent protest.  I have indicated earlier in this 
affidavit Motsoeneng made all critical decisions as 
they relate to SABC and politics.  It was him that 
reported and it was his instructions that I ultimately 
carried out and the report confirms Motsoeneng 
10 
firmly established that he as the COO has the final 
responsibility for news.  I accordingly repeat the 
contents of paragraphs 15 and 16 above for 
Mr Krige’s contents.  I also confirm that I tendered 
my resignation before the decision to dismiss the 
SABC eight was taken or implemented.” 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  Ja, this is very sad that the newsroom 
was not protected at that stage.  If - if Mr Jimi Matthews said that - that 
Mr Hlaudi Motsoeneng had the final say about news and it is maybe just 
an indication of what - what was going on in the newsroom?  You must 
20 
remember at that stage we were not informed that the CEO is not the 
de facto head of - of news or the Editor in Chief. 
At that stage the SABC had not told anyone as far as I know 
that - that there was a change in the Editorial Policy but ja.  He 
resigned.  That I agree with before the decision to dismiss but there 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 171 of 173 
 
was no one not one line manager not one person in the SABC that 
stood up and defended any - any of the dismissals or any - any of the 
suspensions.  Not one and he was part of that. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Mr Krige.  Chair just to go to 
the information about the transcripts.  We do have a recording of the 
meeting that Mr Krige did highlight but however that recording from 
what I have been informed is not clear enough.  However if the Chair 
wants to have a listen to it we can provide the Chair with that 
recording.  However you know I have been told by the tech - by … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it anything for which there is a transcript already 
10 
here? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  No the - it has not - there has not - it is 
for - it is for what is said in Mr Krige’s statement.  There has not been 
any dispute of the authenticity or … 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja.  No, no I am talking about the recording that you 
are talking about. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Is it a recording in respect of which we already have 
a transcript here? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  Ja. 
20 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Now if - if there is a transcript it is - it is okay. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Ja. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And in - well paragraphs 24 to 25 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 172 of 173 
 
speaks about the transcriber - how - how these were transcribed in your 
affidavit and so forth and you did hand in a recording to the 
investigators.  However as we relayed it was not clear enough for us to 
play but it is a true reflection of what is stated in your affidavit? 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  It is Chair, ja. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And that would conclude the end of 
Mr Krige’s affidavit as well.  Mr Krige if there is anything that you would 
like to add on top of - if there is anything that you feel that we have not 
relayed but we have come to the end of your - of your affidavit. 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  Maybe just one thing and referring back to 
10 
Mr Matthews’ argument or affidavit is that - that people must 
understand that the newsroom at that stage there was a toxic fear.  
There was uncertainty.  We - there was no protection from anyone.  Not 
Mr Matthews.  Not Mr Tebele. 
Not Mr Motsoeneng and it was a very, very difficult situation 
to work - work in and I think if I can just mention what happened 
yesterday with Ms Phathiswa Magopeni the new Head of News.  That is 
- that is the sort of leadership that we need in a newsroom and you 
need a newsroom that is bulletproof.  That is free from interference 
where you can do your job as any other journalist should do and that 
20 
did not happen during 2016.  That is all I want to say. 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Chair just to bring the Chair’s attention 
to - we do have a transcribed - a transcription of that recording.  It is 
on page 121 of CC12. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  That is fine.  That is fine. 
04 SEPTEMBER 2019 – DAY 156 
 
Page 173 of 173 
 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  And that would conclude the evidence 
of Mr Krige. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you very much Mr Krige for - for coming and 
for sharing with the Commission your experiences.  Thank you very 
much. 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  Thank you Chair. 
CHAIRPERSON:  You are excused. 
MR JAKOB DANIEL KRIGE:  Thank you. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Thank you.  Tomorrow how many witnesses have we 
got? 
10 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  We have got - as far as I know we have 
two witnesses. 
CHAIRPERSON:  So we could start at 10? 
ADV MPHO RASIVHETSHELE:  Yes Chair.  10 o’clock. 
CHAIRPERSON:  Okay.  We will adjourn the proceedings for the day 
and we will start at 10 o’ clock tomorrow.  We adjourn. 
REGISTRAR:  All rise. 
INQUIRY ADJOURNS TO 5 SEPTEMBER 2019
